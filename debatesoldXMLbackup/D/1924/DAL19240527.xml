      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

      <P>In section 3 (2), immediately after the word &ldquo;week&rdquo; in line 46, the following words inserted: &ldquo;to a person who, on the first appointed day, shall not have attained the age of 80 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is put in for completing the purposes of an amendment of Deputy Daly's, which was accepted in the Dáil.  This would exclude from the cut old age pensioners over 80 who happen to have a pension of only 1s. a week; otherwise they would have lost that shilling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in this amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of section 3 two new sub-sections inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) If any person whose pension is reduced or terminated in pursuance of a ruling by the pension officer under this section claims that by reason of his age his pension should not have been liable to be so reduced or terminated, such person <Col N="1313" /> may appeal against such reduction or termination, as the case may be, to the local pension committee, who shall consider the matter and give their decision thereon in the same manner and subject to the like appeal to the central pension authority as if the ruling of the pension officer under this section was the report of a pension officer on a claim referred to him for report and inquiry under Section 7 of the Act of 1908.</P>
    <P>(4) An appeal against the ruling of a pension officer reducing or terminating a pension under this section shall not suspend the operation of such ruling, but if the appeal is finally determined in favour of the pensioner, he shall be entitled to receive all sums which would have been payable to him if the ruling of the pension officer had been in accordance with such final determination.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide an appeal in case any person claims to have been over age and has suffered a reduction, so that the matter may be determined in the usual way. In the next section of the Bill, which deals with the revision of pensions, a provision such as this was inserted, but by an oversight it was not inserted in Section 3.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Of course reference can be made to the railway tribunal by any person interested, and it may order that a reduction shall be made accordingly, after a full inquiry into the matter.  But this amendment provides&mdash;and I think it is very necessary&mdash;that <Col N="1316" /> the company should have the power to reduce the rates from time to time without any reference to the tribunal.  That is the object of this amendment, and it is a very essential amendment.</P>

      <P>It is quite distinct from 25.  Section 25 deals only with the amalgamated company, and this deals with such portions of lines, partly in the Saorstát and partly outside, as may be attended to by our legislation.  I resist the amendment because Section 30, as drafted, is the natural balance to Section 29.  Section 29 prevents undue preference being given to any one port over another by reduced rates, rebates, etc.  If this amendment were passed Section 30 would give these companies which are not entirely in the Saorstát power to defeat what we intend to bring about by Section 29; it would give the non-amalgamated companies power which we have refused to the amalgamated undertaking.</P>

      <P>No, I do not, but this amendment takes away the application to the railway tribunal. It was our desire that an application should be made to the railway tribunal before reductions in rates are made.  If this were passed it would give the partly in and partly out lines power, by the provision of unduly cheap rates, to divert traffic to northern ports.  We do not intend to do away with the provision to traders of low rates; all that we do want is that the tribunal should have a say in the matter, and should be in a position to prevent preferential rates purely for the diversion of traffic.</P>

      <P>With all respect, I think the Minister does not understand this amendment.  It does not deal with either special rates or through rates; it deals generally, I think, with what has been done by more than one company already, a general flat reduction in rates.  Does the Minister mean to imply that under this Bill it is intended to prevent any company from making a <Col N="1317" /> general reduction in its rates in order to help the commercial community, because that is how I understand it?  If he had qualified his objection and said that of course if it applied to special rates or through rates the matter should be considered because the question of preference in favour of certain ports might then arise, but if it is a general reduction such as has already taken place surely there can be no objection, if it does not give any special preference to any particular port at all.</P>

The object of the amendment, as I read it, was to do away with application to the railway tribunal.  It is intended to have application to the railway tribunal an essential feature of the Bill, before any reduction in rates of the amalgamated undertaking, or of any of the undertakings in competition with it, in so far as we can control these undertakings, takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the principle that the Minister embodies in his objection to this proposal.  If a non-amalgamated company is not free to make a general reduction in its rates in favour of the commercial community, should in its opinion the circumstances justify that reduction, I think be would want to put a stronger case than the case he has made.  To my mind, it is quite possible to put another interpretation altogether on the objection of the Minister.  Supposing the non-amalgamated companies, for instance, desire to reduce their rates, and we know that they have been considerably <Col N="1318" /> reduced&mdash;they stand at 75 per cent. at the moment over pre-war level as against 120 per cent. in amalgamated companies&mdash;this Bill debars them, except the matter is approved, from making a further reduction should circumstances justify it.  This is one of the most serious objections.  I never thought that the Minister, and those associated with him, would offer the least objection to this amendment, to take away from the non-amalgamated companies the right of reducing rates generally.  I quite admit that in special cases, in the case of through rates or special rates, there might be some justification for the opposition, but I can see none for a general reduction. The interpretation that may be put on the opposition to this amendment outside the Dáil may be of quite a different character, and that is, that it is in order to keep up the rates of the amalgamated company, and that other companies who are not in the amalgamation are to have the power withdrawn from them whereby they might reduce rates, because that reduction might possibly call in question certain rates that are made by the amalgamated company.  That is a line of argument I do not want to stress, but if the Minister perseveres in his opposition to the amendment I am sure it is a form of argument we will hear a good deal more about, because no real objection can be lodged to this clause when we exclude the special rates and the through rates.  I hope the Minister will review the matter and re-consider his decision.</P>

      <P>So as to read &ldquo;modify&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;increase.&rdquo; The section further provides that on application to the railway tribunal a modification which includes a reduction in charges may be made&mdash;that is to say, if the railway tribunal consents. It is vital for this Bill that the tribunal shall be a decider in regard to any application for the reduction of rates. Arguments that have been used in the Dáil, so far, have been the opposite to <Col N="1319" /> those put forward by Deputy Good. There has been a suspicion that sufficient control was not taken over those undertakings, partly in and partly outside the Saorstát, and that they would be able to reduce rates for competitive purposes, not of the ordinary type, and by so doing traffic might be diverted unduly to northern ports, and consequently the safeguard intended to be kept here is that there should be always an application to the tribunal before any question of a reduction is considered.  The tribunal is absolutely essential to this section, and it is the natural corollary to Section 29.  This is the natural balance to Section 29, and must be preserved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>But I object to the necessity for a reference to the railway tribunal.  I pointed out before that the railway tribunal is not a free agent in this matter of rates.  The obligation is placed on the railway tribunal of maintaining the standard income, and in any re-consideration of rates it must always have regard to the obligation of the standard income.  When you come to the question of non-amalgamated companies, that does not arise at all and they ought to be free to make a general reduction.  I am quite willing to limit the power of general reduction, but to say that they cannot make a general reduction in rates without reference to the tribunal is, in my opinion, unreasonable, because when you come to look at the point the tribunal may say: &ldquo;We cannot drop below a certain level in our areas. These people want to drop below that level, and we will not allow them.&rdquo; That is an unfair and unwise attitude, and I do not consider that it ought to be supported by the Dáil, and I hope the Minister will reconsider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would Deputy Good bring his mind to bear on the practical application of his argument, and see what companies could be affected in the way he speaks of.  The Great Northern, presumably, if the Bill passes as it stands, will be outside this amalgamation, and some other companies.  I am not quite able at the moment to think of any kind of competition such as that which Deputy <Col N="1320" /> Good speaks of, because every company, if it seeks to get an outlet in northern ports, even as far north as Dundalk, will have to go through the Great Northern system.  Perhaps Deputy Good has something else in his mind of a definite concrete kind, and I think it would be well if we were informed as to what is in his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>In the specialised case that Deputy Johnson referred to the Great Northern comes into competition with the Midland, one of the amalgamated companies, at a considerable number of points.  It comes very largely into competition in the West. If the Great Northern is precluded, as it will be under this section, from reducing its freights generally, except through the tribunal, then commerce will not be in a position to get the advantage that it is entitled to, because the railway tribunal will say: &ldquo;If we allow the Great Northern Railway Company to reduce its rates the traffic will go over its lines instead of going over the amalgamated lines.&rdquo;  Consequently it is in the interest of the tribunal to refuse such a reduction in order to maintain the traffic over the lines of the amalgamated company. They are not an impartial authority when they come to deal with the amalgamated lines.  To say that they are to be prohibited under the Bill from reducing the rates is a thing that will be very widely criticised by the commercial community.</P>

      <P>I beg to support Deputy Good in the statement he has made.  The Great Northern Railway recently reduced their rates, and naturally that has brought a good deal of traffic via northern ports.  Were it not for the fact that this unification scheme was in contemplation the next thing we expected, naturally, was that the Midland would have to reduce the rates on account of the competition with the Great Northern.  I think it is unfair on the part of the Government if they refuse to allow this competition to exist in future.  I do not see why the hands of the Great Northern should be tied if they wish to compete for traffic via northern ports.  The excessive rates at present are very detrimental to the live stock trade, and the more competition we can bring about the better.</P>

      <P>I would like to have it pointed out in what respect this Bill proposes to refuse competition by asking that any question of reduction of rates on lines not included in the amalgamated undertaking, and which are partly in the Saorstát, should be brought before the tribunal.  If we stated that no such reductions could take place, that is a definite proviso against competition.  It is stated that the company may apply to the tribunal to modify the charges in existence at the date of the passing of the Act.  In his argument Deputy Good advances from that to saying, that the tribunal is to be an interested party.  The tribunal is not intended to be an interested party, and in so far as any provisos could be made with regard to it it is put definitely on a strict judicial basis.  There is no intention whatsoever to prevent ordinary cutting of rates on the part of, say, the Great Northern Railway.  The only thing stated in the section is, that any proposed reductions are to be brought before the tribunal so that the tribunal can consider all the circumstances. There is no intention whatsoever of depriving traders of low rates where those low rates are not specially cut for the purpose of injuring the amalgamated undertaking.  It is quite a reasonable precaution.</P>

The tribunal will decide whether that proposed reduction of 20 per cent. is such as comes under Section 29, whether it is undue disadvantage.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point that Deputy Good made is valid, in so far as the tribunal is more or less bound to justify its previous action.  The tribunal is going to decide upon the terms of amalgamation, and classification and re-organisation of capital and will, as I have already suggested, feel itself, sub-consciously perhaps, bound to justify its previous activities.  When, for instance, a request is made by the Great Northern Railway to the tribunal to allow a reduction, let us say, on cattle from Navan to Dundalk, the amalgamated company may come along and say it is unfair competition and endeavour to persuade the tribunal that if they allow the reduction they are diverting traffic that would come from Navan to Dublin and thereby prejudicing the amalgamated company in paying the dividend fixed and guaranteed by the Bill.  In that sense I can say that there is a point in Deputy Good's argument.  Quite apart from any northern ports, you are going to prejudice Dundalk or Drogheda, because the non-amalgamated company covers that area, while the amalgamated company runs from Navan to Dublin.  I can see the possibility that the tribunal will say: &ldquo;No, this is unfair competition; we cannot allow you to deprive the new amalgamated company of its opportunity to pay the reasonable dividend that we think it is entitled to and which is guaranteed by the Bill.&rdquo;  In that sense the cattle trade particularly might be detrimentally affected if the companies were not free to make reductions on that part of the line which is within the Saorstát. This section only deals with those portions of the undertaking situated in the Saorstát.  It might be different if this was a tribunal clearly established to safeguard the interests of the community. We have been told so often that it is not pretending to be that, but is a judicial tribunal holding the balance as between the companies and the public, that we have always to bear in mind the possibility that the tribunal will come down in favour of the company and not in favour of the public.</P>

      <P>I think probably too much is being made out of the northern ports in reference to this question.  We should apply it more to the districts where the railways meet and where, as Deputy McKenna said, there is competition between the Midland and the Great Northern, such as the town of Cavan, where I come from.  Does the Minister mean that the Great Northern cannot lower their rates below those of the Midland, except with the permission of the tribunal?  If that is so, it would be very unreasonable, especially in regard to the town of Cavan, because in pre-war days the competition there was considerable.  I remember when we used to have general holidays there was considerable competition between the two railways.  If they have to apply to the tribunal now it will mean that competition will be cut out altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very sorry that Deputy Davin is not in his place to-day.  He was very much afraid in an earlier stage of this Bill, that we had not such control over undertakings, partly in and partly outside the Saorstát, as to prevent what this seeks to prevent.  If Deputy Good's suspicions are well founded, that the railway tribunal is going to simply look to the interests of the amalgamated undertaking and to secure their guaranteed dividends to stockholders, or even if we take Deputy Johnson's point of view, that there is just a possibility of the railway tribunal in a particular case coming down in favour of the company as against the railway user, then, of course, this provision is unsound. Indeed the whole tribunal is unsound if you leave out of consideration all the matters in and around the setting up of the tribunal, the terms of reference and the whole principle of the Bill.  Deputy Cole asks is it suggested that certain rates shall not be reduced before application is made to the railway tribunal?  It is so intended.  If <Col N="1324" /> that is not reasonable I cannot see where the great unreasonableness is, that application be made to the railway tribunal before rates are reduced. It is reasonable if you look on the railway tribunal as definitely going to crush competition or, as Deputy Good thinks, prevent competition.  On that basis this amendment is perfectly sound and the section is perfectly unsound.  But that is not likely to be the case.  The tribunal is not bound up merely with the amalgamated undertaking. Section 30 gives jurisdiction over railways not definitely in the amalgamated undertaking, and there is a right for people interested, and desirous of being heard, to appear before the tribunal.  The case has to be made in public and if the tribunal is going to stop legitimate rate reduction brought about by ordinary, competition then it has to face public odium for that.  There is always that safeguard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not dealt with the fare question, whether this provision must apply in all cases apart from the general question of special traffic at special points. The Minister's expectation was that after five years the tribunal would have very little to do and that perhaps only one person would be required.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>And such application shall be published in such manner as the railway tribunal prescribe and the tribunal after hearing all parties whom they consider entitled to be heard may make such modifications in the said charges or any of them as to the tribunal may seem just, and shall fix a day upon which the modifications are to come into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an application to reduce fares for an excursion party or to make special terms or arrangements that shall be published, etc.  That, of course, brings it into ridicule, unless you expect the tribunal to be appealed to immediately so that the company can say, &ldquo;We want to run excursions for a penny per mile for any distance,&rdquo; and that out of that they may make special charges.  Otherwise you are placing the company in a position that they cannot make any special reduction without application to the tribunal. <Col N="1325" /> At the moment I am dealing with this matter from the point of view of passenger traffic.  I think it is unreasonable to expect that the company will have to go through all this form of application, advertisements, hearing witnesses, etc., to find out if they should be allowed to run an excursion from Navan to Drogheda lower than the usual charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Minister rejects the amendment he will disappoint the people in the West of Ireland. The natural tendency already in that area, owing to the reduction in fares, is to shift traffic by the cheapest route.  What is the Minister's proposition? He proposes in future that before the Great Northern Railway Company can reduce rates, they will have to go before the railway tribunal for permission to do so.  It took nearly 12 months in England before the decisions of the railway tribunals in some cases were made known.  If the Great Northern Company wishes to reduce rates further I do not see why they should not be allowed to do so.  It will hit farmers of all classes in the west unless there is some reduction of rates. One of the reasons that the Party that I belong to supported the Bill was that we were looking forward with some hope to a reduction of rates by this unification scheme.  Now, as things go, I see that the railway companies are fettered and their hands tied by the railway tribunal who will be masters of the whole situation.  I would ask the Minister not to oppose the amendment.</P>

The more light that is thrown upon this Bill the better.  Deputy McKenna is concerned, now that the Minister would not allow the non-amalgamated company to reduce rates.  Obviously a reduction in rates would be beneficial. All this clearly shows the ramifications of this Bill.  I think the Minister would want to give very good reasons why he is going to reject the amendment. In connection with the amalgamation of railways we did better under competition, and by dealing with our <Col N="1326" /> business in our own way than the Government are going to do under the Bill.

      <P>The rates shall remain in force so far as the amalgamated undertaking is concerned as maximum charges.  There is to be a preliminary revision by the tribunal, and it is confidently expected that it is going to produce a good percentage in reduction.  There is no phrase which reveals an intention to prevent any railway company from reducing its rates.  It is provided that no such reduction shall take place without reference to the tribunal.  Deputy Johnson says that all sorts of small excursion rates will have to be referred to the tribunal before they can come into operation.  That is not the case.  There is a scale in operation which will be taken over.  There are scales for instance on the Great Northern system which will remain in operation. Any further reduction or extension of excursion or passenger fares will be a matter to bring before the tribunal.  The present scale will be taken over.  It is not a case that you start off with no excursion rates and that every minor change of a fare will have to be brought before the tribunal These things are done in general.  There is neither an intention to prevent the reduction in rates nor an intention to impede the railway companies outside the amalgamated undertaking from bringing in passenger and excursion fares.  The only thing is that for the <Col N="1327" /> future, apart from those scales in operation, application should be made to the tribunal, and the tribunal is not <Col N="1328" /> going to be put in a position that it will have to refuse these.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 32:&mdash;To delete in line 29 the words &ldquo;whom they considered entitled to be&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;interested and who are desirous of being.&rdquo;  The object of this is to give anybody who has any grievance and who desires to go before the railway tribunal an opportunity of doing so.  You will see that under the Bill, as drafted, the tribunal regulates the persons who have a right to go before it.  The words are: &ldquo;Whom they consider entitled to be heard.&rdquo; Seeing that we are dealing at the moment with non-amalgamated companies, I think we ought to extend every privilege to them, so that nothing might be said against the tribunal that it did not hear all the evidence that was entitled to go before it, <Col N="1330" /> before it gave a decision.  This amendment meets that point by substituting, as I said, the words &ldquo;interested and who are desirous of being&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;whom they consider entitled to be.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Of course that is a matter of justice. I think we must recognise that this clause deals with the non-amalgamated companies.  If the tribunal were to fix a lower charge for the non-amalgamated companies than the standard charge, it would be an obvious injustice to the non-amalgamated companies.</P>

      <P>There is one objection to the amendment.  It would prevent any application for reductions on these lines, partly in and partly outside the Saorstát until the standard charges had been established, that is to say, until sometime after the 31st December, 1925.  It would postpone actual reductions until that date.  The introduction of the words &ldquo;standard charges &ldquo;would limit decrease in rates or fares on these lines until after the standard charges became operative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before passing from this, I am a little doubtful about the phraseology of the first paragraph: &ldquo;in so far as they relate to those portions of their undertakings situate in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  We have a definition <Col N="1331" /> of Saorstát Eireann in the Interpretation Act:&mdash;... &ldquo;the area for the time being within the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In respect of railways, what is the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government of Saorstát Eireann?  We have, at least, partial authority over railways in Ireland as a whole.  At least, no other authority has any more control in regard to new railways in any part of Ireland than the Government of the Saorstát.  I am not quite sure whether the phraseology in this section does not forget that fact.  When we speak of &ldquo;situate in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; and then refer to the Interpretation Act as to what is meant by the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; we find they mean &ldquo;the area for the time being within the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  If we read that as having reference to railways then the Parliament and Government of Saorstát Eireann have certain not very clear, not very well defined, authority over railways outside the present area of the jurisdiction.  I do not want to go into the matter just at the moment because it will come up at a later stage, but I would ask the Minister to think over it, and consult with the Attorney-General as to whether the phraseology in the Bill would require any amendment, having regard to all the circumstances in connection with the powers of the Saorstát Government, in relation to railways in the northern counties.</P>

    <P>(1)  On and from the appointed day all exceptional rates in operation immediately before the appointed day on the railway of the amalgamated company shall cease to operate, with the exception of such exceptional rates as&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)are not less than five per cent. below the standard rates which would otherwise on and from the appointed day become chargeable; and</P>
    <P>(b)have been continued by agreement in writing between the railway company and the trader concerned, or, failing agreement, have been notified in writing to the secretary of the railway company by the trader with a request that they should be referred to the railway tribunal for determination by them, in which case the rates shall continue until determined by the railway tribunal, and the onus of proving that any such rates should be altered or discontinued shall be upon the railway company;</P>
    <P>so nevertheless that no rate which has not been applied to the charging of merchandise actually forwarded within the two years preceding the 1st day of January, 1926, shall be continued unless the trader can prove to the satisfaction of the railway company, or, failing agreement with the railway company, to the satisfaction of the railway tribunal&mdash;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(i)that its non-application is solely due to abnormal conditions of trade; or</P>
    <P>(ii)that a rate of equal amount to the same destination remains in operation at other stations or sidings in the same group or area:</P>
    <P>Provided that, if the trader and the railway company agree to continue any rate which will be more than forty per cent. below the standard rate chargeable as aforesaid, the rate shall, before the appointed day, be referred to the railway tribunal, and. if so referred, shall continue until the tribunal have determined the matter.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any such agreement or determination may provide for the continuance <Col N="1333" /> of any exceptional rate for a specified period of time and at the same or any higher figure or charge, not being, in the case of an agreement between the amalgamated company and a trader, less than five per cent. nor more than forty per cent. below the standard rate chargeable.</P>

There are simply two or three matters that have to be brought into consideration. I am not at all disposed to stand <Col N="1334" /> by 40 per cent. 40 per cent. was arrived at in a certain way.

      <P>(2)  If the Minister is of opinion that the amalgamated company is granting new exceptional rates in such manner as prejudicially to affect any class of users of the railway not benefited by such rates, or so as to jeopardise the realisation of the standard revenue of the company, he may refer the matter to the railway tribunal, who may, after giving all parties interested an opportunity of being heard, take either or both of the following courses:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment 37:&mdash;&ldquo;In sub-section (1), to insert in line 8, after the word &lsquo;shall,&rsquo; the words &lsquo;subject to the provisions of section 29 of this Act.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When this amendment was drawn up we were hopeful that we would get a more sympathetic hearing from the Minister as regards the provisions of section 29.  But as the matter stands I do not think the addition is of as much value as if Section 29 had been moulded more in accordance with our ideas as to what it should be.  At the same time it is useful although it is not as useful as it might have been otherwise.  The section with the amendment would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On and after the appointed day the amalgamated company shall, subject to the provisions of section 29 of this Act, be at liberty to grant new exceptional rates.....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the Committee will recognise and remember, section 29 is the section which deals with the protection of the ports.  I do not think I will weary the Committee on the subject of the ports at this stage.  Perhaps, later we will be able to raise it in more effective form.  I submit this addition to the section for the consideration of the Minister.</P>

Section 29 rules all this, and there is no additional safeguard in adding these words.

      <P>Before we depart from this section I would like to know from the Minister whether this question of owner's risk rate will be solely a question for the railway tribunal or whether there can be anything done about it during the discussion on the Bill.  There is an old Act called the Railways and Canals Traffic Act of 1854, and when this Act was passed in 1854 certain regulations were laid down that compel senders of live stock, when sending at owner's risk rate, to practically give away guarantees they have from a legal point of view.  This matter of owner's risk rate has been a source of great annoyance and litigation in the past, and I would like that some understanding be arrived at before the Bill is passed as to what is the line of action to be taken in the future in regard to it.  Now, as regards live stock, most of the live stock in the past consigned to Great Britain were booked at owner's risk rate because the rate at the company's risk was too high, and they did not consider it worth while to insure.  Supposing you lost a beast in transit under this Act of 1854, all you could legally recover was, in the case of a beast, £15; a horse, £50, sheep and pigs £2 each.  Now there is an agitation going on for a long time with regard to remedying that law and bringing in legislation.  No legislation was brought in, and the same law existed in England and in Ireland.  I understand that since the grouping took place in England the owner's risk rate has been altered, and there is substituted now in the case of horses £100, beasts £50 and £5 for sheep and pigs.  That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with this clause that requires amendment.  In the past if you had a claim against the railway company, unless you lodged that claim inside three days, you were debarred from going into court.  Besides, if any of your <Col N="1338" /> animals in transit broke down in the waggons, the railway company could dispose of those animals without communicating with the owner at all, and oftentimes they sent them to the knackers and returned to the owner 25s. or the price of the hide in some cases.  That is all now altered in England, and the railways in cases like that have to notify the owner, and they are also compelled to make the best use they can and to get the best price they can in the sale of the animal that breaks down.  There was another flaw in this &ldquo;owner's risk&rdquo; rate.  The railway companies insisted that it was the duty of the owner of the live stock to prove how the accident occurred if an accident occurred in transit, and unless you were able to prove how the accident occurred, you could not recover any damages.  It was most expensive litigation, and it was very costly to go to law with the railway company.  I know myself where there was a big lot of money lost by the owners of cattle over these laws.  On one occasion there were 40 cattle booked from the West of Ireland to Carlisle at this &ldquo;owner's risk&rdquo; rate They were smothered at sea.  The owner went to law with the railway company.  In the first court it was dismissed on the grounds that they were sent at &ldquo;owner's risk&rdquo; rate.  It was then taken to the Court of Appeal, and he was beaten in the Court of Appeal. The owner appealed then to the House of Lords, and he was beaten in the Lords, too, because this clause was there specifying &ldquo;the King's enemies,&rdquo;&ldquo;visitation of Providence.&rdquo;  It was a wild night at sea, and this not of consignment put him out of court. The judge said it was a very bad case but it was the law.  I submit that in future there should be some guarantee for the owner.  The railway and steamship companies have huge capital, and as against the individual traders the can go on appealing as far as the House of Lords, and if the case goes against the trader in the House of Lords wipes him out.  I hope the Minister will see that there are proper safe guards put into the Bill for the benefit of the trader in the future.  In the pay it was impossible to get any value for anything lost in transit.  So strict <Col N="1339" /> that law that even if the railway company lost a horse, a beast, or a pig, all they would legally be entitled to pay would be £50, £15 or £2, according as to what animal was lost, although the horse might be worth £100, and the beast might be worth £50.</P>

      <P>Again I rise for the purpose of calling Deputy McKenna's attention to the fact that he is one of the supporters of this Bill.  In this Bill and in this clause there is a provision which says: &ldquo;Within six months of the passing of this Act, or within such further time as the railway company may permit.&rdquo;  May I tell Deputy McKenna that &ldquo;the old order changeth,&rdquo; and we are entering a state of affairs, in which, as I said before, this almighty tribunal is going to settle everything.  The tribunal is going to be placed there to remedy &ldquo;all the ills the flesh is heir to.&rdquo;  They have a fancy job, of course, and one that I do not envy.  The tribunal is to be the means whereby Deputy McKenna is to get all he desires in the way of smothered sheep, stolen lambs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All the smothered sheep.  Of course, the through rate is a rate that is going to operate, and the Minister has over and over again disclaimed any intention of using even his influence&mdash;at all events, using his compulsion&mdash;as regards the other parties to the through rate.  Deputy McKenna's sheep or pigs or cattle, on the through rate, have to go to sea, and he complains that he could not recover from the steamship company because the animals were sent at owner's risk. Of course, the owner's risk is one risk and the company's risk is another, but the rates are different.  It is customary when you are sending live stock across the water to insure them, when you send at owner's risk.  In that way you would, I suppose, get back the value of the animal that was lost.  I only rise to impress upon the Farmers' Party, and particularly on Deputy McKenna, that whatever remedy they had in the past it was of such a kind that at any rate it enabled them to convince a railway or a steamship company which had <Col N="1340" /> a conscience and was in competition for the traffic, that they had a just claim; but under the amalgamated company they will deal with a body that has no soul at all.  The tribunal is going to lay down what it is going to do, and neither the directors of the company&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point that I want to raise may be easily cleared up. I had been always under the impression that the terms and conditions affecting railway transport were standardised, and that all the companies acted on the same terms and conditions. If that is so, I wonder why we should be making changes now?  I can quite imagine that the terms and conditions of the non-amalgamated companies may be different from those prescribed for the amalgamated companies.  We may have terms and conditions of transport, company's risk conditions, owner's risk conditions, applicable to the Great Northern or the Donegal railways, very much more favourable or very much less favourable, as the case may be, than such terms and conditions as may be applied to the amalgamated company.  I think whether it has been so in the past or not, it ought to be statutory, that the terms and conditions should be standardised and that all companies should have the same terms and conditions, so far as their general carriage is concerned. When we have in the first paragraph a reference to the terms and conditions of the amalgamated company, it seems to me that we are opening a way for different conditions for those companies which are within the scope of this Bill and those which are without <Col N="1341" /> its scope, and there is nothing here to show that the non-amalgamated companies shall submit to the tribunal its conditions.</P>

      <P>Is it Deputy Hewat's contention that there was protection afforded to the trader before that is not afforded under this Act?  I gathered, as far as I could follow his &ldquo;Second Reading speech,&rdquo; that he implied that.  Deputy McKenna was also inclined to make the point that the protection afforded by the Railways and Canals Traffic Act of 1854 no longer held.  Would either of the Deputies mind looking at the seventh Schedule of the Act?  It is proposed there to amend that Act of 1854, and for the £50 for the horse, the £15 for the cow, and the £2 for the pig, there are to be awarded £100, £50, and £5 respectively.</P>

      <P>Various points have been raised on this.  The points raised by Deputies McKenna and Hewat have been well answered by Deputy O'Sullivan.  It is very difficult to answer points raised by people who are so angered by the Bill that they will not trouble to read it.  I think the amendment to the Railways and Canals Traffic Act of 1854 is to the satisfaction of Deputy McKenna.  Deputy McKenna raised a matter concerning owner's sea risk&mdash;risk of conveyance by sea.  With that we have nothing to do.  This is a Railway Bill and not a Shipping Bill, <Col N="1342" /> and we do not intend to deal with that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKENNA Mr. McKENNA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain, then, how is he going to deal with booked through traffic.  Under the Railways and Canals Traffic Act of 1854 in any cases that I saw tested in law the contract was originally made with the railway company, and you had through booking from a station in Ireland to a destination in Great Britain.  You had to get over the sea, but the contract was made with the railway company in the first instance.  With the greatest respect to the Minister, there should be some understanding arrived at in regard to our position with the shipping companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how I can insist on shipping companies which are not under the control of the Dáil giving certain rates.  I cannot insist on it.  We can make representations to them about it.  This question of through rates has arisen several times, and we can make representations, and we can seek to have agreements, but beyond that we cannot do anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKENNA Mr. McKENNA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is open, I take it, to any shipping company coming to the port of Dublin, to cut the painter so far as their through rates from Ireland to Great Britain are concerned, if they so desire.  That is a very serious situation for the country at present, because as bad as the old law was, we had through rates from nearly every station in Ireland to destinations in Britain.  But when this Bill is passed the Minister tells us they have no power outside the Saorstát to compel railway companies, and I think it is a very serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>At what time was there power over a through rate more than you have at present?  We had through rates in the past; we are quite aware of the fact, but the difficulty that Deputy McKenna is in is this: You had one booking.  There has been a modification for the benefit of the shippers, <Col N="1343" /> those who ship at owner's risk, on the other side of the Channel.  I think it is largely in Deputy McKenna's mind that, if possible, there should be modifications on this side of the Channel, that if possible such a regulation should be made, and as far as the Minister was concerned, if it were in his power, he should take steps to see that there was a modification here, as was made in England as regards all the bookings at owner's risk.  Undoubtedly it is a very great disadvantage, and it is something that would require amendment, and if they have made this amendment in the English Act there is no reason why it should not be made in this Bill by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not deal with through rates; it deals with the terms and conditions under which traffic, live stock, or other, shall be carried, and while Deputy McKenna instanced sea traffic, the arguments he used will apply to inland traffic just as well, and it will be then a matter for the companies to consider what arrangements they will make with their associate companies outside the Saorstát. But in regard to the terms and conditions under which traffic shall be carried within the Saorstát, Deputy McKenna is, I think, in order, and not merely in order, but right in raising this question as to those conditions, as to whether there may be new conditions, more attractive, shall I say, or more protective for the traders' interests. Again, I would suggest that if there are to be conditions under which traffic may be carried, whether at owner's risk or at ordinary risk, they should be standardised to cover all companies within the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Confining the discussion now to the section and leaving out this question of through rates, which has revealed a serious situation to Deputy McKenna, but which was always as serious as it is now, and was never protected by law, on this particular point, the section provides no change.  It does not insist on a change; it provides that the amalgamated company shall submit to and publish these terms and conditions, and that afterwards the tribunal shall consider or <Col N="1344" /> show it has prepared and published additional terms and conditions, and after hearing a representative body of traders, shall draw up finally its terms and conditions.  Deputy Johnson seems to think on that, that again the railway tribunal will go out of its way to prevent any improvement in existing conditions.  I think his first argument was that these terms and conditions were actually standardised and that we should, apparently, give a direction to the tribunal to incorporate or fix again certain charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think the Minister is misunderstanding me.  I do not know whether they were unsatisfactory or not.  I will assume that they were perfectly unsatisfactory, or I will assume, if you wish, that they were quite satisfactory, but the same kind of conditions were satisfactory or unsatisfactory, whether the company in question was the Great Northern, the Midland Great Western, or the Great Southern and Western.  I may be wrong in that, but I am assuming that they were all the same.  If so, and if there is to be any change, that change should be applicable to all the companies. That is all I am contending for, that the trading public should not be in a position of doubt as to whether, when they send traffic by one line or another line, they are running the risk of being under worse conditions regarding traffic than they would be if they sent by the alternative route, inasmuch as, if my assumption is correct, that there was a standardised scheme regarding owner's risk and regarding ordinary risk, a similar standardised scheme should apply henceforth, whether it is better or worse, and that there should not be a variety of schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know now whether Deputy Johnson wants an answer to the point, but I might state this, that these terms and conditions which were fixed and were standardised in Great Britain are now all under review, and this section was drafted in this fashion in order to allow of any meeting, as far as the terms and conditions were concerned, between those operating on the other side and those which it is proposed to operate here. <Col N="1345" /> The point, however, that I think Deputy Johnson is making is as between the companies comprising the amalgamated undertaking and those railways partly in and partly outside the Saorstát.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there does seem to be an omission in the Bill.  I imagine that what Deputy Johnson requires is something relative to Section 39, just as Section 30 was relative to Section 29, in dealing with the fares, tolls, rates, etc., and I am not quite clear that a corresponding section to Section 29, having reference to railways partly in and partly outside the Saorstát, has been included.  I will take that into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

An amendment especially that I would like to see introduced, is with regard to the three days, the time limit under which you are debarred from making your claim, and also the alteration with regard to the substitution of £100 for £50; £50 for £15, and £5 for £2, in the case of sheep and pigs.  Another clause was with regard to making the best market value you could in regard to an animal injured in transit.  I am sure that if the amendments that were substituted in England were inserted by the Minister in this Bill, it would please very many, because like the Siamese Twins, they are dependent on one another.</P>

      <P>With regard to the various suggestions put forward by Deputy McKenna, these are all matters to be put forward by the representative body of traders who may desire to be heard before the tribunal.  It is not for the Dáil to go into all the details of consignment notes, and the various circumstances upon which the different risk conditions are built.  That is a matter for the tribunal after hearing the representative body of traders.  A big change has been made, as Deputy McKenna is aware, in regard to the revaluation of animals.  That has been incorporated, and is insisted on, and goes before the tribunal as a matter on which they have to base decisions, and to take into consideration.  Everything else applicable to owners' and companies' risk conditions are matters for argument before the tribunal.  With all respect I suggest that is a matter that could be much better discussed before the tribunal than in the Dáil.</P>

      <Col N="1347" /> Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 39 to 43 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 44.</P>
    <P>The amalgamated company shall be entitled to charge for the conveyance of merchandise as for a minimum distance of such number of miles as the railway tribunal may determine, or such minimum sum as the railway tribunal may determine, but such minimum distances shall not vary according to whether charges for station terminals are or are not made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the section and to substitute therefor the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The amalgamated company shall be entitled to charge for the conveyance of merchandise as for a minimum distance of such number of miles, or alternatively such minimum sum as the railway tribunal after hearing all parties interested and who are desirous of being heard may determine, but such minimum distances shall not vary according to whether charges for station terminals are or are not made.</P>
      <P>The real difference between this amendment and the section is that it incorporates words which the Minister has already agreed to incorporate in another clause.  I refer to the words &ldquo;after hearing all parties interested. and who are desirous of being heard.&rdquo; That is, that it is essential under the clause, as I propose it, before these minimum charges are fixed that all parties who are interested and are desirous of being heard shall be heard. I think, as the Minister has already seen his way to incorporate these words in another section, it is unnecessary for me to lay further stress on it, or to take up the time of the Dáil further.</P>

      <P>The Minister did rather suddenly accept the last amendment, but it occurs to me that may be he is compelling the tribunal to hear any crank that might turn up and ask for the right of hearing, and I am not quite sure whether that is wise.  I think it is rather unwise, for I have in my mind certain people who are sure <Col N="1348" /> to be at that tribunal.  I could name three persons whom I can guarantee will be heard at that tribunal as often as possible.  They are interested, of course, and the tribunal under this section will not be able to say they are not interested, for they will be able to show that they are, and the desire to be heard will certainly be evident, but as to whether they are serving any public interest&mdash;and as to whether the tribunal ought not to be allowed to have a little discretion&mdash;I am very doubtful. I do not think it would be serving the public interest in the case I have in mind, and I think the tribunal ought to have some discretion as to whether they should be heard or not.</P>

      <P>The answer I propose to make is one, unfortunately, that will not answer Deputy Johnson, for if Deputy Johnson's three crank friends are inclined to be present and are going to force their way in under this amendment, I am afraid they will have power to force themselves in under other sections.  This section deals with minimum charges.  Minimum charges are portion of the standard arrangements.  Section 27 states that, &ldquo;the Railway Tribunal shall consider the schedules of proposed standard charges so submitted to them, and any objections thereto which may be lodged within the prescribed time and in the prescribed manner, and, after hearing all the parties interested and who are desirous of being heard.&rdquo;  I would ask the Deputy to consider whether it was worth while to include words which are already in Section 27, inasmuch as Section 27 operates with this particular section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson, a few moments ago, referred to the fact that this Bill is based on the English Act, though the Minister did not exactly agree with that.  I may inform him that the words I suggest to incorporate are in the English Act, and as the clause stands it appears to us that it is unnecessarily restrictive, and might, as the Minister recognises, give rise to cases of hardship.  I think it is in the interests of all parties that the rights of those who appear before these different tribunals, when such important matters as minimum charges are being fixed, shall appear in the section, <Col N="1349" /> so that there may be no question as to the right to interfere and be heard, when these particular matters are being considered.  I would press on the Minister to accept this amendment. There is nothing in it that will weaken the Bill.  These people have already got the right in another section of the Bill to appear before the tribunal.  We, commercial men, are not lawyers, and like to have on the face of a section exactly what it means, and what our rights are, and not have to refer from one section to another.</P>

    <P>(2)  The amalgamated company may, and upon being required to do so and upon payment of the proper charges shall, at any place where the company holds itself out to collect and deliver merchandise, perform the services of collection and delivery in respect of such merchandise as is for the time being ordinarily collected and delivered by the company at that place:</P>

      <P>I would like to know would Deputy Good prevent the railway company delivering merchandise which has been carried by a railway outside the Saorstát?  Supposing goods were put on rail at Belfast and were delivered in Dundalk for transmission to some point in the County Louth or Meath.  Why should the railway company be prevented from transmitting such goods by, say, motor?  If Deputy Good's amendment were accepted unless they have been put on the railway within the jurisdiction of the Saorstát they will be precluded from such delivery.  I do not see that there is any point in the plea that there should be a restriction in the way suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot agree with Deputy Johnson.  I think the section is quite obvious.  If the goods are not carried by any railway in Saorstát Eireann, is it intended that the railway company should become a sort of delivery agent?  That is really what it means.  The goods may be delivered by the amalgamated company even though they may not travel on any of the lines included in that group. There is no objection whatever to delivery if they run on any of the lines on Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can understand it now, the amendment seeks to provide that the amalgamated undertaking should not run, say, a motor service from Mullingar to Dublin. If that is the point, I think it is met by the Bill, as the amalgamated company has to make reasonable <Col N="1353" /> charges for certain things, in addition to the charges for carriage by rail.  It is only where there was a previous charge for carriage on the undertaking itself that there would be allowed, in addition, a small charge for collection and delivery.</P>

      <P>As to the point Deputy Johnson raised, we want to prohibit the amalgamated company from delivering goods that had not travelled over their line.  We do not want to stop the amalgamated company from collecting or delivering goods.  Surely, it is reasonable to expect the goods must run over their line.  We do not want them to become delivery agents alone.</P>

    <P>(i)  the chargeable distance from that station or place of every place to which they book, and such distance shall be the actual shortest distance with any additions authorised by statute;</P>

      <P>(i) the chargeable distance by every alternative route from that station or place of every place to which they book.</P>
      <P>The object of that amendment is to provide that information about alternative routes shall be available at each station.  If a person goes to book stuff at a station that person should be able to ascertain the different routes by which it could be sent.  The provision of that information might cause trouble, but it is valuable for the consignor, who for some reason or other may wish to send goods not necessarily by the shortest route, but by a route that, from his point of view, would be the best one.</P>

That book will be open for inspection, but it would be impossible to show the alternative routes, say, from a station in the interior of Ireland to some station in an eastern county in England.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>You have had a good deal of discussion during the consideration of this Bill on the difference between consigned and unconsigned traffic.  Except a man is going to get some facilities when he is consigning traffic and knows his liabilities, it is obvious that he will send it as unconsigned traffic.  Whether that is the desire of the framers of this Act, that they will facilitate those who leave traffic to them to consign in any way they like and will not facilitate those anxious to consign their traffic, I think the amendment turns on the question of giving certain information to the consignor to enable him to say that he will send the traffic as unconsigned traffic, or whether he will consign it via a certain route.  If you do not facilitate the man and enable him to decide when forwarding the traffic as to the way he is to forward it, and you refuse to give him facilities, he will probably send it as unconsigned in order to avoid certain liabilities.  That appears to me to be the real principle underlying this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of the amendment says: &ldquo;For the purpose of this sub-section the expression &lsquo;alternative route&rsquo; shall be deemed to be every route, the distance by which route to the place to which the company book does not exceed the distance by the shortest route by more than fifty per cent.&rdquo;  Clearly the whole thing hangs together.  We want to preserve the alternative routes when they are within a certain measure of distance to the shortest route.  The whole thing is coupled up with the various other <Col N="1357" /> amendments, which means really, so far as the ports are concerned, that they wish to safeguard their routes so far as they possibly can.  This Bill is tieing the railways up into a unified group, and the ports are concerned in the matter, and this is simply to leave open an alternative route that does not exceed the shortest route by fifty per cent.  I think the Minister will recognise that it is not such a voluminous thing as he makes out, and that there will not be so many cases arising at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just exactly that point that weighs with me.  The work will be voluminous.  You have to get the distance of any one route from any point in Ireland to any point in England, and you have to give an alternative list.  I am told that the work was so complicated that the railway company did not make up the books in several instances, but sent them to the Railway Clearing House to have them made up.  It is because of this voluminous work that I object to the amendment.</P>

It is not that there are so many alternative routes.  The traffic is through traffic, between the towns and the stations in Ireland, going to Great Britain, and in those cases the alternative routes are not numerous.  They are very well defined and clear, and the Minister need not hestitate about the extent or volume.  It will all be covered within a reasonably small amount of space.</P>

      <P>This amendment deals with a very important matter.  Section 49 deals with matters very largely of classification, and such matters are very important. I do not know that we have, next to the question of rates, a more important question than classification, and it is very necessary, in fixing the question of classification that the interests of all parties should be heard when questions of such importance are being considered.  This amendment, therefore, proposes to incorporate in this section what the Minister has already agreed to incorporate in other sections, namely, that all parties interested and desirous of being heard shall have an opportunity of putting their views forward.</P>

      <P>(1)  The standard charges to be fixed in the first instance for the amalgamated company shall be such as will, together with the other sources of revenue, in the opinion of the railway tribunal, so far as practicable yield, with efficient and economical working and management an annual net revenue (hereinafter referred to as the standard revenue) equivalent to the average annual aggregate net revenue for the three years of account ended next before the 1st day of January, 1914, of the amalgamating companies and the absorbed companies, together with&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> (a)a sum equal to five per cent. on capital expenditure forming the basis on which interest was allowed at the end of the period during which the amalgamating and absorbed companies were in the possession of the British Government; and</P>
    <P>(b)such allowance as may be necessary to remunerate adequately any additional capital which may have been raised or provided in respect of expenditure on capital account incurred since the 1st day of January, 1913, and not included in the expenditure referred to in the last preceding paragraph, unless it can be shown that such expenditure has not enhanced the value of the undertaking; and</P>
    <P>(c)such allowance as appears to the railway tribunal to be reasonable in respect of capital expenditure not being less than one thousand pounds in the case of any work and not being capital expenditure included in paragraph (a), on works which enhance the value of the undertaking, but which had not at the beginning of the year 1913 become fully remunerative:</P>
    <P>Provided that, in determining the sum which charges will, with efficient and economical working and management, yield, the tribunal shall, with a view to encouraging the taking of early steps for effecting economies in working and management expenses rendered possible by or in anticipation of amalgamation, take into consideration the economies effected by such steps already taken, and shall make such allowance in respect thereof as the tribunal may consider fair and equitable to an amount not exceeding thirty-three and one-third per cent. of such economies.</P>
    <P>(2)  The railway tribunal when fixing charges in pursuance of the provisions of this section shall have regard to the means which in their opinion are best calculated to ensure the maximum development and extension in the public interest of the carriage by railway of merchandise and of passengers and their luggage, <Col N="1365" /> and shall accordingly ascertain as far as may be practicable the effect which the existing charges, or any of them, have had upon the merchandise or passenger traffic to which they are applicable, and, in particular, whether the application of such charges has tended or, if continued, would be likely to tend towards causing the increase or diminution of the said traffic.</P>
    <P>(3)  If on any such review as is mentioned in the next following section it appears to the railway tribunal that the allowance made under paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section was too high or too low, the tribunal may revise the allowance and make such adjustment in the amount of the standard revenue as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>(4)  When fixing the charges necessary to produce the standard revenue, the railway tribunal shall take into consideration the charges in respect of any business carried on by the company ancillary or subsidiary to its railways, the charges for which are not subject to the jurisdiction of the railway tribunal, and if, in the opinion of the railway tribunal, the company is not making, or has not taken reasonable steps to enable it to make adequate charges in respect of any such business, the railway tribunal shall, in fixing the charges under this part of this Act, take into account the revenue which would be produced by any such business if adequate charges were in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move on behalf of Deputy Bryan Cooper the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete in line 34 the figures &ldquo;1914,&rdquo; and in lines 45 and 55 to delete the figures &ldquo;1913&rdquo; and to substitute therefor in each case the figures &ldquo;1916.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the arguments which Deputy Cooper intended to bring forward, but I shall point out what appears to me to be the effect of the amendment.  I understand that the figures for the three years ending 1913 accepted by the Minister, in putting forward this Bill, upon a certain basis <Col N="1366" /> did not commend themselves to the railway company, and they suggested that instead of the year 1913, which was the year of maximum amount of revenue received in a certain number of years, the average for the years 1911, 1912 and 1913 be taken.  That did not commend itself to the Minister, and this suggestion of Deputy Cooper seems to me to be put forward as a compromise between the two points of view.  I think if you take the figures in the White Paper you will see that the average of the three years specified in the Bill would be a figure of £1,088,000.  That would be the nett profit to be taken as the basis in fixing the standard revenue.  If you take the figure that was advocated by the railway company, £1,147,000, the two figures differ by £59,000.  If you take the figure advocated by Deputy Bryan Cooper you will get the figure coming in between those two.  There was a falling off in the year 1914-15 from the big figure of 1913, but that was no doubt due to war conditions.</P>
    <P>If you take the average of the three years it seems to work out at £1,115,000, which is very nearly halfway between the two other figures I have quoted.  I think the difference that would accrue to traders from the choice of the figure laid down in the amendment, as compared with the figure laid down in the Bill, would be exceedingly small, whereas it would mean a very important thing to the railway company if they were allowed to have the larger figure in that it would enable them to commence their operation in a much stronger position. Therefore, without elaborating the matter any further, and in order to draw the Minister as far as I can, I will move the amendment which stands in Deputy Cooper's name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a good case can be made in respect of this amendment.  It was originally intended that the average should run for five years.  The fact that 1913 was a big year is an advantage as far as the shareholders of all the concerns are concerned.  To bring in 1914 and 1915 would bring in unquestionably very peculiár circumstances, the circumstances of the war and the fact that 1913 was a big year I think should <Col N="1367" /> satisfy any fair-minded person that a real attempt was made to deal fairly with them in this matter.  1914 and 1915 were abnormal years, and the question which we ought to ask ourselves in that connection is, how does the state of business at the present moment compare with 1913, 1914 and 1915?  I think an examination of almost any returns in connection with business will show that the bulk of business is not transacted now that was transacted in those years.  The actual receipts may be somewhat different, owing to the different values of money and other matters of that sort, but the facts are that we are scarcely in a position to say that the business which was done in 1913, 1914 and 1915 compares very favourably with the business of to-day.  If, then, we were to accept those three years, or the average of them, as a standard by which we would measure the earning capacity of the new company, we would be setting a higher standard than the business of the country could afford.  We had that in mind when we fixed the average three years.  I do not know what the views of the business community are in a matter of that sort, but I do think, apart from their views, that we must take into consideration the whole circumstances of the country at the present time, and if you seek to get from the new company a sum that it is impossible for it to earn without making its business gilt-edged as against everything else in the country, I think much more harm than good will result from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the business community have any particular partiality for any term.  I should say the only argument we could advance in favour of the amendment would be that if it is more favourable in the sense of being likely to give us cheaper rates in the one case than in the other, we would naturally support the one that would give us the lower rate.  It is not very clear how the operation of the amendment would work in that direction.</P>

      <P>I think there is no likelihood of this particular amendment ever being called upon to do duty. There is not a great likelihood, but in such an eventuality, it would mean that we would have to introduce an Act amending this particular Bill in regard to any war, greater, perhaps, in extent than the last war, which would have the effect of raising prices.  But, when one takes into consideration the circumstances prevailing at the time that permission was granted to increase rates and charges, and that we have now reached a period when the justification for the continuance of those charges cannot be made, then I think it is obvious that there is no likelihood whatever of an increase in charges.  There might possibly be a case for an increased rate in respect of certain classes of goods&mdash;I mean such things as explosives and dangerous traffic of that sort.  It is most unlikely that a railway tribunal, taking into consideration the circumstances under which permission was granted to increase the charges before, and bearing in mind the cost of living now and the changed circumstances of the times, would give any occasion for the operation of this amendment.</P>

      <P>There is one point Deputy Gorey probably has overlooked. I think power is taken in some clause in the Bill to review special rates that have been quoted.  Certain people may have got certain special rates.  If they are not economic rates, apparently somebody else must make up the difference between the uneconomic rates in question and the actual amount that might come in.  In that case, any privileged person&mdash;granted there be such person, which I do not know&mdash;would have his position strengthened and consolidated by the amendment of the Deputy, and I do not think that is the Deputy's intention.</P>

    <P>The Dáil went into Committee on the Railways Bill, 1924.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 53.</P>
    <P>(3)  If on any such review the railway tribunal finds that the net revenue or the average annual net revenue obtained, or which could, with efficient and economical management, have been obtained by the company during the period on the experience of which the review is based is substantially in excess of the standard revenue of the company with such allowance (if any) as appears to the railway tribunal necessary to remunerate adequately any additional capital which may have been raised or provided in respect of expenditure on capital account incurred since the date upon which the standard charges were fixed in the first instance, the railway tribunal shall, unless it is of opinion that owing to change in circumstances the excess is not likely to continue, modify all or any of the standard charges and make a corresponding general modification of the exceptional charges of the company so as to effect a reduction of the net revenue of the company in subsequent years to an extent equivalent to eighty per cent. of such excess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move this amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), to add after the word &ldquo;excess,&rdquo; line 66, the following words: &ldquo;or, if the tribunal is of opinion that the excess arises from causes not due mainly or in great part to the enterprise and good management of the amalgamated company, to such greater percentage of the excess as the tribunal may think proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of this section provides that if the revenue of the company, or at least the income of the company is such as to allow a reduction in charges, that there shall be a reduction in charges, but allowing 20 per cent. of the excess to be retained by the railway companies over and above the standard revenue.  The theory of the Bill I take it is to encourage the company by efficient management to save by allowing 20 per cent. over and above the standard revenue with the hope that that will be an inducement to more efficient management. That is not objected to in this amendment.  There are possibilities <Col N="1373" /> that the excess will have been obtained not by the action of the company but by the action of the public, the traders perhaps, the local corporation perhaps, the Government itself perhaps.  As I think I hinted at an earlier stage, it is quite possible, for instance, that certain circumstances might arise in connection with the development of power schemes on the Shannon.  This amendment provided that the tribunal shall have a right to say whether the excess is due to the action of the companies or whether it is, in fact unearned increment; and if so, they may modify the amount to be retained by the company, that is the 20 per cent. to such an extent as they may think proper.  It is a provision to enable the tribunal to modify the provisions of the Bill in so far as it ensures that they shall be entitled to 20 per cent. of any excess on saving and will really mean that the company will be guaranteed any such advantage as they may obtain by virtue of good management, but will not be guaranteed any such advantage as they may obtain by virtue of communal or public action.  I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

      <P>The object of the section is that if the actual revenue in any year is found to be in excess of the standard revenue an amount equal to 20 per cent. of such excess shall be retained by the amalgamated undertaking. If Deputy Johnson's wishes are sanctioned by the passing of this amendment we shall not have an inquiry into how that excess arises, and if the tribunal is of opinion that it arises from enterprise and good management, then certain further changes in the division of the excess will be made.  First of all, the Dáil ought to consider the extra butden that is going to be put on the tribunal in the deciding of this question. It has to decide the excess arising during the year and apportion out that excess so that some portion of the excess is set down as arising from good management, and some portion not allocated as being due to good management and enterprise.  That would be a task which would simply be not possible for the tribunal.  It would be humanly impossible for the tribunal to <Col N="1374" /> go into all these things.  The division made here is 20 per cent. to the company and 80 per cent. towards the reduction of charges, and that is an equitable arrangement.  It is obviously the easiest arrangement.  But it is an equitable one.  It gives an incentive to the company.  This point must also be remembered that the excess might be due not to what Deputy Johnson describes as something arising from the community.  It might arise from good conditions in the country which would lead to greater use of the railways and greater employment of them by traders.  It is considered equitable to give a proportion of 20 per cent and 80 per cent. in the way indicated so that it would be enjoyed by the whole community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to be put in the position of supporting the Government on this Bill, but it seems to me that the Bill with all its volume of words must have some good points in it, and perhaps the clause that we have been dealing with is perhaps the saving clause as against the condemnation of the whole Bill.  Now, one must realise that whenever a board of directors come into operation as forecasted in the Bill, if you do not give them some incentive to exercise their initiative in the saving of expense, they will be simply a board with control, but with no authority and no incentive towards improvement of any sort.</P>
      <P>Taking the Bill as a whole, and leaving that clause in, I think it is reasonable that the Directors should retain some proportion of the prosperity that may accrue to the amalgamated company. I am not very sanguine that it is not rather a work of supererogation to put it in, but at all events, I think it is due to the shareholders that they should get some benefit out of it and the percentage indicated in the Bill is not unreasonable.  Deputy Johnson says that the railways may benefit by something outside their activities, some windfalls.  We all know that we sometimes benefit by windfalls that we do not, perhaps, deserve,.  In my opinion, his amendment would lead to controversy as to whether the directors by their foresight had contributed to this increase in revenue or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very hard to decide that, <Col N="1375" /> and with very great regret I have to break the coalition which has worked in connection with this Bill on many occasions, and I will support the Government.  After all, if the poor shareholders did get a little benefit they would not be altogether dealing with a gold mine.  In the past they did not make a great deal of money out of the railways, and if there is an opportunity now for getting some of their own back before nationalisation comes, it ought not to be grudged them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to the amendment is that on the face of it, it seems to deal only with one thing, but as a matter of fact it deals with two.  I do not know whether Deputy Johnson objects exactly to the actual percentage that we have put down. He may think it too high, but if it be to high, we should consider what the percentage would be.  That is one point.  The other is much more material and it would affect very much the character of the most important element in the Bill, the tribunal.  The tribunal, up to this, is of an analytical character very largely, and having analysed, it is easy for it to make up its mind.  If this amendment is to pass, the tribunal would have another office, a sort of super - board of management, which would have to determine whether there were any profits in excess of a certain sum, and whether that excess should or should not go to the shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the other duties we have imposed on the tribunal, I do not think it would be fair to it, or to the other duties it has to discharge, that it should be also called on to discharge this extra duty.  I am afraid I could not accept the amendment.  If the percentage that is put down is earned in the ordinary development of the business of the country, that entitles the shareholders to their particular advantage.  If, on the other hand, the excess is due to good management, I think Deputy Johnson subscribes to that, because, according to the amendment. I think he means that if there were good management the advantage could be derived by the shareholders. I think the shareholders are better entitled on the other ground, which does <Col N="1376" /> not appear to me to be included in the amendment.</P>
    <P>From these facts&mdash;but particularly from the fact that the character of the tribunal would certainly undergo a change if it had to decide whether or not a percentage or a portion of the excess should go to the shareholders&mdash;I am afraid I could not support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President, I should have thought, would not object to giving this function to the tribunal, because he thought in the earlier stages of the Bill, that the tribunal was quite competent to arrange the amalgamation, fix the terms, and listen to all arguments for and against the terms of the amalgamation, at the same time as they would be preparing the schemes, reviewing rates, and generally conducting the preliminary of the fixation of rates, and that it was quite an abnormal tribunal which could do very many wonderful things at the same time.  But by the time the tribunal gets to work and is fixing a ratio it will have a good part of that duty already accomplished, so that it is not really asking them to do very much more than they will be required to do under the Bill.  If I had been asked to prophesy, it would have been the very simplest thing for me to have said that Deputy Hewat would not support this amendment, because he stands frankly for unearned increment, and that capital shall get what it can.  I am trying to suggest that in this Bill there should be some recognition of the fact that there may accrue wealth to a railway company, there may accrue revenue to a railway company by the action of others besides the railway shareholders; that the community action may very easily and very simply add to the revenue and the profit of a railway company without any action, without any prevision, on the part of the company or the directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have suggested in this amendment that the company should be entitled to that 20 per cent. which is clearly due to management, but if there is clearly due some of that excess to the activity of others besides the company, then those others, the trading community should get the benefit in lower rates.  Had the Minister for <Col N="1377" /> Education been here I would have suggested to him that he should put sub-section (3) of this section as an exercise in reading in primary schools, and perhaps if I were Deputy O'Connell, I would ask the Dáil to read this sub-section after me.  But maybe if I tried, the Ceann Comhairle would rule me out.  But it is a most interesting exhibition of English phraseology and does require a little bit of care in the reading of it.  Perhaps the President, who has explained that the draftsman has been laid up, would attribute that illness to the drafting of this section but for the fact that it is drawn from the British Bill.  The amendment frankly asks the Dáil to agree to recognise the principle that the community-created profit should not go to the railway shareholders but should go back to the community, or to the trading interests who are looking for lower rates.  Of course, allied with this is the assumption which I make that the guaranteed dividend is a very satisfactory return to the shareholders, and if they are to have anything beyond that it should certainly be confined to any profits which are directly traceable to good management and railway enterprise, rather than to communal effort, and perhaps traders activities.  That is why I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Deputy Johnson's point of view on this is quite clear, and I think that the Committee will understand my point of view.  Deputy Johnson and his party are actuated by principles, but the Government have no principles at all.  Deputy Johnson refers to this section and the rest of the Bill as being of British manufacture. I do not object to that.  British manufacture is quite good, but British manufacture may not always be quite suitable to transfer to Irish soil.  The President has said that he does not want to put any more on the tribunal, but when we analyse this Bill we can see that a little more on the tribunal would not hurt it, because the tribunal is of such a superman capacity that it could stand a little more.  But the real reason that I want protection for the shareholders is that the Government set up a tribunal and they also embody in the Bill the management of the railways by the directors.  As far as I can <Col N="1378" /> see, the directors who are representing the shareholders will have very little to say in the management of the company. However, I like this section, because it protects the directors&mdash;save the mark &mdash;and the shareholders whom they represent, from the further autocratic encroachment of this body which is going to be set up to represent the Government, and everybody else, in railway management.</P>

      <P>(1)  From and after the passing of this Act the rates of pay, hours of duty, and other conditions of service of railway employees shall be regulated in accordance with agreements made or to be from time to time made between such employees or their trade unions or other representatives of the one part and the railway companies and other persons by whom they are respectively employed or the representatives of such companies or persons of the other part.</P>

    <P>(3)  In this Part of this Act the expression &ldquo;railway employee&rdquo; means a person who is employed by a railway company or the Irish Railway Clearing House, in any of the grades specified in the Eighth Schedule to this Act, and whose station, depôt, or other place of employment is situate in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson says the amendment sets out to give recognition to the Central Wages Board and the Irish Railways Wages Board.  If that is the object then I must resist the amendment.  These two bodies were not created by the Oireachtas, or any law passed by the Oireachtas, and they may disappear any day.  It seems a peculiar thing to legislate here for two bodies which may disappear any moment after the passing of the Act. In addition, there is the further objection, that these Boards consist of representatives of companies wholly outside the Saorstát, and from that point of view they are undesirable bodies to bring under the operation of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I recognise that there may appear to be a weakness in that fact, but it remains that the companies within have agreed with the companies without to follow this procedure.  This amendment does not add that there should be any control over that Wages Board.  It is a Board set up by voluntary agreement, and the amendment allows for modification, if change is to take place in respect of the Wages Board.  I think owing to the fact that there has been set up this voluntary agreement that the employees of the railway companies and the companies themselves, should be recognised, that the Bill would be strengthened, and the general position be improved by recognising that statutorily.  While it does not give any added authority to the Government of the Saorstát, or the railway <Col N="1381" /> tribunal, over the Wages Boards, it recognises the existence of the Boards, and I think it is valuable in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the purpose of the amendment is clearly to carry on the two boards at present in existence, but I think everybody must recognise the difficulty of that in so far as the Boards are created voluntarily by arrangement as between the companies and trade unions, and have no power to come to decision unless practically a unanimous decision, not as arbitrators. Therefore, to embody a form of procedure such as that in legislation of this sort would give an importance to that form over and above what its value really is.  One must recognise that a board of that sort, that can come to no decision unless it is a decision which is unanimous, would be practically useless as a means of arbitrating between employers and employees.  It may be very useful to help in coming to a decision, but it is certainly not the thing you could put into an Act of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, when Deputy Hewat takes that line he is arguing against the establishment of public inquiry into matters which might easily lead to disputes, and arguing against the establishment of any conciliation tribunal.  If you cannot put into an Act of Parliament any such board or tribunal, well I am prepared to accept that view, if it is pressed, and simply tell the Deputy that he is going back on all those things which have been urged from his side of the Dáil.  The establishment of this railway tribunal, which was done in Ireland by voluntary arrangement, was a duplication of a similar arrangement in England, which was in fact embodied in the British statute, and the whole form and manner of the tribunal is embodied in the British statute.  I am not very anxious to press the amendment: I am not quite sure of its value, but I think that it is doing something, that it is going some little way towards recognising that the railway companies and railway employees are public servants, and exist to serve the public and the community, and that it is well to have established some kind of tribunal which may be in <Col N="1382" /> the nature of a buffer to avoid sudden shocks upon the community.  If there is to be no such tribunal, then, of course, the regular, and shall I say, old-fashioned method, of discussing issues in dispute, leading to lock-outs or strikes, possibly without even reference to the public convenience, and possibly even without notice&mdash;if that is what Deputy Hewat desires I have nothing to say.  But there has arisen a public opinion, a public opinion that has been subscribed to by the railway trades unions, and agreed to by the companies, that it is a rather good thing to have something in the nature of these boards, which will discuss and, if necessary, make public the issues in dispute.  While it is not, and I hope never will be, an arbitration tribunal with compulsory powers, it does allow an opportunity for the matters in dispute to be discussed publicly, and a public opinion may be created in the matter.  As to the merits of the claim, or the merits of resisting the claim, if the Dáil is to be led by Deputy Hewat in this matter then we know where we are.</P>

If it is preferred that greater risks should be run by the community than to have such a thing as this registered in the Bill, I am not going to quarrel.  I am only going to say that I think the Dáil is unwise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> This amendment is, I think, of more importance.  &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;railway employee&rsquo; means a person who is employed by a railway company or the Irish Railway Clearing House, in any of the grades specified in the Eighth Schedule.&rdquo;  The passing of this section as it stands would rule out all those people engaged in the railway shops, and I do not think that is intended. The Eighth Schedule deals with station-masters, clerks, supervisors, signalmen, guards, traffic staff, goods staff, cartage staff, carriage and wagon examiners, drivers, shed staff, gangers, signal and telegraph line men, etc. But all these people engaged in the railway workshops are ruled out of that.  The amendment asks the Dáil to delete the words &ldquo;in any of the grades specified in the Eighth Schedule to this Act.&rdquo; Perhaps the Minister would explain whether it is his intention that the regulations providing for the conditions and services of railway employees shall only apply to these grades.  Does he deliberately intend that railway shopmen should be excluded from the operation of this Part 4?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I am somewhat in a difficulty owing to this amendment being brought to my notice late.  Previously Deputy Davin had another amendment down, if I may discuss it here, relevant to the new proposal. Deputy Davin proposed to insert &ldquo;and in such other grades as may hereafter be brought within the scope of the agreements referred to in this section by agreement between the parties thereto.&rdquo;  It was proposed to accept that.  Is there any point not met by Deputy Davin's first proposal which is included in the second proposal to omit certain words?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is. There are certain grades that have been working under agreements, and it is believed that the amended proposal is much more likely to effect the end sought than the original amendment. The object of it is to bring under Part 4 of the Bill the railway shopmen, which the original amendment does not do effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is clear that this is intended to bring in what <Col N="1384" /> are purely railwaymen.  The men whom Deputy Johnson refers to as shopmen are, of course, boilermakers and other trades unionists of that sort.  The difficulty, so far as the amendment is concerned, is that these trades are regulated pretty well by their own organisations, and they would not, and never did, come into a body such as the railway organisation.  They are governed more by the outside conditions as a trade rather than the internal conditions as regards a railway.  As far as I can see, Schedule 8 embraces what would be railwaymen, as apart from the men in the shops, who are more general and whose agreements stretch out beyond the radius of the railways.</P>

      <P>May I say a word on this?  I know that the railway shopmen are interested in the compensation schedule.  I met some of them from time to time on this matter, and they have put it up in various forms, but not in regard to this particular part of the Bill.  They are interested in the schedule dealing with compensation because they do not consider that they are covered by the terms &ldquo;railway servants,&rdquo; which has a meaning by usage and custom which they fear would exclude 15 or 16 trades unions that make up the railway shopmen.  I have, as a matter of fact, spoken to the Minister about an amendment that would put it beyond doubt that the Third Schedule, dealing with compensation, would apply to railway shopmen. and I understand that the Ministry are willing to accept that amendment.  I do not think that they have ever put up anything with reference to this particular provision, which leaves the terms of employment as a matter for agreement, preserves existing agreements and does not impose any obligations on anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Attorney-General is quite right in referring to the Superannuation clauses there is a demand in respect to this question of wages and conditions of service:&mdash;&ldquo;From and after the passing of this Act the rates of pay, hours of duty, and other conditions of service of railway employees shall be regulated in accordance with agreements <Col N="1385" /> made or to be from time to time made between such employees or their trade unions or other representatives of the one part and the railway companies and other persons by whom they are respectively employed, or the representatives of such companies or persons of the other part.&rdquo;  Then we are asked to say that that refers only to certain sections of railway employees, excluding a very considerable number of other sections, who are all governed by agreement with the railway companies.  As a matter of practice, these employees make agreements with the railway companies and the proposal in the amendment is to ensure that these agreements will be governed by section 54.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Conciliation grades&rdquo; covers a certain section of employees who made agreements regarding these conciliation proposals that did not include shopmen.  Conciliation grades are the only grades referred to in the Schedule.  What I desire in this amendment is to provide that every tradesman who works for railway companies in railway shops shall also be brought into this provision, notwithstanding the fact that they are not within the conciliation grades.  As a matter of practice, you are ruling out a specific reference to the Wages Boards, and it seems to follow inevitably that you should bring in non-conciliation grades under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference, as far as I understand it, is, you take people in certain grades, with whom, or about whom agreements were already in existence, and you carry those over, and you make arrangements for any further agreements hereinafter to be brought in.  The term &ldquo;railway employe&rdquo; is limited by Section 3 and confined to the people mentioned in the Eighth Schedule.  That would, of <Col N="1386" /> course, put out of court such people as Deputy Johnson has alluded to.  But if Deputy Davin's first amendment were accepted, and there were added to the definition of &ldquo;railway employe&rdquo;&ldquo;such other grades as may hereinafter be brought within the scope of the agreements referred to in this section by agreements between the parties thereto,&rdquo; then you have everything provided for.  You have mention of agreements that have already been made, and you make provision for future agreements.  I think the section, with Deputy Davin's first amendment, includes everything.</P>

      <P>Is it not really a question of fact whether there are any agreements regulating the terms of service with the shopmen?  If there is none Deputy Davin's amendment does all that is required, as it enables agreements to be made.  If it is suggested that there are binding agreements, the matter should be looked into to see whether they should be carried out.  I understand there is none.</P>

      <P>I do not want to object to any concession that the Minister is going to give in this Bill, but I think he is going further than he realises in this matter.  What you call &ldquo;railway grades&rdquo; cannot be mixed up with grades which are only supplemental as railway grades.  In other words, take the case of boiler-makers and carpenters. They are governed by trades unions which are very much larger outside than inside railways, and if the Minister brings in these grades he is going to court trouble.

      <P>(1)  With a view to securing and promoting the public safety, or the interests of the public, or of trade, or of any particular locality, the railway tribunal may, on the application of any body of persons representing any such interests, by order require the amalgamated company or any other railway company in respect to that portion of its undertaking situate in Saorstát Eireann to afford such reasonable railway services, facilities, and conveniences upon and in connection with its undertaking (including the provision of such minor alterations and extensions and improvements of existing works as will not involve in any one case an expenditure exceeding ten thousand pounds) as may be specified in the order:</P>

    <P>Provided that, if on any such application a company satisfies the railway tribunal that under all the circumstances the capital required for the purpose cannot be provided or <Col N="1388" /> expended as proposed without prejudicially affecting the interests of the then existing stockholders, the order shall not be made:</P>
    <P>Provided further that the powers under this sub-section shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other existing powers of requiring measures for securing the safety of the public or the provision of reasonable facilities.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may by order require the amalgamated company or any other railway company in respect to that portion of its undertaking situate in Saorstát Eireann to comply with any recommendation of an inspector duly appointed under the Regulation of Railways Act, 1871.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where any coroner holds or is about to hold, an inquest on the death of any person occasioned by an accident, of which notice for the time being is required by or in pursuance of the Regulation of Railways Acts, 1840 to 1889, to be sent to the Minister, and makes a written request to the Minister in this behalf, the Minister may appoint an inspector or some person possessing legal or special knowledge to assist in holding such inquest, and the person so appointed shall act as the assessor of the coroner, and the return to be made by the coroner to the Minister under the Acts aforesaid shall be made by such person in lieu of by the coroner, and the return shall be made public in like manner as in the case of a formal investigation of an accident under the Regulation of Railways Act, 1871.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 55, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Save as is hereinafter in this section provided all appointments to any office or situation in the clerical grades of the service of a railway company shall be made by means of open competitive examination in accordance with regulations made by the railway company.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every such open competitive examination shall be open to all persons desiring to attend the same who are ordinarily resident in Ireland, and who pay the fees and possess the qualifications as to age, health and character prescribed by the regulations relating to the examination.</P>
      <P>(3)  A railway company may by special regulation provide that not more than 25 per cent. of the vacancies in the clerical grades of its service shall be filled by means of limited competitive examinations and where an examination is so limited only persons in the employment of the company or the children of such persons shall be admitted thereto.</P>
      <P>(4)  A copy of every regulation made under this section shall be lodged with the Minister as soon as may be after it is made.</P>
      <P>(5)  It shall be competent for the Railway Council and the Central Wages Board and, on appeal, the Irish Railways Wages Board to take into consideration, as a matter affecting the conditions of service of railway employees, any question as to a regulation made by a railway company for the purpose of this section, including any question as to the number, proportion or nature of offices or situations appointment to which is made subject to limited competition under sub-section (3) of this section.</P>
      <P>(6)  For the purposes of this section, the Irish Railway Clearing House shall be deemed to be a railway company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to secure that the principle of open competition will operate in filling all vacancies in the clerical grades in the railway. The principle of open competition is a well recognised and generally accepted <Col N="1390" /> one, and there is no necessity to use arguments in support of it at this time of the day.  It was, and is, the practice of most of the largest companies at present to have these vacancies filled by competitive examinations, and this amendment is intended to provide that that practice would apply in the case of the new amalgamated company and in other companies left outside it.  Provision is made whereby regulations governing the examination should be made by the railway company. There is a further provision in sub-section (3) of the amendment making provision whereby a certain percentage of the places may be reserved under the regulations to be made by the companies, limited competition amongst servants in the employment of the companies or their children.  I am sure that the Minister will have no difficulty in accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the principle of this amendment, but I would like to indicate to the Deputy that he has not made provision for exceptional appointments such as those in the case of experts.  In many cases these will enter into the service of the new company considerably above the age at which men generally start first in such service.  It may, for instance, be desired to transfer a good man from some company not in Saorstát Eireann at all.  No provision is made here for such appointments. I think there is just a little difficulty, too, in calling in the Railway Council and the Central Wages Board. I agree with the principle of competitive examination and the reservation of a percentage of places for the relatives of men already in the service.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy O'Connell has met Deputy Alton on that point, and that the amendment <Col N="1391" /> has reference merely to clerical grades. So far as the amendment is concerned the principle of competitive examination may be, and is, accepted.  This question of the reservation of a certain percentage of vacancies for the relatives of employees in the service may cause considerable difficulty, and I would have to consider it.  Sub-section (5) refers to the Central Wages Board and the Irish Railway Wages Board, and I must resist that on the ground, as already stated when these bodies were mentioned previously, that they are not permanent bodies so far as statute goes, and they include people for whom we cannot and should not attempt to legislate. The idea of competitive examination is acceptable, and consideration will be given to the question of retaining a certain number of vacancies for employees.  I am not ready to say now that that is accepted.  The appeal to these two bodies, the Railway Wages Board and the Central Wages Board, is not possible.  If the Deputy would leave it in that stage for further consideration on Report I will meet him.</P>

      <P>It is not of very great importance in connection with this particular matter, but so far as sub-section (3) is concerned I think it is a reasonable proposal. There is nothing mandatory about it; it only says that the railway company may make this reservation. It is not unusual in public services such as the post office and others to have a certain proportion of appointments kept for people already in the service by promotion to certain posts.  Likewise it is quite a usual procedure in certain services that the children of people in the service should have a special privilege.  This is, as I say, not mandatory and the percentage is the maximum one, and I think the Minister will find that it will be quite a satisfactory regulation to have embodied in this amendment.  I do not press sub-section (5) of the amendment in view of what happened previously.</P>

      <P>Nobody would have <Col N="1392" /> the hardihood to get up here and say that the competitive examination system was not the best way to fill positions generally, but I think a certain amounts of latitude should be allowed in so far as competitive examinations do not always provide the very best men. In the case of a board surely they might have a limited selection for discretion. We all know that many men who can pass examinations brilliantly may not be good for anything else except for passing examinations.  It is hard to say that it is always the best men who are got by competitive examination. I confess that I do not see that there is any better system, but I think that a little discretionary power should be allowed to fill positions of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point it may happen that sometimes through the system of open competition you get men to pass examinations who will not be good for anything else.  The system has been tried, and it has so far been found to be the best system.  It is the system which applies to all Government services, and, as is suggested, regulations governing the examination may be made so that, so far as it is possible to do so, the best type of candidate will be got and the best appointments will be made in that way.  If you have a system of nomination by a board of directors it is bound to lead to dissatisfaction, and in any case to allegations of favouritism, even though such favouritism does not exist.  I have heard such allegations repeatedly in services such as the Bank, where nomination is necessary.  I think that on the whole you cannot get a more satisfactory system than that of open public competition, even though it may have some of the drawbacks to which Deputy Hewat refers.</P>

      <P>I should, I suppose, speak on this, but I would feel rather like a murderer defending his crimes, as I have taken part in so many of them myself at both ends.  I quite agree with Deputy O'Connell that we have no other system which will give the public confidence.  I am in favour of this suggestion of reservation of a number of places, and of a limited competitive examination to be reserved for <Col N="1393" /> the relatives of employees.  I think it will make for efficiency and will encourage the employees to work better for the company.  A boy brought up in the atmosphere of a railway is likely to learn a lot of things at an early age that will be useful to him later on in his career.  There is another point which Deputy O'Connell may have overlooked when proposing this competitive examination, and that is that he probably intended that it should be coupled with a medical examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Davin I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 55 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Not later than one year after the coming into operation of the amalgamation scheme in accordance with this Act, the amalgamated company shall prepare and submit to the trade unions representing railway employees a scheme for the establishment on a contributory membership and actuarial basis of a new Superannuation Fund for the benefit of any persons or classes of persons who may be from time to time employed by the amalgamated company, other than classes of persons employed in the clerical and supervisory grades of its service who are eligible for membership of the Railway <Col N="1394" /> Clearing System Superannuation Fund Corporation.</P>
    <P>(2)  A scheme for the establishment of a Superannuation Fund prepared under this section shall provide for the representatives of the members of the Fund sharing in the management thereof.</P>
    <P>The clerical and supervisory grades have already schemes of superannuation, but there is a demand very widespread throughout the railway services in those companies which have not any superannuation scheme that some such scheme should be instituted, contributory by the employees.  The proposal in this amendment is that it shall be an obligation on the company to prepare such a scheme, submit it to the unions, and presumably discuss the whole question with the union representing the employees, with a view to its general adoption.  It was not thought desirable to import into the Bill a fixed scheme.  That would be quite impossible, for the suggestion in this amendment is that the duties shall be imposed upon the company to prepare such a scheme in association and in conference with the employees, and to do that within a year.  There is a very general desire on the part of railway employees of all sections that some such scheme of this kind should be adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal of a contributory scheme would not be unfavourably considered by the company. As far as I understand the position, the proposals were put forward, but on the actuarial figures the cost was considered too high by the staff of the railway company.  To embody in this Bill compulsory proposals for a scheme, the outlines of which have not been agreed on or even are not practicable, seems to be rather reckless.  Of course, Deputy Johnson speaks with greater certainty on the question, but I do not think from my experience that it would be easy to get a voluntary agreement amongst employees for any scheme on a contributory basis.  I have made various attempts in that direction but I have found many, young men especially, show great disinclination to join any such scheme.  If you saddle the <Col N="1395" /> older men on to a scheme of that sort it immediately becomes impossible as regards cost.  I venture to suggest there would be a great deal of difficulty in getting the employees of the railway as a whole to agree to any such scheme on a contributory basis.  There would be bound to be great difference of opinion and, at all events, without some figures before them, I think to put a compulsory section like this in a Bill would be a mistake.  After this Bill is passed there is nothing to prevent the company on the one hand and the employees on the other from coming together and forming a scheme outside the Bill altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is to get a scheme which is sound from the actuaries' point of view and practical from the point of view of the company, and particularly the men.  It is pretty doubtful if such a scheme could be agreed within a year after the coming into operation of the amalgamation scheme, because that would be a year in which the future finances of the undertaking will not be quite clear. This task to be put on the amalgamated company for the period of that year would be very burthensome.  The amendment as proposed here is also unlimited as far as the personnel goes. &ldquo;For the benefit of any persons or classes of people who may from time to time be employed with,&rdquo; certain exceptions stated.  There is no objection to a fund except to get it sound actuarially and practicable and if the Deputy would be content with the acceptance in principle of the putting an obligation on the company to produce a scheme, without stating definitely this year, or without stating it so widely to be for the benefit of persons or classes of persons I would agree. You might indicate, in so far as it is possible, that it should be brought in within the year.  I do not think it would be right to tie them to that period of one year, particularly the year after the passing through of the amalgamated scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the period I quite see that there is some reason perhaps against fixing one year. That period, perhaps, might be extended. <Col N="1396" /> Nevertheless, there should be a period fixed if there is to be an obligation upon the companies.  As to the scope of the scheme, I do not see the point of the Minister's objection, because if he has in mind temporary employees, for instance, it is not going to do the scheme any harm, and it is not going to do the fund any harm.  If they have to contribute for a period, and they are no longer employed, the fund benefits and they do not.  If it is a fear that the older persons might be excluded, I have no doubt that any such scheme would have to take into account the age, and in any case the scheme itself, while we suggest that it should include all persons from time to time employed, would make provision for these exceptional cases that the Minister seems to fear.  The reason why it is desirable to put in an all-embracing phrase of that kind is to ensure that the various classes of employees will be brought within the scope of such a proposal.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Hewat has said, I have had representations from very wide areas, indeed from people from all parts of the country and from all grades of railway employees, on this question. The proposal is one that I am not particularly enthusiastic about, but the railwaymen, being a very conservative and law-abiding body of men, desire that they shall be placed in this position, and that provision shall be made for their old age.  As I have said, they are a very conservative body of men. They want to be made secure, and they are anxious to contribute to that security. I think myself it would be an improvement on the Bill to put in a clause of this kind.  I would like it to be stronger, and it would satisfy the men better if it were more definite.  Frankly, I will admit it has not been possible to frame a section which would be more definite and would give satisfaction, but if the Minister will agree to the general proposal, with the alteration that the period might be longer than one year, on the ground that he states that the first twelve months will be a rather crowded period, I would have no objection.  I think that any section of the kind should be one which will include all grades of railway employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The next question that <Col N="1397" /> arises on this matter is, what is the amount of the contribution that would be chargeable on the railway companies, and who is going to pay it?  You have got this amalgamated company on a certain basis and this contributory proposal is extremely vague. When it is worked out it is certainly going to cost the railway companies a good bit of money.  I do not object to that, but what is the amount that it is going to cost the amalgamated company? I would like to know who is going to pay it, because it is either a question of increased rates bearing it or it will have to come out of the profit and loss account of the railway company. I do not want to put a spoke in the very conciliatory attitude of the Minister towards this proposal from my friends on the opposite benches, but in this matter I think he is biting off a little bit more than he can chew in some directions.  I just want to point out that, not with any idea of opposing this scheme, because I realise that a large body, such as the railway servants, would be in a far better position to carry on a scheme of that kind than a small body composed of comparatively few people.  At the same time this proposal is a very far-reaching one, and I think we ought to know more about what it is going to cost and how it is going to operate before it is put in as a provision in the Bill as it now stands.  I know that a great grievance with railway servants has been that after a lifetime of service they get no pension.  That seems to be a very great grievance, and I have no hesitation in stating that, but at the same time this provision on a contributory basis raises very large questions&mdash;that is to say, to compel men who do not want to join this scheme to pay into it. For instance, in connection with the banks, they have a contributory scheme.  It works all right, but it is a compulsory scheme.  A great many bankers, in the early years of their service at any rate, resent very much the deductions that are made from their salaries.  Of course, they may appreciate the scheme a good deal when they get older, and when, I am sure, they derive some benefits from it.  But at all events the proposition put forward here is a very big one.</P>

      <P>The only thing I have in mind is the difficulty of preparing a scheme which, as I say, will be sound from the actuaries' point of view, and would be practicable mainly from the point of view of the men. Deputations of men have come to me on this particular point.  They have stated that the men are in agreement and will contribute at what even appears to be an extravagant rate.  It is well, of course, to point out that a scheme has never yet been put before me in detail of which could be said after examination that it was sound and that the men had actually considered the contribution.  I can well believe that while the men in general may say &ldquo;We will agree to a scheme of this sort or of that, and are agreeable to pay even a fairly heavy rate of contributions,&rdquo; they may adopt a different attitude altogether when an actual matter of fact proposition is put before them, and when deductions are going to be made from their wages as a result of that.  The amendment I intend to bring in on Report Stage will be limited to producing a scheme.  There is no question of making this scheme compulsory. As far as this amendment <Col N="1399" /> goes it will have to be a matter of agreement, and I presume it is a matter of agreement between us now.</P>

      <P>So far as the public safety is concerned, the Minister, actually, has the right to appear, and he has the power, if necessary, to appear, so that, as far as that stage of the amendment goes, it is unnecessary. But the question that the Minister should be the judge as to what is in the interests of trade, or of the locality would, in my opinion, place the Minister in a very unfortunate position, leaving it to him to judge what is the public interest.  There is a right to representation, before the tribunal, to those interested, and to traders or those associated with a particular locality, and it would be for them to make a case, and not for the Minister. So far as the public safety is concerned the Minister has power, and it will not be necessary for him to interfere.</P>

      <P>The Minister has <Col N="1400" /> forgotten the words &ldquo;or the interests of the public.&rdquo;  I think it would not be difficult to imagine circumstances where no private person would come forward to appear before the tribunal, when somebody ought to appear to initiate an action before the tribunal. The obvious person to appear in the interests of the public is the Minister. It does not say that the Minister must, any time anybody else shall come forward, himself come forward, and have the right to appear specifically.  The interests of the public, however, are so general often that there is no specific body who will take the matter in hands, and the Minister is, therefore, the obvious authority to seek, to be heard by the tribunal.</P>

      <P>The point that Deputy Johnson has stressed is a point where I said the Minister has already the necessary powers.  For instance, as one of the many sections which gives the Minister power even in this Bill, I refer to section 18 (3), which says that the Minister shall be entitled to appear at hearings upon any proceedings before the tribunal; and at various places throughout the Bill it is provided he is entitled to be at the hearing, and has that power conferred on him, and occasion is taken to ensure that the Minister will have every power where the public interest is concerned to appear before the tribunal.  So that from that point of view I say that it is unnecessary to make this addition.  Provision has already been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The section the Minister has referred to I do not think is as definite as is required: &ldquo;The Minister shall be entitled to appear and to be heard at any proceedings before the tribunal.&rdquo;  That assumes proceedings have been initiated and the tribunal is hearing a case of an application and it gives the Minister the right to intervene in such a case.  I think a little more than that is required and that, in this section 55, which refers to the applications of any body of persons it is the initiation of proceedings before the tribunal.  Now, the earlier section that the Minister referred to rather suggests that the Minister may intervene in a case which has <Col N="1401" /> already been initiated and which is being heard.  I want to give the Minister power to initiate proceedings before the tribunal in the public interest and I am doubtful whether in the Bill there are framed such powers.</P>

      <P>The point made by Deputy Johnson in reference to 18 (3) to which I referred does seem to put a limitation upon the Minister if proceedings should have to be initiated, but when the proceedings are initiated Deputy Johnson will agree that the Minister has power to come in.  With regard to this section it surely lies mainly with the interest concerned to make representations to the tribunal. It is incumbent on them to take steps to intervene, and it seems to be rather accepting or taking for granted a thing which is not likely, that people interested in certain matters will not appear.  I think it is an unreasonable proposition to put upon the Minister the necessity of engaging extra officials to keep an eye on all matters that might arise before the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that is not involved in this at all.  It is not suggested that by the insertion of these words the Minister would have to have somebody always looking after proceedings. As a matter of fact that, if it follows at all, follows from 18 (3) which says that the Minister shall be entitled to appear, but only in proceedings which have been initiated.  It might fairly be assumed that that would impose upon the Minister the obligation to have somebody watching proceedings.  I am not suggesting that it does, but if he has not already that obligation imposed upon him, it will not be imposed upon him by this amendment.  Let me draw attention to the phraseology of this section &ldquo;with a view to securing and promoting the public safety or the interests of the public.&rdquo;  The Minister says he has already power to intervene when a question of public safety arises or the interests of the public or of trade or any particular localities.  No doubt in trade matters people interested will apply to be heard, will initiate, or any particular locality will apply for a hearing, but who is to safeguard the interests of the public?  The Minister <Col N="1402" /> himself has inserted that phrase, &ldquo;the interest of the public,&rdquo; and surely the Minister is the person concerned with the interests of the public, and obviously, if the interests of the public are to be in his own hands, he ought to have equal rights with trade to apply to the tribunal to be heard in those interests.  Now, it may be argued that without inserting these words that any person interested has a right to initiate an application.  The object of the amendment is to make it quite definite that he has the right and not to leave the matter open.  I ask him is it not true to say that it is his primary duty to safeguard the interests of the public and to initiate applications in that respect?</P>

      <P>I would not like to see the Minister taking up the position that Deputy Johnson wants him to take up in this matter.  The outside public would be properly represented by public bodies, and it seems to me that if the Minister is going to intervene in the tribunal in connection with every Tom, Dick and Harry who comes along, and says he has got a grievance, he is going to occupy a more grandmotherly position than he already occupies in the Bill.  I should say that it would be really courting disaster for the Minister himself to agree to it; and I suggest that the particular cases that Deputy Johnson has referred to&mdash;those undemocratic bodies like the municipalities and the Port and Docks Board &mdash;might, very properly, take charge of the poor wanderer in the street, who has nobody else to represent him.</P>

The Bill provides that &ldquo;the railway tribunal . . . . . . may require the amalgamated company or any other railway company . . . . . . to afford such reasonable railway services, facilities and conveniences upon and in connection with its undertaking (including the provision of such minor alterations and extensions and improvements of existing works as will <Col N="1403" /> not involve in any one case an expenditure exceeding ten thousand pounds) ....&rdquo;  This amendment proposes to reduce this maximum to five thousand pounds.  I confess I can do little more than formally move this amendment.  Deputy Bryan Cooper has not left me the arguments with which he would urge it or the eloquence with which he would embellish it.

      <P>This amendment, which stands in the name of Deputy Corish, has some relationship to an earlier amendment, and it is intended to impose upon the company the necessity of conforming to arrangements to prevent uneconomic working.  The guarantee that is given might possibly &mdash;Deputy Hewat, if he were here, would agree with me in this&mdash;mean somnolence to the company if they can arrange to plead before a tribunal and secure such rates as will enable them to pay their dividend, without any active movement towards more economic working, they may do so, and the twenty per cent. provision, passed earlier, may seem not to be quite enough for them.  They may argue that way and this amendment is designed to give <Col N="1404" /> some kind of supervision, and it suggests that they should conform to arrangements for the prevention of uneconomic working.  I do not think there should be any objection to this.</P>

      <P>I have simply to point out that Section 52, upon which the adjustment of charges to revenue depends, is based upon efficient and economical working and management. The whole basis of the standard charges is efficient and economical working.  It is quite unnecessary to have the phrase repeated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point, of course, is that there is no direct control.  It is left to the company, and somebody has to prove before the tribunal that efficient and economical working of the company has been carried out.  The Minister, a moment ago, declined to take powers to go before the tribunal, and he has left to private interests to prove before the tribunal that the company is not being worked efficiently and economically.  There is a reference in one of these clauses&mdash;I think it is 52 &mdash;which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The standard charges . . . .  shall be such as will . . . . in the opinion of the railway tribunal so far as practicable yield with efficient and economical working and management an annual net revenue . . . .&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But the interests of the existing stockholders have all to be taken account of, and, inasmuch as there is no means of securing, except by the railway tribunal, that this efficient and economical working is being carried through, it is desirable that somebody should be able to initiate before the tribunal, and, having initiated, prove before the tribunal that there is uneconomical working. That is one of the reasons why we moved that it was desirable that the Minister should have power to apply to that tribunal.  Now, we are left in the position that unless the tribunal itself is able to find out and initiate an inquiry, on its own account, other interests not being prepared to do so, the railway company itself is to be the judge of the economical working.</P>

Definitely on that point the Minister has leave to intervene on his own initiative and to bring before the tribunal such matters as he may think relevant to this particular matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The real difficulty about this section and the real reason why such an amendment as this is required, are found in the first proviso that certain things may be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that if on any such application a company satisfies the railway <Col N="1406" /> tribunal that under all the circumstances the capital required for the purpose cannot be provided or expended as proposed without prejudicially affecting the interests of the then existing stockholders, the Order shall not be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That question as to whether any new expenditure which is required in the public interest is going to prejudicially affect the interests of the then existing stockholders seems to weaken the whole section, and requires some amendment such as this which has been put down in the name of Deputy Corish, because these interests of existing stockholders may be such that it may be said that the extra 20 per cent., for instance, has to be reckoned as their interests, and that you cannot impose on the company an obligation to undertake certain new works or afford reasonable railway facilities or services because they might prejudicially affect the interests of existing stockholders. It is very often the case, and I am sure Deputy Hewat will recognise this, that it is more beneficial to existing stockholders not to give new services. It is more profitable very often to give a 75 per cent. service than 100 per cent. service, and if any proposal for securing the public interests which might involve new works, and a case is being made before the tribunal that such new works should be entered upon if the company can plead that this would prejudicially affect the interests of existing stockholders then the order shall not be made.  I suggest that there you find the necessity of having to impose the requirement that the company shall conform to arrangements for the prevention of uneconomic working. Otherwise the interests of existing stockholders will nullify the effect of this whole section.  I think it is quite an important matter, and I would urge upon the Minister that he has not in these other sections the power to deal with that in view of this proviso in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Johnson is quite right, but the remedy is the one I have advocated, to scrap the Bill. Of course, we might get into an argument as to the value of this amendment, but I would rather get into an <Col N="1407" /> argument as to the value of the Bill itself, as being simpler than the amendment. The whole thing is bound up here, and it is, in my judgment, an impossible state of affairs.  You have got the amalgamated company formed, and I am blessed if I know what they are there for.  I have not been able to find it out.  You have got a tribunal that is all powerful, and this clause refers to the tribunal questions about whether the company is working on economic grounds or whether it is working on uneconomic grounds.  If the company is called upon to spend money by the tribunal, obviously there will be a battle royal between the tribunal and the company as to whether the tribunal <Col N="1408" /> is justified on calling on it to spend money.  The battle will be as to whether the directors of the company as representing the stockholders have carried out their supposed duties of running the railways on economic lines or whether they have been defaulters in that respect.  I hope that the very limited number of members who are sitting on this Committee will read, mark and inwardly digest the whole question.  If they come to the conclusion&mdash;the Government lambs, or our own particular sections&mdash;that the thing is not going to work out in favour of the public I hope they will make their convictions vocal when we come to consider the final stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Possibly worse, unless somebody can intervene and persuade the tribunal that the interest of the shareholders shall not be prejudicially affected.  This proposal is carried over from the British Act, but it met with a good deal of opposition from the agricultural and trading interests, at least a good many of them opposed this proviso because of its reactionary effect, and because it gave too much protection to the interest of the shareholders against the interests of the trading public.  The amendment is going a very long way; it at least helps to protect the trading public, and it enables the tribunal to say that the financial position of the company would not be prejudiced by this new expenditure, or by the improvements that are sought for.  The existing stockholders and their interests are safeguarded thoroughly, and the premium is paid upon the easy going board in the proviso that is in the Bill.  The amendment, I suggest, makes an improvement upon that, and allows the tribunal to insist on those improvements in services, provided that the new capital expenditure that may be required would not be such as would seriously prejudice the financial position of the company.  I suggest that the real purpose of the Minister would be accomplished by the amendment, whereas the existing stockholders are the only people benefited by the proviso in the Bill, and that benefit may be secured to the stockholders to the prejudice of the interest of the trading public.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to add in line 28 after the word &ldquo;facilities&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and on any such application the railway tribunal shall have due regard to the provisions of Section 29 of this Act which for the purposes of this section shall be deemed to apply to any proceedings thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This deals with the protection of ports. As I have exhausted all my eloquence without any effect on the Minister on that subject, unless some other member of the Committee has got some eloquence that might have some effect, I think I will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>This amendment is quite unnecessary.  Section 29, which is referred to in the amendment, protects the ports to the fullest, and there is no necessity for bringing in a reference to Section 29 to the tribunal, when the tribunal would definitely have the section before them.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 55 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 56.</P>
      <P>(1)  For enabling a railway company to effect alterations, extensions, and improvements of existing works in pursuance of an order of the railway tribunal or of the Minister, the Minister may, after compliance with the provisions of this section, authorise the railway company to acquire the land and easements and to construct the works necessary to effect the alterations, extensions, and improvements aforesaid.</P>
      <P>(2)  Before an order is made under this section the railway company shall deposit with the Minister such plans, specifications, and other documents as shall be required by the Minister, and after the deposit of such documents the Minister shall give public notice, in such manner as he may consider best adapted for informing persons likely to be affected by the order, of his intention to consider the making thereof and of the manner in which and the time within which representations and objections in respect of the order may be made, and shall, if he shall consider it expedient so to do, cause a public inquiry to be held in regard to any matter relating to the making of such order.</P>
      <P>(3)  An order made under this section may&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  incorporate the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, with the modification that the expression &ldquo;public authority&rdquo; shall include the said railway company, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>  the Lands Clauses Acts, so far as the same are not inconsistent with <Col N="1413" /> the said Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
    <P>(4)  No order shall be made under this section in respect of any matter which the Minister is of opinion, as a result of representations made to him or the report of the person holding a public inquiry, or otherwise, is of such a character or magnitude that it ought not to be proceeded with without the authority of the Oireachtas obtained by way of private Bill.</P>

      <P>The amendment in my name reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (4), after the word &ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; a proviso in the following words: &ldquo;Provided that nothing contained in this section shall authorise either of the amalgamated companies at any time to acquire by compulsory powers any part of lands or premises in the possession or occupation of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, or of which they are owners.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask the leave of the Committee to amend this by substituting &ldquo;amalgamated company&rdquo; for &ldquo;either of the amalgamated companies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Leave to amend amendment granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the amendment in the amended form. The Port and Docks Board is elected on a democratic franchise, and is a very estimable body carrying on valuable public work.  In my judgment it is a much more important body than the amalgamated company.  To give power to the lesser to acquire the greater does not seem to be quite desirable legislation.  The Board owns property in and around the Port of Dublin, and the acquisition of certain lands by the amalgamated company would affect detrimentally their control over the Port in its beneficent working for the public good.  I base my amendment on the great public importance of the Port and Docks Board to the community.  Their services in the past have been very great, and in the future will be of still greater value. To allow the amalgamated company to interfere with their operations will not be desirable.</P>

      <P>There is nothing sacrosanct about the Port and Docks Board or their property, and they are simply placed on a footing here with any other company.  Provision is made for the hearing of objections and representations to be made by the objecting party.  After these representations have been made, if the tribunal considers that a case has been made out for the acquisition of land belonging to the Board, then that land is going to be acquired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat has raised a rather important question, and I would like to ask the Minister whether that general question was not secured in sub-section (4), which seems to prevent the acquisition of land without the ordinary procedure.</P>

      <P>Except, of course, it be of such &ldquo;a character or magnitude.&rdquo;  If it be of such character or magnitude that seems to require private Bill legislation that would be the procedure, and I suppose the Port and Docks Board are specially safeguarded by that.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 56 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 57.</P>
      <P>(1)  Any agreement which may hereafter be entered into for the purchase, lease, or working by the amalgamated company of any part of the system of another railway company may, subject to the provisions of this section and after such notices and inquiries as the Minister shall consider necessary or expedient, be confirmed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>(2)  No such agreement as aforesaid shall, without the authority of the Oireachtas, be valid or effectual unless and until it is confirmed by the Minister under this section, but if and when so confirmed shall be of full force and validity and may be carried into effect by the parties thereto without any further authorisation by the Oireachtas.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> (3)  No agreement shall be confirmed by the Minister under this section which, in his opinion, is of such a character or magnitude that it ought not to be proceeded with without the authority of the Oireachtas obtained by way of private Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a stage at which I think we could very reasonably call a halt.  If Deputies will look at the amendment paper they will see that several amendments stand in the name of Deputy Duggan.  These represent a further consideration that has been given to Section 58 as it stands, and the conclusions arrived at as the result of such consideration.  Even with the amendments proposed it is found that the section is not satisfactory, and it is proposed to have a new section submitted to the House substituting it for this section.  I propose to have this amendment in the hands of Deputies early tomorrow. It would read this way:</P>
      <P>In Section 58&mdash;Delete sub-sections (1) and (2) and substitute therefor the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Nothing in this Act shall prejudice or affect the rights or liabilities of any amalgamating or absorbed company under any agreement or arrangement (being an agreement or arrangement not confirmed by nor scheduled to a statutory enactment) in existence at the passing of this Act except in so far as the same are inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, but from and after the passing of this Act it shall not be lawful for any amalgamating or absorbed company or for the amalgamated company to vary or rescind any agreement or arrangement (being an agreement or arrangement not confirmed <Col N="1416" /> by nor scheduled to a statutory enactment) with any other railway company or other transport undertaking for the allocation or routing of traffic or the pooling of receipts or for differential rates on traffic passing by sea to or from Saorstát Eireann or to enter into agreements for any of those purposes except in so far as may be authorised or required by an Order made with due regard to the provisions of this Act by the railway tribunal on the application of any party to such agreement or arrangement or of a representative body of traders or of a body of persons representative of trade or a locality.</P>

      <P>The object of the new amendment will be to include all arrangements or agreements which are cut out from Section 29 in its proposed form, and it seeks to provide that these agreements or arrangements shall be continued without prejudice or without being affected, and that the variation or recision of these may be got on foot of an order of the railway tribunal after representation has been made.  I propose that we adjourn at this point.  I move to report progress.</P>
