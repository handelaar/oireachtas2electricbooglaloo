      <P>asked the President if he is aware that considerable confusion exists as to the steps necessary for the recovery of guns taken by the R.I.C. in the pre-truce period; whether he would formulate detailed instructions to guide the public in the matter and thus relieve Deputies of a considerable burden.</P>

      <P>Persons who surrendered arms and ammunition to the authorities under the British regime should address their applications for the return of their property to the Chief Ordnance Officer, Island Bridge Barracks, Dublin.  He will take all the necessary steps in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that they would have a little more to do than that.  I fear that what has happened is this, that very large quantities of munitions are there.  Some of them can be identified by tags and so on and some of them, I think, will be very difficult to identify, but, as far as Deputies are concerned, the most satisfactory way is to get application made to the officer at Island Bridge Barracks, and every effort will be made to expedite their return.  I do not mean that the Deputy should infer <Col N="490" /> from that that they will be returned without delay, but I do wish to give the information that that is the most satisfactory way at present for dealing with the matter.</P>

I will, however, have the Deputy's suggestion carefully examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Medical Officer of the hospital reported to the Board of Health that Mary McMahon fell ill on the 5th December, 1923.  He reported subsequently that she was discharged from hospital and given a week's leave to return to duty on the 28th January, 1924.  Consequently she would appear to have been away from work for a period of about seven weeks.  I have no information at present to show whether she was or was not paid during that period, or whether she was maintained in the hospital at the expense of the rates.</P>
      <P>The insurance of employees of the Board of Health is primarily a matter for the Board.  I would suggest that all employees who are not appointed permanently to pensionable posts should be insured.</P>

      <P>I beg to ask the President a question of which I have given private notice&mdash;If his attention has been called to a statement made in the British House of Commons, that it is the intention of the British Government to introduce legislation to guarantee the principal and interest of the Irish Free State Bonds in connection with the completion of land purchase in the Irish Free State; if the Executive Council is in any way party to these proposals, or if any protest has been made against the proposal to legislate in the British Parliament in respect to the financial obligations of Saorstát Eireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the intention of the British Government to introduce legislation to guarantee the principal and interest of the Bonds issued by the Government of the Irish Free State in connection with the completion of land purchase.  This legislation carries out an undertaking given to the representatives of the landlords some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> The Executive Council agrees to the proposed legislation in England, and a Bill shall be introduced to deal with our side of the matter very shortly.</P>
    <P>This undertaking is considered necessary by the vendors under our Land Act, and was, I understand, one of the main reasons for their acceptance of the terms of the Land Act passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not subscribe to that.  Our liability in respect of these Bonds will not be different from our liability in respect to the payment of the annuities due under the £130,000,000, or so, advanced up to this, and it simply places the vendors, under the recent Land Act, in exactly the same position, so far as security is concerned, as those who sold their property under the 1903 Act and the 1909 Act.  In any case the proposal will come before the Oireachtas here, and it is open to them to reject it if they think fit; but the Government is simply carrying out the obligation which they believe is due to the vendors under the recent Land Act.</P>

We cannot possibly apply ourselves properly to the arguments we wish to put forward. The Minister in this amendment is changing the whole scheme of the resolution to which we assented.  We were asked to assent to the taxation of black and green bottles.  Now we are asked to assent to the taxation of all sorts of bottles.  We cannot be experts, and we should have an opportunity to consult people in the trade, who are interested, as to what the effect of the amendment will be.

    <P>That this Dáil hereby approves of the Railway and Canal (Compensation) <Col N="506" /> Commission Order, 1924, made on the twenty-third day of Aprils-1924, by the Executive Council, under Section 7 of the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922 (No. 2 of 1922), and laid before this Dáil on the 6th day of May, 1924.&mdash;(Minister for Lands and Agriculture).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion of the Minister is that the Dáil approves of the Railway and Canal (Compensation) Commission Order.  I requested that there should be a little delay before finally agreeing to this resolution, so that we might have time to understand its import.  I am not going to disagree with the resolution, but I think it my duty to inform the Dáil of the result of my reading of the Minister's explanation and to ask the Dáil to pass this resolution with a full understanding of what it implies.  Certain lands were taken over by compulsion.  It was decided that a Commission, called the Railway and Canal Commission, should determine the amount to be paid in compensation for the compulsory acquisition of those lands.  It is now desired that a Railway and Canal (Compensation) Commission should be set up to determine the amount of compensation to be paid for the compulsory acquisition of those lands.  It is intended that the Executive Council, which was indirectly responsible for the acquisition of these lands, shall be the body which is to appoint the Commission which will determine the amount of compensation.  Following precedent, as related by the Minister himself, it may well happen that the personnel of the previous body, or some such personnel, will be taken.  The personnel of the previous body was, the Executive Head of the Ministry of Home Affairs (Mr. Friel) and the Executive Head of the Ministry of Local Government (Mr. McCarron).  If that precedent is followed, then we shall have two officers of Departments to determine the amount that the State is to pay as compensation for the compulsory acquisition of the land.  I support the motion, and I hope Deputies will support it and realise that they are making a very valuable precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's point, as far as I can follow it, is that the particular people who are to form the Commission and to decide the compensation&mdash;he does not deny that some compensation should be given even to owners of land&mdash;are to be appointed by the Executive Council.  I think that is a thoroughly reasonable and practical way of appointing them, and I only make one point.  He referred to a previous Commission, which also exercised functions under this Act, and he repeated what I stated here on the last occasion, and previously when I was moving the necessary resolution some months ago, that the previous Commission was composed of the Executive Heads of the Ministries of Local Government and Home Affairs. The Deputy rather conveyed to me the impression that the Executive Heads of the Ministries of Local Government and Home Affairs were not exactly the proper persons to say what compensation should be paid to owners of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is rather missing the point.  The point is not that the particular officers mentioned may not be the proper persons, but that Departmental officers who are obviously direct servants of the State, which is the authority that has to pay the money, are not likely in the minds of the persons who own the land to be right persons to assess compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting more information on this question after every debate or during the course of every debate.  It was never suggested that Departmental officers should form this Commission.  Departmental officers formed the last Commission merely to extend the time to do something which was almost automatic.  It does not follow at all that the same officers are to form this Commission.  Possibly the same officers may be left there, and people who would know more about the price of land added.  I can assure the Dáil that the Executive Council will probably ask the advice of the Ministry of Agriculture, and that the <Col N="508" /> endeavour will be&mdash;whether we succeed or not&mdash;to put men on that Commission who will be able to do the work they are expected to do.</P>

      <P>This is a case of the rushing of business.  I would really appeal to the President to ask the <Col N="509" /> Minister for Finance if it is not possible to take these resolutions on Tuesday. My papers are ten miles away.  I got the Order Paper at 9 o'clock this morning.  I had to be at a Government Committee at 10 o'clock, and had to leave my house at 9.15 a.m.  In the interval I had not time to read the Order Paper.  I have not the resolutions with me, but it is not fair to ask the Dáil to do business under these conditions unless there is going to be a serious loss to the revenue.  If this entailed a serious loss to the revenue I would not press the matter, but as it is a protective duty and as the Minister did not express the hope of getting much revenue from it, I think he ought not to ask us to go on with this now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be unreasonable to the Dáil in any way. If I were allowed to explain perhaps the Deputy would be in a better position to judge of the line of action he would take.  There is no intention of changing the effect of the first resolution, but we find that this word &ldquo;coloured&rdquo; is an exceedingly difficult one to describe.  There is general talk of black bottles and black glass, but that really seems to me as almost any colour of glass.  There is no intention that ordinary clear bottles, whether you call them white flint glass, or whatever they may be called, shall be taxed. There is no intention of taxing any but what are called in the trade dark metal bottles, the sort of bottles that are being made here and used really for beer or porter.  When we have the words &ldquo;glass coloured green or black&rdquo; it might be said some bottles are really coloured yellow or brown, and should be let in without duty. That is why we are putting in this new formula.  Between the Report Stage of the resolution and the introduction of the Finance Bill we will be able to go further into this matter of a definition and provide the exceptions that may be necessary from the general resolution and achieve the effect we are aiming at.  For instance, I propose certain concessions in regard to canned fruit, but I have not been able to get the form of words yet.  I propose that a form of words shall be put into the Finance Bill, and that any <Col N="510" /> duty overcharged should be refunded. In the same way in the case of bottles this resolution in the form in which I am now proposing it will be wider than we intended, and when we get a satisfactory form of words they will be put into a Finance Bill, and any duty overcharged will be repaid.  It is felt that owing to the vagueness that exists on the question of colour, and as the duty is due to be collected next Monday, it would be better if I had a wide resolution that would enable us to collect the duty on all sorts of beer, wines and spirits bottles.  We have to put in some words to exempt clear bottles.  We will get some phraseology to exempt them, and any duty overcharged will be returned.  The reason I am pressing the matter is simply that the duty comes into effect on Monday, and the wording of the original resolution is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>What I am suggesting now is not really the final wording, but it is the wording that will, at any rate, enable us to collect the duty which it is desired should be collected on bottles.  It is really only a drafting amendment to enable us to do what was intended to be done.  I understand that it is quite common that financial resolutions are somewhat wider in their scope than in the ultimate law that is passed. Exemptions and other special provisions are put in a Financial Bill, which restrict the somewhat too wide scope which the original resolutions may have had.  That is the reason that I suggest to Deputy Cooper that perhaps he might hear my explanation of the proposed amendment.  I do not want to rush the Dáil at all.  As a matter of fact, if there is really serious objection to this particular resolution and the amendment to it being taken to-day, we would not like to persist.  I suggest that this will enable us to do something which will not be irrevocable or irreparable, and there is no intention of extending the scope of what was originally passed, and it might, perhaps, be allowed to be dealt with to-day.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he has consulted, before this resolution was put before the House, experts on these <Col N="511" /> matters.  I objected to the wording of the original resolution, and afterwards I consulted certain people interested in the matter, and I promised to let them know what the amendment of the Minister would be as soon as it was before us.  I have been out this morning since before 9 o'clock, and I came here at 12, and I never saw the amendments, so that personally I should like to object, because I have not had time to read them.  I do not like to raise an objection, but I think it is rather a serious matter that amendments which have been in our hands only this morning should now be discussed.  We had promised to consult certain people as to whether these amendments would meet with their approval.  I do not want to press the matter, but I think Deputy Cooper deserves support in objecting to this matter being rushed. I think that the Minister will remember that the very evening on which these resolutions were discussed he asked us not to talk too much about them, and stated that he would give us an opportunity later to discuss the amendments.  He pressed on us not to keep up the discussion too long in order to allow the resolutions to be carried. I would like to have all these postponed if possible.  I will not press my objection, but I think there is a good deal in what Deputy Cooper has said.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance is the last Minister in the Dáil to whom I would like to offer any objection, as he is invariably courteous and anxious to meet us; but I am not satisfied with his explanation.  One reason is that it must raise many matters which are contentious.  He tells us that he is not going to tax white bottles, but he puts in his resolution that he is going to tax certain classes of bottles.  I do not know whether the Minister is an authority on spirits, but gin is invariably bottled in white glass bottles, and so is Jameson's whiskey. We ought to have time to consider what the amendment would mean.  My second point is that we cannot consider this amendment without considering Deputy Johnson's two amendments. We would be forced to commit ourselves in the matter, and both amendments are contentious.  The Minister <Col N="512" /> will be forcing us to come to a decision on these points without consideration. He tells us that these are his second thoughts, and that this is not necessarily the final form.  The Minister suggests that his first thoughts were bad, but that in the Finance Act he is going to give us the final form.  What reason have we to trust the Minister's second thoughts any more than his first?  If he was wrong in the first instance he might be wrong again.  I am afraid I must make it as difficult as I can for the Minister to pass his resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection arises from a different source.  The Minister is limiting his powers, and though he assures Deputy Cooper that there are such things as rebates or refunds if too much is taken off under the resolution from what is allowed in the Act, the proposal in the amendment of the Minister is to limit his power to tax bottles.  He now suggests that he should only be allowed to tax bottles used for bottling wine, beer, and spirits.  Under the old description bottles used for the bottling of mineral waters would come under the description. It may be that it is not the most accurate description, but nine out of ten mineral water bottles used in Ireland are green, however pale, and under the resolution which was passed earlier in Committee, these bottles would come under the duty.  Now it is proposed to limit the duty upon these glass bottles used for bottling beer, wine, and spirits.  It seems now to be the Minister's intention to delete from classification what are commonly known as mineral water bottles, but we have not been told whether that is the intention.  I do not want to argue the case at the moment, but it would be far better to have a wide classification under the resolution than a narrow one, if it is finally decided that mineral water bottles shall come under the duties.</P>

      <P>I think that the discussion that has taken place so far has shown that the settlement of this question of colour cannot be done off-hand. What Deputy Johnson has said about mineral water bottles is quite true. I take it that the foundation of this charge on bottles is to shut out bottles that are not, but can be, made <Col N="513" /> here.  Mineral water bottles used to be used very largely here, and whether you call them green, white, or blue, they seem to come under the protection clause.  It is not a simple matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I stated when the original resolution was proposed that it was not the intention to include clear bottles, but what is roughly termed black bottles.  It was not the intention at any time to include mineral water bottles.  There is, for instance, an export trade in mineral waters, and serious difficulties would arise in respect of that trade if mineral water bottles were included.  One of the difficulties that has arisen is that there is this pale green tinge in some of these bottles which might bring them within the terms of the original resolution.  What I have now suggested will, at any rate, exclude that particular type of bottle, and will indicate more clearly what we are actually trying to achieve.  I was inclined to put in &ldquo;glass bottles except white flint glass bottles,&rdquo; but when you come to deal with experts, to whom Deputy Craig referred, it is difficult to get anything final.  One contradicts the other. One would eliminate certain bottles and one would tell you differently, and it is extremely difficult to get over this question of colour.  I am reluctant to press for consideration of this matter to-day, but I feel there will be certain administrative difficulties if it is not considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is worse than the experts.  The experts contradict each other, the Minister contradicts himself.  He says it is not his intention to tax mineral water bottles. Does the Minister drink ginger ale? Does he know that Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale is enclosed in bottles which resemble wine bottles, and so will be liable to be taxed.  The whole <Col N="514" /> thing is complicated, and we are not doing ourselves justice to discuss it on the spur of the moment.  I think it was Napoleon who said that difficulties existed to be surmounted.  That would be a good motto for the Government when it is dealing with the boundary question. I think it is wrong that we should commit ourselves to a formula which has not been thought out and which presents an extraordinary number of loopholes for criticism.  As I say there is one particular case of mineral water bottles which will come under this.  There is the case of peculiarly-shaped bottles.  I do not know whether liqueurs are included.  Liqueurs have a certain trade mark, and they are peculiarly-shaped bottles.  For instance, you have Benedictine and Quantreau.  Even though liqueurs are spirits, I do not know what the Treasury definition is. Jameson's whiskey is put up in bottles of a certain shape. I do not know whether those bottles will be taxed, and I do not know whether they are produced in this country. Those are all matters we should give some consideration to.  I admit I am not making as strong a case as I should like to make.  I am at a distinct disadvantage.  I have, practically speaking, to think those things out on my feet.  I protest emphatically.  The Dáil is not doing itself justice, and the Minister for Finance, swayed by Departmental influences to smooth their way, is not fair to the Dáil.  He is not personally unfair; he never is, but he allows the Departmental point of view to rush this thing on us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy knows that all those resolutions have to be embodied in the Finance Bill. That will go through five different stages in the Dáil, and there will be a good deal more opportunity for considering it.  I might be accused of rushing this particular resolution, but I am not going to rush any of the other resolutions, or attempt to rush them or urge the Dáil to take them more quickly than it would be otherwise inclined to take them.  If this particular resolution is passed, the only serious thing it would do is to eliminate things like mineral water bottles, which were not intended to be included, but which Deputy Johnson thought were intended <Col N="515" /> to be included.  That would amount to a change of substance from his point of view, but otherwise it would not. When some formula that we can stand over will be found to include those pale green bottles and absolutely clear bottles, we will put that in the Finance Bill.  We found when we went to the people in the trade that it was almost impossible to get definite views or opinions from them.  There was the uttermost confusion in advice as to the definition.  There is only a limited time in which we can deal with this matter at this stage.  The resolution to be effective must be reported within ten sitting days of the Dáil from the time it is first brought forward, so, to some extent, the report stage will be rushed. There will then be twenty days of the Dáil before the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, and there will be a considerable time before the Committee Stage, so that we will have an opportunity to deal with all the difficulties that are involved.</P>

We have listened to objections, and certainly there does not seem to be a general opinion in favour of going on.  I would like to hear his decision.  There is a good deal in what Deputy Cooper says in regard to the necessity of altering it at a subsequent date and even if this altered resolution will have subsequently to be altered, as evidenced by some of the illustrations given by Deputy Cooper, <Col N="516" /> I suggest it would be a far better thing not to take it now, but to yield to the pressure of the members here, and to bring it forward at a later date.</P>

That being so, I think we should consider the resolution at the present moment, and I think the Dáil should take the word of the Minister for Finance, that if serious objections are raised by anyone affected they will get a rebate, so that they will not be at any loss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes's point misses the case that was made&mdash; the phrase in the resolution &ldquo;without amendment&rdquo; allows the Minister to draw a tax from all bottles imported which may come under the classification of black or green.  If at a later stage, we limit that classification, there may be a refund made, but if we do not levy the duty according to the classification of the unamended resolution and we amend it in this limited way the Minister now proposes, there will be nothing to refund, and he will have lost some revenue.  I am very anxious that the Minister should keep up the revenue, and I am now helping him to get a few pounds.  I have amendments here, which, if this is persisted in, will require to be discussed, but the proposal I would suggest is that the Minister should act upon the resolution already adopted in Committee, have that resolution reported to the Dáil, and then let there be amendments made in the Finance Bill.</P>

It is that while the word &ldquo;black&rdquo; is a very loose word in the trade, covering all sorts of bottles that are not just clear bottles, there might be some difficulty for the Customs authorities to act upon it, because there are bottles that might better be described as an amber colour rather than black.</P>

It is pretty definitely public knowledge that certain arrangements for an amalgamation scheme and for provisional schemes have already gone very far forward, and no objections have been raised by the companies concerned to this date.

That gives a very short period for the carrying out of the necessary work.  In any case, it does seem to me to be fixing dates that are, to say the least, rushing the matter very much.  Of course, that may be resented by the Ministry on the lines that they are going to put the Bill through in the shortest possible time, and make the changes as quickly as possible.  On the other hand I do think that the date that is put in, the 31st July, 1924, is rather earlier than the date that should be put into it.  I have already said that I am not going to obstruct the Bill in any way, and as far as I am concerned, I do not expect that I will call for divisions on very many of the amendments that stand in my name, but assuming that those amendments go through the ordinary procedure a very considerable portion of the time would be occupied in passing the Bill.

      <P>The amendment, to my mind, would be reasonable, and might be sustainable if the circumstances were not what they are.  The circumstances are that an agreement was almost reached between, certainly, one of the amalgamating companies and the one that is outside.  There was a point in dispute&mdash;these disputes usually occur between business men. The man on one side says: &ldquo;My interest in this particular concern is worth so much&mdash;x£'s.&rdquo;  The man on the other side, who is purchasing, says: &ldquo;Your interest is only worth 90 per cent. of &mdash;x£'s.&rdquo;  It is not a matter in <Col N="520" /> which very grave considerations have got to be judged.  The negotiations had got to a point where, as far as I know, very little remained to be settled, and if the scheme be not hastened to some extent there will be disadvantages. Every advantage is taken of delays in this matter, and the real fruits and the real advantages are needed now more than at any other time.  Deputies know that the reduction in profits&mdash;which, I suppose, is the shortest way to put a serious economic situation&mdash;necessitates an immediate change in our railway system, and unless the Dáil were informed as to the difficulties which would take time to solve and as to the delays that are inevitable, I do not see that there is a case for the acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I take it that Amendment 20 is to delete the reference to the Railway Tribunal and there are consequential amendments in the name of Deputy Hewat to the number of 13 which, I think, aim at amending the Bill, so that the Railway Tribunal will not appear.

      <P>Yes.  I am afraid that I want a lot more practice than I have got up to the present as a Parliamentarian to follow all these documents.  I am down for proposing this amendment. <Col N="522" /> As you have said, A Chinn Comhairle, the amendment aims at reconsidering this question of the Railway Tribunal.  The amendment proposes that a scheme shall be brought before the Dáil and discussed.  The Bill provides for referring the matter to the Railway Tribunal.  The creation of this Railway Tribunal means the setting up of a body and in this particular case the same body is to carry out two separate functions, or at least what I claim are two separate functions. In other words, the Railway Tribunal, when formed, will, I think, take unto itself all the various questions that arise in connection with the administration of the railways. But is it right that the same body should have anything to do with the various railway amalgamation schemes?  Would it not be better that those should come before the Dáil and be considered by the Dáil, as a whole. Obviously it would be desirable that the fixing of the various schemes&mdash;the payment to be made and all that sort of thing&mdash;should be done by a separate body, and that that body should disappear when that particular part of the work is done.  It does not follow that the same men who would compose the Railway Tribunal would be in any way the best men to consider the scheme or to value the scheme.  The amendment objects to the clause as it stands and proposes to substitute the words set out.  I move that the amendment be accepted.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to delete &ldquo;tribunal.&rdquo; But it does a great deal more than that, as I will show in a moment.  It substitutes for &ldquo;Tribunal&rdquo;&ldquo;Minister,&rdquo; with a proviso that if it appears to him that certain preliminary matters have been complied with the scheme shall be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas and have full statutory force, unless objected to.  It is for the Dáil to consider how far it is desirable for both Houses of the Oireachtas to consider the technical details, that will have to come up in connection with the amalgamation schemes.  Further than that, there is no provision in this amendment as to what is to happen in the event of the Minister finding that the requirements preliminary to submission <Col N="523" /> have not been complied with. Further than that again, if both Houses of the Oireachtas object, the amendment states: &ldquo;It shall be open to the companies parties to the scheme to submit a new or amended scheme framed in accordance&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;&ldquo;It shall be open&rdquo;: that is to say, there is no finality about it, no compulsion on the railway companies: a new scheme can be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and if objected to the matter lapses. The amendment in its effect would be to delay the whole arrangements to be set up in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat hardly suggests or could reasonably suggest, as the amendment does, that all the financial arrangements in connection with the setting up of the amalgamated companies should be left to the companies as such to determine and decide between themselves.  If that was the position it would be very easy, and I am sure that they would take advantage of the opportunity for the present shareholders to make a very good deal between themselves to dispose of their shares on the Stock market, and then find they had sold to people who would be in a very false position if the grouping had been set up.  I think it is very necessary that sufficient powers should be given to the Tribunal to see that the financial arrangements, capitalisation and everything else, should be very carefully looked into, because if you examine the position which occurred in England as a result of the British Railway Act you will find you can benefit by the very sad experience which some people had there as a result of the failure on the part of the Government to examine the financial arrangements of these schemes in a proper and satisfactory <Col N="524" /> way.  Deputy Hewat has not said, of course, that they should have a freedom which would enable them to do that.  Assuming that the capitalisation of the amalgamated company was too high, it would be quite possible that the shareholders of the amalgamated company would come along and say that they had not sufficient powers to earn what was a sufficient dividend. That would be a very undesirable thing so far as the farming community would be concerned.  It would prevent any relief in regard to the rates, and might mean an increase of the rates.  Deputy Hewat should tell the Dáil that such powers would be in the hands of the amalgamated company to do these things.  What is the justification for the amendment?  He has not said that that is likely to happen, but it may if there is not sufficient powers to examine all these things by the Government or a Tribunal, such as is suggested in the Bill?  Does Deputy Hewat also mean in the amendment to suggest, as I think he does, that there should be no control whatever over the question of rates, a control which the Tribunal is given in the Bill?  If so, there is nobody who would have any effective control over the new company as representing the interests of the community as a whole.  I doubt if Deputy Hewat, as a representative of the business interests, could from that point of view press this amendment.</P>

      <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy Davin, of course you have to recognise that these amendments hang one with another.  My original objection to the Bill was an objection to the Tribunal as well as to the Bill itself, but the Bill having reached this stage, I admit that the Tribunal is necessary, and I am not carrying my objections to the Tribunal to that extreme length at all.  But I would have preferred that the whole thing should be voluntary, or that any grouping scheme should be voluntary and that therefore that internal arrangements would be made for carrying on the business.  Of course, with the defeat of my original amendment for grouping the concerns, my attitude is altered, but in this particular case of the Tribunal I say that the <Col N="525" /> Tribunal should be confined to work in connection with administration of railways, in laying down original schemes with a different personnel from the personnel which I hope will be permanent, as things are going now.  A different personnel would probably be better for the work than the personnel that would be best for the Tribunal as a standing body of appeal.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat really means to say that he desires to withdraw the amendment, because I think he will realise that what he is doing is asking the Dáil to agree with him on this occasion, to deny everything he has ever said hitherto about bureaucracy.  The railway companies are to propose a scheme and Deputy Hewat objects to an independent tribunal examining that scheme, relating not merely to railway companies, but to the public interests, the trading interest in general; and he prefers that the Minister should examine the scheme and if he approves simply pass it on to the Dáil to lie for 21 days.  That is a new doctrine by Deputy Hewat; bureaucracy <i>in excelsis</i> is proposed by Deputy Hewat in this amendment.  I would have thought that the Minister should not be asked to set apart one of his officers to examine schemes in addition to all that officer's other duties but that it would have met the desires of the commercial community better to have the schemes examined by a Tribunal composed of three persons, such as is designated in the Bill, to examine them in relation to all the many requirements of the trading public that Deputy Hewat professes to speak for and the other public who are not amongst Deputy Hewat's constituents.  I think that the scheme in the Bill is better than the amendment, and I imagine that Deputy Hewat has not realised that with the failure of his previous amendments this one also ought to have fallen.</P>

      <P>I want some information on this.  The amalgamated companies, may, on or before the 31st of July, 1924, submit to the Minister a scheme or schemes framed in accordance with the provisions of this Act. I want to know from the President if it is the intention of the Government if an agreed scheme is submitted that that scheme must be accepted by the Government as agreed by the people outside, without any careful examination by the Tribunal or the Minister.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin's suggestion is an important one.  It is that this section may read that if the tribunal is satisfied that the forms of the Act have been complied with, and that the procedure preliminary to the submission of an agreed scheme have been complied with, then the tribunal shall confirm the scheme.  They are not to be required to consider the merits of the scheme.  They are not to be required to consider whether the scheme does conform to the common interests or not; all that they are required to do is to decide whether the forms and the procedure have been complied with.  I submit that that is not enough, that the tribunal should be required to report on the scheme on its merits, to decide whether there are any public interests detrimentally affected by the scheme, to decide whether there are any agreements between the companies involved <Col N="527" /> in the scheme so submitted which may be detrimental to the public interests, and I think, this mandatory provision to Section 2, that the tribunal shall confirm any such scheme provided it has complied with the procedure, is rather too strong, that it should not be mandatory, and that they should have power to report and point out the defects from the point of view of public interest.  I think the section would require reconsideration, having that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It may require reconsideration, but not in the public interests.  It would perhaps require consideration if one were of opinion that the stockholders or shareholders, or other persons interested in the value of one of the amalgamated companies were not getting due consideration in the reorganisation, amalgamation, or unification of the various companies. Only to that extent.  So far as the public interest is concerned, the public interest is safeguarded by reason of the average of the three years' expenses. If, for example, one were to say that the relative values of W, X, Y and Z was a fourth of the total £27,000,000, but that the proportions were not increased, that the relative values of the particular companies joined, and that by reason of that a company's stock-holders had their interests so looked after that their proportion or ratio in respect of the £27,000,000 was greater than what it should be, then to that extent only the interests of the shareholders of that company who were given greater consideration than the interests of the other three companies would be a matter for the directors in the first instance, and for the stock-holders in the second.  The public interests are safeguarded absolutely if you limit the actual amount that they are entitled to earn by the three years' average.  The public interest is not in any way interfered with by reason of this section.  If stockholders or other persons think their interests are not sufficiently safeguarded we would be prepared, if the Dáil think it is desirable, to have it the subject of a special clause.  Personally, I do not think it is desirable.  I am satisfied, from my meetings with the directors of <Col N="528" /> the various companies, that the interests of the stockholders are being very well looked after by the directors.</P>

      <P>It is quite possible, as I have previously stated, that at a later date the amalgamated company may come to the tribunal and say that their powers are not sufficient to earn a reasonable dividend, with the result that you will have to meet that situation either by a reduction in the wages of the employees, or an increase in the existing rates.  I suggest that is in the public interests, and that the capitalisation of the amalgamated company, whether it is agreed or not, should be the first concern and the serious consideration of the railway tribunal.</P>

      <P>I fail to appreciate the points that have been made. The facts are that any issue of stock obviously will not be of the value of the sum set down&mdash;£27,000,000.  I should say it would be very much less than that, but whatever the sum is the real thing that concerns the public interest is the amount of money that this new body is to be allowed to earn.  That is limited by reason of the ratio of the three years' average.  The next question is if the new company has a nominal capital of £20,000,000, each of the companies to be amalgamated or absorbed, as the case may be, will seek to get a proportion of that.  We will suppose for a moment that one of them gets twice what he is supposed to get; it has no effect whatever on the amount of money the whole concern is entitled to earn.  It is not a matter of the preservation of the rights of public interests but, rather, if it should so happen that the stock-holders or share-holders <Col N="529" /> of a concern did not get due consideration, it is the concern of the stockholders or the shareholders only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this whole matter will come up again.  The Minister has failed to see that if certain arrangements are made regarding capitalisation of companies the way is made for an agitation in three or four years' time.  A poor mouth will be made by the shareholders to show how they are only getting so much per cent.  They bought stock and it is returning only so much per cent. &ldquo;How can we afford to do this, and how can we afford to do that.  We are receiving only so much on our capital investments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The thing has been done.  It is not something entirely new.  It is not supposition. It has in fact been done under a similar scheme, of which this is a copy, and the public interests of the future have to be safeguarded from the attack of an innumerable, or at least very many railway shareholders, in ten years' time.  They will be liable to the plea that the money that they invested in railway stock in 1924-5 is only returning them so much, and they will plead: &ldquo;You must allow us to charge a higher rate for our services and charge a higher rate for our goods or reduce wages,&rdquo; or do this or that or the other thing.  In a general way, if procedure only is to be the consideration that the railway tribunal has to take into account, then the position of the companies is secured, and the public interest may be very detrimentally affected.  I suggest that as a matter of fact there are schemes already in the pigeon holes waiting, and if they have followed the lines of some of the British companies they are just re-adjusting the method of capitalisation so as to prepare the way for a future agitation. The present companies will be benefited and future shareholders will then find themselves in difficulties and they will come to the tribunal and they will come to the Dáil and ask for consideration because of the fact that they were taken in. in 1924 and 1925.</P>

If it is put to me that there is danger of an agitation starting in one year, two years, or three, five or ten years, I am afraid it is beyond the limits of the possibility of this Oireachtas to prevent that.  I would direct the Deputy's attention to Clause 4, sub-section (d), which I think makes the thing even more water-tight than I have described it.  I have certainly failed to grasp the force of the case that is being made as to any infirmity that there is in this section.

There might be a fair case made in this way.  Take the case of persons who invested money in a railway company that was not a success.  They put their money into the company in good faith, and let us take it the business of the country developed to such an extent that they would have a claim for consideration.

      <P>Under the scheme of the Great Western group in England, the Minister forgets that the Great Western Company of England has been able to do things which the companies in Ireland are quite well able to copy, and the Bill that is now before us is in very many of its clauses word for word copied from the British Act, and in this clause the companies put their fingers into the eyes of the British <Col N="531" /> public and the British legislature and took advantage of the loophole in the Act.  The Great Western group decreased its nominal capital under the capitalisation scheme by £14,000,000, but by its manipulation it actually increased its fixed annual charges by £91,000.  Now, adopt that method and you will undoubtedly give the company, or the shareholders of the company, an opportunity to say that the scheme which was presented was agreed to, and having agreed to that scheme, the Railway Tribunal and the Dáil have a right to take into account the circumstances of the time the scheme was accepted.  And when they come to make what is a fair charge they would say that that should have to be taken into account.  When there are proposals for reducing the charges upon public rates, etc., the cry will come: &ldquo;We are only getting so and so from our invested capital,&rdquo; which, following the example from the British grouping, would be increased by the manipulation of the capitalisation scheme which was not examined and must not be examined because of the forms we followed.  The Tribunal is practically, under this section, precluded from considering anything else but the procedure.  If the procedure has been followed accurately, then the Tribunal is bound to pass this scheme. I say that is a defect that should be looked into before we arrive at Section 7, and I hope it will be.  I hope the Minister will consider the desirability on Report, if this section is passed in its present form, of altering it so that the powers of the Tribunal will be to consider the whole of the scheme of capitalisation or any matter relating to the proposed amalgamation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years 1901 and 1902, during the Boer War, £87,000 were advanced when the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Company endeavoured to raise a sum of £100,000, by the issue of 4 per cent. guaranteed stock, in connection <Col N="534" /> with the carrying out of the New Ross and Waterford extension, which had been commenced in the year 1899. Only £13,000 of this issue was taken up in Dublin, leaving £87,000 unsubscribed. Unless this balance was forthcoming there was no alternative but that the project should be wholly or partially suspended, if not altogether abandoned. The L.N.W.R. Company came to the assistance of the D.W. and W. Railway Company, and took up the entire balance of the issue, £87,000.</P>
    <P>The £126,800 represents 1,268 £100 shares of the G.S. and W. Railway Company, which were taken under the following circumstances: In 1872 it was found essential, in the interests of the country, to provide railway communication between the Great Southern and Western Railway and the North Wall. By the G.S. and W. Railway Act of that year that company was empowered to make its North Wall Extension from Kingsbridge.  By the same Act, amended by the L.N.W. Railway Act of 1877, the L.N.W.R. were empowered to advance monies to enable this project to be carried out.  In all they advanced a sum of £126,800.  All these monies were advanced by the L.N.W.R., now the L.M.S., to independent Irish railway companies in the interests of the trade of the country.  It is now proposed that these independent companies should be swallowed up in an amalgamated company, losing their separate identities, and it is not unreasonable that the L.M.S. should ask that the monies subscribed by them should be refunded.</P>

      <P>This is the most extraordinary proposition I have ever heard.  On behalf of whom is this proposal put forward?  Is it on behalf of the Port and Docks Board, which I observe recently has evidenced a remarkable improvement?  The people of Ireland are, as you know, a peaceful people, evidence to the contrary occasionally notwithstanding.  But if there is one particular spot in Ireland that was not a peaceful spot, judging from the reports we read in the newspapers, the assembly-room of the Dublin Port and Docks Board is certainly that particular place.  But an extraordinary change has come over the personnel of <Col N="535" /> that body.  They are now a lot of cooing doves, one to the other, and they have all joined up in an attack on this particular measure.  All past differences, all past disputes, and all past abuses between sections of that body are now composed.  This, indeed, has been a most remarkable Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a most remarkable Bill.  It was never intended that it would produce such a result as I have indicated.  That fact alone shows the immense potentialities of it. The proposition before us is that a railway company, not of this country, is to get treatment different and superior to any national railway in this country.  We have a proposal here by which a Company is to get par value in respect of an investment made in 1901 and 1902, and the citizens of Dublin or of the country who subscribed the £13,000 to make up the £100,000 are denied the same right and privilege.  As I am not in the confidence of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, I do not know whether this particular proposal is put down at the suggestion of the L.M.S.  We may suppose it is.  If it is, there is a claim made here in respect of investments made by them, to give them a cash value, that is apparently denied other people.</P>
      <P>Examining the proposal further we find that a sum of something like £300,000 is to be made good because, apparently, there is a discount upon its present value when the words par value are being put into the clause with regard to repayment.  Apparently the present value of this is not what the face value of it would indicate.  The thing we are endeavouring to do with regard to railways is to put them on a sound basis, to check their work, to have what we will call a supervisory body over their receipts and expenditure, and to see that the trade of this country will have a fair chance.  Now, this new company is to be burdened with an amount apparently in excess of the cash value of the particular assets in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="536" /> I would like to know the reasons for this proposal, other than the reasons that have been read out, because I am certain I could go around the country and get shareholders in the D.S.E.R. Company who paid par price for securities at present at a discount of 70 to 80 on the market.  I could get those people, smaller investors, and people to whom a loss of this sort is greater than to a gigantic corporation like the L.M.S.  I suppose I could be accused, with some degree of certainty, of having a certain little business knowledge. If an investment is made by a corporation, a wealthy, well-managed, well-conducted business corporation outside of this country, in something in this country, certain results are anticipated and certain advantages must be anticipated. If there were any results or advantages by reason of these particular investments, have we anything to put on the other side of the account so far as this proposal is concerned?  I think the Dáil is entitled to know why, if this be preferential treatment, it should be given to a wealthy corporation. If it be not preferential treatment, why is the motion put down?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment, which is a new paragraph.  I may say that it is for the same purpose, because an agreement already exists between the various Railway Companies.  In 1870, at the <Col N="538" /> time of the loan to the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway, it was enacted that while any money should remain due to the London and North Western Company by the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Company that the English Company should have power to appoint one of the Directors to the Irish Company.  This principle was again adopted in respect of the £100,000 loan authorised in 1905, and in the agreement to the Schedule of the London and North Western Railway Act in 1905 the right of the English. Company to have a Director on the Board of the Irish Company was specially provided for.  The object of the amendment which I have put down is to preserve the right of the L. M. &amp; S. to nominate a Director so long as any portion of the above-mentioned moneys remains unpaid.  I do not think it is unreasonable to say that they should have a Director to see what way their £187,000 is being spent.</P>

E. R. to continue to apply to the new amalgamated company.  If we were to accept the reason put forward by Deputy Byrne for his amendment, other groups holding charges against the amalgamated undertaking could claim the right to appoint a Director.

      <P>I would like also that the Minister should consider the suggestion contained in the amendment for reasons quite different from those given by Deputy Byrne in moving the amendment.  I think that the existence and continuance of a through rate system and the harmonious arrangements in connection with anything of that kind will depend upon the amount of co-operation and agreement that will exist and remain between the English Companies, whether the Great Western or the Midland and Scottish, and the Irish Companies.  I think it would be very injurious that anything should happen that would prevent a continuance of such arrangements, and I think the Government should consider very seriously, if they are not prepared to give way to the amendment which I support for other reasons than those advanced by Deputy Byrne, how best they can frame a Railway Tribunal or the general panel in connection with that Tribunal, so that existing arrangements in connection with the working of through rates should be continued us harmoniously as possible.  The development of the trade of the country possibly depends on the continuance and existence of these through rates, and I think nothing should be said or done in the Bill that would injure the traders of this country in keeping up the good relations that have hitherto existed in connection with the working of the through rate system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment from a different point of view to any that has so far been advanced. We had here in this country a good deal of what we may call British capital invested.  I think it is the desire that in the future we should encourage the investment of British capital.  In connection with that investment, especially of large sums of capital, it is very often a qualification that a Director should be attached to the particular industry in which this large capital is invested.  If that qualification were not admitted, the probability is that the capital would not have followed.  Now, from that point of view I would like to ask the Minister to consider this aspect of the question very carefully, because we are all <Col N="540" /> anxious that industries should be developed, whether with Irish capital or with British capital.  It is a usual qualification, where British capital is invested, that directorships of this character should follow, and hence I think we should be slow to set up any principle whereby such an appointment would be lightly set aside.  Here, it may not appear possibly a very important matter, but the principle may follow, that is to say, whatever we adopt with regard to the principle in this particular case, capitalists on the other side may naturally say, &ldquo;Well, we can get the qualification all right now but we do not know how soon this Free State Government will wipe out that right.&rdquo; That is an aspect of the question that I would ask the President to consider very carefully before he decides on doing away with this right that attaches to the capital invested in this particular Company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not considered this matter very exhaustively but we have been in communication with a very important representative of the London, Midland and Scottish Company, and we have asked what guarantee they required, but we have not got particulars supplied to us. I suppose we would be entitled to expect that we would get them.  The capital of the Dublin and South Eastern is approximately 3½ millions. There are probably seven directors, so that each director might be said to represent half a million pounds worth of property.  In this particular case the London, Midland and Scottish got a representative on the Board in respect of&mdash;if the figures submitted by Deputy Alfred Byrne are correct&mdash;something like £187,000.  Therefore the representation is far in excess of the interests or of the money subscribed in that particular form.  If we take the further figure, that is in regard to this matter of the North Wall extension, and one has to stretch one's memory very far back to go that distance, it would appear that the total interests, accepting the figures as correct, of the Midland and Scottish Company in the Dublin and South Eastern Company and the Gt. Southern and Western Company would total somewhere about £300,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not quite completed my statement.  The Deputy did not show me sufficient consideration. In the proposal, so far as this particular unification scheme is concerned, the number of directors in the unified company is to be not less than 12 and not more than 15.  Assuming it to be 15, if if you divide 15 into £27,000,000 you will get something like £1,600,000.  I see that Deputy Good acquiesces in that figure.  Now, the proposal in this amendment is to give representation for a sum of £300,000 to a director from an outside company, but as far as the citizens of this State are concerned each director is to represent £1,600,000.  I put it in all fairness that that is an extravagant demand to make on the face of it, judging it on sound business principles. If I were, for example, to consult Deputy Good in regard to his business and say I am going into it with one-hundredth part of the capital, and you have got to give me a seat on the Board; there are not less than 12 and not more than 15 directors on the Board and I am bringing in money in the proportion of one pound for every hundred that you have invested, I know the answer he would give me.  It would be polite, but it would be a very definite one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to say that.  I would have to take into account the value of the £128,000 lent in 1870.  That is point one.  I would not say that was worth more than two per cent. now.  Then I would have to take point two: that a sum of £187,000 was lent between 1901 and 1902.  Very few businesses paid more than 3½ per cent. at that time.  Certain gilt-edged securities scarcely realised more than that. The other sum, lent in 1905, probably went up one quarter per cent., and at that time was worth three and three <Col N="542" /> quarter per cent., so that all round one could write down the whole of these sums by nearly fifty per cent., or certainly 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the market value of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway property has not stood high in recent years, certainly not in my recollection, but I may be wrong. In order to use the argument with the force that the President would attach to it we would want to know the full value of the capital.  For instance, for the investment of this sum of money they got the par value of the security.  These securities at the time might have been purchased in the market at 25 per cent. of their par value, so that instead of investing in that way they had purchased in the market they might have got four times the value at which the investment stands to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument could be dealt with in more ways than one.  Would a company like the London, Midland and Scottish come in with this money purely for philanthropic purposes? Obviously there was some development anticipated for their business, some increase in traffic was anticipated by them in this particular investment.  Apart altogether from such matters as the Deputy cited, if we were investing the money we would not anticipate anything more than dividends unless we were living in Gorey or in Wexford, where probably one would get a voucher to come to Dublin to hear the affairs of the company discussed and to see the sights of the city.  Now the point is that there is a claim made in respect of a sum of money of the nominal value of £312,000 for the same rights and privileges that would attach to an investment of £1,600,000.  I do not know, and I do not want to anticipate who should constitute the board of the new company. Supposing for a moment that the Dublin and South Eastern were entitled to two seats on the board, and that is on the face of it, according to the figures I have read, a generous assumption in respect of that company, then all the shareholders other than those who hold this particular £300,000 in <Col N="543" /> that form are represented by one director, and the London, Midland and Scottish, in respect of their £300,000, would get the other seat.  I do not know that the London, Midland and Scottish themselves would put up such a case as that, and I cannot for my part see that a case has been made in respect of this particular representation.  The demand has not been served on us, and in the circumstances I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. ALTON Mr. ALTON">

      <P>I am still bothering about the equity of the matter.  I agree with the President that the representation of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway should be two-sevenths, but I do not know how to realise such a thing.  The fact that we cannot have two-sevenths of a director on the new Board does not wash out the claim.  The claim is a real thing. It seems like this to me, that I might owe a man half-a-crown and refuse to pay him because I said it was my principle to pay in pounds.  The President is a very just man and I think he will admit this claim, which is a real one. I am not pleading on behalf of the railway company or anyone else, but in the interests of what I consider to be equity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the argument he used in regard to the D.S.E. Co. What do we find?  If I were in Deputy Byrne's place probably I could use other arguments than those I am now going to use.  The capital of the Irish railways, as shown in the Report of the Railway Commission, is £46,856,324.  In connection with all the <Col N="544" /> Irish railway companies we have approximately 270 Directors.  That, I think, puts a different complexion altogether on the amount of share capital which is represented by a Director of the Dublin and South Eastern, as compared with a division of the share capital that I have referred to over the 270 Directors that have hitherto controlled the Irish railways.  I do not know whether that is an argument which would have any influence with the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a short personal explanation. When I was taking of £27,000,000 of capital I was talking of a certain sum, and I was contemplating that each one of the concerns which would be joined together would have a right to claim representation in respect of its nominal capital or of its cash value, if we were to take cash value.  But I do not want to have it inferred from that, that if we were to take, say, the Lartigue Railway, on which there may possibly have been three directors, that the value of that divided by three should qualify for membership of the Board in the new unified scheme.  I did not intend that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I would not, under any circumstances, argue on the same lines as Deputies Good, Hewat, or Byrne.  I do not admit that the qualification for directorship of a business concern, especially in the case of an essential public service like a railway, should be based on the amount of shares a person holds in the company.  It should be a different qualification altogether&mdash; namely, his ability to carry out the work for which he was elected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not admit the other argument at all.  Therefore, it is for quite a different reason that I think this amendment deserves the serious consideration of the Government&mdash;I do not exactly say that I am supporting it.  Deputy Good has stated that nothing should be done to prevent the investment of capital by British or other people in the development of Free State industries.  I contend that if <Col N="545" /> capital is to come from other countries &mdash;if Irishmen are not patriotic enough to realise the capital they have invested in Great Britain, and put it into industries in this country&mdash;any capital that is imported for the development of Irish industries must be controlled to a certain extent, and perhaps to a great extent, by the Free State.  But we are faced with this proposition&mdash;and it is just as well that we should take the facts into consideration&mdash;that the greater amount of the traffic carried out of and into this country at present is carried by shipping companies that are controlled by British railway companies. While that state of affairs exists, or until we are in a position to raise our own merchant service, I think that the claims of the people who have money invested should get some kind of consideration so long as their working arrangements suit the convenience of the people here, and, particularly, accommodate the traders here, and help to develop the country.  It is for these reasons I say that the question might be seriously considered, as to whether the amendment can be accepted, and, if not, as to what representation can be given to these companies on the general panel that may be set up in connection with the Bill, so as to see that the harmonious working arrangement in connection with the through rate system, which exists at present, is continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Davin did not give expression to these views when we were considering this Bill at an earlier date.  The Deputy is probably aware that this Bill gives particular rights to railway companies and the cross-Channel steamers attached to railway companies.  If he is not fully aware of that, I think before we are done with this Bill he will possibly get some information on the point that will remove any doubt he may have on the subject.  As to the other point, the President has been good enough to go two-sevenths of the way with us in connection with the amendment.  It is only a matter now of the other five-sevenths. As I said before, there is a sort of moral obligation attaching to us in connection with this matter.  This particular sum of money was advanced on the understanding that it would carry a <Col N="546" /> directorship of the undertaking concerned. That is a moral obligation. What I am afraid of is, that if we retain the capital and attempt to remove by Act of Parliament the obligation, it may be construed in a wrong sense on the other side and may prevent that free movement of capital into this country that some of us would desire to take place.  I ask the President if he would not weigh this point to see if he could not go the other five-sevenths in connection with this matter and not give an opening to people, who are possibly inclined to decry the Free State and warn those who have capital on the other side, and who may be willing to invest it, against the wisdom of doing so in view of what happened to them. All things concerned, I would press the President to make a special effort in this particular instance so that nothing may prevent, what we might call, the industrial development of the Free State in future.</P>

The very terms of this Bill, I think, practically preclude the appointment of a Director to the amalgamated concern just because he was a Director of the other.  I quite agree with the equity of the proposal, and I am quite sure it is based on sound commercial law, but at the same time I do not think it is possible to carry it out.</P>

      <P>In spite of the difference of opinion between the business representatives, speaking as a non-business man, I would urge the President to consider this point.  I know he will do so if he has not done it already.  I think there is something in this.  I am sorry to say that I am not in agreement with the business men.  I feel that Deputy Davin has expressed my view better than Deputy Hewat.  I urge the President to look into the matter and not to hastily decide to refuse the amendment.  Perhaps he will consider it again on the Report Stage, or that something might be done in the meantime. On the face of it I admit that the L. M. S. Railway hardly have a case for <Col N="547" /> a director on the new Board.  They have a claim and I do not see how we can meet that claim by simply striking it out.</P>

Here is £300,000 and there are £27,000,000.  On the face of that there is certainly likely to be some apprehension on the part of business men in this State that their interests are overlooked and that other people's interests are safeguarded. There is that danger.  I will consider the matter before the next stage, but in my present frame of mind, unless Deputy Good smiles more affably at me, I would not be inclined to accept it.</P>

      <P>I should have thought that this amendment was consequential and would have been dropped.  The Dáil has already defeated an amendment to delay the completion of the amalgamation scheme until 1925.  This provides that although we are going to have an amalgamation scheme in 1924 that an absorption scheme may be delayed until the 31st July, 1925.  I think that is very definitely consequential on the defeat of the other amendment.</P>

      <P>I think a certain distinction must be drawn between amalgamation and absorption.  I have discussed this matter with the Ceann Comhairle and he was of opinion that it was not consequential.  I think the two things are different, and that although the amendment to delay the date of amalgamation has been defeated still it is permissible to move this one and give the companies&mdash;if the amendment is carried&mdash;a longer time to put forward a scheme of their <Col N="549" /> own.  That was the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, and therefore this and the following amendments are in order.</P>

      <P>I think that even the greatest optimist does not expect to see the scheme completed by the 31st July next, not even the Minister, who, I am sure, has more experience than I have, as the Bill has to pass through, another House after leaving the Dáil.  Though its progress in the other House may not take as long as it did in the Dáil, from what I know there will be some amendments there. After the scheme has passed and becomes law it has to be brought in the usual form before the stockholders in the several companies.  Anyone who has experience of getting these things carried through and complying with the different formalities with which these companies are bound up, knows the amount of time it takes.  In view of that experience as far as I am concerned, I believe that anyone who would wager that this scheme would be through by the 31st July next would lose money.  If we cannot get the Minister to go the whole way with us in this matter, possibly, like the President, he would go two-sevenths of the way and accept December instead of July.</P>

      <P>To insert before paragraph (e), page 6, a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  shall contain such provisions with respect to the management of any superannuation, pension, provident, widows' and orphans' and other benefit fund or funds established by any absorbed company to which the scheme relates as may be necessary in consequence of absorption so, however, as to preserve in all other respects the management of such funds unaltered until other provision is made by the Oireachtas or by agreement between the parties concerned, as the case may require.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This point has already been passed in connection with the amalgamation scheme.  All the other provisions required by the amalgamation schemes are incorporated in the absorption schemes, but this provision has for some unaccountable reason been omitted from the adoption scheme. It happens to be a provision requiring that the schemes shall contain certain provisions in respect of the management of any superannuation, pension, or other benefit funds.  I cannot call attention to the existence of any such schemes. There may or there may not be such schemes.  If there are not, then no harm is done in inserting this new sub-section, but if there are such provident schemes already in operation amongst the absorbed companies or the companies to be absorbed, then that should be brought into this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall not be transferred to the amalgamated company any liability of an absorbed company in respect of any dividends or interest or arrears of dividends or interest on any loan or any mortgage, bond, charge, debenture, debenture stock or other security for money on which there were six or more years' arrears of dividends or interest unpaid on the 3rd day of April, 1924, and no provisions in this Act applicable to an absorption scheme shall apply to such liability: Provided that this sub-section shall not apply to the liability of an absorbed company in respect of any dividends or interest or arrears of dividends or interest on any mortgage, bond, charge, debenture, debenture stock or other <Col N="554" /> security for money the holder of which was by virtue thereof in possession (whether by himself, or by a trustee on his behalf, or by a receiver appointed by him or any trustee on his behalf) on the 3rd day of April, 1924, of the property or any part of the property comprised in such mortgage, bond, charge, debenture, debenture stock or other security for money.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  In the event of the amalgamated companies and the absorbed companies failing to determine, for the purpose of an absorption scheme, the capital value of any loan or security mentioned in sub-section (1) of this section, the value shall be such amount (if any) as is determined by the railway tribunal having regard to the possibility of any dividends or interest being paid on such loan or security if absorption had not taken place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I will be justified in saying that this amendment means that nothing in the Act shall over-ride the provisions in the Statute of Limitations. There are some bank concerns in which dividends have not been paid for six years, and we do not want those bad debts to be made good debts by reason of the Act, and I may further say that we are simply benefitting by a mistake which was made by legislators in another place.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of determining the terms and conditions of amalgamation between the amalgamating companies or of the transfer of the undertaking of any absorbed company, the railway tribunal shall take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, and in particular <Col N="555" /> the value on a net revenue-earning basis of each of the amalgamating and absorbed companies as a separate company, and its value as a component part of the amalgamated company: so, however, that regard shall not be had to economies or accretions of traffic or other circumstances tending to enhance its value as such component part attributable solely to the provisions of this Act relating to amalgamation and absorption:</P>
    <P>Provided that, in the case of the line of one company being worked by another company under an arrangement whereby a percentage of the gross receipts of the line so worked is payable to the owning company, the railway tribunal in determining the terms and conditions of transfer shall not take into account any higher charging powers than those authorised in respect of the line under the statutory provisions in force in the year 1913.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of discussion has taken place on the basis of this amendment on Section 3 when it was moved for inclusion in the Bill.  The Bill provides that preliminary amalgamation and absorption schemes be submitted to the tribunal at any time, and the tribunal shall approve if the procedure necessary to their submission has been complied with.  Section 7 applies to a scheme which should be made applicable to preliminary schemes and applicable to the tribunal, and that is the object of the amendment I move. When it was made clear that the British Railway Act, 1921, had to pass through the British House of Commons, every one of the companies now absorbed in the four different groups in England prepared different schemes.  The schemes decided questions of capitalisation and every other question in connection with finance in respect to the setting up of the group, and when the schemes were submitted to the tribunal they found they had no power to examine the financial arrangements of the <Col N="556" /> schemes submitted, and that so long as the provisions of the Act were complied with they had no power to interfere. The effect of that non-interference was shown by the statement made here to-day by Deputy Johnson, and in view of the assurance given by the President I cannot see why the Government should not pass this amendment which I now move.</P>

The difficulty arises that this suggestion governs quite a considerable portion of the Bill.  If that tribunal is not to be empowered to take into account anything but what is embodied in the original draft many other things may have to be done.  I think the Minister would not like to have a long discussion on a future Committee Stage, having gone through discussion at this Committee Stage.  If the Minister is prepared to accept provisionally this amendment, it is quite easy for him or one of his supporters to move the deletion of it on Report Stage.  It is not <Col N="558" /> quite so easy to get it reinserted, and if the main purpose of the amendment is not disagreeable I would suggest to the Minister that he should accept this amendment with a view to a possible deletion of it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This amendment is not of the greatest importance.  It is partially a drafting amendment, and I am moving it on behalf of Deputy Morrissey. It is one of the possible outcomes of that last amendment.  Under Section 9 a company may be formed by an amalgamation scheme before the amalgamated company is constituted. The preliminary scheme allows many things before the final amalgamation is completed, and the company may be formed by a preliminary amalgamation scheme before the final completion of the amalgamated company.  This new company will be treated for all purposes as an amalgamating company. The amendment provides that in arranging the capitalisation of such a company so being formed by any amalgamation or absorption scheme the value of the original or newly constituted company is to be calculated upon its relationship with that company with which it is merged and loses its separate identity.  Of course with the first amalgamation or absorption the interests of all concerned are in like manner preserved by the provision applying to the final amalgamation scheme.  The intermediate stages seem to be omitted in the drafting of the Bill, and this amendment, I think, is an improvement in the drafting and makes sure that the interests shall be protected.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I have not been able to understand what is meant by this amendment.  I looked on it in the beginning as merely a roundabout way of expressing what was better expressed by the term &ldquo;amalgamated company,&rdquo; and Section 9, sub-section 7 will have reference to that.  It is there stated that whatever previous and preliminary amalgamations there may be any company so formed will not be regarded as an amalgamated company but merely as an <Col N="560" /> amalgamating one.  That has reference merely to the final stage.</P>

      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That Section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;  Agreed.</P>

      <P>(1)  The amalgamation scheme and every absorption scheme shall be so framed as to come into operation on the 1st day of January, 1925, or such earlier or later date, as the railway tribunal, after consultation with the Minister, may fix:</P>
      <P>Provided that the amalgamation scheme shall be deemed to come into operation immediately before the absorption schemes.</P>
      <P>(2)  Before an agreed amalgamation or absorption scheme is referred to the railway tribunal, the scheme shall be submitted to the proprietors and debenture stock-holders of each amalgamated and absorbed company affected thereby in the manner provided in the Fourth Schedule to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  A scheme under this Part of this Act shall, when confirmed or settled by the railway tribunal, be binding on all persons and have effect as if enacted in this Act, and where any such scheme provides for the substitution of any securities of the amalgamated company for securities of an amalgamating or absorbed company any trustee or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity who at the date of the amalgamation or absorption held and was entitled to hold any securities of an amalgamating or absorbed company shall be entitled <Col N="561" /> to hold the securities of the amalgamated company which may be substituted therefor.</P>
    <P>(4)  No stamp duty shall be payable in respect of any amalgamation or absorption scheme.</P>
    <P>(5) Printed copies of the proposed amalgamation scheme and of every absorption scheme submitted to the Minister or prepared by the railway tribunal in accordance with the provisions of Sections 3 and 5 of this Act, respectively, shall be placed on sale at such places and at such prices as the Minister may direct, and notice that such copies are on sale and the places where they may be obtained shall be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and no such scheme shall be confirmed or settled by the railway tribunal until the expiration of twenty-one days after the publication of such notice.</P>
    <P>(6)  The amalgamation and every absorption scheme shall be deemed to be statutory rules and shall be printed, numbered, published, and sold, and may be cited, in the like manner as statutory rules are for the time being by law required to be printed, numbered, published, and sold, and permitted to be cited.</P>
    <P>(7)  If the railway tribunal postpones the date on which the amalgamation and absorption schemes are to come into operation to a date later than the said 1st January, 1925, then, during the period of postponement, the undertakings of all the amalgamating and absorbed companies shall be used, worked, managed, maintained and repaired as one joint undertaking, and the net receipts of the joint undertaking shall be distributed amongst the amalgamated and absorbed companies upon such terms and subject to such conditions and in such proportions as may be agreed upon by the several companies with the approval of the railway tribunal, or in default of agreement as may be determined by the railway tribunal, and the following provisions of this Act relating to the amalgamated company shall apply as if such joint undertaking were the undertaking of the amalgamated company and as if the governing body of the joint undertaking were the amalgamated company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  An amalgamating company may at any time after the passing of <Col N="563" /> this Act, submit to the Minister for reference to the Railway Tribunal a preliminary scheme for the absorption by that amalgamating company of any absorbed company or companies upon such terms as may be agreed between those companies.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Railway Tribunal shall approve any such preliminary scheme so referred to them unless it appears to them that the provisions of this Act relating to the procedure-preliminary to the submission of a scheme have not been complied with. or unless after hearing such of the other amalgamating companies as desire to be heard, the railway tribunal consider the scheme to be inconsistent with or prejudicial to the amalgamation scheme to be made in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every such preliminary scheme shall, subject to such provisions in that behalf as may be contained therein, come into operation forthwith after it is approved.</P>
    <P>(5)  Subject to the provisions of this section, all the provisions of this Part of this Act relating to amalgamation and absorption schemes-shall, with the necessary adaptations, apply respectively to preliminary amalgamation and absorption schemes except that a preliminary amalgamation scheme shall, instead of giving effect to the provisions contained in the second Schedule to this Act with respect to the direction of the Company, make such alternative provision in that respect as may be agreed between the companies to be amalgamated.</P>
    <P>(6)  In the confirmation or preparation and settlement of the amalgamation scheme the Railway Tribunal shall give effect to any preliminary scheme approved by them, but so that the interests of the other amalgamating companies shall not be prejudiced thereby.</P>
    <P>(7)  Any company formed by a preliminary amalgamation scheme shall be deemed to be an amalgamating company for the purposes of this Act in lieu of the companies amalgamated by the scheme and shall not <Col N="564" /> be deemed to be the amalgamated company within the meaning of this Act.</P>

Section 5 provides that the amalgamated companies may on or before the 31st July, 1924, submit to the Minister a scheme or schemes for the absorption by the amalgamated company of all or any of the absorbed companies.  That scheme must be agreed to by the companies concerned prior to the 31st July, 1924, and on and after that date companies which have not been amalgamated or absorbed by agreement between themselves have to be amalgamated or absorbed under a scheme settled by the Railway Tribunal. My amendment makes it necessary to submit the preliminary scheme before the 31st July, 1924.</P>

      <P>The phraseology of the section is, of course, senseless if the Minister's interpretation is correct&mdash;&ldquo;Any two or more amalgamated companies may at any time after the passing of this Act...&rdquo; If this scheme is to come into operation by 1st January, 1925, and if there is to be a preliminary scheme, which may be submitted prior to 31st July, it seems to be forgotten that there may be an intermediate stage between that preliminary scheme coming into operation and the final scheme coming into operation. The Minister seems to be contemplating the possibility of schemes being arranged and capitalisations being arranged by companies of a kind which will involve what has already been suggested <Col N="565" /> in the earlier debate.  After the 31st July, companies which have not been amalgamated or absorbed by agreement are to be absorbed or amalgamated under the provisions of the Act, so that the necessity for fixing a date is rather to ensure that there is no <i>hocus-pocus.</i>  I think the Minister will be wise in accepting the amendment, and no harm can come of doing so even on his own reading of the present Bill.</P>
