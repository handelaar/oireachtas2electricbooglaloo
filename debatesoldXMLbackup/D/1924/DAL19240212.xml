      <P>asked the President whether his attention has been called to the fact that in Thom's Official Directory for 1924, the name of one Deputy appears as Parliamentary Secretary to the Executive Council, and that of another Deputy as Parliamentary Secretary to the President; whether the Oireachtas has up to the present sanctioned the creation of these posts; whether any appointments have been made to them, and whether the information furnished to the Directory came from any official source.</P>

      <P>I have seen the entry referred to.  The two Deputies mentioned acted in the capacity of Parliamentary Secretaries during the period of the last Dáil.  Since then, and pending the passing of the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, they have continued to discharge the duties entrusted to them.  The Ministers and Secretaries Bill, when passed, will necessitate a revision of the appointments.  I should add that Thom's Directory is not an official publication.</P>

      <P>The floods complained of occur on a river which is not included in any existing drainage district, and there is, therefore, no power to carry out works of relief except by designing and carrying out a new scheme of arterial drainage.  Under the existing law such a scheme can only be carried out on the initiative and at the expense of the owners of lands damaged by floods.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that attempts are being made by the Inland Revenue Authorities to collect Income Tax under Schedule D from farmers who are suppliers of milk in the ordinary course of their business and at wholesale rates to dealers in Dublin, those farmers being also assessed in the usual manner under Schedules A and B, and whether steps will be taken to prevent seizures being made on account of such assessments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. E. BLYTHE Mr. E. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of Case III., Sch. D, Income Tax Act, 1918, a farmer who is also a dealer in, or seller of milk, is chargeable to Income Tax under Schedule D, in addition to any tax charged under Schedule B, if his lands are insufficient for the keep of the cattle brought on to his own lands.  It follows, therefore, that he is correctly assessed under Schedule D if he takes grazing rights over other lands not in his own occupation, or if he adopts other methods for the keeping of his dairy cattle which are not part and parcel of the normal operations of a farmer occupying his own land for the purposes of husbandry only.</P>
      <P>Where a Schedule D assessment has been made in the circumstances aforesaid, a taxpayer has the usual right of appeal to the Special Commissioners within 21 days.  If he neglects to appeal, or, if on appeal, the assessment is upheld, tax is collectable in the ordinary way, that is by distraint or seizure in case of persistent refusal to pay.</P>
      <P>There has been no alteration in the law or practice in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what special concessions, if any, have been obtained from the Governments of India and Nyassaland in consideration of the admission into the Saorstát of their surplus tobaccos at a preferential rate of duty, and if he is aware that owing to the cheapness of labour in those countries Irish tobacco is hopelessly handicapped in the home market, and whether steps will be taken to remove this handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No special concessions have been obtained from the Governments of India or Nyassaland.</P>
      <P>The scheme of Imperial Preference forms part of the fiscal system which was taken over from the British Government by the Saorstát, and which it was felt should not be amended without careful consideration, not possible at the time of taking over.  The preferential rate of duty at which tobacco imported from India and Nyassaland is admitted does not adversely affect Irish-grown tobacco, inasmuch as the Excise duty on Irish-grown tobacco has been reduced to an even lower figure, which would probably be increased in the event of the abolition of the Imperial Preference rate.  To attempt to remove the handicap caused by cheapness of production in other countries would require a permanent subsidy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what was the amount of revenue sacrificed by the Irish Free State for the nine months ending the 31st December of the current year by reason of the adoption of the British Preferential Tariff, and whether Empire grown tobacco pays only five-sixths of the duty charged upon foreign tobacco; and, further, whether the Government proposes taking steps to encourage the tobacco growing industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I am having a return prepared for the Deputy showing, as far as figures are available, the difference between the actual revenue receipts in respect of tobacco imported at preferential rates and the potential Revenue receipts calculated on the assumption that the preferential rates had been abolished and the full duty charged, but that other conditions had remained the same.</P>
      <P>The answer to the second part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>As regards the third part of the question, the position is that the Government have heretofore been granting a substantial subsidy towards the tobacco growing industry.  If the Deputy has in mind a tariff protection for that industry, I am not in a position to say more than that the question of homegrown tobacco will be duly considered in relation to the fiscal problem generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. F. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the fishing industry of the Arran Islands is receiving close attention.  The present depressed condition of these fisheries is due to the universal causes which have their origin in the great upheavals, consequent on the European war.  Remote islands like Arran have suffered in a special manner, as owing to the increase in steamer and railway freights the return to the fishermen for their catches hardly yields a living wage, and the owners of the boats purchased from the State have, in consequence, been unable to meet their instalments during the past three years.</P>
      <P>Efforts are at present being made to develop markets in our inland towns for the catches of our fishermen, and it is hoped that our activities in this direction will help to provide an improved outlet for the catches.</P>
      <P>The principal problem affecting the Arran fresh fisheries development is transit, both as regards the service and the freight charges; for while the market value of fish in the British markets to-day is somewhat below the values in pre-war years, the cost of transit is more than 50 per cent. greater, while the service is greatly inferior to the service available before 1914.</P>
      <P>The Ministry subsidises the Galway-Arran steamer service at a heavy yearly cost.  It may be possible that a scheme for a cheaper and better sea service to the Islands may be evolved in the comparatively near future, but I cannot hold out any hope that such a scheme will be in working order for the coming spring fishing.  The railway service from Galway has been considerably improved of late, and the Midland Railway Company has been as accommodating as possible under the difficult conditions under which it has been working for some years past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="The MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>The MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to give effect to the reduction, which I announced in November last, in the old age pensions.  That reduction has not yet been given effect to, and, in fact, even with the passing of the Bill. it cannot be given effect to for some little time.  The Bill will also include provisions for a revision of the main scale and the method of calculating the annual value of capital or property held by applicants, and certain amendments in regard to the assignment or transfer of property.  The whole matter of the need for this reduction was discussed very fully on a previous occasion by the Dáil, and nothing that has occurred or has come to light since in any way alters the point of view that we hold as to the necessity for reducing the amount of expenditure in this particular service.  Some people are inclined to think that because of the success of the Loan there is less need for economy than previously. There is no less need.  In fact, we still have to borrow, and if we were to fail to carry out the promises of economy made before the last Loan was issued it would be very difficult to carry through a second Loan with the same ease as the first.  The matter is one about which I do not think it is necessary for me to say more.  The events <Col N="808" /> of the past year have made it necessary for us to reduce the national expenditure very drastically, and, no matter how desirous we may be of saving, there is no class that can escape the results of the destruction and damage done during the year.  I accordingly move the first reading of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the verdict of the Dáil as to whether such a Bill should be printed.  The Minister has referred to the promise he made in November last.  On the strength of these promises of economy he appealed for a loan.  I do not know whether one per cent. of the money that has been obtained in response to the appeal for a loan can be said to have been paid in as a consequence of his promise to deduct 10 per cent. from the pensions of the aged poor, and I think that that one per cent., if there were as many as one per cent., who only paid into the loan on condition that 10 per cent. was to be deducted from the old age pensions, are not worthy of any consideration in the Dáil.  The case that was made, such as it was at the time, was based upon the alleged reduction in the cost of living and the purchasing power of the pension.  I do not think that the case for the reduction in the pension can be sustained.  This is, of course, not the occasion for a long debate upon the Bill.  We are now told, of course, that, included in the proposals, are more stringent regulations regarding the administration of the Act.  Presumably, it is expected that a more rigid inspection and a more &ldquo;graagrind&rdquo; administration of the law will save the Exchequer a considerable amount.  We shall wait until we see the Bill before we say anything on that point.  It may be that there is plenty of room for more stringent administration and care. I think there is, but I am afraid that the instructions that have been issued from the Pension Department to local inspectors are being interpreted in a way which, perhaps, the Pension Department may have intended, but they are doing great hardship and injustice to many of those who ought to be receiving the pension.  However, that matter will come under review, I have no doubt.  There are very grave doubts in the country as to the wisdom of this <Col N="809" /> proposal, quite apart from any question of humanity or sympathy, quite apart even from a question of good government. Merely as a matter of tactics, merely as a matter of good politics in the narrow sense, it is considered to be a very false move when discussions are taking place regarding the unity of Ireland. One cannot hold out to the people who are aged or those who are likely to be aged within a few years, who live on the Northern side of the Border, that it would be a good thing for them to unite with their fellows in the larger part of the country, when a cut of 10 per cent. was being made in their Old Age Pensions.  I would like to remind several Deputies, particularly Deputies Mulcahy, O'Higgins, Burke, Duggan, P.J. Ward, J.J. Walsh, and Pádraic O Máille, of the declaration to which they all subscribed when they said, &ldquo;We approve of a sympathetic native scheme for the care of the Nation's aged and infirm, who shall not be regarded as a burden, but are entitled to the Nation's gratitude and consideration.&rdquo;  On that ground I beg the Dáil not to agree to the first reading of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputies have seen the resolutions passed by the different bodies in the Saorstát condemning the action of the Government in introducing a cut of 10 per cent. in the old-age pensions.  In some cases old-age pensioners living ten miles or more outside have to come into a town for sums of a few shillings.  I would like to remind the Minister that if old-age pensions are reduced it will not be a saving to the State.  It may be a saving to the Exchequer, but it will be an increase in the expenditure of ratepayers, for there will be nothing left for the old-age pensioners to do but to seek admission to the County Home or to ask for relief from the bodies which they have contributed to for the upkeep of the county for sixty or seventy years of their life.  If it is a question of economy, surely there are other branches of the Government where economy can be started.  I do not see why the Minister should go to the country and reduce by one shilling in ten the pension of an old man or an old woman.  I can assure the Minister <Col N="810" /> and the Government that a shilling deducted from the old-age pension means more to those concerned than if the Attorney-General was reduced £1,000 in his salary.  All the old-age pensioner has to live on is the 10s. given to him as a gratuity of honour to his old age. It may be a saving to the Free State, but it will mean an increase on the rates.  The different local authorities will have to increase their rates.  They have already passed a resolution condemning the action of the Government, and, to my mind, the Government elected by the people are not the masters of the people, but must be governed by the people.  If the people tell you to do a certain thing I think it is necessary that that should be done. The people are the masters; we are the employees.  The people are the employers. I do not see why this Bill should be enforced; the country is up against it.  In the constituency which I have the honour, or rather the misfortune, to represent every public body there has passed a resolution.  I use the word &ldquo;misfortune&rdquo; because the members there, like the Government, are out to reduce wages.  All those bodies have passed resolutions asking the Government not to enforce this reduction. If this Bill goes to a division I will vote against it.  I do not understand economising if you have to start at the bottom and climb up to the top. I think a much quicker way would be to begin at the top and slip down to the bottom.  If any of the Deputies present happens to have a plum tree and wishes to prune it, he does not prune it at the root.  He cuts away the top branches first.  The same thing should be done as far as the economy of the State is concerned.  I do not want to say that Ministers have too high a salary.  I would give them more if I could.  But you have a Lodge that costs you £38,000 a year.  Saving can begin there.  Every Deputy here knows that the old men and women cannot afford the reduction. If the reduction takes place it will mean expenditure in other places.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that 10s. a week given to the old age pensioner is the only relief for the unemployed that I see up to now.  A father and a <Col N="811" /> mother might be getting the pension, and the son with the grand-children are hungry until that £1 a week comes in.  That 10s. a week is spent on tea, sugar, and a few other things that could be reduced immediately by the Cabinet before they attempted to take away from the poor man or woman of eighty years of age one-tenth of his or her salary, which was well earned from the State before we were born.  It is the only relief of the unemployed.  The unemployment in my district and throughout the country is becoming a serious menace, especially when I am told that the poor people have actually eaten their own seed potatoes.  How are they going to sow potatoes in the coming year?  On that account I am compelled to vote against the Bill.</P>

We saw the recommendations of the Postal Commission, and the recommendations of the Reconstruction Commission turned down, and we see that every effort is being made to give a headline to the employers to assail and attack the position of the workers.  And now, last of all, we see the despicable effort that is being made to increase the poverty that exists amongst the aged poor.  I think the attitude of the Government is unworthy of them as a Government, and is a complete disappointment to the expectations of the people of Ireland who made the Government.  It is a poor recompense for the sacrifice made by the workers to establish native government in Ireland.  I agree with the attitude adopted by members of the Dáil who have spoken against this Bill, and I hope the Dáil will reject the Bill when it comes to a division.</P>

      <P>As far as we are concerned we are not profiteering, and the profiteers and other people of that sort must be dealt with in our own time; but other matters of pressing importance, which in our judgement must come first, have to be dealt with.  We are not, no more than is the Deputy, absolutely free to deal with things as we would like to deal with them.  Nobody knows better than the Deputy the great difficulties there are in trying to solve everything at one time, but there is one thing we have got to make up our minds upon definitely, and it is whether or not you are going to exceed the sum of money in expenditure which you raise in revenue.  If you exceed that money you have got no right to set up Courts to collect money from debtors against whom judgement is marked in the Courts, or against whom decrees are obtained in the Courts.  You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot impose upon the individual what you are afraid to face yourself.  We have in three or four services in this country <Col N="813" /> 50 per cent. of the entire revenues of the State involved to keep them going.  One is Education, the other Old Age Pensions, and the third superannuation. Superannuation we cannot interfere with, because we have pledged our word to it; we are bound by the terms in the Treaty to carry it out.  Is it contended that we should break our word in regard to that?  I have not heard anybody putting that argument forward, I have not heard anybody make the declaration on any public platform that that is a service in respect of which we are entitled to demand a reduction. There are two or three services that have been examined&mdash;the Army, Education and Old Age Pensions&mdash;I do not know that the Minister for Finance has examined closely a great many of the other services; he has not completed the whole of his examination yet.  The Army estimates will be enormously reduced this year, and they would be further reduced if we had not got such political humbugs as we have to deal with in this country &mdash; little gentlemen who call themselves soldiers when the fight is over, and warriors who object to peaceful picketting, and other people of that type who have committed this State, either by innuendo or acquiescence or silence, or by any other methods, to enormous expenditure of treasure and of blood.  The Minister for Finance, in introducing this Bill, has fulfilled his bond to the whole country. He has fulfilled his bond to every person who has a single penny in the banks on deposit, to every person who has invested in the loan, and to every person who will be invited, a little later on, to contribute something towards running the State, and to keeping it out of pawn to other countries&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have been told that we have not responded to any of <Col N="814" /> the recommendations made by Commissions.  My experience of Commissions extends over a great many years.  Every Commission that is set up has not got before it the difficulties which face the Minister for Finance; it has only to concern itself with one subject.  The Minister for Finance, unlike the lady in the Gospel, has to concern himself with many things, and has to be busy about many things.  He has to solve everything in relation to the one problem that should be his first concern, and that is a problem that ought to be the concern of any State which means, in times of difficulty and stress, to maintain a position of honour and integrity amongst the other States in the world.  Deputy Lyons, I think, mentioned something about a plum tree.  I would like to know if the Deputy would submit himself to the particular operation he mentioned&mdash;improving the rest of his body at the expense of his head.  I am afraid the Deputy could not afford anything off the top.</P>

      <P>There is no more popular subject that one could address himself to than this question of the needs, the requirements and the comfort of the aged.  We are as much concerned here with their needs, requirements and comfort as anybody else, and we want to know where else we are going to get £400,000?  The case may not be as strong now as it was when the Minister made his first statement.  The cost of living may possibly vary a little in a contrary direction, but the facts are that during a period of something like twelve months the cost of living did warrant, granted that the original sum of five shillings was the basis, a reduction to 9s, and even the cost of living, prices, salaries, and so on must all subordinate themselves to the fact, whether or not you can afford to pay. There is little use in saying to old-age pensioners or to people interested in education, or to people who say to us&mdash;&ldquo;You must keep up the army and the police forces,&rdquo; and so on, that we must <Col N="815" /> continue to pay this money.  But suppose you do pay this year and next year and the year after, and then find in the fourth year that you have not got a single penny to give them, what will be the case then?  You will be faced with bankruptcy and with a position of being unable to run any of the services of the State.  Do you not fail then in your duty which is to maintain the State?  We are suffering here in this country now not much more than has been suffered in other countries through the terrible war that took <Col N="816" /> place some years ago.  Other countries are bearing their sufferings and bearing them well, and they have responded to the troubles of their time by making better efforts themselves.  It is our duty to make a better effort here, and to see, if there are times of difficulty and stress, what sacrifices we are going to make in order that the State may function and discharge its obligations to all its services.</P>

      <P>Go gceaduíghidh an Dáil leis seo Ordú Pinsean Constáblaíocht Ríoga na hEireann (Fir d'Eirigh as agus Fir do Briseadh), 1924, a dhin an tAire Airgid an 10adh lá d'Eanair, 1924, fé alt 5 den Acht Aois-Liúntas agus Pinsean, 1923 (Uimh. 34 de 1923) agus a leagadh fé bhráid na Dála an 15adh lá d'Eanair, 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil hereby approve of the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pension Order, 1924, made on the 10th day of January, 1924, by the Minister for Finance under Section 5 of the Superannuation <Col N="817" /> and Pensions Act, 1923 (No. 34 of 1923), and laid before the Dáil on the 15th day of January, 1924.</P>
    <P>In this Order we carry out substantially, and as far as we feel justified in doing in the present circumstances of the country, promises that were made to the R.I.C. who left the force or were discharged because of their national sympathies.  Perhaps if the conditions of the country were the same as when the late General Collins made his promise to the men, the order in some details might be slightly different.  However, it is an order that does treat them well.  It gives to these men their completed years of actual service with the addition of any period between the date of their leaving the force and the 31st day of March, 1922.  It adds twelve years to their actual completed service for the purpose of computing the pension.</P>
    <P>There are certain conditions attached to the order.  One is a proviso that no pension shall be payable to any man who, having been offered an appointment in any branch of the public service of the Saorstát which, in the opinion of the Minister for Home Affairs, is reasonably suitable for him, declines to accept such an appointment. We think it is only fair that as far as possible, use should be made of these men.  They were promised by the people who were in charge of Sinn Féin and by representatives of the Dáil in the old days, that if they did resign they would be looked after.  Definite specific promises were not, perhaps, given to them, but they were given very clear general promises.  We are bound by those promises and by the later promises of the late General Collins to compensate these men, but we do not wish to have a large number of able-bodied and comparatively young men drawing pensions for which the State is not receiving any value. Our intention is, as far as possible, to employ these men, as far as they are found suitable, on any suitable police or other work, that can be found for them.  If any of them is offered employment and he refuses to accept it, then no pension will be paid to him.  I think that there is no injustice to the <Col N="818" /> men and no harshness in that provision. Pensions will be retrospective only to the 8th August, the date on which the Act was passed.  We are advised that there is no power under the Act to calculate the pension from any earlier date.  Complaint has been made that no provision is made for the widows of men who have died since they left the R.I.C.  There is no power to give pensions to widows under this Act and, as a matter of fact, when the matter was being debated in the Dáil on the 30th July last, the President specifically stated that pensions would not be given except to the men themselves. No exception was taken to that in the Dáil at the time.</P>
    <P>The Order will involve a fairly considerable expense to the State.  I do not know exactly how many men will receive the pension.  A large number of cases were reviewed by a Committee set up by the Minister for Home Affairs, and some 600 odd cases were passed by that Committee.  In the case of some men, however, additional information has come to light since, and it may be that a number of names, possibly even a substantial number, may be struck off that list.  However carefully we may scrutinise the list, there is no doubt whatever that under this Order men will get the pension who have no real right or claim to it. Men may have resigned for reasons of their own.  They may have resigned without any national sympathy, but simply because they had cold feet. They may have resigned because they were tired of the police force.  They may have resigned for a whole variety of reasons.  Now of course they allege, and they have alleged, that they resigned because of their national sympathies. In justice to those who really did come out at a time when it was difficult and a sacrifice for them to come out, we cannot make the door so narrow or demand such absolute proof as would exclude those who are really entitled.  We are making every possible enquiry, and before a pension is given every enquiry that can possibly be made will be made in each case. Some who are not entitled perhaps will get through, but there seems to be no way of avoiding that.  If such men do <Col N="819" /> get through, perhaps under the provisions of the Order as it stands we will be able to make them do some work if they are young men who can suitably be put to work.  In that case the pension will quite possibly be suspended and the State will be getting value for a considerable number of years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete the words `approve of' and insert the words `refer back for further consideration.' &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must express my regret at being compelled to move an amendment which postpones for a further period the coming into operation of Regulations which would give to the men concerned some part of what they were promised on several occasions.  The Minister really amazed me by many of the statements he has made.  Promises were made on many occasions, in the first instance by the Sinn Fein organisation, which included the Minister for Finance, and every other member of the Ministry, on behalf of the Irish nation, when they appealed to the men concerned to give up jobs worth £4 or £5 a week in the R.I.C. so as to assist as far as they could to drive the British army out of this country.  Anyone who has followed the course of political events in this country for many years past must realise that it was the R.I.C., and the assistance it gave to the British Forces that enabled them, their spies, and secret agents to remain here so long.  If the R.I.C. as a body had responded to the call that the Sinn Fein organisation made to it in 1918, and resigned in a body, I cannot see that there would have been any necessity for all the bloodshed of the succeeding years.  However, I contend that as well as dishonouring the many promises made, the regulations as drafted, are not consistent with some of the Acts that have been passed.  I have referred to the promise made in 1918 by the then Sinn Fein organisation, acting on behalf of the Irish nation.  I may say that it is within my personal knowledge that many of the Deputies, now sitting behind Ministers, during the recent general election, gave undertakings, <Col N="820" /> both in writing and verbally, that they would see that the promises made were carried out.  Some of the Deputies are here now, and I hope they will stand up and tell the Minister where these Regulations fall short of these promises. The late General Collins, on the 9th February, 1922, wrote the following letter to the representatives of these men:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your suggestion that the resigned and dismissed men should be dealt with no less generously than the members of the R.I.C. who have continued to serve has my very strong support.  At the present moment it is not possible for me to say how the details can be worked out, but I do say that my advice would be always in favour of proper treatment for the men who showed by their action that they were on the side of Ireland. I think you, personally, are aware that I have always cherished the deepest feelings of regard for these men, and my desire is to translate these feelings into action, when I am in a position to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was subsequent to the signing of the Treaty.  On the 10th October, 1922, when we were in no doubt as to what the state of the country was, the Minister for Home Affairs, in reply to a question, stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the intention of the Government to grant compensation to certain Royal Irish Constabulary men who resigned or were dismissed in recent years because of their national sympathies.  It is intended that such men will receive as generous terms as if they had remained in the force until the date of their disbandment. Legislation will be required to cover such compensation, and it is proposed to introduce the appropriate measure as soon after the enactment of the Constitution as is practicable.  An inquiry into each individual case will, of course, be necessary, and prior to the introduction of the proposed legislative measure, an investigating committee will be appointed.  I have no doubt that some of these men and their families have suffered great hardships since their resignation, but in this connection it should be remembered that there are many other <Col N="821" /> people who have suffered acutely and for whom no compensation is available. It is, however, hoped to set up the investigating committee at an early date to deal with this specific case of ex-Royal Irish Constabulary men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the two promises made by the two men who were in charge of the Sinn Féin organisation in 1918, and I am sure there is no desire whatever to repudiate the promises, made not alone on their own behalf, but on behalf of the Irish nation.  I hope every Deputy has read the Regulations.  Let us come to examine how they are being translated into action.  In the first case, Clause 3 of the Regulations states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Order the Minister for Finance may grant to any person to whom this Order applies a pension commencing as from the 8th August, 1923, and calculated in accordance with the rules contained in Part I. of the Schedule to this Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister state that there is anything in the Act which would prevent him from making the Order retrospective in regard to pensions.  I consulted some people who may not be of the same high legal standing as those whom the Minister consulted, and they have expressed the opinion that there is nothing in the Act to prevent the Government, if they so desire, from giving these men pensions from the date on which they were received by those who were serving up to the 1st April, 1922. It is, however, within the power of the Minister to amend the Act in a direction which would give these men what they were entitled to and what they were promised.  I contend there is nothing in the Act to prevent him doing so.</P>
    <P>Coming to the most important part of the Regulations, it appears to me that they are absolutely and deliberately worded so as to deprive every one of these men of what they would be entitled to.  I refer to Clause 4 of the Regulations, and I think that if Sir Hamar Greenwood were asked to come back to draft regulations to deny to these men what the Irish people would like to give them <Col N="822" /> for what they have done he could not do it with any greater advantage.  I cannot help thinking that somebody who was closely associated with him, or with his recent administration, had something to do with the drafting of this clause.  I would be glad to hear that that is not the case, and that the Minister accepts responsibility for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, however, that after having studied the regulations more closely he will agree to accept the amendment and to take these regulations back for further consideration. They say: &ldquo;No pension shall be payable under this order to any person who shall have been offered an appointment in any branch of the public service of Saorstát Eireann which in the opinion of the Minister for Home Affairs is reasonably suitable for him and shall have declined to accept such appointment.&rdquo;  It is news to me, especially when I study the Civil Service regulations, to know that the Minister for Home Affairs is empowered to give any position in the established service to any person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, that is not suggested in the Order at all.  It is really suggested in the Order that the Minister for Home Affairs shall judge whether the appointment offered is one that is reasonably suitable for the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>If it means anything it means that the Minister for Home Affairs is not in a position, at any rate according to Clause 3 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, to offer any appointment to any of these men on the established service.  Clause 3 of the Civil Service Regulation Act reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners shall inquire into the qualifications of every person proposed to be appointed to any permanent situation in the Civil Service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann to which this Act applies, and no person shall be so appointed unless and until a certificate of his qualification for <Col N="823" /> such situation has been issued by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, I presume, that the Minister for Home Affairs is entitled to offer these men who resigned from positions worth £5 or £6 a week positions as porters, messengers, night-watchmen, cleaners, and all other persons hired to perform only subordinate duties or ordinary labour, as it is required.  I am sorry that he would not offer them what is provided in Clause 5 of the Schedule:&mdash;&ldquo;Artisans or other skilled labourers employed in an unestablished capacity.&rdquo;  I believe he is also open, under this Schedule, to appoint them to the position of Governor-General, but there is only one appointment of that kind and it is not possible so to provide for them under these regulations.  If Clause 4 of the regulations is interpreted in the way that it can and is likely to be interpreted by any Minister or official&mdash;and it is the officials who do these things, not the Minister&mdash;it will mean that any man who resigned from the Royal Irish Constabulary, and who is now in the fortunate position of having some other work, if offered a position in the public service of Saorstát Eireann as night-watchman or doorkeeper, and if he refuses to leave the position in which he happens to be, then the Minister can deprive him of the pension.  Was that the position taken up by the British Government?  No.  The Minister for Finance and every other Minister knows that full well.  That clause also means that if an individual who is in a position, or even one who is not in a position, to-day, and who is entitled to a pension, and whose case has been passed for a pension, accepts a position such as could be offered to him, and if on the following day he is dismissed, or resigns because he is unsuitable or unfit for the job, the pension is also withdrawn.  I ask Deputies to consider seriously whether that clause should be inserted in any regulations brought before a body of an intelligent kind.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by the Minister for Finance that the number of applicants for pensions under this Act, or the number of people who applied for pensions thinking that they were entitled <Col N="824" /> to them, having resigned from the R.I.C. owing to their national sympathies, was 1,136, and he stated that 631 cases had been approved of as having resigned for that reason.  Now, and only now, we are informed that it is quite possible that this number may be substantially reduced for reasons which we will never hear of, and which we will never be asked to give an opinion upon.  Out of the number of cases rejected there were 190 who, it was stated, could not receive pensions because of their short service.  By that I believe is meant they had only two or three or four years' service when they resigned.  The Committee, or the Minister, or somebody who had some responsibility, decided that they were not entitled under the previous promises to any gratuity or to any compensation. What do we find in the case of the men who were disbanded on the 1st April, 1922?  A constable with two years' service who served up to the time of disbandment, getting twelve years' added service, who was drawing a salary of £234 at the time, was entitled to and has received a pension, not at the expense of Britain, whom he served, but at the expense of the Irish taxpayer, of £52 10s. a year.  A constable with three years' service received a pension of £58 10s., and with four years' service £62 8s., and so on, according to the number of years served.  I contend, therefore, that so far as that clause is concerned, it does not fulfil the promise made to these men, and that the 190 or 200 men who are deprived of their pensions under the terms of these Regulations should have their cases reconsidered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the case of pensions to widows, and stated that when this matter was being discussed in the Dáil on a previous occasion no exception was taken to the statement then made by the President.  I think it is only now, after having heard the statement of the Minister, and especially after reading the Regulations, that one can really come, or is forced, to the conclusion that the Ministry had no intention, or, at least, have not at present, at any rate, of carrying out the promises which they made and repeated on so many occasions.  I could <Col N="825" /> not, for instance, assume on that particular occasion that the Regulations, as drafted, subsequent to the passing or the Act, would not mean that the men who resigned, or who were considered as having resigned for reasons of national sympathy, would get the same treatment as the men who served up to the time of disbandment. The President, about a quarter of an hour ago, asked us&mdash;I think he was speaking to this side of the Dáil&mdash; did we wish him to break the promise made to England when they accepted responsibility for between £1,000,000 and £1,500,000 in pensions to the men who were disbanded.  It is not for me to say whether he should or not, but it is for him and for the Government to justify to the Irish people their responsibility, in approving of the Treaty, for accepting and imposing that burden upon the Irish people for 10,000 men who served England, and at the same time coming before the Dáil with Regulations and asking us, and those who made a promise, to break their work to the few hundred men who resigned their positions to serve Ireland. That is the case we make from these benches, and that is a case good enough for the Minister to take these Regulations back and reconsider the whole matter in the light of things said and the promises that have been broken, and to bring up Regulations that will more honestly interpret the feelings and the wishes of the late General Collins, who originally made these promises.</P>
    <P>In the case of the widows, I should have said that the conditions governing pensions which have been given to the disbanded men are laid down in the Constabulary Act of 1922.  Clause 4 of the Schedule says: &ldquo;In the event of an officer or a constable dying after an annual allowance has been awarded to him under this Act the Treasury shall grant a pension or gratuity to the widow or children of the officer or constable, in like manner as if the allowance were a pension granted to the officer or constable on retirement, and as if his years of service had been years on which the allowance was calculated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand since these men resigned four or five of them have died. <Col N="826" /> I think two of them have died in the Cork workhouse.  I have a letter I received from Cork a few days ago, in which it is stated that a person who had resigned from the Constabulary had his expenses while ill, burial, etc., undertaken by a friend, and they amounted to £100.  I think, seeing the amount is so small, especially when compared with what is being given to the disbanded men, that that part of the regulations might also be considered.  I believe I have said enough, if anything could convince the Minister, to show that the regulations are quite unfair and out of all proportion to the promises made.  If there is to be any honesty in public life or purity of administration in the service of the country, then, promises that have been made by the Minister or by the Government, no matter what they meant, should be carried out, or a very good reason given to the people to whom these promises have been made for not carrying them out.  My main argument is, if you have taken the responsibility of imposing a burden of £1,500,000 a year on the Irish taxpayers for 10,000 men who served England&mdash;and I am not asking you to break that agreement, as the President suggested&mdash;I say that in all honour you should fulfil the promises made to these men who resigned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to oppose this motion also, and principally for the reason that I think with regard to the date on which this Order will commence, that it is quite unfair that these men who resigned at the call of men who are now members of the Government, and the call of the old Sinn Fein party, should now be placed in a worse position than those that remained in the service to the date of their disbandment. With the ethics of the question of resigning or not resigning I do not propose to deal.  Opinions may differ on that considerably, but I do think that the honour of the State and the Government, and, perhaps, the honour of certain Ministers, is at stake in this matter.  Certain definite promises were made and repeated several times that those men would not be treated worse than those who continued to serve in <Col N="827" /> the Force and were disbanded in the ordinary course of events.  I am strongly of opinion that in the making of the Treaty the original terms granted to the men who were disbanded were too generous, with the result that the country was saddled with an enormous debt on that account.  That, however, is no excuse for treating the men who resigned on worse terms than those who were disbanded.  It is an obligation of honour on the State, and I think the State should carry out its obligation. Another matter I would like to refer to is the question of offering these men alternative employment in place of the pension.</P>

      <P>I think that is an excellent idea in itself, but I do not think the regulations which govern that idea are quite as sound as they might be.  I think these men might be treated in a more generous manner.  I do not think that the Minister for Home Affairs should have the right to take exclusive power to decide what is a suitable position for a resigned man. That man himself should have something to say to it.  I think that the Order should contain some provision by which the men would be represented and have some say in the matter before they would lose their pension. Although we all have the greatest possible respect for the integrity of the Minister for Home Affairs, still I do not think it is right he should have the exclusive power to state what position is right and what position is not right for those men.  I would also like to say that the matter of offering alternative employment is one that should be endorsed to its fullest extent by the Dáil. I think the number of pensioners we have from the different services is becoming a scandal, and I wish the Minister for Local Government would take notice of it, and see that these men who resigned their positions under Local Government services would also have alternative employment offered them. The men who resigned from the R.I.C., or others, should be given a voice in this matter, I think, and also regulations <Col N="828" /> should be laid down which should govern the actual salary they should get in these services.  It stands to reason that when a young, intelligent, physically fit man gets a pension, in the course of time he will get employment which will enable him to add considerably to that pension, and I think some method should be devised, I do not know that Deputy Davin's is the best, by which changes could be made in these regulations to provide for these cases.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have no prejudice whatever in this matter, but I intend to vote for Deputy Davin's amendment for one reason, and one reason only, and that is because the motion of the Minister proposes to set up the Minister for Home Affairs as the judge as to whether employment offered to men dismissed or resigned is suitable or not. I am inflexibly opposed to this tendency of putting Ministers in a judicial position, which they cannot possibly fulfil if they are doing their duty.  The Minister has a duty to his colleagues, and particularly to the Minister for Finance, and in discharging that duty he cannot be impartial between a claimant to the bounty of the State and the State itself.  Yet it is suggested that there can be no appeal from the Minister's decision, no appeal to the Courts, no appeal to the Dáil, and no appeal anywhere.  The Minister for Home Affairs is to be the only and the ultimate authority to settle this matter.  I will never consent to that. I would suggest, if the amendment of Deputy Davin is carried, that the Civil Service Commissioners would be the suitable body for this purpose.  The Minister shakes his head.  Then a judge to be appointed by the Chief Justice.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance is a party to the case, and he cannot be a judge as well.  The Minister does not realise the seriousness of this to the ordinary individual.  I have no particular sympathy with these men, but on the general principle I take my stand that no Minister should place <Col N="829" /> himself in a judicial position, because he is a party to the case&mdash;he or his colleagues must be.  Get a judge, get the Chief Justice, or the Attorney-General to nominate a judge if you like; get anybody who is removed from the actual burden of administration.  The Civil Service Commissioners would be suitable if they were further removed from the administration than they are at present, or anybody, but not the Minister, because, as I say, he is one of the parties to the case.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Home Affairs was put in here as the alternative to the Minister for Finance. Perhaps in the ordinary way the Minister for Finance would have been the Minister whose name would be put into the Section.  It was thought desirable that another Minister, whose interest in keeping down expenditure might not be so immediate, should be included. As a matter of fact, the whole thing rests on the discretion of the Ministers.  No person, for instance, can get a pension unless the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Finance are satisfied that he resigned on national grounds.  It would be quite easy for the Minister, if he wanted to strain the Act, or do an injustice, to exclude anybody or the whole lot.  There is really no point in this.  The Minister for Home Affairs will not be asked or expected to decide individual cases, but he will decide certain classes of employment are such as would be suitable and as could be offered to those resigned and dismissed R.I.C.</P>
      <P>Suppose, for instance, it was proposed to appoint some of them as prison warders, the Minister would be asked to say whether he thought that was a class of employment that they might reasonably be expected to take.  There is no question of appointing them to any of the offices that Deputy Davin talked about, and I am not sure but that he knew that very well when he was occupying the time of the Dáil on this particular paragraph.</P>

      <P>I have taken the view always in all these matters, that when we are defeated and when Deputy Johnson comes to these benches, he will do the right thing.  I think there is no other point of view that can well be taken.  I dissent from the point of view of Deputy Cooper, not only on this matter, but on all matters in regard to the discretion that should be allowed to Ministers.  I believe that any Ministers that a majority of the Dáil will elect, will do everything that is reasonable in the circumstances, and that there will be no attempt on their part to do injustice to anybody.  The discretion of the Ministers in all matters is far greater than Deputies realise.  For instance, they can, if they so desire, dismiss the whole Civil Service; yet nobody suggests that the power of dismissal should not be allowed, because that may be done.  I suggest that the Dáil will pay no attention to suggestions that we are going to have no fair play or no guarantee of fair play from Ministers, or that we should be tied up in such a way that the interests of the State and the interests of national finance cannot be looked after because of the distrust with which every Minister must be regarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing I think that should be pointed out was that there was no specific promise given to these men in the sense that there were promises contained in the Treaty.  The Treaty was a definite bargain.  So far as these men were involved in a bargain it was with the old Sinn Fein organisation and with perhaps the old Dáil.  It was when they were resigning and promised that something would be done for them that there was a bargain, but there was no bargain when General Collins made his very carefully worded statement.  They were out then.  He was only asked for the intentions of the Government in regard to them, and his intentions in regard to them, and he took the very greatest care possible not to go into any details so that the proper consideration of the whole matter might not be prejudiced.  In the same <Col N="831" /> way, anything anybody has said is merely by way of a statement of the intentions of the Government in regard to them.</P>
    <P>There were not promises made to them when they resigned that they were going to be treated exactly as well as the men who stayed on.  Nobody knew what was going to happen at that time.  These promises that were made afterwards were not promises in the sense of being bargains, but were statements of the intentions of the Government. If the State and the Exchequer demanded it, and if we were only able to give them half the terms, we would be entitled to reduce their pensions to half what would be given the men who stayed on.  We are giving them what we think can be afforded in view of the heavy burden on the country.  I dissent from the view that because in certain circumstances we were forced to do a certain thing, we should now, of our own volition, give extravagant compensation to these men.</P>
    <P>I think we cannot afford a luxury of that sort.  It would be like cutting off your nose to spite your face, and we ought not to assent to the doctrine that because we were forced to do a certain thing in a particular case in order to gain the victory and the advantages that we have got by the Treaty, we should now throw away the money of the nation.  There is no reason why these men should be given a very big lump sum now because they resigned some years ago.  They have been living in the interval, and probably some have been earning more or less, and there should be no justification, in view of the state of the Exchequer, and the finances of the country, for handing out to them very considerable sums of money.  When we go back to the date of the Act, I think we are not doing very badly by them at all, and those who have had any service will have substantial sums given to them and they will have the future before them.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Order should be referred back.  There is no injustice being done in it to these men.  They are being fairly well treated, and I do not think we can afford the luxury of <Col N="832" /> extravagant treatment.  I think we are under an obligation to many of them. I believe many of them did make very real sacrifices when they came out at the time they did.  They did a thing that certainly was as good in its own way as other men did who got a great deal of praise for it; but there were many amongst them whose motives were not perhaps so altruistic.  There were men who came out whose motives were selfish.  We cannot separate them from the others, and we can hardly get out of our minds the fact that we are bound to be giving pensions to men who are unworthy.</P>

But it cannot be proven, and you could not demand strict proof of a man's motives. Cases had to be let through or you had to risk cutting out nine-tenths of genuine cases.  I think there is nobody who has examined it, when the matter has been sifted to the last, but will realise that we will be giving pensions to men who are not worthy of any consideration amongst the men who are deserving of the very utmost consideration.</P>

      <P>The speech of the Minister is really most disheartening and disconcerting.  It practically tells us, from the beginning to the end, that in all these matters you have to trust to the Minister for the time being.  He almost goes so far as to say that the Regulations which ought to have the force of law are quite unnecessary&mdash; that you may trust to the Minister, and that it is better to trust to the Minister. I wonder whether he considers it necessary to have any Regulations of any kind or to publish any Order.  If it is desirable to publish Orders, if it is necessary to have Orders or Acts of <Col N="833" /> Parliament, surely it is desirable to lay down in those Acts and Orders what the Dáil intends, and not to leave these matters to the discretion of the Minister for the time being.  The Minister practically suggests that it is far better to trust the Minister, and, in fact, his ruling principle is not to be bothered by Acts or Orders or limitations placed upon him by law or regulation, but to leave these matters to the discretion of the Minister.  That may be very good for certain men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I wish to say I used no such argument or made no such suggestion.  I made reference to the carrying out of Regulations that will be laid down, and not to acting without Regulations or on discretion at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he desires to act under Regulations laid down, but when it is suggested that under a particular Regulation certain things are possible that are not desirable he says: &ldquo;Leave that to the discretion of the Minister.&rdquo;  The very fact that it is possible that an undesirable thing may be done, strictly within the Order, surely warrants the argument that the Order should be referred back for reconsideration and amendment, so that these things which are undesirable should be prevented by the Order, and that the Ministers in the future will thereby be acting within the Order.  The Minister for Finance had better discuss the ethics of this question with the President.  The President, several times within the last eighteen months, made appeals to the Dáil on the strength of certain promises which were not part of the Treaty bargain, and which were not embodied in the Treaty, and asked the Dáil to agree to implement certain agreements that were come to outside the Treaty.  He put it to the Dail that we were bound in honour to implement those obligations. The President, even in the early stages of to-day's proceedings, referred to undertakings that were given to the country by the Minister for Finance, and says &ldquo;we are bound in honour to carry through those undertakings in regard to economy.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance speaks of the promises made <Col N="834" /> by General Collins as not being in the nature of a bond, and not the price of a bargain.  It is new doctrine to be told that you are only bound to keep those bonds which you were forced to enter, and that you were not bound to keep those obligations that you entered into voluntarily and freely.  That is new doctrine and very sad doctrine to come from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson is misrepresenting me.  I did not say that.  I said that I had made no reference to bonds entered into voluntarily at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will recollect, and the Dáil will recollect, that the Minister referred to the Treaty bargain, which was extravagant, but a bargain.  That is, undertakings were entered into by this country because the circumstance compelled it and at the price of the Treaty.  I say that is an obligation that is entered into under pressure, but that bond must be kept, according to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not dissent, but I say that the other obligation that was entered into on behalf of the country and on behalf of the Government by the active head of the Government&mdash;at the moment I do not know what his position was&mdash;was a free promise, and surely it is our duty to carry out that promise, which was freely entered into, as well as the one which was entered into under some sort of pressure. I think that the Minister at least, almost before anybody else, should remember that as the time these promises were entered into, they were entered into on behalf of the Government of this country.  They were entered into on behalf of the Dáil and the Ministry of the Dáil even at the time that General Collins made his promise in February, 1922, after the Provisional Government had been set up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall in a minute. Not only were the Provisional Government binding themselves, through <Col N="835" /> General Collins, but the Ministry of which the Minister for Finance was a member, through the Minister for Home Affairs definitely in the Dáil entered into an undertaking not only on this occasion to the policemen who had resigned or been dismissed, but to the Dáil itself.  Deputy Davin has pointed out&mdash;and I want to lay stress upon the words&mdash;that General Collins promised, though I admit that it was not a promise, in so many words, on behalf of the Government.  It might well have been taken to be such by the recipients in view of the position of General Collins at the time.  The words were&mdash; that the suggestion that these resigned and dismissed men should be dealt with no less generously than the members of the R.I.C. who had continued to serve had his very strong support. But very much more explicitly and in a very much more binding manner, the Minister for Home Affairs on the 10th October, 1922, said: &ldquo;It is intended that such men will receive as generous terms as if they had remained in the force until the date of their disbandment; no less generous than if they had remained in the force.&rdquo;  And then he goes on to promise that &ldquo;legislation will be required to cover such compensation, and it is proposed to introduce an appropriate measure as soon after the enactment of the Constitution as is practicable.&rdquo;  There was as specific a promise as it was possible to make to the Dáil&mdash;that the treatment would be no less generous than if they had remained in the Force.  Now, I want to ask whether the proposed Order is treating these men as generously as they would have been treated had they remained in the Force?  To me that is the only issue. If it is proved that that can be accomplished by this Order then I for one will have nothing to say.  But I submit that, as far as one can read it, the Order goes very far from carrying out that undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To begin with, the date from which the pension is to be given is a very long time distant from the time it would have begun had they remained in the Force.  Had they remained in the Force their pension would have begun on the 31st August, 1922.  It is <Col N="836" /> not proposed to begin their pension until August, 1923.  On that account it is not as generous as it would have been, had they remained in the Force. The Minister says that the Act prevents it, and that he has not power under the Act to begin these pensions at the earlier date.  May I take it that had he the power, he would be willing? Apparently it is not so, as the Minister indicates dissent.  Then what is the purpose of his raising that objection? From his dissent it appears he does not desire to make these pensions retrospective, and this quoting of his disability under the Act is only for the purposes of debate, and is not his real mind in the matter.  The men who remained in the Force and who are being paid under the terms of the Treaty, are being paid out of Irish funds.  Had these other men remained in the Force they would have been paid equally out of Irish funds.  Is it then contended that no difference would have taken place in the history of the last few years had these men remained in the Force, that though they were invited by representatives of the Government to resign to prove that they were not traitors to the Government that then existed, their resignation was of no value, and that they ought to be penalised for their actions?  That seems to me to be the deduction that one must draw from the contention of the Minister.  Had the men remained in the Force they would have obtained pensions in excess of the maximum fixed by the Order.  Again there is a departure from the terms.  They are not being treated as generously as they would have been, had they remained in the Force Again, on the question raised by Deputy Davin in paragraph 4 regarding the veto of the Minister for Home Affairs, there is of course a provision in regard to the men who were disbanded which is equally to apply to these men who were dismissed or resigned. If the disbanded men obtained appointments under the Government, as many of them have, their pensions would be treated according to a standard method.  Surely, under the promise that was given to these men they should be treated in the same manner. There is a regular course that could be <Col N="837" /> adopted and surely should be adopted in view of the promise made. Why, then, have a special provision made in this Order to apply to dismissed and resigned men which differs from the regulations applying to disbanded men when you promised to put them in the same position as they would have been in had they waited until disbandment? Again, I think there is a distinct breach of the promise.  There is in existence a Committee, presided over by Judge Wylie, which might be considered quite competent to deal with the question of suitability of employment inasmuch as that Committee does in respect of Civil Servants adjudge the quality and the character of the employment that is being offered.  If a civil servant is removed to a different class of work from that which he has been engaged in, prior to the Treaty, then this Committee, over which Judge Wylie presides, is, I understand, a court which will decide the question of suitability.</P>
    <P>Again, you see, you have machinery in existence whereby the question of suitability may be decided, but if there is employment offered by any Department of the Government&mdash;and this I would ask the Dáil to bear in mind&mdash;&ldquo;no pension shall be payable under this Order to any person who shall be offered an appointment in any branch of the public service of Saorstát Eireann which in the opinion of the Minister for Home Affairs is reasonably suitable for him, and shall have declined to accept such appointment.&rdquo;  That may be a temporary postman's job, for instance. The pensioner declines that temporary post and the Postmaster reports the fact.  The Minister for Home Affairs might save the Exchequer certain sums weekly under that Order, and there is no appeal, as Deputy Bryan Cooper pointed out.  Any other Minister may offer a pensioned policeman a temporary or permanent post, and if it is refused on the ground of unsuitability, the Minister for Home Affairs may be appealed to, and if he says, even in a particular case, that it should not have been refused, and that the man is suitable, then the Minister for Finance finds his <Col N="838" /> balance at the end of the year so much greater.  The Minister for Finance, of course, waives all that aside, and says it was only intended that the class of employment should be decided by the Minister for Home Affairs.  How does he know that?  There may be successors to either of these Ministers, and there may be successors to the Minister's advisers, who will have quite a different view of this matter from that which they have, and under Clause 4 of the Order these things are not only possible but probable.  I think that in all the circumstances, and especially in view of this specific undertaking to the Dáil in October, 1922, of the Minister for Home Affairs that the legislation which was to be introduced would provide that as generous terms would be given to the men as if they had remained in the force until the date of their disbandment&mdash;in view of that undertaking to the Dáil&mdash;I think the Minister should accept this amendment, take back the Order, and reconsider it with a view to implementing that undertaking and satisfying the obligation of honour at least.</P>

      <P>Lest my silence should be misunderstood in any way, I wish to say that I approve of this Order.  My state of mind with regard to it is something more positive than acquiescence.  I think that the Order does substantial justice to the five or six hundred men whom it compensates, and I think that these five or six hundred men are five or six hundred particularly fortunate citizens of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible after a period like that of the last four or five years, to adjust equities to a nicety, to say to this man: &ldquo;You suffered so much,&rdquo; and to compensate him accordingly, and to that man: &ldquo;You sacrificed so much and your compensation is blank pounds, shillings and pence.&rdquo;  Here are 500 or 600 men who, beyond question, did make a certain sacrifice and are receiving from the nation a definite compensation. The thing must be taken in its setting.  It must be taken with some advertence to the fact that there are many hundreds and thousands in the State who made far greater sacrifices, for whom the State can do nothing now <Col N="839" /> and will do nothing in the future. There is a saying that &ldquo;the devil himself knows not the thought of man,&rdquo; but the task that was set to the Committee, which was set up under the auspices of my Department, was a task which, according to that dictum, would baffle the devil himself.  It was to analyse the motives that led these men to tender their resignation to the police authorities of the time.  I quite agree with the Minister for Defence that no sifting, however careful, painstaking and conscientious by the Committee, could ensure that all the men whom they certified were men whose resignation was due to national sympathy. 1,100 cases came before the Committee. 600 odd were passed by that Committee, and there is no member of the Committee who would put his hand on his heart and say: &ldquo;I believe all those men resigned genuinely through sympathy with the national movement.&rdquo; A man's motives are subtle and complex.  Even the person himself often is not clear as to the exact motive which led him to a particular act.  It is often a combination of motives, light and shade.  &ldquo;On the one hand all those people are in favour of this movement. My mother and brothers are having a bad time at home because I am in the police force.  Further, I may be shot in an ambush, and it might be a better thing to get out and work on the farm.&rdquo;  Where is the motive?  Self-preservation is the first law of nature. Affection for his mother and sisters, who are being cut by the neighbours at home because of the son's occupation, or idealistic national sentiment was so effervescing in the mind of a man as to make him run to the depot and put in his resignation.  Here, five or six hundred men are more lucky than hundreds and thousands through the country who took genuine risks and for whom no compensation, through the Oireachtas, will be forthcoming. Young men all through the country sacrificed the most precious and pivotal years of their careers in and around the twenties and are neither asking nor expecting, and, if they did, would not get, compensation from the nation for those sacrifices.  Men spent years in <Col N="840" /> jail, years in internment.  Men have had their health shattered, their careers ruined, their business destroyed.  They got no compensation, but these five or six hundred men are getting compensation from the State for sacrifices which undoubtedly they made, but which in the setting were not abnormal and did not stand out as exceptional. Promises have been quoted and it has been put up to us that it is a matter of the personal honour of one dead Minister, and one living Minister, that the terms should be such and such and not otherwise.  We are to be bound by the letter.  The terms are to be identical with the terms that disbanded men were fortunate enough to secure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Not less generous. The disbanded men, no doubt, were fortunate. It was a bargain.  The men who resigned are getting credit for their actual years of service, plus twelve.  The complaint is that they are not getting any credit for the interval between their resignation and the total disbandment of the force.  Now I think it is an excessive claim to say that they should get a pension for those years in which they were free to take up other employment, and in which there was no particular worry or anxiety put upon them whatever. They were to get the same terms as they would have got had they remained in the force.  Had they remained in the force, God knows what they would have got, or might have got.  They might have got six feet of Irish earth; they might have got many things.  They are doing well.  The Order brought before the Dáil to-day by the Minister for Finance is substantial justice to them, as I hold, in all the circumstances, and is a full and adequate fulfilment of any promises that were made.  I just do not want to remain silent upon this question lest it be thought that my approval of the Order was more in the nature of a grudge of acquiescence to be only expressed by my &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; if, and when this Order goes to a division.  I think the promise made has been kept, and I think, further, that these 600 men are 600 very fortunate young Irish citizens.</P>

It has been suggested that he has not as good a case.  I agree.  Now, it is not a question whether these 600 men that a Government Commission approved of are deserving or not.  To begin with, a Commission was set up, and it approved of 600 claims as deserving. It is not now a question whether they are deserving or not. There may be some exceptions&mdash;some who are not deserving&mdash;but that is not the question.  This is a question of a promise; it is a question of honour, and to my mind it is a question of national honesty or dishonesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say Deputy Johnson has not at all exaggerated the case.  I think he put a reasonable and fair interpretation on the words used in the promise made by the old Sinn Fein Organisation, and the words contained in the statement or promise made by the late General Collins. I think he put the case reasonably and fair, and if there is any meaning in words at all, I think it is the meaning he has put upon them.  This question of suitable employment has been referred to.  Perhaps I do not voice the sentiments of many Deputies, but I believe that the most suitable employment for these men is the employment that they were brought up in, and the employment that they were trained to. With all due respect to the present Civic Guard, I think the inclusion of some of these men, whose credentials were above suspicion, and whose national sympathies were above suspicion, would do good.  I think the present Civic Guard, creditable and all as they are, would benefit by the addition of some of these men.  I was speaking to some of these men some time ago, and they said they would be delighted to go into the present Civic Guard and to perform the duties they were trained to perform.  I think that is the most suitable employment they could be offered, and I believe that employment has been denied them.  If that is so, I do not think there is very much use of using the words &ldquo;suitable employment.&rdquo; It is not mentioned here in its proper sense.  The employment they are to get is State employment, but there can be no difference between employment <Col N="842" /> in the Civic Guard controlled by the State and employment in any other capacity controlled by the State.</P>

      <P>There is no use in these fine distinctions.  A good many of the men who resigned took more risk than the ordinary men in the country.  They went out of the Constabulary; their opinions were known everywhere, and the Black-and-Tans in the country knew them, and I honestly believe that those R.I.C. men who resigned took more risks than the average man in the movement.  I do not think that the promise made by the Sinn Fein organisation ought to be gone back on.  This is a small matter; it is not a question of much money, and I think the promise made ought to be kept, and it is not kept under this Order, or at any rate, it is not kept in the way it was made at the time, or in the way that those who heard thought it would be kept.</P>

      <P>To my mind, if there is any honour in this State, it is bound up in the way the ex-R.I.C. men are to be dealt with in the Order now before the Dáil, and not only is the honour of the State bound up in that matter, but also the honour of the Ministers sitting on the benches opposite.  Those of u who were associated with the Republican movement in those days up and down the country, went to the homes of these men and were responsible in a way for bringing a great many of them out of the service of the R.I.C.  At that time, responsible Ministers in the Government to-day were members of the Sinn Fein organisation, and they directed that this work, to which I have referred, should be done and it was done.  Those of us who were in the Republican movement at the time feel that we encouraged these men to give up the employment that they then held, on the promise that the State would stand by them, and would see full justice done to them.  The Order which is now before the Dáil is not, in my opinion, doing justice to them.  There are men to-day who served in the R.I.C. at that time, and who did not leave the <Col N="843" /> service, and they are now able to walk about with a good pension for life.</P>

      <P>A good many of them are living in Ireland, too.  My point is that the men who gave up the employment they then held, and decided to stand in with the people of Ireland, are, many of them, in sore want and distress. A great many of them are married men with large families, and with very little means to support them. These men are now waiting to see if the pledges given to them by members of the Sinn Fein organisation at the time, and by men occupying seats on the Government benches to-day, are going to be redeemed or not.  They are anxious to know if they are going to be as well treated as those who stood against the country in those trying days.  I think it will be accepted that, as far as this Order is concerned at any rate, the men who left the R.I.C. and stood in with the people against the foreigners are not being as fairly or as generously treated as the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Home Affairs in his speech used the word &ldquo;substantial.&rdquo; He, I think, measured the justice that is to be done to these men by the ability of the State of the day to do justice, as he sees it now.  But that was not considered when these men were asked to <Col N="844" /> give up the positions they then held. It was felt at that time that, whatever did happen to the State, or whatever form of Government evolved out of the struggle that was then being waged, these men would be fairly treated, and that everyone in the State would be a party to seeing that they were fairly treated.  I believe that if the Minister for Home Affairs were to inquire from the young men of the country who gave the best years of their life to serving the interests of the nation, he would find that the opinion of these men is that the ex-R.I.C. men dealt with under this Order should be as well treated at least as those who continued to serve until the police force was disbanded.  On the question of the employment to be offered to these men, I am in agreement with Deputy Johnson that it should be suitable employment.  If a man is offered a post that he is not suited for, either on account of his previous experience, his state of health, or things of that kind, and that he does not see his way to accept it, it is provided under this Order that he may not receive any pension at all.  I think that is not fair.  If that is the attitude that Ministers are going to take up against men who gave their services to Ireland when the call was made on them, I say that Ireland is not doing these men justice.</P>

      <P>The object of the amendment is fairly clear.

      <P>I do not know that the amendment is necessary.  What is meant by &ldquo;vacant site&rdquo; in the Bill is what the Deputy has in mind.  We understand that sites may be encumbered with rubbish or old ruins or something of that sort, but that is what the Ministry of Local Government has in mind as &ldquo;a vacant site.&rdquo;  If Deputy Good thinks that is not sufficient, and requires to have this term taken out, I do not see any objection, but I think it complicates it rather than otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have information about this.  Does the acceptance of the amendment mean that stables might be converted into houses, or might be deemed to be houses for purposes of reconstruction? The word &ldquo;reconstruct&rdquo; is to mean repair, &ldquo;or reconstruct an existing house or stable.&rdquo;  Is that what is intended?  If you insert the words &ldquo;or building&rdquo; is it intended to apply to any reconstruction of a building which might be converting it into a house?  I think we should understand what is the intention and find out whether the amendment really carries out the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the meaning.  I have seen cases where stables have been made suitable for dwelling-houses by reconstruction, and I have heard of one case where a gentleman has reconstructed his garage as a diningroom.  As I believe that is the intention I would be willing to accept the amendment.  There may be cases where huge buildings, or even stables, or other accommodation, might be adaptable for the purpose of providing accommodation at a small price.  In that case it would be an economic proposition. There are safeguards with regard to sanitation appurtenances and so on in another part of the Bill, so that it is not likely any person would be allowed a subsidy towards rendering a house a habitable dwelling, and at the same time offend against any of the laws of sanitation.  It is not intended, and I do not think it is meant by the amendment, that that should be <Col N="851" /> the effect, but that where buildings are capable of adaptation or reconstruction as dwellinghouses they will not be ruled out by the fact that they are not at the present moment dwellinghouses.</P>

Protection is provided to see that buildings converted are suitable for the purpose, and that all the operations are such as would enable the Government to make a grant for conversion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a certain element of danger about this reconstruction problem.  I think it should be surrounded by safeguards.  For instance, a building could be reconstructed and made into a house, and would be perfectly useless except for the man who reconstructed it.  Money spent on it might be for a purely local advantage that would be no benefit to the general public.  If this Bill concentrates upon providing accommodation where it is required, it would be good business to reconstruct a house there. If a house was in a position where it would not be in the public interests to have it, I think the Minister should have power to refuse public grants in such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 covers the point mentioned by Deputy Hewat. The real reason for this is that a person having some sort of claim to public funds for the provision of houses gets accommodation at a much smaller price.  It is an economic proposition to facilitate him in regard to that.  If you take it in another way, a man at present living in a house sees an opportunity for reconstructing a building that would make a suitable habitation for himself, and as a result another house is made available for someone else.  Congestion is relieved to that extent. The congestion problem is the real problem, and, at the present moment, any alleviation of it is a real advantage. To that extent I am prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;In line 22, to add after the word &ldquo;houses&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or flats.&rdquo;  The reason I suggest that should be put in is that I hope that these moneys will be available for the reconstruction of a number of these large old city houses. It would be a terrible thing to think that in these old squares, where there are some fine houses, money should not be provided for adapting them to city circumstances and to the need of housing many of the working classes.  The difficulty in regard to the wording at the moment is that on each floor in the house you might have, I suppose, some half dozen different flats.  You could not call them houses within a house, and I think that the description by which they are generally known in the trade is flats.  I think this defines the idea in the minds of many that these houses could be adapted as flats for housing the working classes, and that in that way they could be utilised, as they are at the moment, in many cases utilised without being adapted.</P>

      <P>I hope the President can see his way to accept this amendment. Deputy Good has in his mind the same purpose that I am trying to press, that something should be done to improve the conditions of habitation of these old houses in Dublin, known at present as tenement dwellings.  In that way we will do something directly for the poorest class of tenant in Dublin.  The Bill, as at present framed, will help them, I admit, indirectly, in that it will ease the pressure, so that the poorer tenant will have a wider choice of rooms.  I think something might be done, and done economically, directly.  It would require very little money to convert some of these old houses into most comfortable habitations. <Col N="853" /> I think the President is probably better acquainted than most of us with the conditions of life of the poorer workmen of Dublin, but he will learn that in many cases tenants prefer the bigger rooms of the older tenements to the small rooms of the new houses.  I would press the President to consider this amendment carefully.  It will lead to some consequential amendments in the Bill, but I think it will produce a great deal of relief at a very small outlay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was drafted, I think it was the intention that the drawing or plans for these houses should be prescribed plans which were already in the hands of the Department.  The President will remember that when he was introducing the Bill&mdash;or during its Second Stage&mdash;I asked him if these new houses, that we hope will be erected under this Bill, were to be limited to these prescribed plans, and the answer he gave was that they were <Col N="854" /> not, that these designs would not be compulsory.  That being so, I think it would be necessary to alter the wording of several clauses, and I propose that where the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; occurs you add the words &ldquo;or approved.&rdquo; That means that the new houses may be in accordance with the prescribed plans, or they may be in accordance with plans approved of by the Ministry.  I think the President will see the object of this addition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand whether the Deputy intends that the approval shall be before building. If so, then the term &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; might be held to cover approval, although it is an approved plan submitted by an outside architect or builder.  As the amendment reads, it might mean approved after building, and I think that is somewhat risky. The approval ought to be before the building is done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no particular objection to accepting the words &ldquo;or approved,&rdquo; although I am hazy about what use they will be to the Bill.  While we have quite a considerable number of plans, we do not intend to confine builders or architects to those plans, and if &ldquo;approved&rdquo; means that we have to approve of the plans it may possibly occasion a good deal of delay.  A good number of plans may come in and, as usually happens in these cases, architects may see something which hurts their eyes or sense of proportion, and a suggestion may come from them for an alteration here and there.  But if the houses were built they would be more likely to say, &ldquo;Give the man his £50, £80, or £100,&rdquo; and that ends it.  If the Deputy likes I will look into it before the Report Stage.  I take it that if it means a delay or anything of that sort he will not press the amendment, and that it is only with a view to facilitating the builders that it is put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <P>That is so to a certain extent.  What I had in my mind is this, that though the Department has a number of these plans there might possibly be a number of cases in the country, and that owing to the situation and circumstances of the site these plans would not be suitable in those cases, and plans would have to be prepared for these particular circumstances, and before the builder proceeded with the scheme he would send plans up for the approval of the Ministry.  We want, in the Bill, to have that all arranged, so that the builder will not be compelled under circumstances where the prescribed plans do not apply to use the prescribed plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2, to insert a new Section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be and there is hereby constituted a Council of Architects to assist the Minister in the administration of this Act.  Such Council shall consist of three persons who shall be nominated by the Council of the Institute of Architects of Ireland and appointed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every design of every house in respect of which any grant shall be made under the provisions of this Act shall be submitted to such Council of Architects, who shall advise the Minister as to its suitability; and in making such advice the Council of Architects shall have special regard to the beauty and dignity of the building proposed to be erected.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall have power, and such power is hereby conferred on the Minister, to order that no grant be made in respect of any house the design of which has not been approved by the said Council of Architects.  The advice given by the said Council of Architects shall be made in writing, and such advice shall be laid before the Oireachtas at the request of any ten members of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The said Council of Architects shall further have power to recommend to the Minister, and the Minister may confirm by Order, the qualifications and professional standing of every person entitled to submit any design for any house in respect of <Col N="857" /> which a grant may be sought under the provisions of this Act.  Provided that every such Order made or confirmed by the Minister shall be forthwith laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and if either House shall, within twenty-one days of which such House has sat next after the Order is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling such Order, the Order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything done previously thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment more or less follows on what we have already been discussing in regard to the approval of the description of the plans, or, as I believe they should be more correctly described, designs.  I feel we are now making a very important departure in the State, and the houses that will be built during the next few years in pursuance of the arrangements made in this Bill will be houses that will remain, not merely for one generation, but several generations, and will give a kind of character and imprint even to the very civilisation that shall prevail in this country for a long time to come.  We know that if something of this kind had been adopted in England before the housing that followed on the industrial revival in the forties of the last century, we would have been saved some of those hideous eye-sores that have been not only destructive of all beauty in England in her industrial centres, but have actually produced, by their effects, a criminal class.  As students are well aware, people who live in certain circumstances of depravity and ugliness are influenced by them.  I have, therefore, suggested, and my amendment proposes, that a Council shall be appointed consisting of three architects to help the Minister in regard to designs that may be put forward in respect of the houses claiming, or desiring to claim, assistance under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is assumed that the Minister, in any event, will have to rely upon the advice of some architect, and it is hardly likely in any case that decisions of this kind will be taken by him without some kind of appeal to professional assistance.  If there is to be that appeal, then I urge that the appeal should <Col N="858" /> be given by persons appointed officially by the profession concerned.  The matter is one of some very considerable importance.  It might be argued, and it has already been suggested to me to-day in the Dáil, that an amendment of this kind might involve extra expense, not merely in the provision of this Council, because there the professional assistance that would be required would be so small an addition that the expense would be immaterial, but that such a Council might demand that kind of houses which, fulfilling certain requirements as to beauty of design, might be more costly than other houses that would be put up.  In reply to that, I would say that even if it were the case that a small additional cost would be incurred by making houses that would not in the course of ten, twelve or fifteen years, look like slum houses, and be in effect slum houses, even that small extra expense would be a right expense for the State to incur at this present moment.  But I think it will be found in practice that there will be no additional cost to the houses that will be built, and that, in fact, a saving might be made.  That I put forward. I had a very remarkable instance of it within the last seven or eight months. Approaching a certain town in a country district very well known to the President, because it lies in his constituency, I noticed that there was a row of cottages, or houses that might be dignified by the term &ldquo;cottages,&rdquo; and that were in effect and in fact the ordinary type of red brick houses one sees when approaching an ordinary industrial site in England, joined side by side, ugly to look upon, and obviously horrible to dwell within.  Then, as the town will grow in the course of time, it will be the natural centre for the creation of a slum.  The person in whose company I was informed me when I commented on these houses, that if the builder of them had been aware of local conditions he might have built from local stone houses that actually would have been cheaper and, even from an aesthetic point of view, far more comely to look at, and that would have resisted the natural tendency of that kind of house to become a slum of the future. I know I will be met by people who <Col N="859" /> will say to me that the word &ldquo;slum&rdquo; applies, not to houses in the country, but to houses in a city or a large town.</P>
    <P>I remember the most remarkable slum that I ever saw in my life when I was travelling in England.  On the brow of a hill twenty miles from any city or town there was one long line of miners' cottages&mdash;a horrible thing to see.  I believe that conditions of that kind could be avoided if there were to be a Council that would be giving its sole time and attention to a matter of this kind.</P>

      <P>They were designed probably by the builder who built them.  They were probably designed by a person who had no competence whatever to design them.  I feel these matters should be given attention to by persons who are competent.  No man should be allowed to-day to set up and give professional advice in respect to the health of an individual, if he were not properly qualified to give that advice by the profession to which he professes to belong; and no person should be entitled to give advice, or act on his own advice, in respect of a matter involving, not the health of an individual, but the health of the community at the time and the health of the community of the future.  I think this is a matter on which the responsibility should be imposed on the profession concerned, and I urge this amendment be accepted because it is along the lines of thought that actually have been adopted in the Constitution that calls for the creation of Councils of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced and is being taken through all its stages by the President.  When the President has brought it to its triumphant conclusion, he will pass it over into the hands of the Minister for Local Government and Health to administer.  I wish that I could have spoken here in the Dáil, if not directly, to the Minister for Local Government, whose primary responsibility it surely is, or that I could at least have spoken in his presence on a matter of this kind.  It does so happen that I hold certain hostages from <Col N="860" /> him.  I have a book which he himself wrote, in which there are many remarkable and eloquent passages.  I quote these words from the Minister for Local Government:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the future historian comes to write the story of the co-operative movement in Ireland he will probably say that Ireland has reason to be thankful to the English Government for one at least of the many tyrannical policies she adopted towards her, namely, that of arresting her economic development.  We have to thank her for the absence of the slum, especially in the few places where we were allowed to progress industrially, the smoke and smell of the factory, and the degraded and degenerate proletariat of the blackened and poisoned country-side.  Economic development will now come to Ireland, but it will come unattended by these terrible companions, disease, squalour, crime, hunger, vice and misery.  We have had the experience of the whole world to learn from, and if we do not learn the lesson it teaches correctly, we have no one but ourselves to blame.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say England to-day, in its houses, and the type of civilisation that these houses connote, that were built as a result of what has been done in England during the last fifty years, are something from which we can learn.  If England had before herself the lesson of her own past, as we have, she would do what I am urging we should now do, and that is, that properly competent persons should lay out the lines and designs of the houses to be built, in order that the Minister might be able to rely on competent and professional advice in that regard, and that we shall not within the next twenty years have to deplore the fact that when we had the opportunity to make careful plans ahead for what we might and should do, we neglected it.  If this amendment were accepted there would be appointed a Council that would be able to give its whole attention to this matter, so that the best could be done in order that in future houses should not be built that were degrading to look upon and that were the natural creation of the tenements and slums of the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering, when the Deputy was speaking, if he thinks that the Minister for Local Government is the person in his Department who looks after the designing of houses and the construction of them. From my experience of that Department, I am aware that there are several capable architects employed there.  If Deputy Figgis wants to augment the number of architects already employed in the Department by the appointment of three gentlemen from the Institute of Architects, I think we will have something tending towards a multiplicity of new Boards, that was never intended.  If, on the other hand, he wishes to burden the scheme with the salaries or fees that these gentlemen will have to get if they are employed, I do not think it will be for the good of the State or the good of the unfortunate people who will have to pay the high rents that will be charged for these houses.</P>
      <P>I know from personal experience the type of houses that have been built, and the appearance that it was necessary for them to have, in country towns. They were built for accommodation. Listening to Deputy Figgis, one would think that we were now going to build grand mansions, beautifully erected buildings, and that we have millions of money to spend.  Instead we have a miserable £300,000.  I could understand if we were going to build great castles that we might take all the precautions he outlines, but with the limited resources at our disposal I do not see that there is any necessity for the provision of this suggested sub-section at all.  I hope the President will not accept it.</P>

      <P>I beg to support the argument put forward by Deputy Hughes.  Deputy Figgis made no suggestion, when discussing the feasibility of setting up this Board, as to how it would affect cost.  He made a statement that it probably would not increase the cost.  I suggest that this Board he is proposing would be more or less in the position of the Commissions that look at one side of a question without looking at the financial side, and their report will be precisely in the position that many reports of Commissions have to be in, because those <Col N="862" /> Commissions do not look at all sides of the question or take into account the amount of money necessary.  They would have to be turned down.  In my opinion, delay and difficulty would be the only result of adopting an amendment of this kind.  Coming from the Deputy who spoke so strongly in regard to other appointments, it is refreshing to see him suggesting the appointment of, I presume, three fairly highly qualified people.  Like a Government architect, they would be independent of the Government, and are not bound to take into account questions of expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Dáil is taking Deputy Figgis and his speech too seriously.  I thought he was trying to find a permanent home for the Oireachtas, by the terms of his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talks about a Council of Architects who shall advise the Minister as to its suitability, and &ldquo;making such advice, the Council of Architects shall have special regard to the beauty and dignity of the building proposed to be erected.&rdquo;  I do not know does Deputy Figgis mean some of the words contained in the new Sub-section that he proposes.  He also said in his speech that he objects to houses being built near each other.  Does he propose that these houses should be standing in their own grounds?  I think he should have some regard to the possibilities of the money at the disposal of the Government, and the possibilities of providing houses in towns and around the country. I think this proposed Sub-section is a most ridiculous Sub-section, and could only be based on the assumption that previous Local Government Boards had never any assistance from their architects, or that their architects were incapable of advising them.  Anybody who has had any connection with Local Government schemes knows that they had very good advice, that several plans had to be submitted to them, and that they selected a series of designs that suited the requirements of the town.  That.  I think, will be the case again.  I think their designs will meet the requirements that we have in view. We do not want too much of this beauty and dignity.  We want good houses for the people, and we must <Col N="863" /> have them cheap if we are to have them at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputies have not entered into the spirit of this amendment.  The paragraph that has been referred to, and I think the paragraph which Deputy Figgis laid most stress upon, is only the preamble to the really important paragraph&mdash;that is, the last one.  Deputies should really realise what they are opposing. The proposition that Deputy Figgis has put before the Dáil is that there should be set up the equivalent of the Medical Council, or the Incorporated Law Society, or the Bar Council of which we have heard so much, which will decide the qualifications of the people who are engaged in designing houses; that there will be established a Corporation of Architects, self-contained, self-governed, and a law unto themselves.  Now that may be a very desirable object, and I am sure Deputy Good will approve of it, and so will Deputy Sir James Craig.  I almost think that Deputy Gorey ought to approve of that principle.  But I raise the question&mdash;is it desirable to introduce it just in this fashion as an amendment to this temporary housing Bill, when, at the outside, the number of houses to be built in the whole of the Free State is 3,000, and when it is very questionable whether anything like that number will be built?  We are asked, incidentally, to establish by law this Incorporated Society of Architects that will be endowed with a monopoly of house-designing.  It may be a very desirable object, and may well be argued on its merits.  That is the kernel of this Section, and I thought, perhaps, Deputies would like to express their views upon that proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how far Deputy Figgis has had the advice of any of those members of the Institute that he mentions, but it appears to me that, looking at this amendment in the most favourable light, it radiates a sort of goodwill towards humanity, and endeavours to improve conditions and to increase the beauty of our towns and countryside.  The facts are that slums grow up or slums <Col N="864" /> are generated from conditions which are more the conditions of the inhabitants than the actual bricks and mortar.  In other words, you rarely see houses, cottages, or anything else, the property of the occupiers, degenerating into a slum.  It usually goes the other way&mdash;that where they have no interest in the houses, and where there is no attraction to keep the property in good order, it degenerates into a slum.  Now, there are two or three criticisms I would like to pass on this new Section.  One is, that two things appear to me to be confounded.  You have in Deputy Figgis's mind the landscape gardener and the architect.  The two are not the same.  You may have a splendidly-designed house, and it may hurt the eye-even of an aesthetic observer like Deputy Figgis.  It may be necessary under this Bill to build long rows of houses.  You do not hear of people saying that Gardiner Street is an objectionable thoroughfare; it is a thoroughfare of fine houses, but with the same monotonous prospect of bricks and windows The same monotonous, magnificent windows are there in house after house.  But when one sees smaller houses, one says: &ldquo;Look at the hideous monotony, &ldquo;particularly in the case of persons who do not realise what a change it is to get into that hideous monotony from the great big tenement house, which was originally a splendid building, but has degenerated because it was nobody's business to keep it in order.  The landlord's interest is to get all he can out of it, and the tenant holds it is the landlord's duty to look after repairs.  This Bill aims at giving houses to people who will look after them, and giving them at a fair price. Even where the builder comes in, when constructing a house without an architect, he will be facilitated with the designs compiled by people who have given years of study to this particular question.  Now, architects, as such, may be divided into various orders.  You will get some architects&mdash;brilliant men, who have made their names household words&mdash;who are hopeless in the designing of working-class dwellings.  I have known one, myself, a man who designed magnificently for an institution or anything <Col N="865" /> of that sort, but who designed the very monotonous dwellings that were condemned a few moments ago by Deputy Figgis.  It is scarcely fair, I think, to the Ministry of Local Government to put up a section of this sort, having regard to the fact that for the last eighteen months or two years they have been engaged in this work of supervising and looking after contracts, tenders and designs, and in every conceivable form of activity in connection with house building.  If I were to disclose to the Dáil and make public how complex these activities have been, I am not sure that there would not be some people peacefully picketing these officials and the Ministry of Local Government, and I do not think that would be fair.  But I can say this, that some of the work that has been done by these officials can be viewed.  If we only go to the South County Dublin and see the labourers' cottages built there, I challenge contradiction that there could be designed a more suitable and a more durable house, or a house of a more general standard of excellence than there is in that area.  We have, I believe, in the Ministry of Local Government one of the architects responsible for the designing and the subsequent construction of those houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that there is nothing which is proposed to be affected under this particular section that has not already been provided for, except one thing&mdash;a Council of Architects.  Such a Council has either to be honorary or paid and, if honorary, you are imposing on it conditions to which I do not think any body of professional men would submit. That is, having given their fiat on the suitability of design, it is to be subject to the examination of members. It comes up for criticism and for condemnation if the Dáil thinks fit.  I do not know that any professional man would stand that.  Take for instance the case of a doctor.  A doctor prescribes for a headache, but if his prescription is to be made the subject of a motion here condemning him, we would not have him prescribing.  It is the same with the architect.  I think everything is intended to be affected by that, except one thing and that is the landscape gardener, and, to some <Col N="866" /> extent, that is provided for by the regulations and by-laws of the local authorities themselves.  I think what the Deputy has in mind has already been provided for, and what is otherwise intended is impracticable at this stage, as it would delay the construction of these houses, and would not be an improvement on the present position.</P>

      <P>I did not put forward this amendment with any intention of delay, and as long as I have drawn attention to the essential matter in it I am satisfied.  That essential matter is that at the outset of this project, care should be taken to see that not merely the right pattern of house be built but that the responsibility should be laid upon the profession concerned.  So far, my object has been achieved, and I will not press my amendment, but I would like to deal with one comment made by Deputy Hughes, and repeated by Deputies O'Sullivan and Gorey.  The assumption was made that when you talk about beauty and dignity you mean a palace.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan said that the Oireachtas, in considering the matter, would not pay attention to the financial side.  The other two Deputies did make that clear reference, and I say, you may have a simple cottage with dignity and beauty and have a palace ugly in every aspect. There are, moreover, buildings in Ireland to-day built on the responsibility of local authorities and built from materials that give an ugly result, whereas, if the authorities were properly advised, they would have got another result at a much cheaper cost.  I agree with the President that slums do not come wholly from bricks and mortar but I believe they assist very largely towards that result.  The President has more or less met the point which I wished to make.  I believe ultimately that the responsibility for such matters will have to be laid on the profession that is concerned with them, and I would like to see that done now.  I do not press the amendment but I think that the substance of it is sound and <Col N="867" /> will have to be taken into consideration at an early date.</P>

      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this Section, this Act applies to a house which fulfils the following conditions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the house shall, in respect of its planning, construction, sanitation and number per acre, comply with the prescribed conditions:</P>
      <P>(b)  the house shall in respect of the size and number of rooms and necessary appurtenances be in general accordance with prescribed plans;</P>
      <P>(c)  the total area of all floors of the house measured inside the external walls shall not be less than 520 square feet, and shall not exceed 960 square feet;</P>
      <P>(d)  the house shall be certified by an appointed officer to have been completed in a proper and workmanlike manner;</P>
      <P>(e)  the erection or reconstruction of the house shall be begun after the passing of this Act, or, in special cases approved of by the Minister, within six months before the passing of this Act, and shall in any case be completed within twelve months after the passing of this Act, or within such further period not exceeding four months as the Minister may in any particular case allow;</P>
      <P>(f)  in the case of the reconstruction of an existing house, that existing house shall have been in a ruinous or defective condition at the passing of this Act, and shall, before the reconstruction is begun, be certified by an appointed officer to be capable of reconstruction as a house fulfilling the foregoing conditions;</P>
      <P>(g)  in the case of the erection of a new house, the site of such house shall not have been the subject of a claim under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923 (No. 15 of 1923);</P>

    <P>(2)  The provisions of this Act in relation to the reconstruction of houses shall apply only to houses situate in a county borough or urban district, or in a town having commissioners under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, or in a town having a population according to the latest census of not less than five hundred.</P>

      <P>I think that the object of the Deputy would be met if he were to leave all that matter in the hands of the Minister.  I do not think that the clause, as amended by him, would read properly.  He starts with the word &ldquo;house,&rdquo; and then introduces the words &ldquo;area of the site.&rdquo;  I suggest all that should be left to the approval of the Minister.  If there are certain departmental restrictions at the moment, a number of them might be relaxed in certain circumstances, and I think the object which the Deputy has in mind is to give the Ministry that power.  I think it might be met by eliminating all words after the word &ldquo;sanitation,&rdquo; and by putting in the words &ldquo;to be approved by the Ministry.&rdquo; Everything then would be subject to the approval of the Ministry.</P>

      <P>I think there is something more required than that. The sub-section speaks only of the planning, construction, and sanitation of the house.  I would imagine that there should be added the words &ldquo;or houses.&rdquo;  It does not deal with the surroundings, <Col N="869" /> or the plan, or the lay-out of the site.  It is desirable that the powers given to the Minister under this Bill should include not merely the house, or the houses, but the position of the houses.  The sub-section, as it stands, speaks of the number per acre. That, of course, it is desirable to retain, notwithstanding Deputy Good's next amendment.  There is something more than the number per acre required. There is also the lay-out, and the general plan of the scheme, that might be under discussion, and I think the section as drafted does not deal with the lay-out of the site or the general plan of another larger scheme that may be referred to, because it speaks all through of the &ldquo;house,&rdquo; and &ldquo;house&rdquo; means dwellinghouse.  There is no suggestion of groups of houses.</P>

      <P>I quite agree that that is a very important consideration, but Clause 11, Sub-section (1) gives the Minister power to prescribe certain conditions, and I take it that that would be one of them.  In addition to that there is the question of the time and manner of making grants and where, if the conditions are not complied with, the payment of partial instalments will be considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to lay-out, I am fairly satisfied that when it is proposed to start a scheme in which there are a number of houses the plan would be submitted, because the very question there of a number per acre arises, and although it does not specifically include the lay-out, I fear if you were to include that, it might complicate the matter and frighten the builders.  In other words, the Bill is itself requiring a network of conditions of one sort or another.  What has been put in gives some latitude, but the inclusion of a condition of this sort would leave us open to the charge, not alone that we were determined to get certain conditions with regard to building, but that we also wished to impose conditions as to the lay-out.</P>

      <P>I would just like to make a point which I do not want to urge too strongly.  It seems that the Section with which we are now dealing only has in view the house itself, and seems rather to suggest individual houses.  The only exception I can see is when you use the words &ldquo;and number per acre.&rdquo;  Surely it was not intended that all other questions, planning and lay-out of the scheme, should be left unconditional.  Surely there was an intention to have some supervision over the plan of any scheme which is accepted?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This touches the same point.  I think under this Bill it would be very unfortunate if we were to tie up the Ministry or to arrange that they would not have latitude to deal with certain prescribed sites.  There are difficulties in connection with it.  There are many sites of that nature in the city.  I think to impose limitations on a Ministry that if so many cottages cannot be got per acre the scheme must be discarded, is a bad thing.  If we are anxious to get houses we must join together to remove the restrictions on getting them.  I do not want those restrictions <Col N="871" /> unfairly removed.  We want them removed without causing great difficulty. I suggest in that case power might be given to the Ministry to use their own opinion in matters of this kind.</P>

      <P>I do not know how it can be read into it, that the house shall, in respect of its planning, construction and sanitation, be approved by the Ministry.  I do not know whether the Minister would have power in the event of its being left to him alone to object.  Say if he got 56 houses to the acre.  I believe that number is on an acre in the City of Dublin.  I do not see how you can object to 40 per acre without some condition being set down in black and white, limiting it.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the President that there are two points in this, the planning of the house on the site, and prescribed conditions. That would govern the number of houses on the site.  In any case, if the first amendment is limited to the planning of the house, then it leaves the whole of that matter in the discretion of the Ministry.  If you take that in conjunction with Clause 11, it must be in accordance with prescribed conditions, laid down by the Ministry.  You <Col N="872" /> have both points.  Those are covered by the two Sections.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1) <i>(a)</i> after the word `conditions,' line 51, to add the words `except that in existing streets in Borough or Urban areas the Minister may waive the condition limiting the number of houses per acre to suit such special cases.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>This really will meet occasional cases that will arise in urban or borough areas where you may have a site for a certain number of houses.  The regulation respecting the number of houses per acre would be more generous with regard to the amount of ground allotted to each house than would be possible to conceive in such cases.  Those are cases which will arise in urban or borough areas.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.  It is not necessary in any case, because the conditions have still to be prescribed, and it is within the province of the Minister to make exceptions under Section 11; but to put in this amendment is too like an invitation to the Minister to waive conditions limiting the number of houses per acre, and more especially in the boroughs and the urban areas.  There is no need at all to suggest such congestion, because it was owing to the desire to prevent congestion that the conditions have been imposed, and it will be generally agreed, I think, outside certain quarters, that such congestion should not be allowed. Now, under the Bill it is within the province and powers of the Minister to make exceptions without this amendment; if the Dáil formally passes this amendment it may well have the effect of suggesting to the Minister that he should waive conditions so that houses could be crowded in the most unfortunate manner at the suggestion of the Dáil, because that is what it would mean.  I hope the Minister will not accept the amendment, because it is too much like a request to the Minister that he should waive the conditions limiting the number of houses to the acre.</P>

      <P>This section does not deal particularly with reconstruction. My point is that without this amendment the power of the Minister to exempt special cases remains, and there is no need to suggest to the Minister, as would be the case if we accept this amendment, that it is desirable for him to waive conditions.  He has power to do it in special cases, but if you put this amendment in you practically tell him that the Dáil desires that he should waive these conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Johnson that it is not necessary to put this amendment into the Bill.  There is no hard and fast rule as to the number of houses per acre.  The number of houses per acre must be taken usually with the estimate of the number of persons per house.  The number of persons per acre is normal or abnormal according to the considerations that must be taken into account.  It may be, for example, that in the case of a huge hotel in New York, or Chicago, one would have to take into account the number of people on each floor.  The whole building might not occupy more than a few acres, and it might be found that there were 1,000 persons to the acre, but is that a fair estimate of density in a slum area in which there <Col N="874" /> were, as I remember, found in one tenement house as many as 109 persons? These are not parallel cases.  One is not entitled to say that the density of that tenement house is less than a huge hotel in New York.  I think it is better not to have any mention of the number.  I think the general idea of enlightenment or advanced views as regards housing schemes is to have a smaller number of houses to the acre and to work down from what 10 years ago was regarded by certain housing experts as not very objectionable, namely 30 or 40 houses to the acre.  That has come down in 10 years to 20 or 30 houses, and it is now, I believe, below 20.  The gradual trend is to have a lesser number per acre.  This amendment might do more harm than good. At the present moment the Minister's hands are not tied, and he is in a position to waive certain conditions.</P>

Now this clause, as framed, says that the houses shall, in respect of the size and number of rooms and necessary appurtenances, be in accordance with prescribed plan.  I want the words &ldquo;in general accordance with prescribed plan&rdquo; eliminated so as to give the Minister wider powers, and to substitute the words &ldquo;approved by the Minister.&rdquo;  I think you will see the object of that if you read the marginal note in Section 3, which mentions &ldquo;houses to which this Act applies.&rdquo;  Deputy Sullivan pointed out a moment ago, quite properly, that we gave a wider meaning to the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; when we incorporated flats in Section 1, and if we are going to tie up the hands of the Minister in connection with reconstruction by the statement that reconstruction cannot be carried out and that you cannot get the prescribed number per acre we will defeat the object we have in view. <Col N="875" /> Therefore, I suggest that this clause would be greatly improved by the elimination of these words and the substitution of the words I mention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what Deputy Good has in his mind are the thirty plans that I mentioned on the Second Reading of this Bill.  He seems to think that the houses must be built in accordance with these plans.  That is not our intention.  These plans are in the offices of the Ministry of Local Government for one purpose, and that is to assist, as far as possible, persons inclined to build houses: in the first place to give them the considered opinion of persons engaged in these housing matters for a great number of years, and, secondly, to give them a conception of the class of house that is likely to be accepted.  I take it that Deputy Good himself could probably give us a design of a house as good as any of those at present in the office of the Ministry of Local Government.  At <Col N="876" /> all events, he ought to be able to do that, because he has been interested in house building for a great number of years.  There can be no real difference, or at least any great difference, between what we put down as being in general accord &ldquo;with prescribed plans.&rdquo;  It would simply mean that in some houses the living room does not bear the same relation to other rooms in one particular house as it does in others.  I remember that when I was a member of the Dublin Corporation there was a very strong feeling, on the part of some people, who were interested in housing that the living room, in other words, the kitchen or the room in which the people spent most of their time, should be far larger, in fact twice as large if possible, as any other room in the house.  Sometimes the case was made that the living room might reasonably be the whole of the ground floor, and that the upper floor should be divided into two or three compartments as people might desire. Now, there are people who object to that, and say that there should be a smaller living room, with a parlour on the ground floor.  We will suppose, say, that three different plans are submitted. Number 1 specifies a single living room on the ground floor, with three bedrooms upstairs; number 2, a living room and a parlour downstairs and two bedrooms upstairs; number 3, a living room downstairs and a parlour and three bedrooms upstairs.  It is quite reasonable to expect that plans of these descriptions might be sent in, and to meet the suggestion made by Deputy Good I may say that we would have no objection whatever to any of these plans being accepted.  Any one of them would be, in general accord, with what we have laid down.  From our experience in the past I think it will be found that any of the three plans I have mentioned will be approved of by the Minister, and the building can then go on.  If you take it then that the building can go on as soon as the plans are approved of, there is no difference between our proposal and that of Deputy Good, but if, on the other hand, it means approved by the Minister before you start there may be a delay, and to that extent Deputy Good's <Col N="877" /> amendment may require further consideration.</P>

      <P>There is a point here that possibly we are overlooking.  I mentioned the marginal note before to Section 3, which reads as follows: &ldquo;Houses to which this Act applies.&rdquo; I am rather inclined to think that there is no distinction at all in the Bill between what you would call houses that come under the term of reconstruction and ordinary houses.  I do not know whether I am wrong in that idea or not. It does not say in the Sub-Section that it only applies to self-contained houses, and that it does not apply to reconstructed houses.</P>

I think it would be a good thing, because it does appear to me that there is a difficulty there.  Furthermore, the President has pointed out that I seemed to be under the impression that there were prescribed plans which should be followed.  I must say that I formed that idea in reading the Bill originally, and I am quite satisfied that when the Bill was drawn originally the idea was to erect houses in accordance with plans already in existence.  That is the reason why, on the Second Reading, I put a question to the President as to whether these prescribed plans were mandatory, and he told me that they were not, that they were optional.  That is the reason, therefore, why I want to have this point cleared up, and that was the reason I had in framing this amendment, to get rid of these words and to give further power to the Minister in connection with this matter.  What I want to be clear about is, as to whether this Section applies to what you would call a small, self-contained house or a reconstructed house.  As the Section stands it could be applied either ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the matter, and if it is thought necessary to bring up an amendment on the Report Stage I will do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'MAHONY Mr. O'MAHONY">

      <P>I beg to move Amendment No. 11, in Sub-Section (1) (c) to delete the figures &ldquo;960&rdquo; in line 6, and to substitute therefor the figures &ldquo;1,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think that the acceptance of this amendment would entail any additional expenditure either on the Government or on the local authorities. In the figures I have suggested I think I have erred on the side of modesty, because under the English Housing Act it is provided that the floor area shall be 700 superficial feet in the first class of house, 800 superficial feet in the next, and 920 superficial feet for a five-roomed house, with a margin up to 1,400 superficial feet.  Under the Bill we are considering there will be many cases in which houses will be erected by builders, with Governmental and local financial support.  Builders in many cases will erect houses for specific clients, people who have money to spare, and who with the Governmental and local help that will be available, will be anxious to provide houses for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it will be found that the maximum area proposed in the Bill is not even a floor area because it is an area taken within the external walls.  It leaves out of account the area occupied by partitions or by chimney-breasts that may be within the external walls. You have not actual floor area to deal with in the several areas mentioned here.  A person might be anxious to have a bath-room and all the accommodation that is possible in a house of <Col N="879" /> the kind.  The extension of the area of the house does not necessarily mean a proportionate extension in the cost. The increased cost in proportion to the increased general accommodation will be relatively small.  When a builder is building for speculation on the assumption that he is to sell at the price stated, he may be induced to extend the official area for the reason that if there is a readier sale for the larger house he will adapt himself to that circumstance.</P>
    <P>In the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; of Thursday last there were illustrations and particulars given of houses recently erected at Bray under the present housing scheme.  The actual floor areas given with respect to one of the two types of houses illustrated were:&mdash; Large bedroom, 163 superficial feet; second bedroom, 120 superficial feet. Both these rooms are sufficiently large for ordinary purposes.  But the third bedroom is only called a bedroom by courtesy; it is only 62 superficial feet. If you put a four-foot bed into such a room as that you have only about 24 superficial feet left over.  Where are you to accommodate furniture in such a room?  The total area of these three rooms is 345 feet.  I say that the smaller bedroom should not be less than 100 superficial feet, or 10 feet square. That is one of the standard houses we are erecting under the Government grant.  That means an increase of 38 feet.  For the stair space on each floor and passages there would be about 50 superficial feet.  That makes 433 superficial feet.  Then you want accommodation for a bath, say 40 feet for combined bathroom and sanitary accommodation.  That is 473 feet.  If you add the area of partitions to that, you have 500 feet, which I say is the minimum for a five-roomed house.  That brings it up simply to the figure I have laid down of 1,000 feet.  I would ask the President to reconsider the area specified in this Sub-section.</P>
    <P>The area of 520 square feet, even for a two-bedroomed house, is very small. I suggest that the Government should accept the 1,000 feet, or even be more generous, and leave it to the discretion of the builder.  It is not going to cost the Government or the local authority any more, but, as I say, there are many <Col N="880" /> people who will be anxious to avail of the services of a builder, with the financial accommodation this Bill will give them, to build houses a little better than those provided for in the Bill, and such people ought to get encouragement.</P>

      <P>I approve of this amendment.  In fact, I would go further and remove the limit altogether, as I do not see what purpose is served by it.  It is desirable, provided the builder keeps inside the specified costs, that the rooms should be as big as possible. Perhaps there is some reason for this, but I cannot see it.</P>

      <P>In Sub-section (1) (d), line 7, to delete the words &ldquo;by an appointed officer&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;by a competent architect or an officer appointed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is that where a competent architect designs a scheme, and that scheme has been carried out under his supervision, his certificate would be accepted by the Ministry for the completion of that scheme, in accordance with the plans, instead of sending down an officer from the Ministry for that purpose, which is mandatory under the Bill.  This amendment leaves it optional.  If the Ministry is not satisfied with the competency or otherwise of the architect it has the alternative of sending down an official of its own.  But where an architect is employed, and the Ministry is satisfied with his competency, it seems unreasonable that the Ministry should be compelled to send an official in order to give a certificate that the house has been built in accordance with the plans as approved and furnished.</P>

      <P>I wonder does the amendment carry out what Deputy Good has stated?  It seems to me if this amendment is accepted that the Government has not the power to object to the architect if he is a competent architect.  He need not be appointed by the Government, and if the house is approved by him I do not see what choice the Government would have in the matter.  Deputy Good explained that it was still in the power <Col N="881" /> of the Government if they were dissatisfied with the architect to send down an official, but his amendment does not provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point is a good one.  Deputy Figgis's earlier amendment would have fitted into this amendment of Deputy Good's.  The competence would be judged by the Council of Architects, and once any member was declared competent, no matter what his relationship might be to the builder, there would be no option but to approve.  I think that the Bill does not prevent the appointed officer being a competent architect.  Under the Bill as drafted the Ministry may say that so-and-so, who is an architect, has our authority to inspect this house. Under the amendment, if any person who is declared to be a competent architect, had issued a certificate that the house had been built in a workmanlike manner, the Ministry would have no option but to accept that certificate.  I think that the Section as it stands is preferable to the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read the Section it is mandatory on the Department, notwithstanding that a competent architect has been associated with the scheme, to send down an officer to certify that the house has been completed in accordance with the plans, in order that the Government grant may be paid.  If the Section is not mandatory I would like to hear to the contrary.  In order that that difficulty might be got over I suggested that it should be in the power of the Ministry to accept the certificate of that competent architect, and avoid sending down an officer to certify. That is the object I had in putting forward the amendment.  It seems to me to read clearly; possibly I may misunderstand it.  If the Ministry is not satisfied with the architect, then it has power to send down its own officer.  If it is satisfied with the competency of the architect there is no necessity to make it mandatory to send down its own officer.</P>

      <P>Follow the precedent laid down by the Local Government Department, by sending down an architect to inspect and certify for the building.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Good, as Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has pointed out, would preclude the Local Government Department from having a say as to the manner in which the houses were finished, if a certificate was forthcoming from the architect.  No Government Department could surrender the right of seeing that public money, given for the purpose of erecting the houses, had been properly expended.  I think the custom that prevails is one that ought to be continued in that respect.  Where architects are employed to supervise the erection of houses all over the country, the houses on completion are inspected by an architect or by an officer appointed by the Local Government Department. It is on his certificate the money is paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If it should be necessary to adopt the method suggested by Deputy Good I think the definition clause gives us that power. On the other hand, there are reasons why there might be objection on the part of any Ministry to have persons styled as competent, either as doctors, engineers, architects or dentists.  What is to decide a man's competence?  Is it his qualifications or that he has passed through a University?  If the Ministry is to decide the competence it is open to question if that could be sustained in Court.  An architect may say, &ldquo;I have all the qualifications,&rdquo; and snap his fingers at the Ministry. At any rate, even if it were desired to save expense the Minister, if satisfied with the name of any particular person, has power to appoint a person according to the definition clause.  The Auditor and Comptroller-General will <Col N="883" /> object to any wide interpretation of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <P>I move&mdash;Section 3 in Sub-section (1) (e) to delete from the word &ldquo;or,&rdquo; line 11, to the word &ldquo;Act,&rdquo; line 13, inclusive.  The Sub-section would then read: &ldquo;The erection or reconstruction of the house shall be begun after the passing of this Act,&rdquo; omitting &ldquo;or in special cases approved by the Minister within six months before the passing of this Act.&rdquo; To leave these words in would be to approve of something we had done before the Act came into existence.  I do not know how that is to be worked exactly in accordance with the Schedule attached.  It appears to me we are laying down rules for something to be built in the future rather than for something that happened in the past. I do not know what is the object of putting in &ldquo;within six months before the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to hear what Deputies have to say on this question.  It struck me that if this Act was not made applicable for some very well intentioned people, who are building the class of house we have in mind, obviously they would be at a disadvantage compared with persons who are going to start when this Bill is passed in a month or so.  If these people are building five-roomed houses and have to sell them without the £100 it does appear that, although they are doing a patriotic thing, constructing houses at uneconomic prices, they were certainly penalised.</P>

      <P>All the previous Acts have been suspended, I think.  To use the phraseology of the play bills, &ldquo;the free list has been permanently withdrawn for the last 12 or 18 <Col N="884" /> months.&rdquo;  There is no doubt about that. It is a matter I think of equity.  The amount involved is not considerable. It may be urged that they were under no disadvantage, and that there will be no limit as to their sale.  I really think it does not matter at all unless a person is constructing a house for himself. I leave it to the Dáil to decide what, in their judgment, would be the best.</P>

      <P>I can imagine that there have been some cases where the person interested might get relief, but I think that in most cases where there has been any prospect of State assistance of this kind there is no necessity for it.  Presumably they are being built entirely for other tenants, sub-tenants, workmen on estates, gate-lodges and the like.  Whether there are such or not, I cannot say.  It may be that there are farmhouses, or small houses, in the course of erection in the country which would come under this exception, but I think the Minister has to make the case for the special cases, and to explain the sort of houses they had in view when putting in this sentence.</P>

      <P>I think the provision is a fair one.  When you come to consider the fact that we are discussing this Bill to-day, it is quite on the cards that a considerable period will elapse before it will come into operation. Then when it does, its effectiveness or otherwise will be governed by conditions different from what we see <Col N="885" /> exactly to-day, and it may be that the provision of six months from the passing of the Bill is not likely to be six months as from to-day, and it is not likely to affect very many people.  If it does bring in certain houses that were built recently, I think it is only fair that they should be brought in because of the conditions which the people faced when they started to build these houses.</P>

      <P>I am puzzled to <Col N="886" /> know what the amendment means.  I take it that if a house has been in course of construction six months before the passing of the Bill, it shall, in any case, be completed within twelve months.  If, on the other hand, a house is started after the passing of the Bill, it must be completed within twelve months.

      <P>I move in sub-section (1) (e), line 14, to delete the words &ldquo;twelve months&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;two years.&rdquo;  The words here are important.  I see that Deputy Heffernan has also an amendment down corresponding with mine. If the Bill is to serve any useful purpose at all it is absolutely essential that it should be extended for two years, because, as I pointed out on a previous occasion, negotiations in connection with the acquisition of the site will take at least six months, and then there will be certain negotiations between the local authority and the builder.  That being so, to say that these houses must be erected within twelve months would be absolutely impossible, because if the site has been obtained, waterways, roadways, paths, and other things have to be made on the site before the contractor starts the erection of the houses at all.  So that, it will be generally agreed, I think, that two years is not too much to allow for the carrying out of a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much afraid if we assented to two years it would take all the ginger out of it. We want houses put up rapidly; we want to try to galvanise these builders, employers and employees, into doing what is their duty, and if it will take them six months to get a site I am afraid we will have to wait a little longer than twelve months to get the houses built.  In this case, if you extend it to two years they will not start <Col N="887" /> to look for a site for six months.  Our estimate for twelve months is £250,000; we would want £500,000 for two years, and we are not prepared to ask for a Vote on account in respect of next year.  I think fifteen months would be a perfectly reasonable time, allowing three months for the acquisition of the site.  Surely it ought to be possible to do it in three months.  Will it take twelve months to build a house?  Is time allowed for such amusements as strikes and lock-outs and things of that kind?  On the other hand, I am perfectly satisfied that nine months ought to be sufficient to build these small houses&mdash;nine and six, allowing that it will take six months to get the site.  I would offer a year and three months.</P>

      <P>If the President wants to get houses I think it is essential that he should allow time to erect them.  As I tried to point out, sites will be acquired by the local authority.  The President has some experience of the time it takes a local authority to acquire a site.  I have been told by a man of lifelong experience in the matter that the average time is six months.  After the site is acquired the local authority has to carry out a considerable amount of work on it, in the way of roads, pathways and sewers, etc.  All this would take a considerable amount of time, and I think if we allow twelve months for the local authority we will not be allowing too much; in addition to that we would want another six to nine months.  I think nine months would be essential for the carrying out of a larger scheme, and that would be the shortest possible time in which they could be erected.  I am quite with the President in trying to get houses, but there is no use in laying down impossible conditions that would only kill the scheme.</P>

I think our experience of contractors and the men <Col N="888" /> who work for them is such as not to allow us to be so optimistic as to the wonderful results that they will achieve. I would suggest that if the President could meet us in this amendment, I for my part would be willing to withdraw, and if he would substitute for the period four months, one year, that is that the Ministry might have the option of adding one year to the period they could sanction beyond twelve months.</P>

If you are speaking of Dublin, and I suppose Deputy Good is entitled to speak for Dublin, there is a site already available.  It may take the Corporation two months to decide as to whether it is going to avail of it for these houses or not.  It should not take any more time than three months for them to make up their minds as to whether they will facilitate the erection of these houses.  As far as I know the roads and sewers are made. Usually when they are talking about a thing for a long time you see something done after a while.  I would be prepared to make it a year and six months, but further than that I will not be prepared to go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the reconstruction of existing houses it is an essential feature, according to this Section, that they shall have been in a ruinous condition. <Col N="889" /> I do not know whether that was the intention of the draughters or not, for that would limit reconstruction to houses that were in a ruinous condition.  These houses while they may not be in a very good state of repair might, if this clause is left as it is, not come under it at all.  Take any of the houses in one of our leading squares and see would it come under this clause as it reads at present:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of the reconstruction of an existing house, that existing house shall have been in a ruinous or defective condition at the passing of this Act, and shall, before the reconstruction is begun, be certified by an appointed officer to be capable of reconstruction as a house fulfilling the foregoing conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that any of us who have a knowledge of the city of Dublin could say that some of these houses that we are anxious should be reconstructed are in a ruinous or defective condition at the moment.  I think it would be trying to read into this Bill what is not in it to say that they are.  I suggest in order to make that clause workable that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; shall be substituted for the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It seems to me, in view of our decision to allow self-contained flats that the wording of this requires re-drafting.  The President said on Second Reading that he saw no reason why Utility Societies could not make use of this Bill.  It seems to me that through this Section they could act, as they would not have funds to build on a larger scale; it would be through turning houses into self-contained flats that the larger opportunity would come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not really see what purpose the first three lines of the clause serves at <Col N="890" /> all, because unless some good purpose is to be gained, people are not going to lay out money on houses.  If the purpose is that they shall turn a house which is not serving any useful purpose into a house serving a good purpose, a house that was defective already, who would the judge be as to whether it is defective or not.  What you want would be the words &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>May I ask the President whether it is his intention that the financial assistance to be given under this Bill is to be given for the purpose of transferring, altering, or reconstructing large houses into self-contained flats?  Reading the Bill, I think it is not the intention.  I rather gather that the Dáil does desire that houses may be converted into self-contained flats, and that the money available under this scheme shall be available.  I wonder whether that is approved by the Ministry? If it is, I suggest that a good part of the Bill will require re-drafting. Certainly some new clauses will need to be added.  I suggest before we go further with this matter that the main question should be decided, whether we desire that houses which are capable of being converted into self-contained flats may come under the definition of a house, and whether the Ministry is agreeable to that interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am agreeable to that interpretation, but whoever intends to put the Act into force in connection with one of these houses is confined, as far as we are concerned, to the amounts that are set out in the schedule. I am not satisfied that it is an economic proposition unless in very special circumstances.  Even under these special circumstances, we would be justified in making the measure adaptable for these very few cases, because I do not think there would be many.  When I was a member of the Corporation I remember on one occasion a proposition being put up to us that if we got a half-a-dozen houses in Gardiner Street at a given price, and if we were to make certain alterations and convert them into flats and so on, they could be let at a certain figure. We spent some time in dealing with the <Col N="891" /> matter, and we got out very unsatisfactory figures.  This was in pre-war days.  The figures were unsatisfactory, and at last I said&mdash;&ldquo;If you get the houses for nothing, if they are presented to us, what will the result be?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We found the result would be that the flats would be provided at a price far in excess of what the ordinary single cottages would cost the Corporation at the time, the reason being&mdash;that is, the reason that was put forward&mdash;that the bricks and mortar, which were all we took into account as getting from the person who would give us the houses, would constitute one-third of the price of the house.  I believe there are other means than those adopted by a local authority.  I think there has been some activity in England.  A Miss Hill took up the matter, and found that her system was a success.  Whether it is possible to put something of the same sort into operation here and to make it a success, I do not know; I hope it is. It is with that view that we have included this clause, which would enable us at a small expenditure to give practically the same accommodation, because every flat that is readapted or made possible by this reconstruction would be the equivalent of a family house in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>The Section under discussion only deals with ruinous or defective houses.  I have no views or knowledge as to the feasibility of turning mansions into flats, but it is apparent that there is a desire that such reconstruction should come under the Bill.  Paragraph (f) does not deal with reconstructing houses which are at present in good condition.  It only deals with houses that are in ruinous or defective condition and the desire is, as I gather, that houses that are in good condition may be reconstructed and that each self-contained flat made out of the reconstructed house should be the equivalent of a dwelling-house and so get a subsidy.  If there are four flats to be made out of one mansion, then there will be a £400 subsidy.  I am speaking of the larger houses.  There would be four new houses.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest that in this whole question, and the very important one that has been raised in connection with these flats, it might be desirable for the President to consider whether he would not put in a special clause dealing with the position of the flats.  When you look around Dublin and see the number of houses that are gradually going into decay and crumbling down, you must recognise the importance of the reconstruction of these houses as being even greater than going out into the suburbs and building new houses.  What will become of these houses if you do not adopt some system of this kind that will encourage people to put them into livable condition for tonants?  These houses are going to be like Sackville Street, crumbling into ruins, an eyesore to the city, and a source of the various troubles we would be glad to avoid.  It is all very well for Deputy Figgis to talk about the æsthetic house building and all that; but you cannot ignore the fact that workmen want to be near their work, and that there is a big demand for houses as near as possible to the centre of the city.  You have those houses in <Col N="893" /> a ruinous condition, and unless you are going to sacrifice your city and extend it to the suburbs, leaving your city derelict, I think the most important housing problem before you to-day is the matter of the reconstruction of the houses in the old city area.  In dealing with the matter, this question of flats has been raised, and I think it might be very properly dealt with separately in one or two additional clauses in the Bill.</P>
