      <P>Sergeant-Major Bain (or Behan) died on the 1st July, 1922, as a result of wounds received on active service.  Payment of dependent's allowance, which had been issued to his <Col N="652" /> sister at the rate of 7s. a week, was continued until the 29th December last. Miss Bain's claim to pension or gratuity under the provisions of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, has been disallowed on the grounds that she was not wholly dependent on her brother and that the necessities of the case did not justify the making of any additional award. Miss Bain was informed accordingly on the 3rd April last.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of dependent's allowance to Mrs. Cooke had to be discontinued from the 5th instant. In accordance with regulations, it has been paid for six months subsequent to her husband's decease.  His death was caused by cardiac asthma, which, it appears, was the outcome of a weakness of long standing.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the unemployment books of the railwaymen who joined the Railway Protection and Maintenance Corps of the National Army were not stamped from week to week as the contributions became due.  The non-payment of those contributions, however, would not necessarily of itself deprive the men of unemployment benefit, as such benefit would be payable in respect of contributions paid before enlistment, to which would be added the contributions paid by the Ministry of Defence, under Section 7 of the Act of 1923, and which in about 25 per cent. of the cases were at least as many as could have been paid for those men if their cards had been stamped for every week of their military service.  Unemployment benefit could not have been allowed in any case in respect of contributions which had not been paid, but <Col N="658" /> an arrangement was made last month between the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Defence by which the accounts of the insured contributors in question were to be credited with a contribution for every week of military service in excess of the number of contributions already credited under Section 7 of the Act of 1923, and benefit in respect of the contributions credited under this arrangement has already been allowed on every claim now current so far as it has been practicable to identify the claims of the persons concerned.  If the Deputy will let me have particulars of any cases in which it is alleged that those contributions have not been brought to credit, I will have immediate inquiries made.  Benefit in respect of all these contributions will be available in the Third Benefit Year established by the Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1924, as soon as it becomes law.</P>

      <P>Laurence Mulhall, of Skehana, Castlecomer, who is by occupation a coal miner, applied for benefit on the 7th April, 1924, and his claim was accepted.  On the 14th April he was offered employment at his own trade, namely, as coal miner in the Wolfhill Collieries.  As he refused the offer he failed to fulfil one of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit, in that he was not unable to obtain suitable employment, and his claim was accordingly disallowed for a period of six weeks, after which, if he renewed his application for benefit, the case would be reviewed. He appealed to the Court of Referees, which, after considering his case, recommended that the claim <Col N="659" /> should be disallowed.  This recommendation was accepted.  When Mr. Mulhall renewed his application for benefit on the 2nd July it was possible again to offer him employment at the Wolfhill Collieries, and when his attention was directed to the vacancies for coal miners he stated that he would not proceed with his application for benefit. One of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit laid down in Section 7 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, is that the applicant must be unable to obtain suitable employment.</P>

(3) To provide free grants in aid of such works from <i>(a)</i> the Government, and <i>(b)</i> the county councils.  There are also subsidiary objects.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That leave be given to introduce the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>Before the procedure becomes automatic, I think there is a word or two still to be spoken on this Bill.  As a result of the speeches of the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Second Stage, I came to the conclusion that there was very little basic difference of opinion between the Government and myself, that we were all agreed that the control or regulation of prices is a very difficult matter to carry out successfully.  The only difference <Col N="665" /> was that the Government thought that the best way of extricating themselves from a difficult situation was to throw the onus of initiative on to the public.  There I disagree with them. I admit that in a normal country in which normal conditions have prevailed for the past four or five years, the course taken by the Government would probably be the best one&mdash;the best one from the point of view of abstract political economy, and also possibly the best one in practice.  But this is not a normal country, and it is peculiarly difficult in this country to get the public to come together and to co-operate in work of this kind to bring down prices.  Partly that is due to our national temperament; partly it is the fruit of our history, which makes it very difficult to get people to trust one another and work together in any sort of undertaking of this kind.  In no branch or section of life&mdash;I do not think I will be contradicted from the Labour Benches when I say this&mdash;is it easy in this country to get people to work together.</P>
      <P>While the Minister's scheme would be admirable, applied to what one may call an adult country, I am afraid that here in this country, unless it is taken up either by Traders Unions or by the Farmers' Organisations, or by some body of that kind already in existence, it will not produce any very tangible results.  The Government will say to the producer and consumer: &ldquo;Very well, we gave you your chance.  We placed this money at your disposal, and if you did not choose to take it, that is not our fault.&rdquo;  But I do not know that that can be taken as a complete fulfilment of the pledge that was given in the Governor-General's speech and that was also given by the President in the Rathmines Town Hall.  I am afraid it will not be, but such as it is, it is up to the public to make the most of the scheme, and I certainly hope they will do so.  I hope that if any body of consumers do attempt to use this scheme, particularly Section 2, in the spirit in which it is intended, that they will get help and encouragement from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to follow <Col N="666" /> the remarks of Deputy Cooper on this matter, that is to try to find out from the Minister whether, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, he can give us any assurance that our local authorities will be encouraged to apply for assistance in working out Section 2.  I imagine if these local authorities are not only allowed to participate in the working of this section but are specifically informed by the Minister, in view of recent experiences, they will be slow even to move in the matter.  In respect of the City of Dublin he will be able to say perhaps with more confidence than in respect of other cases whether it is the intention that the local authorities should take action under this section for the purpose of marketing commodities&mdash;farm produce, coal and other essential commodities&mdash;at a cost very little over the cost price.  The matter is of importance because of the fact that Deputy Bryan Cooper called attention to, and if there is anything to be said in favour of local government in the hands of one or two persons, then it should apply more certainly in a matter of this kind than in most other matters.  If one or two persons have power to take action regarding the marketing of essential commodities with a view to a general reduction in prices, the local authority that is most likely to do it is the local authority that is run by Commissioners, if they have the will and if they are directed by the Minister for Local Government. I feel confident at any rate that if an early result from this section is to be looked for it will be from the action of local authorities, and so far as it affects the City of Dublin then we should be able to say now when passing the Bill that it is intended that the local authority should put into operation this section and do something to bring down commodity prices in retail sales.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister in replying give us the result of any further thoughts he might have had in regard to the Advisory Committees to be established under Section 1 and Section 2 of the Bill?  I had recommended in Committee Stage that the two committees should be quite distinct and separate from one another. <Col N="667" /> I mentioned that the committee that might be best qualified to advise under Section 1, might be by their very capacity of experience, debarred from that kind of advice in regard to Section 2 that the Minister would naturally look for.  We had not the advantage of the presence of the Minister when the Bill was reported from Committee.  If he had been here he would have heard from Deputy Good a very cogent argument against the lending of money to, or the guaranteeing of loans for co-operative societies.</P>
      <P>The argument itself was cogent.  I disagree with its premises and I differ entirely from its conclusions, but it did reveal the fact that there was a certain type of mind to which the Minister would look, and should look, for advice in regard to Section 1 that did disagree with what everybody had assumed to be the primary purpose of Section 2.  Therefore I return to the argument that I brought before the Dáil in Committee, that the Committees on each of these sections should be kept separate, that one Committee should be chosen for Section 1 and another Committee should be chosen for Section 2, and those who have any faith that the provisions of Section 2 will lead to a cheapening of prices to the consumer would, I think, desire to have an assurance from the Minister that the Committees will be kept separate as indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the first result of this Bill on its Fifth Stage has been to make a convert of Deputy Cooper to the extent to which he has this evening confessed. With regard to what Deputy Johnson said, it is my intention, in so far as I am allowed to have any intentions with regard to this Bill at all, that local authorities should make use of its provisions, particularly of Section 2, but whether that is their intention or not I cannot say.  We have endeavoured to clear every obstacle from the path. One obstacle, which we discovered late, we did remove by a new clause which we put into Section 7, and in so far as I can use any persuasion with the Minister for Local Government I shall use every endeavour to see that he prevails <Col N="668" /> on local authorities to make use of this Bill, and particularly, as the Deputy has pointed out, in the regions where local authorities are at present substituted by commissioners.  The point raised by Deputy Figgis, I am afraid, does not appeal to me.  I have to confess that the particular argument which was so cogent that its weight was lost on Deputy Figgis, has not had any weight on me because I did not hear it, that is, regarding loans to co-operative societies, to whom, I may say, I did look to get most benefit from this Bill. On the question of the Committees and the separation of them, I am still in the position I announced on the Third Stage, that I have not been able to get a sufficient number of names from which to form two separate committees, taking into consideration the qualities required in the members who are to sit on these committees, and the fact that the work will be honorary. If I can get a sufficient number of persons interested and with a sufficient civic spirit to lend the ability which they must possess for this particular task to the operations of the Bill, it certainly is my intention to have two separate committees.  At present the only difficulty is the number of people interested and willing to act.</P>

      <P>As regards the schedule I would like to have it quite explicitly stated by the Minister in charge that every person whose name appears in this schedule was dismissed from his office or retired from his office at the instruction or under the orders of the national authority for the time being.  I think it is just to the local authority that they should be relieved of liability because of obedience to the action of the Central Government.  But I do not agree that the Central Government should take upon itself responsibility <Col N="671" /> for payment of pensions, allowances or gratuities where the local authority on its own initiative took action which involved that local authority in charges for pensions, superannuations and the like.  I think before we agree to this schedule we should have it stated quite clearly from the Minister that in every case it was the responsibility of the Central Government which the local authorities were carrying out, and on that account they should be relieved of liabilities which they would not otherwise have incourse?</P>

      <P>I would like to know if all these officers mentioned in Part I. of the Schedule would in the ordinary course be pensionable officers.  I notice amongst them a number of officers connected with technical instruction and different Departments.  Can the Minister tell us if they were pensionable officers or servants in the ordinary course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give the guarantee that has been asked for by Deputy Johnson, for more reasons than one.  In the first place, it is quite possible that on a technicality some of these local authorities may not have, in exercise of their own wisdom, perhaps, taken the necessary precautions to ensure that their funds would not be made available under the law in respect of the termination of the office of any one of these officials whose names appear in the second column of either Schedule.  In the case of technical education officials mentioned by Deputy Good, I am inclined to the view that he puts forward, that these officials were not legally entitled to compensation for loss of office.  The incident arose in this way.  A certain gentleman who had suffered a term of imprisonment as the result of court martial in 1916, having been released from prison, applied for a position under the Limerick Technical Education Committee. He was appointed to that position, but his appointment was not sanctioned, and in that case a conflict arose immediately between the British Government and the Limerick Technical Education Committee, and it remained a conflict for the better part of two years. <Col N="672" /> In the meantime, the conflict still going on, an Act was passed which, according to its general description, was an amendment of the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Act, but, while it pretended to be that, there was one section, Section 8, which gave rights to officials of local authorities not hitherto possessed by them.  In respect to that particular section those officials were given certain rights which, by any stretch of the imagination, or any extravagant interpretation of the Superannuation Acts of the time, could not possibly have been foreseen.  That Act ought to have been called the Superannuation of Local Government Officials Act.  A certain amendment of that particular section has given rise to practically all this trouble.</P>
      <P>As far as that particular section is concerned, any one official there could have claimed his pension or sent in his resignation over the heads of the local authority as long as the Local Government Board could be canvassed to consent to their resignations.  Then at once the situation arose as to the amount of compensation that should be awarded, that is, the amount of superannuation in the majority of those cases.  The Local Government Board of the time added quite a number of years' service to whatever service the person had.  In one case they added twenty-six years to fourteen years' service, and in other cases, a sufficient number of years' service to make up the maximum amount, that is, up to 40.  In one case down in the list, where the person had been reported for inefficient administration or something of that sort they saved their faces by deducting four years from the forty and giving thirty-six. In the case of one officer here&mdash;I do not suppose it is a gracious thing to mention&mdash;whose sister is a very pronounced Republican, when the time of stress was on he had not sufficient nationality to take his place with the rest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the sister takes on a lot of responsibility in other directions.  As far as that particular <Col N="673" /> lot I mention, the Limerick Corporation officials, were concerned, that was a subject of legal proceedings.  The legal proceedings succeeded and went on to appeal, and the Corporation succeeded in disposing of the contentions of the officials.  Again, on appeal that was reversed and their rights were preserved. Generally on the whole thing we have come to an arrangement with the British Government.  Mr. Justice Wylie has considered the whole of those cases, and our liability has been assessed at what would have been a fair compensation given in each case, excluding the political circumstances of the times.  The British Government has accepted responsibility for the difference between what might be called an equitable pension in the circumstances and what was granted, and our responsibility is in respect of the rest.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment 3, of Deputy Duggan, amendment 7 of Deputy Figgis, amendment 11 of Deputy Duggan and a new amendment 11a of Deputy Johnson, it seems to me they are not provided for by the Money Resolution. The Money Resolution is:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of any pensions payable under the authority of any Act of the present Session to provide for the payment of Military Service Pensions to certain members and former members of the National <Col N="674" /> Forces and the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The National Forces are already defined. Reference is given in the Act itself to the definition, and inasmuch as the Money Resolution has not been amended I do not think it would be possible so to amend the Bill itself as to make the Criminal Investigation Department, the Citizens' Defence Force, and the Protective Force deemed to be members of the National Forces.

      <P>I do not want the Deputy to make a speech. The matter is clear enough.  The Deputy is trying to introduce persons who have had no service in the National Forces of Saorstát Eireann since the Treaty, with certain exceptions.  That is not provided for in the Money Resolution.  I think not only that, but although the amendment in the name of Deputy Duggan might be deemed to come within the scope of the Bill, Deputy Figgis's amendment would be outside the scope of the Bill because what was contemplated in the Second Reading was pensions to certain persons who had given a certain service <Col N="675" /> in a certain period, whether you defined them technically or not.</P>

      <P>(2)  The Minister shall refer every such application for a certificate of military service to a board of assessors appointed under this Act to hear all such applications and shall before granting any such certificate take into consideration the report made by the board of assessors and, subject to the provisions of this Act, shall grant or refuse a certificate of military service in accordance with such report.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is this: the Bill is a Bill to provide pensions for certain members of the National Forces.  The essential thing is that the person must be a member of the National Forces, as defined; that is to say, a member of certain post-Truce forces.  The word &ldquo;certain&rdquo;<Col N="680" /> can be interpreted to include all kinds of pre-Truce persons provided they had subsequently service in the National Forces.  That is the position.  So that as to amendments 1, 2 and 9, dealing with pre-Truce service, it is a completely open question, not affected by the Money Resolution.

      <P>In sub-section (3), after the word &ldquo;Eireann,&rdquo; in line 21, to insert the words &ldquo;or the rank held by him on the 1st day of February, 1924, whichever of those ranks shall be the higher.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for putting down this amendment is that as a result of the re-organisation that came into force from the 1st April of this year, a large number of ranks were reduced, and men either resigned, rather than accept the particular position that was offered to them, which was lower to the rank they held, or were demobilised subsequent to 1st April, at the time when they held the lower rank.  In view of the general circumstances of the time it would be unfair that men, who were simply demobilised as a result of the working of the re-organisation scheme, <Col N="684" /> should receive pensions based on their old rank, while men who had resigned in any particular circumstances in the meantime, or who had been demobilised by the Army authorities subsequent to the 1st April, 1924, should suffer because of a reduction in rank from that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also another reason, that quite a number of officers or men were demobilised much earlier than those demobilised this year.  I take it the principle would be the same with regard to such demobilisations. In the case of officers who were first demobilised, they went out with the rank they held during the active service period.  As to the other officers, who came along for reconsideration under the reorganisation scheme, some of them who were kept &mdash;and they would represent, I take it, a higher order than those who were demobilised at that time&mdash;were reduced in rank.  There had necessarily to be a reduction by reason of the smaller army.  These officers passed through two stages, the first demobilisation and the second demobilisation, and entered into the third with reduced rank.  They had passed through two gaps and had sustained their commissions in the Army.  Their right to a pension would be prejudiced in comparison with those who were demobilised earlier.  Although it may seem a certain extravagance I think this particular amendment is the only means of restoring to these men the rights that their brothers had who were demobilised earlier, or who had resigned earlier than they did.  I accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the argument is sound as far as it applies to men who in a technical sense were degraded. That is to say, men who had to accept a lower nominal rank because of re-organisation.  It occurs to me that we should be clear the acceptance of the amendment would not apply to reduction in rank owing to other causes perhaps, not to reductions that had taken place up to date, but to future reductions.  If for some reason an officer is not deprived of his commission, but is put into a lower rank for some offence, or for some failure, or for some reason which justifies that in <Col N="685" /> the mind of the Minister the amendment in its present form would mean that in any future demobilisation or resignation the pension would depend on the rank the man served in on the first of February, 1924.  Whether that is the intention or not I am doubtful, but I think we should guard against it if it is not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention, because we regard this particular period for which these compensations are to be paid as one continuous block, but we are not continuing it.  If you were to continue it by reason of service, that is to say from the 1st October, 1923, persons serving until the 1st October, 1924, would be entitled to retire with an additional year of service to their credit, and there would then be a case for considering what Deputy Johnson has stated.  But, that is not the case.  An officer who serves now for three, four or five years and then retires, gets no benefit by reason of the period of service that he gave during the peace conditions.</P>

      <P>I think there is some case for the bringing in on the Report Stage of an amendment to meet the object aimed at by Deputy Mulcahy. Take the case of two brothers. One retired last year as a Major-General, and the other was retained in the Army and continued to serve as a Major-General until the reorganisation scheme was brought into operation, when he was reduced to the rank of Colonel.  If he should retire, he would only be entitled to a Colonel's pension, while his brother, who had gone out earlier and, as a matter of fact, had less service, would get a Major-General's pension.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I beg to move amendment 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 9, after the word &ldquo;moneys&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;whether provided by the Oireachtas, by Local Government Authorities, or other statutory body.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put forward this amendment with a view to making it quite clear what is intended, and to prevent, if possible, the misuse of this Act.  The phrase used in the Bill is &ldquo;public moneys,&rdquo; and I am not sure what that means.  The section says: &ldquo;If any person to whom a military service pension is payable under this Act shall at any time during the continuance of such pension be in receipt of any remuneration, pension or allowance payable out of public moneys, the military service pension payable to such person under this Act shall be suspended to an extent calculated&rdquo; according to certain provisions. If that is intended only to deal with money provided by the State, then it leaves the way open for a person in receipt of a pension to be employed by a local authority and to continue in the full enjoyment of a payment from the local authority and of a payment from the pension fund.  I am very strongly against the practice, which has been adopted too often, of using a pension as a means of reducing the wage of people by an employer, whether a local authority or a private employer, and incidentally generally reducing the standard: taking advantage, as it were, of a State pension for services rendered <Col N="688" /> in the past to reduce the payment given to a man for services rendered in the present.</P>
    <P>If that position is maintained in the Bill I think what we shall find will be that there will be a little cutting in the offer made to a man to take a post at something less than the normal rate just because he is in receipt of a pension. He may be in receipt of a pension of, say, £100, and the normal rate would be £200, giving a total of £300. Well, he will be better off if he works for a local authority for £50 while retaining his full pension: he will be better off by £50, and the local authority will be better off by £50, but the men who are not in receipt of pensions will be prejudiced accordingly.  I want to provide that in the case of a public authority employing a man that the man himself will be debarred from offering his services at a lower rate than the current rate, and that there will be no temptation placed before the local authority to employ a man at a lower rate than is current by virtue of that man's pension, and I also want to provide that whatever is applicable in relation to State employment should be made applicable also in the case of employment by local authorities.  If public moneys include moneys paid out of the rates or by local authorities in any way, then there will be no need for my amendment, but if public moneys only mean moneys paid out of the State Exchequer, then I want to press my amendment or some other amendment to bring about the same result.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Johnson's amendment would hardly meet the point he has in view. &ldquo;Statutory body&rdquo; is a term which includes quite a number of institutions which do not derive their moneys from the public in the way of rates or taxes or other such sources.  I would be prepared to accept an amendment framed somewhat on these lines: &ldquo;Where provided by the Oireachtas or by means of the poor rate or any other rate imposed by a local authority.&rdquo;  I think that provision would meet the taxable and the rateable moneys that come in, and I take it that beyond that Deputy Johnson does not wish to go.  Statutory <Col N="689" /> bodies, as I have already stated, include a multitude of institutions of one sort or another, and I think that while we might save money on the pension, our officers would really have their time taken up in examination of cases to such an extent that we would lose as much in that way as we would save in the other, because the cost of the administration would be very great. In this case there is no doubt but that a correction of any abuses that might exist could be easily overtaken, and the provision I have suggested would, I think, meet the case.</P>

      <P>I beg to move this amendment, which, I think, is necessary.  Referring to the First Schedule, it says that the number of years of army service counting towards pensions under this Act shall be computed as follows, and it sets out what the different periods allocating a certain number of years as equivalent for pension purposes.  Paragraph (h) says &ldquo;for continuous service from the 1st July, 1922, to the 1st March, 1923, two years,&rdquo; and paragraph (1) says &ldquo;for continuous service from the 1st April, 1923, to the 30th September, 1923, one year.&rdquo;  I am afraid that, standing as it does at present, if a person joins, say, two months after (h) period began and left the army two months after (i) period ended, that instead of getting practically three years credit towards pension he would get nothing, and I feel, therefore, that in order to make matters quite clear it is necessary to insert this paragraph.  &ldquo;For service rendered during any broken part of any period mentioned in column 1 or of paragraph 1 of this schedule there shall be added a corresponding proportion of the total equivalent for that period as set out in column two of the said paragraph.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before the President answers as to his attitude on this amendment, I hope he will give us some idea what the amendment, if accepted, would cost, because if it does not involve an enormous addition to the cost of the Bill I would like to support it. Of course, as in any scheme of this kind, there is bound to be a feeling of injustice, and the more elasticity you get into the scheme the better.  I think Deputy Mulcahy's amendment gives a certain amount of elasticity and would eliminate a number of hard cases. There were a number of people in the South, from Waterford and Cork, who wished to join the National Army before the 1st July, 1922, but they were unable to do so because they were in places that were held by the Irregulars, and even afterwards when these men tried to get to Dublin to join up they were taken off the trains and threatened and made return home.  Now, because these people did not join on the <Col N="694" /> 1st July, 1922, they would forfeit two years towards pension.  They would find that very hard, because the moment the National Troops arrived in their different places they joined and gave very good service, and I hope that the President will give consideration to this matter.</P>

      <P>I was hoping from the representations that Deputy General Mulcahy put to me that quite a small number of persons were concerned in this amendment, but now, having discovered that there is general support for the amendment in different quarters of the House it would appear that there will be a very large number of people disadvantaged unless I accept this amendment.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one.  It is difficult to fix a period without hitting somebody, but it is our intention to deal fairly.  I do not think that the number of cases can be very large, such as were mentioned by Deputy Cooper, where it was impossible for men to join the Army by reason of circumstances over which they had no control. I think it certainly would be unfair that they should be debarred from getting consideration for what services they did give and, in the circumstances, I propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page seven, to delete lines 24 to 29 inclusive, and to insert in lieu thereof the following:&mdash;&ldquo;For the purposes of this Schedule a person who was a member of the Irish Volunteer Executive or of the Headquarters Staff of Oglaigh na hEireann at any time prior to the 11th July, 1921, or who was a member of the Army Council or of the Defence Council at any time subsequent to the 1st July, 1922, and prior <Col N="698" /> to the 1st October, 1923, shall be deemed to have been serving at the date of his discharge from the National Forces or the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann in a rank higher than that of Major-General.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the end of 1922, and before January or February of 1923, a body known as the Army Council changed its personnel on two or three occasions, and this amendment is simply to cover cases of officers of the rank of Major-General at that time who were members of the Army Council, and who held very serious and heavy responsibility.  There were only three officers concerned.  I do not anticipate that any of them will fall upon evil days, but I think this amendment should be embodied in the Bill to safeguard them, so that if at any time they wanted to apply for a pension they would be entitled to do so under this Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the Schedule, line 29, a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Furthermore, for the purpose of this Schedule an officer of the Medical Services Branch of the National Forces, or of the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann, shall be deemed to have that rank which in the Combatant Service carries the rate of pay drawn by such officer of the Medical Services.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to prevent an injustice to officers who are in the medical branch of the service.  As you are aware, the salary which goes with the medical rank is higher than that attaching to the corresponding rank in the line service.  Take the line service. We begin with Lieutenant, then Captain, then Commandant, and next Major.  The salary for a Major is precisely the salary for a Lieutenant of the medical service.  Similarly the salary of a Captain in the medical service is equivalent to that of Colonel in the line, and if the pensions were calculated on the basis of rank the medical officer who was a Lieutenant would be regarded merely as a Lieutenant, whereas if the equitable method put forward in this amendment be adopted, <Col N="699" /> instead of the mere rank being con-considered, and the formal consideration of the titular position being taken into account, the pension will be computed with reference to the salary, just as it is in the case of all other superannuation allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to support this amendment.  The future army, no doubt, will take care of itself in so far as relationships or the prestige of the different branches of the service are concerned.  It may be that the Engineering or Air Branch will feel that the putting of a clause like this into the Bill is giving the medical profession a status and a position in connection with the Defence Forces that they were equally entitled to.  The Medical Service was a specially organised force.  They did excellent work, and they were paid special rates because of the particular circumstances under which they worked, and because their organisation was a temporary and a war one.  I only know personally two officers who will be affected by this amendment, but the number that would be likely to be affected will be very small for the reasons that they must be pre-Truce men, they must be doctors, and they must have been doctors in the National Forces, and they must be amongst those to be demobilised. They must fulfil each of these four requirements, so that, I think, the number must be very small, and I think it is due to the appreciation that we should have of what the medical service has done during the last three or four years, that we should make this provision in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not agree with Deputy Magennis, I should like to support his contention.  This is opening a very wide door, but not only are there medical, but legal officers who are paid a special rate.  These legal officers rank as commandants, and are paid £2 2s. a day.  If these officers were army commandants they would only be paid 18/- a day.  The same anomaly that Deputy Magennis indicated in the case of medical officers exist there.  But I should think there are very few cases of medical men with pre-Truce services, <Col N="700" /> so that I think the President would be wise, while not restraining his heart from any concession on the lines suggested by Deputy Magennis, to examine the whole subject, and take into account transport, artillery, engineers, and services of that kind receiving special pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I can give to this amendment the favourable consideration that has been pressed by the Deputies who have spoken.  The real purpose of this Bill is not to distribute public moneys, but rather to afford some measure of compensation to persons whose lives have been interrupted at the very moment when they ought to have been arming themselves in some way for the struggle of life.  In the particular case of doctors, what did we give them during their service in the National Army? They had a splendid opportunity for practice in the Army, and we paid them, and paid them generously.  They served well I know, but during that particular period their lives were not interrupted to the same extent as the ordinary rank and file, and any justification there is for consideration in their case would have to be based on how their lives were interfered with during a certain given period.  That case is not made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be a case made that they ought to have some more consideration than their rank would qualify them for. For instance, if a case were put to me that an officer in the Medical Service of the rank of Lieutenant ought to get a pension that would be paid to a Commandant, there would be some justification for that, but as far as the services of these gentlemen are concerned they were paid professional fees during the time they served.  Can the same thing be said of a soldier who, according to his profession, is&mdash;I suppose it would be vulgar to say it&mdash;in the blood-letting business also, and to pay him according to the number of scalps to his credit?  It is not done. It is known that some officers are very efficient.  We saw their activity at once, and how well they earned the title of soldier, but in their case their professional qualifications or results were not compensated by an increase <Col N="701" /> of pay, and they have certain disadvantages that the medical men have not&mdash; memories that are disturbing&mdash;whereas the greater the number of operations the medical man has, the more skilled is he; and many of them would take service in order to practice their skill. I would take steps not to consider the matter as generously as is suggested, but to consider it justly according to the needs of my friend, the Minister for Finance, who, as well as being just, is very often generous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the President, because men who served in a medical capacity in the Army have been taken from a different walk of life altogether from the ordinary soldier; and they would naturally expect to earn a much larger income.  The President says that during this time they have been getting experience. But experience is not building up a practice; it is quite a different thing. They have been taken away from their profession just at the time when they would be building up a practice.  The same thing would apply to men in the Army or Navy.  When they come out of the Navy or Army they find that they are a spare file, to use a military expression. I do not think the President has met this case as it should be met.</P>

      <P>There is no question of sacrifice as far as the medical men were concerned.  Wherever sacrifice was made it was made by the class that Deputy Gorey referred to as the ordinary soldier&mdash;in cases, for instance, where students were taken away from their studies and had to be away for years.  I certainly think that the President has met this amendment in the proper way.  I think he is doing the right thing.  We have got to realise that the medical men were in a privileged position.  Other men were brought <Col N="702" /> away from their business and east into the Army, where they were in a different position altogether all the time. I think that the President has met the amendment very fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would undertake to consider it at the next Stage rather with a view to giving a higher rank.  We have certain ranks&mdash;Lieutenant and Captain in one; Commandant and Major in a second; Colonel and Major-General in a third; Lieutenant-General, and so on, in a fourth. In this case I would prefer to consider between this and the Report Stage bringing in an amendment which would entitle a medical officer to be rated on a higher scale than to which his rank on the 30th September would entitle him to.  We have paid them good salaries. I think it will be admitted that they compare more than favourably with salaries that are paid by important institutions outside the Government service and, in fact, by important institutions inside the Government service. Take the salary that is paid to a medical officer in the service of the Government who held a very important position in the Government service, and you will find that the salary of the military officer who held the highest rank in the military service of the Army during the active service period compares more than favourably with it.  You will find that the salary of the medical officer of the Army compares more than favourably with the salary of the Medical Officer of Health of the City of Dublin.  I understand that there is a dispute about that, that it is alleged that the Medical Officer of Health of the City of Dublin gets huge fees as Analyst of the City.  He does not get anything of the sort.  I know it. I have personal knowledge of it.  As far as the salaries of the medical officers in the Army are concerned they have been most generously paid; and there is no case for comparing them with the salaries of the ordinary officers whom it is proposed to compensate under this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>It struck me that this Third Schedule was an arrangement to take back with one hand what was given with the other; and a few figures will perhaps illustrate it. Take an officer demobilised with the rank of captain who had served for the period 1919, 1920 and 1921&mdash;the period of operations against the British&mdash;and who had served for the whole subsequent period from the 1st July, 1922, to the 30th September, 1923.  Such an officer would have to his credit six years service for pension purposes, and he would be entitled to a pension of £60 a year.  If he obtained a position with a salary of £70 a year attached to it, the proposal in the Third Schedule would mean that £12 would be taken off his pension of £60.  If he got a position with a salary of £120 attached to it, £18 would be taken off it.  If he got a position with a salary of £220, £42 would be taken from his £60.  And the effect of the Schedule would be that his whole pension of £60 would disappear if he was receiving a salary of £420 from public funds.  But the incidence of the deduction was not fairly placed. The proposals contained in my amendment would have this effect, that his pension of £60 would not disappear entirely except he was in receipt of a yearly salary of £570; and it runs systematically from 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 per cent., and so on for every £50 of rise.  And to compare the two proposals, the man in receipt of £120 would surrender under my proposal £6 of his £60 pension, and under the proposal contained in the Bill he would surrender £18; if he was in receipt of a salary <Col N="706" /> of £220 under the proposal in my amendment he would surrender £18, but under the proposal in the Bill he would have to surrender £42.</P>
      <P>These figures will give the impression that the cut that would be made under the Third Schedule, as it stands, in the Bill is too heavy entirely, and is too heavy around salaries, say, of £220, £270, and £320.  I think the President or the Minister for Finance has in a way suggested that he would accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know but these amendments were to some extent responsible for the absence of the Minister for Finance, and I suppose Deputy Mulcahy is taking advantage of the shower.  I would be disposed to consider this, not because it is a peculiar mathematical proposition, which is what, I think, the General really represented it.  But I do think, having given the matter some consideration, that those years for which we are compensating the persons affected might reasonably be regarded as years in which, if they had not rendered the service which they did, would have entitled them to a very much higher scale than they would be in receipt of, and that their position under A, B, C, D, E, and F, and so on, would be very much stronger than at the present moment. In these circumstances, I think that the case made for a reduction of the amounts, which it was originally intended to deduct, is a fair one, although I would admit that the General scarcely made that sort of a case.  I would be disposed to consider this, and if it is not in order to have it moved in its present form, I would bring up an amendment on Report Stage that would achieve the same purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It may simplify the work of the Committee, in dealing with this Estimate, if I say a few explanatory words in advance.  In the discussion yesterday, and previously, on the primary Estimate, I endeavoured to give a full and detailed account both of the policy and of the programmes that are being followed in the primary schools&mdash;that is to say, the policy and programmes that are already in operation in the primary schools.  At the same time, I was seeking to emphasis that the primary system was not the be-all and end-all, but that it ought to have its continuation in the secondary system.  I gave, in connection with the primary system, a certain amount of information with regard to the connection between that and the secondary system, and the general lines upon which the secondary system was working out.  I endeavoured to give some account of the methods which were not merely proposed, but initiated, in order to bring the education in both types of schools more closely into touch with the realities and needs of Irish life.  Now, I find it necessary to say some things which I had hoped it would not be necessary to say.  I feel <Col N="708" /> rather humbled in the face of certain comments which I have encountered and which teach me that my efforts to be explanatory fell very far short of being successful.  I want to make it clear with regard to this Estimate that is before us now&mdash;the same would apply to the Estimate which was dealt with previously&mdash;that the statement I made was not a statement of what ought to be, of something that existed in my head, of something that existed in my dreams, or of something that was still to come into existence, but of a system which has been actually inaugurated, is in existence, and is operative. I have encountered the comment that I have &ldquo;unfolded a scheme of reform which, on paper, is of an inspiring character.&rdquo;  I am glad to hear the statement that it is of an &ldquo;inspiring character,&rdquo; because this scheme of reform exists to a much more real extent than its existence on paper.  Therefore, I assume that the inspiration is going to be real.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A scheme of reform which provides on paper for the unification of all grades of teaching between the primary school and university, and for a system of teaching in the rural schools, which will train children to be intelligent tillers of the soil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These excellent objects, I have been informed, are no nearer of accomplishment than they were a year ago.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The splendid reforms which pos terity may link with Mr. MacNeill's Ministry are still unembodied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad to encounter comment of that kind.  If those who make that comment had realised that the reforms that I indicated are not unembodied but are embodied, I am quite sure their generous testimony&mdash;perhaps their over-generous testimony&mdash;would still as ungrudgingly be given, and that I would be told that the objects which I was endeavouring to carry into effect were excellent objects, and that the reforms which this Department is engaged in furthering, so far as it can, are splendid reforms.</P>
    <P>With regard to this scheme, I may describe it in the following words, which are not my own:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The drstic reform of secondary education in the Saorstát is provided <Col N="709" /> by the rules and programme that were published yesterday.</P>
    <P>That was about a month ago.</P>
    <P>The old machinery of grades disappears in favour of two periods of secondary education which will be terminated respectively by an intermediate certificate examination and a leaving certificate examination. The old system of payment by results is replaced by a system of capitation grants.  The old programmes, narrow and formal, which encouraged merely mechanical teaching and fostered the vice of cramming, are superseded by a more elastic programme which ought to give full scope to the teachers' gifts and to the pupils' real tastes and faculties.  An earnest effort has been made to satisfy the needs of the different classes of the people and to supply an educational ladder that will stretch, without gaps, from the primary school to the University.  It is hoped that holders of the intermediate certificate who leave school at the age of 16 will be qualified to make their way in commerce and the trades, and that others who continue their studies will be led to the threshold of professional and scientific careers.  Clever and ambitious pupils will be assisted to mount from one rung of the ladder to the other by means of scholarships.</P>
    <P>To continue the same account, which is not mine nor inspired in any degree by me:</P>
    <P>We believe that most of the schools and a majority of Irish parents will welcome the principle of the new system. Many of our national misfortunes&mdash;</P>
    <P>These are not my words&mdash;</P>
    <P>our insular arrogance and ignorance, our dearth of technical efficiency, the scarcity of moral courage and the lack of sound public opinion are the penalties of a machine-made system of education that has cramped the development of our people's natural capacities.  These capacities ought to receive fair play under the reformed system which is planned on a basis of intellectual rather than financial. results.</P>
    <P>That is an encouraging statement made a month ago of a programme then <Col N="710" /> in existence&mdash;a programme which I have no doubt the schools made preparations for carrying into effect from the very moment of its publication. Therefore, I say with humility that I apologise for any shortcomings in my statement of yesterday which could have led the same excellent authority to have supposed that the same things existed only on paper, only in an imaginary way, only as hopes and aspirations, which were still completely unembodied.  These programmes are actually before all the secondary schools in Ireland and have been before them for a month's time.  They include programmes specially drawn up for those who are going in for an agricultural career, programmes for boys and girls who intend to follow a commercial career and programmes for boys and girls who aim at a professional career.  They include programmes of subjects like history and geography and ought to lead to very deep changes in the method of treatment of these subjects as it existed in the school&mdash;not altogether I should say through the fault of the schools, but very largely through the fault of the programmes imposed on the schools. History, for example, as taught under the direction of these programmes will not consist of lists of reigns, dates, dynasties and battles and things of that kind.  It will be history as concerned with the developments of peoples.  As regards geography, I can remember the sort of geography I learned when I was undergoing primary education&mdash;I thing &ldquo;undergoing&rdquo; is the right word.</P>
    <P>Those were the days which some of the Deputies still sigh after.  I think I knew at that time the population of almost every town in the world.  At least, I was expected to know it.  That sort of thing this programme not only aims at changing but I think will succeed in changing if it lives.  There is not in the new programme a subject that is not so arranged&mdash;and intentionally arranged&mdash;that an intelligent teacher will not be induced to teach it with a closer reference to the needs and the potentialities of Irish life, and with reference to the actual circumstances in which the pupils live.</P>
    <P>I repeat this is not a dream.  It is a <Col N="711" /> bald statement of the contents and the character of the programme.  This programme is based on the principle that up to the age of eighteen pupils of our schools should get a sound general education, based, as I have said, on Irish, English, mathematics, history, geography, and rural science, and that after that age they should be supplied with such a choice of programmes that each pupil will be able to combine his general education with a beginning of specialisation in the direction of a future career, whether that be agricultural, commercial, industrial, or what is called professional.  I admit that there is one respect in which that programme is still open to the criticism of being unreal.  I have said before how much education depends on personnel; it depends entirely on personnel, and it has been a very great satisfaction to me to find such complete unanimity as represented by the Deputies here, by members of another assembly united to this, by the Press of the country, and by the whole public opinion of the country so far as it is vocal, that with regard to personnel the state of the case was unsatisfactory, not so much as regards the qualifications of the personnel.  I think that wonderful things have been done in Ireland by those engaged in secondary teaching in order to qualify themselves for the work in which they are engaged in the circumstances.  I am not classifying them.</P>
    <P>That applies practically to all those engaged in secondary teaching, but the drawback has been, and the thing on which public opinion has been unanimous, was that where the livelihood of the secondary teacher depended on that occupation, the provision which had been made up to the present was inadequate and unsatisfactory.  I should feel in a very weak position indeed, if I were to come before you here to defend the programme, and the programme only, and if I were not in a position to say that the Government was prepared to do something to remedy the condition in which the profession of secondary teachers, as a profession providing men and women with a livelihood, had been left for this <Col N="712" /> Assembly to remedy.  Now I have had discussions on this point with the Minister for Finance, whose absence we all regret, and I may say on all occasions I found the Minister for Finance, notwithstanding the claims which you know surround him on every side, and the extremely difficult task with which he is faced&mdash;as great a task, I think, and as difficult a task as has ever faced a Ministry in the constructive work of any Government&mdash;most fully appreciative of the particular matter that I have just mentioned, and most anxious, so far as it was in his power, to provide the necessary improvements.  The result of our colloquies has come to this: the Minister for Finance has agreed to two proposals which I put before him as vital.  The first was that the salaries of secondary teachers should be put on a professional basis by the institution of a fixed minimum basic salary, to be paid to the teachers by the schools.  I take as a representative figure in that case, £200 for a man.</P>

In the absence of the Minister for Finance, I cannot give the exact details in figures, but you may take it from me that the statement I made is intended to represent facts, realities.</P>

      <P>Yes, including past service.  In order to enable the schools to pay a proper basic salary the Minister for Finance agreed to increase the capitation grant to the schools, which would not, in most cases, be able on the present grants to pay a sufficient basic salary to form the foundation of a profession.  I repeat what I was saying there now for clearness.  In order to pay a proper basic salary the Minister for Finance has agreed to increase the capitation grant to the schools which would not in most cases be able on the present grants to pay a sufficient basic salary to form the foundation of a profession.  The teachers who are to benefit by the above scheme will be the registered teachers, that is to say, professional secondary teachers who are or will be on the register.  Now, the statement I have made reduces the actual proposal before me to a rather illusory form; that is to say, you will not be asked on this occasion to vote the sums which will be necessary to give effect to these proposals.  To that end it will be necessary to introduce in good time a Supplementary Vote.  The reason for that is obvious.  These Estimates are necessarily drawn up months before they can be presented, and then a certain amount of time has elapsed since the Estimates were actually drawn up in the form in which they are presented.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly. I was about to say that except in one item the Estimate of this year is almost identical with the Estimate of last year, and that item is not material, because it represents an increase of £37,000, which, as you will remember, was provided by the Dáil in the very closing days of the last Session in order to make further provision for the secondary teachers.  That increased the amount of the previous Estimate, £63,000, to £100,000.  In that respect that is the only substantial difference between the figures for 1923/24 and the figures for 1924/25.

      <P>I think that the Minister is to be congratulated upon the statement he has made, so far as it goes, and that Deputies cannot really be expected to offer criticism of that statement until they know all the details. But as a beginning I think we may really welcome this as a red-letter day for secondary teachers in Ireland. This really is the beginning of something being done for them, and I think from Deputy O'Connell to myself that Deputies have not lost an opportunity of pressing upon the Government the urgent needs of the secondary school teachers, and I would say also that the Government themselves have never hesitated to admit that there were these claims and these needs.  Up to the present they have done nothing to meet them, and now we are really faced with a promise from the Minister for Education&mdash;and I want to put this explicitly, so that there will be no mistake about it&mdash;that they intend that the secondary teachers for the coming year shall be working upon totally different lines, and shall have what may be regarded as a satisfactory means of livelihood. I think the Minister said that, and I would like him to correct me if I have in any way exaggerated his statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we cannot say until we know something further what the position of schools will be; whether they will be able, with the capitation grant that will be provided, to meet their own needs and to pay this basic salary, but I think we may assume at this stage that the Government will carry out their plans so as to put the schools into a position to pay that basic salary.  That is the first essential.  The second is that the teachers should have a satisfactory system of increments and that their past service should be adequately reckoned to enable them to be put at once on a proper basis as regards salaries.  The Minister has not gone into certain other questions, and we cannot, I suppose, hope that everything will be done at once.  There still remain to be dealt with the questions of their tenure and their superannuation.  We can only hope at this stage that the Minister will keep these before him and will come to a decision on them at as early a date as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass over as really not vital at the moment what we are considering, namely, the Estimates.  I did not feel that we really are in position to consider programmes in any serious way while the teachers are really living on starvation wages; but when we get this other question settled, perhaps we can go into the question of the programme more fully.  At the same time, I take the opportunity of saying that this programme introduces changes, many of which, I believe, will be accepted as real improvement.  I welcome what the Minister said in reference to the part the teachers have played in fitting themselves, so far as they could, and in many cases by very serious and great efforts, to fulfil the conditions that have been laid down as necessary for registration.  I think the Minister paid them a well-deserved tribute when he said that they had carried out their part in a very creditable and laudable way.  What the Minister has said ought, to my mind, to make the consideration of these Estimates to-day a very short matter, because, as he pointed out, we are not really passing the Estimates for the year; we are only passing a Vote on <Col N="717" /> account.  But there is one point that I would like to have cleared up immediately, and that is, how it is that the Interim Grant, this £100,000 has not yet been distributed to the schools.</P>
    <P>I know that some schools have got their share of the interim grant but others have not and I would like the Minister to explain the cause of that delay.  It is less necessary now no doubt to demand an explanation and ask for a promise of reform in the future in this matter than it would have been before the Minister's statement because we know now that it will be different in the future, and teachers will know what they are going to get. They did not, however, know that, when the school year ended, because they did not get their grant, and they did not know what their share in the grant was going to be.  In the past year I think it is regrettable that the distribution of that grant was delayed and I hope the Minister will give a promise that the remainder of the grant will be distributed without any further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>While I share Deputy Thrift's joy that the lot of the secondary teachers has been relieved I do hope apart from the merits of the case it will shorten the debate. There is one point to which I wish to draw attention and it comes in under the new rules of which the Minister spoke.  It is perhaps unfortunate that these rules have not been laid on the Table.  They are not in the library upstairs, particularly as the Minister said that he wished the Dáil to be informed on these matters.  Probably it is due to an oversight and perhaps there is no statutory obligation to do so, but these rules are not to be found in the library.  I think I am right in saying that the sum allowed for scholarships is in the future to be £40 for boys and £30 for girls.  That discrimination between the value of a scholarship for boys and girls introduces a new principle into the administration of scholarships because, hitherto, there has been no sex discrimination. I think we ought to know the reason why it has been introduced.  I think I am right in saying&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;that neither in the Intermediate system nor in the University, <Col N="718" /> with the possible exception of Queen's University, Belfast, is there any distinction in the amount of scholarships owing to the sex of the recipient.</P>
      <P>I think there are certain foundation scholarships in Trinity College for which women are not eligible but that has been equalised by scholarships of the same kind which are non-foundation and which are open to women. Now, the Minister has introduced a rule that a girl is to get £10 less than a boy and the only justification for that would be if he could prove that a girl costs £10 a year less than a boy to educate.  I am very doubtful of that. In my own case I find that a girl is as expensive as a boy to educate and I think that is generally the case throughout the country.  I think that that discrimination against the girls is going to hit female education rather hard.  I do not say that it is a breach of the Constitution because it is not a breach of the letter of the Constitution, but I think it is a breach of the provision of the Constitution which declares that citizenship is equal to both sexes and that primary education is free to both sexes.  I think that such a regulation as this is not quite framed in that spirit and that it is going to hit a clever girl rather hard because it is always difficult to get a girl educated in the country.  Parents are more inclined to pay more attention to a boy's education because there are a greater number of posts for them and it is more the custom to keep a girl at home to help her mother.  I do not think that the Minister intended to hit female education and I think that this discrimination was probably forced upon him by financial necessity and possibly with a view to meeting the Minister for Finance in order to get this increase in the salaries of secondary teachers.  If the sum available for scholarships is limited I would urge the Minister to abandon this system and if necessary, reduce the number rather than the amount of the scholarships and in that way he will be sure of getting the best out of the scheme and making competition keener. There is little to be said for discrimination, simply and solely on the ground of sex in the amount of the scholarship awarded.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is so difficult to have justice done in these days we should be thankful if tardy justice is done.  I am glad that the Minister has made the statement which he has just made.  For the first time he has given us something more than vague, indefinite promises of favourable consideration.  Like Deputy Thrift, I say that of course there are other matters such as the tenure of teachers and their superannuation, but I do recognise that he has taken at least the first step towards putting the teachers in these sechools on a sound professional basis.  I agree with Deputy Thrift that this is not the time to go into detailed criticism of the Miniser's statement.  As a matter of fact, it does not permit of detailed criticism at this stage and we are not in a position to offer anything like useful criticism of it.  I take it that the proper time to do that will be when the supplementary estimate comes up for consideration before us.  There will be many matters such as the conditions of service, the increments, the maximum figure of salaries, the conditions under which the increments will be given, the conditions governing the employment of teachers, the number of pupils and so on, which will undoubtedly get detailed consideration before the Minister comes before us with his supplementary estimate, and we shall be afforded an opportunity then of giving our views as to how these conditions shall be determined. I believe that it would be impossible for the Minister to take up any new reforms by way of programme or anything else if he did not take the step which he has taken to-day in connection with teachers.  I think it was in the course of the debate on Thursday that he himself told us that if you have good teachers it does not matter very much what other school arrangements there are, and that on the contrary if you have not good teachers other arrangements are not of much use.  I think that is a fact admitted by everyone.  It must be admitted, too, that this country would not have much longer had good teachers if some step had not been taken such as that just announced to put the teachers' profession in the secondary schools on a sound and satisfactory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> With regard to the programme itself, I do not wish to say anything except in a general way that, on the whole, it must be admitted that it is an improvement on things as they stood heretofore.  There is one comparatively small point which I think is important, and I would like to draw the Minister's attention to it in this connection.  The regulations tell us that the purpose of the new proposed intermediate certificate is to testify to the completion of a well-balanced course of general education suitable for pupils who leave at sixteen years of age and for the fitness of pupils who enter for the more advanced courses of study in secondary or technical schools.  The object of the intermediate certificate is set out plainly there.  It will be to a boy leaving school advantageous to have such a certificate.  Yesterday I suggested that there was no reason why in some of our schools, which cannot be technically called secondary schools, boys would not reach the same standard of education that is required by this new intermediate certificate, but, as the regulations are drafted, such boys would be precluded from entering for or obtaining such a certificate if they reach this standard.</P>
    <P>Regulation 1 (a) says: &ldquo;Pupils are required to pursue a course of study of a certain duration at a secondary school before admission to any of the public examinations.&rdquo;  Now, as I say, I know several national schools in the country where senior pupils attend, and are encouraged to attend, by the teachers, and their parents are anxious that they should attend, and sometimes they attend up to the age of fifteen or sixteen.  I see no reason why, if some pupils reached the standard of proficiency required by this certificate, they would not be in a position to go in for the examination and obtain a certificate which would be very valuable to them if they were seeking employment in business or any other such way.  That does not mean that special fees should be paid for those pupils.  That is not the suggestion. Some few years ago pupils from the national schools did go in for the various intermediate examinations.  I do not see why that regulation should be <Col N="721" /> discontinued, and I think it would encourage boys to stay at the senior classes in national schools if they could look forward to sitting for this examination and obtaining a certificate as a result of their studies.  I strongly urge on the Minister to consider that particular point in connection with the programme.</P>

      <P>I, like the other Deputies, offer very willingly my tribute to the Minister.  We cannot claim to be specially conservators of the interests of education in this House, because every member who has the interest of the country at heart must realise that the future of the country largely depends on education.  To-day we have at last, in outline at least, a scheme that gives us hope, and we have a promise that one of the most crying grievances in this country, that of the secondary teachers, will be remedied.  In a kind of way&mdash;the Minister will not mind my saying it&mdash;he has created disappointment.  I am sure that some members come with bricks in their pockets to hurl at the Minister. He never expected them to present him with bouquets.</P>

      <P>The Minister, however, is indifferent to both bricks and bouquets.  I was beginning to despair. I did not know whether it was the Minister for Education or the Minister for Finance, but I thought they were, like the gods of Epicurus, who &ldquo;haunt the lucid interspace 'twixt worlds and worlds,&rdquo; and nothing would break the sacred, everlasting calm, certainly not the complaints from Deputies. Now we find a Minister is realising his godlike duties and is going to administer his educational world, and I would urge upon him to let no more delays occur.  There are three things.  First of all, I would urge that the interim grant, as Deputy Thrift has pointed out, is not yet distributed and should be distributed immediately. Secondly, I think that a scheme which he is going to produce in co-operation with the Minister for Finance, a scheme of salaries rising by definite increments, should be settled <Col N="722" /> as soon as possible and paid as soon as possible.  It is as essential for the secondary teacher as for the Minister for Finance to make up his yearly budget, and I would urge the Minister, if possible, to let that scheme be published inside the next couple of months or before the next school year. Thirdly, with Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Thrift, I would urge the Minister to consider the necessity of producing at the earliest possible period a Bill dealing with the question of pensions and superannuation for secondary teachers.  The Minister has, by his statement, disarmed most of my criticisms, and I will congratulate him. I will keep my criticism of the programme for the supplementary estimate.</P>

      <P>There is a story, often told I am sure, of the Jew who, forgetful for the moment of the precepts of his creed, had partaken of pork, and by an unhappy coincidence lightnings came out of the clear sky and he exclaimed, &ldquo;What a fuss about a little piece of pork!&rdquo;  Deputy Alton and Deputy Thrift almost indulged in pæans of congratulation; for what? For a promise, that some time shortly, I suppose at no far distant date, steps will be taken to introduce a scheme of salaries, nebulous so far, except for the assurance that in the case of men they are to begin at £200 a year.  There are women teachers.  Are they to be forgotten? On what scale are they to be remunerated?  Where are they to begin?  After all, the Dáil must not forget, and, if it were disposed to forget, it has been reminded very recently by Deputy Cooper of the equality of men and women before the law, and the equality of men and women under the Constitution, and the bringing about of what I have spoken of as the great aim of education, that is, the provision of the good citizen of the good State, which depends very largely on the proper education of women. Intermediate education, or secondary education, for girls, is none the less important from the national point of view, in the national interest, merely because there are fewer girls' schools, and fewer girls attending them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, what is £200 a year with <Col N="723" /> the possible increments, when one considers the very stringent requirements that are laid down, or, at any rate were laid down by the educational authority? The teachers are to be registered and are required to fulfil quite a number of difficult conditions.  The teacher was a graduate of a university; he had proceeded to a diploma in teaching, and he had at least three years' experience in teaching.  He had, as Deputy O'Connell calculated it in another context a few days ago, seven years' apprenticeship to serve.  Is £200 a year considered an adequate salary for a position of trust?  For that is precisely what the teacher's position is.  Whether he is primary, secondary or higher, he is in a position of trust.  He has the shaping of the future destinies of the nation largely in his hands.  He has the children committed to him at the formative period.  If, at least, he does not positively construct them, at any rate he has tremendous opportunities for injuring them.  The selection of those teachers and the attraction to the service of the proper type of teacher is therefore of the first importance.</P>
    <P>Now, the bank clerk holds a position which I do not intend to disparage.  He is a very useful member of the community, in fact, indispensable.  But the bank authorities do not demand any very considerable educational proficiency in his case, though they do, of course, look to considerable qualifications in point of character and things related to character.  Through the mere fact of having got into the service of a bank, the ordinary bank clerk may count upon reaching £400 a year without being promoted to be a manager.  And he receives all this free of income tax.  I have dwelt upon this so often that I am almost ashamed to return to it again, but I find reiteration &mdash;though iteration has been called by a distinguished writer &ldquo;damnable iteration&rdquo;&mdash;has become essential in this connection.  The work that these teachers are called upon to do is a highly specialised type of work which only the man who has received an adequate education and intellectual and moral training can hope to do.  The schools and the colleges and the universities <Col N="724" /> are in competition with all the other careers for the securing of men of just that type, and men will not go into what has been hitherto a comparatively despised occupation unless the prospects are good.</P>
    <P>There are, I am willing to admit&mdash; because I know of them&mdash;men who are willing to work hard year after year in the teaching profession for less rewards than their abilities would bring them in another profession.  These men, because of their love for teaching and their zeal for education, are willing to make that sacrifice.  But I am speaking now of the generality of men as they stand.  After graduation, on the threshold of life, when they look around them and see the prospects of the professions or of businesses of various new kinds that are open up to them, will they be willing, will those who advise them in these matters, be likely to advise them to embark upon the career of a secondary teacher with £200 a year and certain increments, when we know that amongst those increments, for the vast majority of them, will not be included a head-mastership? Whether you like it or not, when we take into account the conditions that obtain, our secondary schools are, and have been, and we may venture to prophesy, will be, worked by the only agencies that, under the circumstances, could have hoped to work them.  Consequently the headmaster is a member of the Order that owns the school.  I am speaking now with regard to the schools that I know most about and am most interested in &mdash;that is, the Catholic schools.  What I say does not apply to Protestant schools, because their head-masterships are within the ambition of the assistant teacher, and he may look forward to one day filling those most important and comparatively lucrative posts. What I am saying applies all round to the profession of education.  It applies to the secondary teacher no less than the university professor.  The State cannot secure the services, in most cases, of the right type of man without being willing to pay.</P>
    <P>There is another protest I would like to make.  The public have short memories, not here alone, but elsewhere. <Col N="725" /> A new king ascends the throne. <i>Vive le Roi</i> comes from all sides.  Then the world begins on that date.  The passage which the Minister for Education read from a newspaper criticism upon him and his administration, speaks of the old bad methods, the old harsh, inelastic programmes.  Now we are going to have the new.  The new methods that are indicated belong to the policy for which the late Intermediate Education Board struggled for the freedom to set in being.  The late Intermediate Education Board threatened on one occasion, now nearly 16 years since, to resign as a body as a protest against being compelled to distribute the moneys to the schools exclusively as a reward on the basis of competitive written examinations. They succeeded in getting inspection. They pressed further, and eventually they were allowed to create a body of inspectors.  No change in the educational system has been productive of such extraordinary benefit as that.  It is very rare that those who serve the public get the proper tribute to their work in their own time, but on all sides, from teachers who might be prejudiced and critical, from head-masters, from Commissioners of Education, from everyone who knew the men and the work they were doing, these Intermediate inspectors have received nothing but unbounded praise.</P>
    <P>They, I may say without exaggeration, transformed in a very brief period of time all the work from a mechanical procedure in most of the secondary schools into live and genuine teaching. The capitation system, with the inspectors' plus examinations, was worked by the late Intermediate Board, and they indicated as a necessary reform the substitution for the three grade examinations of the Intermediate certificate and the leaving school certificate. These things are now apparently in the eyes of certain editors new improvements. But what I think the Ministry of Education ought to be commended for is that they have set to work as instruments of the first educational body that has been responsible to the Irish people, to do these things, and to bring into actuality, as they are now in actuality, those measures of reform that <Col N="726" /> other Irishmen, no less interested in education, struggled to bring into being but were not permitted to create. That, after all, is their very real credit, and it is in a measure altogether theirs.</P>
    <P>I do not like to be for ever on the attack, but I cannot restrain my criticism from one thing, this truism about education depending upon the personnel of the teaching staff.  It has been echoed from bench to bench.  Examine into it, and what does it come to? That if you have a perfect system of education, then your educational machinery is perfect.  What is meant by the good teacher?  The teacher teaching well.  Using the jargon on another subject, &ldquo;Don't view the teacher statically; view him dynamically.&rdquo;  The good teacher is a teacher teaching well. The teacher cannot teach well if he is not teaching a good programme as part of an organisation well conceived.  The system requires to be right in order that the teacher should be good.  I do admit that the quality, and, to a large extent, the volume, of the result achieved depends upon the personality of the teacher.</P>
    <P>But that is a different question altogether.  As Deputy Alton reminds me that is what was meant.  If that is what was meant that would be an argument for an almost lavish expenditure of money, whereas, when you talk of the good teacher teaching well it seems to me to be in favour of a <i>laissez faire</i> arrangement.  After all you get the man.  You let him go and the results are what might have been expected.  The amount of money set down in this Estimate is not lavish.  I know that Deputies of the Business Group are thirsting to get up and make a protest against the amount.  Do they realize that the money set out in this Estimate for education represents only a fraction of all the money expended upon education?  The Intermediate system of education, or the Intermediate Schools rather, in Ireland rank very high.  As compared with the Intermediate Schools in other countries they are excellent.  There is a great deal of money expended on them from private sources that does not appear in the public Estimate.  This public Estimate would be very much higher, and <Col N="727" /> would excite the wrath of the business men more, if it were not for that fact of Irish history, which I need not dwell upon at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat objected to the vote for primary education on the score of salaries and expenditure, or rather it was with regard to superannuation. He spoke of other walks of life providing no superannuation for the men engaged in them.  I would ask Deputy Hewat to remember what the public does not always remember with regard to the teachers, and which the teacher is painfully conscious of in his own experience. The more successful he is, and that means the more zeal and the more energy he has put into his work, the more likely is he to have produced a man who will supplant him.  The teacher all the time is producing rivals to himself.  There is no other productive occupation in the whole range of human experience, that is, of that peculiar type.  No doubt, in the case of the workman, the apprentice learning from a superior man may get the other's job. That is an accident of life.  It is not part of the intention and the purpose of the work, whereas in the case of the teacher it is.  That is a reason why the superannuation allowance ought to go with salaries that are provided for teachers if there were superannuation allowances for no other occupation under the sun.  That is one of the things that I have not heard of as satisfactory, so far from the Minister with regard to the improvement in the position of the secondary teachers.  Are these salaries to be absolute or are they pensionable?  Is a pension to accrue? It is most important that the teacher, in addition to having an interim to look forward to should have a retiring allowance to count upon as well.</P>

      <P>I know that a good many Deputies came here to-day with big guns charged to let them loose upon the Minister for Education, but by a delicate turning movement he has practically escaped the fire altogether. I join with other Deputies in congratulating him on the advances that are being made.  There is no doubt that probably some people will not be satisfied, but certainly a beginning has been made, and it is a great thing for the teachers to know now that if they are taken on they will have a salary of £200 a year and that that is going to be increased until they get what may be called a decent living.  I do not say that a basic salary of £200 a year is very much to induce any man, particularly a man who has come from the Universities, to take up that very onerous and very trying mode of life.  But I do say that it makes a difference when he knows that in the future his increments are going to run his salary up to at least £400 a year.  I think that both the basic salary and the final salary are something below what is being fixed for the Six Counties.  I am not quite certain of the figures in the Six Counties, but I think our figures are somewhat below the salaries that are paid in the Six Counties.  If that is so I regret it very much, because I think that we should be able here to pay our secondary teachers as well as they are paid in the Six Counties.  I want to press upon the Minister, although I know there is not much use pressing it at this time, that these teachers must know that they cannot be kicked out at a moment's notice, or at three months' notice, but rather that they must receive some form of fixity of tenure and will be able to look forward <Col N="729" /> in their old age to something in the nature of decent superannuation or a pension.  They are not in the position of business men who are able to make a good income during the years of their capacity for earning.  They are fixed down to this small salary just like civil servants, and they are just as much entitled to a pension as the civil servants are.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of this Vote being before the Dáil last year, I stated, and I repeat it now, that if you want good teaching you must have good teachers, and if you want good results you must pay the teachers well.  That is to say, you cannot get good teachers unless they are paid well.  I desire to stress a point that has been stressed by other Deputies, namely, that the interim grant that has not been paid to some schools should be paid at once. I know that that is causing a great deal of irritation and a great deal of uncertainty amongst the managers of schools.  With regard to the future, I press upon the Minister, as others have done, that this is a matter that should be dealt with immediately.  There is one point I would like to refer to, and that is, that in certain schools, I do not know in how many of these intermediate schools, each pupil who enters for an examination has to put down a pound, and if he is not able to put it down, his parents have to do it.  If he passes the examination the pound is returned to the boy or his parents, as the case may be, but if he fails the pound is confiscated.  Whether that is a rule of the Intermediate Board, or whether it is the rule in particular schools, I am not quite certain, but at all events it is a rule that I would like to see abolished, because it is a great deterrent on poor boys to be told that they must deposit a pound before they can go in for an examination, and that if they fail in that examination the pound will be lost to them or to their parents. The Minister will be able to tell us whether that is a rule of the Intermediate Board or whether it is a rule of some of the schools, in order to make boys who have been inclined to mitch or keep away from the examination and who could pass to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the most important point has <Col N="730" /> been reached with regard to the improvement in education is the fact that boys and girls now cease to be made machines for making money for schools.  I think that in the past that was one of the most disastrous things in connection with secondary education, that the results' fees were paid on the result of the examination.  In the past clever boys and girls were seduced from one school to another in many cases, so that results' fees might be obtained by the schools.  They were seduced, too, on a promise that lesser fees would have to be paid to the schools by their parents, so that these clever children might bring the £20 to £25, or whatever the sum was, into the school where they were educated. They were simply worked as machines for making money for schools.  I think that Deputy O'Connell made a very good case for the boys who remain at the primary schools&mdash;in the primary schools where the teachers take a higher class and go beyond the ordinary programme in the matter of teaching Latin, Geometry and Algebra and other subjects that would allow their pupils to compete for the first Intermediate Examination.  I say that the boy in the primary school who is capable of passing that examination and of receiving the certificate that is offered, should be entitled to take it in the primary school.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that the words Deputy O'Connell seeks to have deleted, namely, that the boy must be in an intermediate school, should be deleted. I think, too, that boys attending these higher classes in the primary or national schools should be allowed to compete for these certificates.  I would also like to make a plea for the encouragement of such subjects as Drawing and Shorthand and other subjects that are supposed to be in the business or industrial course.  I have found to my cost that I have been extremely wanting in not being able to do shorthand, and that I was a great deal worse off from the fact that I omitted to learn drawing.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  Elocution was taught in the school that I was at, but, like a good many other boys who were then going to college, I despised <Col N="731" /> the idea of elocution.  I never thought at one time that I should become a lecturer, and would need to be able to speak properly, and so I have suffered from the neglect of the study of that particular subject all the rest of my life.  I, therefore, make a plea, and I am sure the Minister agrees with me, that the schools should give as wide a course of teaching as possible, not tieing the pupils up to the mere subjects that will be of use to them when they go into commerce or go to the University. I would like these subsidiary subjects to be encouraged, so that men, no matter what position in life they find themselves in, may be able to fill these positions with credit to themselves. On the whole, therefore, I congratulate the Minister.  I am afraid that by this time he may be getting puffed up, but it is not a common occurrence I may say in this Dáil for the Minister of Education to get the praise showered upon him that was showered on him this evening.  Those of us who are interested in education are extremely grateful that, so to speak, he has taken the bull by the horns, and that he has done something to satisfy schools that were becoming bankrupt, and that he has given some hope to the Intermediate teachers, not the Headmasters, but some hope to those who had taken it up in their junior years as a profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help feeling that the congratulation of Deputy Professor Thrift on the statement made by the Minister with regard to the future salaries proposed for secondary teachers was something like the sigh of relief a fellow gives when somebody kneeling on his chest unexpectedly steps off.  I feel that as far as the congratulations have gone in the matter they have been congratulations that really if you examine them are sighs of relief that something is about to be done.  But simply to state that you are going to start and make a minimum salary of £200 a year for a secondary teachers, and that they will get increments of some kind, and to leave it at that, is not giving us any information from which we can relax the pressure of criticism at the present moment. <Col N="732" /> I just happen to have here a list of people who get more than £200 a year, and if we examine the new intermediate programme, for secondary schools, and if we have a proper and due appreciation of what is the position of secondary teachers in our general system of education, and what the proper arranging of our educational system means to the country, we have some idea of what type of man we require as a secondary teacher, and some idea of the responsibilities that would be placed upon secondary teachers.  The following is a list of people who get more than £200 a year:&mdash;Draughtsmen, electricians, bricklayers, cabinet-makers, carpenters, joiners, coach-builders, plumbers, gas-fitters, plasterers, bakers, table hands, oven men, butchers, switch board attendants, tin smiths, sail makers, tent makers, upholsterers, etc. You are starting off, whatever may be said about what was done in the past, or whatever may be said about what led up to the present situation here, with new hands upon the educational system, and a new outlook and new hopes.  You want to attract the young men leaving the universities to the ranks of the secondary teachers' profession.  I think it would be unfair, in the start that we hope to make now, that there should be fixed simply a scale of salaries without any reference to pensions.  We all know, or at least we all hope, and we have a certain amount of reason for knowing, that the world is going round and round, and we do know that we cannot escape facing the question of pensions for teachers in three or four years' time.  You are going to make a false start now, and you are going to lose three or four valuable years if you do not face the pension question when you are facing the salary question.  You are either going to lose a good many coming into the ranks of secondary teachers, or you are going to bring in good men to disappoint them in four or five years' time by introducing a pension scheme that will be a contributory one and you are going to take back from them some of the money you are giving them now under the guise of a fixed scale of salary and increment.  I just want to raise that word of warning to the Minister for Education and to the <Col N="733" /> Minister for Finance, and to the Deputies here who are interested in getting a proper start in educational matters just from this very year.  We would want to hear very much more about what the intentions of the Government are in this matter before we really can afford to gasp with relief. It will not be facing the question and dealing with it in the way it should be dealt with if the matter of pensions for our teachers is going to be left out of consideration at the present moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>My sympathies in this matter lie with the attitude taken up by Deputy Mulcahy, not that I would quote the wages of joiners, cabinet-makers and plumbers as something that ought to be lower than the wages of secondary teachers, but I think that he is right in asking us just to withhold our congratulations, or at least to keep them in a minor key.  The difference between the present minimum, if there is a minimum, and I think there is a minimum of £180, and the £200 promised, is not so great as to make one feel jubilant that something has been accomplished.  But my hesitation lies in this: that I remember on several occasions we asked the Dáil from these benches not to be content with promises, but to let us have either legislation, or accomplishment in the way of administration which will satisfy us that the thing has been done, and not merely that it is about to be proposed.  I would like to have had the details of the scheme that the Minister has touched on.  He has given us some information; he has given us the bones, but we require and ought to have it, I think, considering the great deal of time and attention that has been devoted to this question, we ought to have the matter in a little more detailed way, we ought to have the propositions in a little more detailed way, and, even now, I would ask the Minister to tell us how soon we may expect those details and, therefore, what date the new conditions will be applied, and as to what period the new appointments will cover.  Even that information would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the present minimum and the proposed minimum, as I say, is not so great as to make one jubilant.  Everybody has spoken about <Col N="734" /> the position of the secondary school teachers.  I happen to know two men, one of whom preferred, and did, as a matter of fact, spend quite a long time working at the docks rather than keep on applying for a position in a secondary school; and another very competent man, known to many of us, who did as a matter of fact go round the country fairs and markets with a fiddle accompanying a dancer rather than continue his applications for a job in a secondary school.  It gives one an idea at least of what men highly accomplished have been driven to in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to support the line taken up by Deputy O'Connell in regard to this programme.  The Minister told us here yesterday that his purpose was to coordinate the work of the primary and secondary schools and to bridge the gap that has hitherto existed, and he did say that in the programme there had been more or less overlapping&mdash; overlapping in the right sense, as he suggested, of splicing.  But it seems to me that the point raised by Deputy O'Connell rather shows that it is still in the nature of an aspiration and that in practice it is defeated.</P>
    <P>The pupils may not enter upon an examination unless they have pursued a course of study of a certain duration at a secondary school.  They will not be admitted to either of the public examinations. In the case of pupils who intend to follow a secondary school course it is advisable that they should enter a secondary school at the age of 12 years where possible; and then it is intimated that for the purpose of the Intermediate certificate recognised pupils who had attained the age of fourteen years on the 1st August were to follow an approved course at a secondary school for three years.  That, of course, precludes boys and girls attending a great many of the primary schools, and taught by primary school teachers, but whose parents are not in a position to send them to secondary schools.  There may be no secondary school near at hand.  A boy may be competent, may be clever, and the teacher may be most competent and able to teach, to bring that boy forward, but unless the pupil has taken a course of <Col N="735" /> study at a secondary school for two or three years, he cannot enter this examination. I submit if we are going to bridge the gap, and bring together the two courses, we ought to make it possible for the higher classes in the primary schools to enter for this Intermediate certificate.</P>
    <P>That would go further than, as far as I can see, most other propositions in the direction of linking the two systems together.  I imagine that there still remains the idea in the minds, perhaps, of the framers of this scheme that it is the attendance of the school, the surroundings, the atmosphere, that is doing the work required, and that unless the boy or girl is able to go to a secondary school he or she is not able to get the advantage, the impress, that a secondary school education gives. There may be some truth in it, but the pity is that it is true, if it is true, and we should not now, while talking about co-ordination of the systems, say that it is and must continue to be true.  It practically tells the primary schools that they can never attain to the position of the secondary schools in regard to this atmosphere, and the quality of education that is provided for youth. I am afraid that that provision somewhat spoils the intention, and that we ought to make it possible for the teacher in the primary school who is competent to train the boy of poor parents, who cannot afford to send him to a secondary school, to train that boy and bring him to that standard which would allow him to take the Intermediate certificate.  Then you might have the possibility of that continuous educational process which we have been talking about, and which we thought from the Minister's speech was his intention. It seems to me that these two or three rules Deputy O'Connell drew attention to suggest that in practice the Minister's intention is not to be given effect to, and I hope he will give us some assurance on that point.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, there is one small point I would like to urge on him, that is the advisability of taking the teachers into consultation in framing <Col N="736" /> the scheme which he has outlined to us, and settling the details of the scheme.  It is, I need hardly say, very important that they should be consulted when these details are being settled, and that they should be satisfied with the scheme as a whole.  I would also urge the necessity of announcing the scheme as early as possible.  The academic year, I think, begins on the 1st August, and it is essential that the matter should be settled, and finally disposed of, so soon as possible after that date.  I quite realise that the supplementary estimate cannot be taken until the autumn session, but I suggest that everything should be ready for the early days of the autumn session so that the matter can be settled.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat impressed by the argument put forward by Deputy Johnson with regard to boys from a primary school not being able to get the Intermediate certificate unless they have spent some time at a secondary school.  I know there are good schools in the country where the boys' parents are not in a position to send them to get secondary education, and they are debarred from getting their due share of what they are entitled to.  I know where the county council scholarships are in operation in some places the standard for obtaining one of them is that a boy must have passed a certain standard in the Intermediate. That should not be allowed to continue any longer.  I know districts where there are boys living away from centres where the Intermediate system is available who, if they had the opportunities of boys living in the immediate vicinity of these schools, would be able to go in and take a fair share of the education offered by these schools.  I think the gap could be bridged over in some way by allowing the teacher in a primary school in a country district to put a pupil forward if he thinks he should be put forward, and give him the value of the benefits he would derive from attending a secondary school.</P>

      <P>With regard to the disbursement of the interim grant, already about £35,000 has been paid out, and the grant is actually in course of payment.  What happens is that the returns come in by degrees and piecemeal and the grants are paid as soon as the returns are complete.  In some cases various questions arise, and one of them is in regard to the more or less difficult case of the share of individual teachers&mdash;a matter which often requires to be gone into in detail. But I do not think that I can plead guilty to anything like departmental delay in the matter.  At all events the intention of the department is that the grant should be made available for each school as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The point was raised by Deputy Cooper of the discrimination in the programme between boys and girls in the matter of scholarships; and great stress was laid on the fact that the scholarship provided for girls was £10 less in amount than that provided for boys. The Deputy might have said that £10 more was provided for boys than was provided for girls, which, as a matter of fact, is the more accurate way of putting it.  There is no reduction.</P>

But if there is a constitutional question involved I may remind the Deputy that it arises on every one of these estimates.  There is not a single estimate dealing with any department which does not pay smaller salaries to women than it pays to men; and therefore I hold that I am not the person who is primarily guilty of this grave violation of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>A Deputy suggests that we should reduce the number of these scholarships rather than reduce the amount.  It is arguable which would be the better.  And if it was proved to me that it was better to keep up the amount and reduce the number, I should certainly adopt that suggestion.  With regard to pupils remaining under instruction in primary schools, and receiving in those primary schools instruction that would correspond with the standard or programme in the secondary schools&mdash;any part of it, I do not know whether the rule as it stands is as inelastic as has been suggested; and if it is I undertake to have it looked into, and to take care that it will be made sufficiently elastic to provide for effective instruction given by teachers of primary schools.</P>

      <P>Whatever the obstacle may be I think it ought to be removed.  And in saying that I want to make it quite clear that I should not like that to be done in such a way as to draw away the attention of the teachers from the work at one particular end of the educational chain, and make them concentrate on the other. I should want to make sure that care was taken that no abuses arose out of it in that respect.  I may say that I think that Deputy Johnson was a little <Col N="739" /> hard on me in suggesting that, even as it stands, the rule vitiates my intentions. I do not think that statistically the number of schools, and still less the number of pupils affected is very considerable. However, as I have said, I should like to see, and will look to it, that an arrangement be made that will do justice to any teaching of the quality and degree corresponding to that required by this programme when that teaching is done by teachers of primary schools.  I miss Deputy Magennis.  Deputy D'Alton, I think it was, who presented us with the figure of speech, the brick and the bouquet.  If Deputy Magennis were here I should like to remind him that he came armed with a brick and a bouquet, and that he presented me with the brick, and presented the bouquet to himself.  I am not claiming at all for myself to be anything more than an instrument in carrying this programme into effect; and it would be sufficient credit for me if I proved myself an effective instrument in that matter.  There is no doubt that there is not a single new idea in this programme&mdash;not one. There is not a single improvement in it, among the improvements that have been welcomed, that has not been initiated and put forward long ago; and I by no means wish to claim any personal credit at all in the matter. At the same time, while rejecting the bouquets, fragrant as they are, I take the privilege of rejecting the bricks with equal decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised by Deputy Sir James Craig, I think, about a charge of £1 by way of deposit being imposed on students in Intermediate schools.  No such charge is made or required by the Department.  I think that that arises in this way&mdash;it is a matter, too, of some years standing&mdash;it was found that certain schools were in the habit of presenting pupils who were gravely inefficient in a number of subjects; and in order to prevent the waste that took place in that way&mdash; waste of various kinds, a deduction of £1 was made from the moneys payable to schools in each case of that kind. This regulation was of some years standing, and arose from reports made <Col N="740" /> by the inspectors with regard to what they considered to be very serious abuses, and what the Intermediate Commissioners considered to be serious abuses.  And the imposition of £1 as a charge on the pupils must be a thing done by the school authorities, the individual school authorities themselves, in order to indemnify themselves in advance and apparently to enable this abuse afterwards to be carried on.  At all events, the Department of Education is not responsible for any imposition of that kind, and it is evident that the very fact of the imposition is an attempt to avoid a remedy which the Department has endeavoured to put in practice.  I would just blunt slightly the edge of what Deputy Sir James Craig said with regard to making money for schools; undoubtedly the idea of making money has prevailed. I do not think there is a single secondary school in Ireland that could be accused of being a moneymaking institution.  Drawing and shorthand, I should like to see, I think, practically universal.  I think we have got now beyond the stage of the three R's, that writing is not a sufficient accomplishment, and that it should be possible practically for every young man in these times to write shorthand.  I feel, as I am sure others feel here, at a great disadvantage in not being able to write shorthand, and I envy those of my colleagues in the Ministry and others who are able to take notes in shorthand when I am not. Drawing, I say, is a subject of very great importance and should be far more widely and generally taught than it is.  It is of great educational value, far greater than is generally appreciated. Not only is it laying the foundation for the acquisition of other knowledge later on, but is an actual teaching of the faculties and a teaching that can be brought into operation in the case of children at a very early age. As to elocution.  I am not so sure about it.  If it were of the right kind I would not mind.  There are two subjects&mdash; elocution and composition&mdash;and I should say that great atrocities are perpetrated in the schools in the name of both.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy thinks that I have made a great mistake in not having brought forward provision for pensions.  Again I get back to the position, so often asserted here, that pensions are deferred salaries, and to criticise me for not having made provisions for pensions is just the same as to criticise me for not having made larger provision for salaries. The two criticisms would stand on the same footing.  Now, there again it seems to me a great pity that this Assembly, which has both the power of expenditure and the power of taxation, could not devise some means of exercising these two powers.  That is to say, drawing up measures for these two powers simultaneously, so that when an addition to expenditure was proposed the manner in which the expenditure was to be provided should be dealt with at the same time.</P>

      <P>If it were possible even to do it through the Ministers it would be desirable.  It is not. My responsibility in the case is this, that I not only have to provide the means of expenditure, but that also, as one member of the Executive Council, I have to take part in providing the resources or putting before the Dáil the form in which that expenditure is to be met.  But members of the Dáil are privileged.  They can bring forward matters of expenditure without at the same time taking the provision to meet the expenditure into account.  Not only can they do that but they continually do it.  They can suggest that we should spend instead of a quarter of a million one million on a certain object. The same million would do duty for them on one occasion after another. They can spend that million as often as they like.  Every time the Minister for Finance has to spend a million he has got to find the million to be spent. I have endeavoured to be as frank as possible in my statement of the proposals that have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance had been in attendance I should have thought it my duty to be in a position to give you <Col N="742" /> those proposals in as minute detail as possible.  In the Minister's absence I cannot do that.  I can only deal with a matter of that kind as between the Minister for Finance and myself.  I do not think I would be doing it in a proper way, as I realise it, if in the Minister's absence I were to deal with the officers of his Department.  I cannot say when I can give the details, but I do not think it is likely that I shall be able to present them before the Recess. I will feel it my duty to present the details as soon as possible after the Recess&mdash;if possible earlier.  I do not think that Deputy Mulcahy's argument with regard to the comparisons of salaries was valid.  It was effective, but not valid.  It is quite conceivable a Minister of the Government would be making a larger income by promoting Derby schemes or something of that kind.  At all events, a comparison of salaries is not valid.  The proposal I have made this evening represents a very substantial and distinct advance on any financial provision that has been made hitherto for secondary teachers. In the discussions that have taken place leading up to that, I should like it to be known here that the headmasters of all the schools in Ireland, without exception, cordially advocated and pressed upon me the necessity for making some such advance as this in the salaries of registered teachers.  I formally move the Vote.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £343,983 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1925, for expenses of Dublin Metropolitan Police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Vote represents an increase of £16,446 on last year's estimate.  Savings amounting to £46,067 are effected under sub-head (B) (which deals with the pay of the Force), the saving there being £37,570; and sub-head (C) (clothing and equipment), on which there is a saving of £8,497.  Those two substantial savings are more than offset <Col N="743" /> by excesses under sub-head (A) (salaries, etc.), £1,052; sub-head (K) (pensions), £3,411, and sub-head (KK) (compensation under Article X. of the Treaty), £58,292.  Under sub-head (A) (salaries, wages, and allowances), £15,237, Deputies will notice that an increase of £1,052 is caused by the appointment of a secretary in the Chief Commissioner's Office, an additional copying typist, and the reinstatement of a second-class clerk in the Dublin Metropolitan Police Courts. This second-class clerk resigned his position in the Courts after the signing of the Treaty, but before the approval, by the Dáil, of the Treaty, on the grounds that he had been harshly treated on account of his national sympathies.  He obtained an appointment in the Dáil Ministry of Home Affairs, and on the commencement of the recent Irregular troubles he was dismissed on suspicion of being hostile to the Government.  His case was investigated, and it was decided to reinstate him in the Dublin Metropolitan Police Courts, so that it is really a case of reinstatement.  But the item did not appear on last year's Vote. The post of secretary in the Chief Commissioner's Office was one that always existed, but was absent from the Estimates for 1923-24.</P>
    <P>Under this heading you have the salaries of the Police Magistrates.  The Chief Magistrate at present has a basic salary of £1,200, plus bonus, the bonus being £263.  He has, therefore, a total income of £1,463, and the two other Magistrates have basic salaries of £1,000, plus bonus of £263, giving them a total income of £1,263.  When Part 3 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, comes into operation there will be a District Court for the whole of the Saorstát, and it is probable that there will be three Justices of that District Court allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan area, at present served by the three existing Police Magistrates.  The salary fixed by the Act for senior Justices appointed to the D.M.P. area is £1,200, inclusive.  That is, in effect, a salary less than the salary of the present Chief Magistrate by £263.  The salary fixed by the Act for the other <Col N="744" /> two Justices to be assigned to the Metropolitan Police area is £1,100 inclusive, being £163 less than the salary of the present Police Magistrates.  The salaries of Justices of the District Court are to be borne out of Voted monies until 31st March, 1927, and after that date will be charged on the Central Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They will appear on the District Justices Vote until March, 1927, and after that they will be chargeable on the Central Fund. When Part 3 of the Courts of Justice Act comes into operation, there will be a District Justices Vote which will include the salaries of all the Judges of the District Court and of the staffs attached to the court.  This particular item will then disappear from the D.M.P. Estimate.  There is a vacancy in the office of Chief Clerk which has not been filled.  The Chief Clerk retired under Article X. of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>Passing to sub-head (B), dealing with the pay of the Force, a saving of £37,570 on that Estimate is based on a requirement of 1,140 men as the normal working strength of the Force.  A large number of men have retired and are retiring under Article X. of the Treaty, and it is necessary to make provision for the pay of 180 men, in order that there may be sufficient recruits trained to fill the vacancies.  As an offset against this, a lump sum deduction of £13,321 is made in respect of the estimated saving in pay of the men retiring. 210 members of the force will be retiring as between this and December of the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be retirements under Article X. of the Treaty.  The position is that out of 1,124 men who were transferred on the 1st April, 1922, 423 have actually retired, and 190 have applied to retire, so that out of 1,124 men transferred only 600 are now serving.  There have been, from some quarters, suggestions that it <Col N="745" /> was the wish or the policy of the Government to cause men to retire under Article X. of the Treaty, and that statement received a certain amount of publicity through the Press and otherwise. That statement is the exact reverse of the truth.  We have done everything possible to keep on in the service of the Government and of the people the members of the Force who were transferred. We are disappointed that out of eleven hundred men transferred, who for the most part are probably sons of the small farmers of the country, such a large number would decide to take advantage of an Article which was inserted in the Treaty to meet the case of men who would be utterly obnoxious to a new Government, or to whom a new Government would be utterly obnoxious. There is something rather disappointing about that wholesale rush to take advantage of the terms, of that particular Article in the Treaty, and I feel it has been strained beyond the intention of the framers of the document.</P>
      <P>There are four women police provided for in the Estimate.  There was some curiosity expressed on a previous occasion as to the purposes for which they were employed, and I find that they are chiefly employed in cases of offences against children, molestation of women, and sex offences generally. Searching of female prisoners is also carried out by them.  They are sometimes engaged by private shopkeepers to watch for shoplifters and pickpockets, and one part of their duty might be to obtain evidence in cases of illegal betting, palmistry, fortune-telling, and cases of that kind.  I have dealt with the strength of the force as on the 1st April, 1922.  It was 1,124; 423 have actually gone, and 190 are due to go, and will probably go between this and December.  In addition to these retirements, there were certain retirements which might be described as normal owing to age, illness, and so on.  There were about 110 such retirements. The pay of the force was readjusted in March of the current year.</P>

      <P>It is a most appropriate word.  It was readjusted to <Col N="746" /> meet the fall which had taken place in the cost of living since the previous rates were fixed.  These rates were identical with the rates fixed for the British Police Force as a result of the recommendations of the Desborough Committee which sat in 1919.  During the period in which that Committee was sitting the average cost of living figure was 115 above pre-war, and since December, 1921, the cost of living figure has never been more than 100 above pre-war.  The most recent figure was less than 90 above pre-war.</P>

      <P>To meet this reduction the police rates of pay were revised as from the 1st March.  As I explained in dealing with the Gárda Síochána Estimate, it is not the intention that these present rates of pay would be subject to fluctuations with trifling changes in the cost of living. It is intended that the pay of the police would remain unaltered, while the cost of living gravitated between 70 on one side and 100 on the other, and only in the event of a change outside these figures, either upwards above 100 or downwards below 70, would there be any proposal to alter the rates of pay, so that for all practical purposes the members of this Force can feel that the present rates are permanent, static rates, and not likely to be changed in the near future.  That revision of pay was effected on exactly the same basis as was adopted in adjusting the pay of all other Government servants, whose remuneration varies with the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay of a constable who has completed his training at the Depot is now £3 per week, increasing by annual increments to a normal maximum of 78/- at the end of 10 years' service.  It is as well to remind Deputies that in 1914 the initial pay of a constable was 25/- a week, and that the present rate of £3 a week represents an increase of 140 per cent. on the 1914 figure.  A sergeant gets as his initial rate at present 87/- per week, and his initial rate in 1914 was 37/-.  You have there an increase of 135 per cent. over the 1914 figure. Deputies will, of course, keep an eye on the fact that the cost of living figure at present is less than 90 above pre-war, <Col N="747" /> so that while it is natural there will always be discontent when there is a proposal to change the rates of pay&mdash; no man accepts light-heartedly or gladly a reduction of his income&mdash;when you get down to facts, such facts as these figures I have given now, the basis of the discontent is not very sound or very substantial.</P>

      <P>I have here tables showing a comparison of 1924 with 1914, and it might be well to run through it.  In 1914 the Chief Commissioner had a salary of £1,000 a year; in 1924 he has a salary of £1,100.  The Assistant Commissioner in 1914 had £800; he has now £820, rising to £910.  The Chief Superintendent, pre-war, had £300 to £400; he has now £650 to £800.  A Superintendent had £250 to £320, and now has £425 to £585.  An Inspector had £120 to £160 in 1914; he has now £280 to £320.  A Station Sergeant in 1914 had 41/- a week; he has now from 100/- to 105/-. A Sergeant had from 37/- to 39/- weekly in 1914, and in 1924 has from 87/- to 98/6.  A Constable in 1914 had from 25/- to 33/- a week, and has now from 60/- to 83/-.  A recruit constable in training in the Depot had in 1914 20/- a week, and has now 50/- a week, and Deputies will not lose sight of the fact that these figures include free housing and free uniform, and consequently are a little better than they look, even at first sight.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of the recruits.  Oriel House appeared on last year's Estimates, and disappears from the Estimates for the current year.  The strength of that institution <Col N="748" /> in November, 1923, prior to disbandment, was 72 men, not including the director, and of that 72 men, 28 were appointed to the new Detective Branch of the D.M.P.  One of these received rank as superintendent, two received the rank of inspector, five became sergeants, and twenty constables.  Of the twenty who were accepted as constables, one received an immediate benefit of eight annual increments in the normal scale, four received six increments, and the rest received four. Five members of the Transport Branch of Oriel House were accepted for transport duty in the D.M.P.  The members of Oriel House who were not transferred to the D.M.P. received disbandment gratuities of eight weeks' and four weeks' pay, according to service, and a number were employed on protective duties when the D.M.P. remained below strength.  In filling vacancies in Government Departments ex-members of Oriel House receive the same preferential consideration as ex-members of the National Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present strength of the Detective Force is one chief superintendent, one superintendent, five inspectors, fifteen sergeants, and thirty-eight constables. Taking the present strength of the whole force, you have a commissioner, one assistant commissioner, one chief superintendent, seven superintendents, twenty-five inspectors, forty-two station sergeants, 145 sergeants, 843 constables, 189 recruits in training, and four women police, making a present total of 1,258.  That figure must be taken with a reminder that quite a large number of men are due to leave under Article X. of the Treaty within the next four or five months.  In recruiting for the Force preference has been given, and will continue to be given, to the applications of men who had service in the National Army.  Of 663 recruits accepted since April, 1922, 267 were ex-members of the National Army, and 41 were ex-members of either Oriel House or the Protective Corps. Twenty-eight ex-members of the Force who retired or were dismissed for political reasons prior to the Treaty, have been reinstated, and under the provisions of the Superannuation Act <Col N="749" /> of last year the previous service and period of absence of these men will count for purposes of increment of pay and also for pension.</P>

      <P>I would not like to say yes, as a general rule, but always in the case of a good man, a desirable candidate, that rule can be made a little elastic.  Sub-head (C) is for clothing and equipment, £3,382.  You have a decrease there of £8,497, which would be due, I think, to the small issue of clothing to be made for the current year.  The clothing and equipment consists of trousers, night helmets, leather waist-belts, armlets, and a small quantity of serge and cloth tunics for new recruits.  When uniforms are part worn they are issued to recruits to wear them until the full life-time of the garments have expired. I think that that is feasible. Occasionally men retiring give up uniforms in a condition that precludes their being issued to new recruits.  No issue of new uniform is made to men who have sent in application to retire under Article X. of the Treaty.  As in the case of the Gárda Síochána, contracts are made by the Government Contracts Committee, and they are notified in advance of the requirements of the Force.  There is an item of £571 under sub-head (D) for transport.</P>

A man stationed down the country in the Gárda Síochána is not as easily suited as a man in the city, and it was considered better for the purpose of having the Gárda properly turned out that they should get the uniform made up locally by a local tailor to ensure a proper fit.

      <P>They get one uniform there.  Under &ldquo;Transport&rdquo; there is a reduction of £81, which is due to the fact that a motor prison van has replaced the old horse-drawn vehicle, and that eliminates charges for forage and shoeing of the horse.  It is worth mentioning that the change was effected by adopting the body of the old van to a new Leyland chassis at a cost of £650.  There is the fact that apart from being an economy to some extent, the motor van is better suited for the purpose and will minimise the risk of a recurrence of the incident which took place some months ago, when an attempt was made to rescue a prisoner from the horse-drawn van, an attempt which was only defeated by the courage and presence of mind of the driver.  There is an item of £388 for law expenses.  The fee paid to the solicitor for the Metropolitan Police is £300, plus bonus, which varies according to the cost of living.</P>

      <P>I would like to touch on the question of the strength of this Force, compared with the growing population of the city for, say, 30 or 40 years.  In 1883 the population figure was 349,645, and the strength of the Force at that time was 1,245.  In 1891 the population figure had grown to 352,277, and the strength of the Force was still 1,245.  In 1901, the population figure was 392,797, and the strength of the Force was 1,233.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1911 the population figure was 416,104 and the strength of the Force remained much the same, namely, 1,231. The estimated population for the current year is 432,000 and the strength of the Force stands at 1,140.  So we have had for the last 30 or 40 years a very substantial increase in the population of the area in which this Force served, an increase of 24 per cent., while the strength of the Force suffered a reduction of 8 per cent.  You had an extension of buildings and streets in suburban areas, and taking it all round you had a considerable increase in the duties of the Force.  For instance, traffic is a comparatively new thing.  I <Col N="752" /> find, going back on the records of the Force, that this duty, which at present takes 75 men daily, had not a single members of the Force assigned to it in 1914.  Thus you have a combination at the moment of steadily increasing duties and a rather low strength and I think that the general efficiency of the Force, in spite of these facts, is on the increase.</P>
    <P>I am not quite certain at the moment that at some stage during the current financial year it may not be necessary to get powers from the Dáil to increase the statutory maximum, to increase the strength of the Force.  In 1922 you had issued 11,000 summonses and 3,925 arrests were affected by the Force.  In 1923 the number of summonses rose to 17,251 and the number of arrests to 5,288.  Those figures do not necessarily point to an increased lawlessness on the part of the population of the capital but they point, I think, to increased vigilance and somewhat increased energy on the part of the Force. Deputies in considering this Vote will have regard to the fact that the sums provided for compensation and provided by the police courts are substantial, and the actual cost of the police Force proper may be estimated at £208,690, which represents a saving on last year of £45,919, so that the increase as shown on the estimates may create the false impression and is somewhat deceptive.  It is due to the increased pension burden.</P>

      <P>I have something to say on sub-head (A), but it may also come under sub-head (KK). It is hard to disentangle the two.  The position indicated by the Minister with regard to the number of retirements <Col N="753" /> from the Force is a very disquieting one to a certain extent, because it practically means that in two and a half years since the signing of the Treaty more than half of the Force that is taken over has gone.</P>

      <P>That means that before December there will only be 410 left of the 1,100 taken over.  That is obviously a situation which must cause certain difficulties both in administration and in the efficiency of the Force.  That means, broadly speaking, that at least half the Force will have less than 2½ years' service, and that in a comparatively large city like this.  From my own personal knowledge I know that the recruits coming in are of a very good stamp.  I was told that secondary teachers, not foreseeing what the Minister for Education had in store for them, were about to seek positions in the D.M.P.  I know that the men coming in from the National Army are men of very good character, indeed.  However good their records are, it will take time to make them efficient police officers.  I think that one of the first directions in which an advance should be made is in that department referred to by the Minister, namely, that of traffic control. The Minister said that we have 75 men employed on traffic control.  That is not an enormous number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major BRYAN COOPER Major BRYAN COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that there were none in 1914.  In 1914 there was certainly a policeman at the junction of Grafton Street and Nassau Street.  He may not have been put down as controlling traffic and nothing else, but that was his chief duty.  The Minister will, perhaps, be able to elucidate the position a little, but he certainly did control traffic, whatever his title was, and it is obvious that there must have been men who did control traffic, because motor traffic in 1914 <Col N="754" /> had developed within seventy-five per cent. of the pitch it is at now.  I think seventy-five men are too few for traffic control.  I think that is noticeable already. A friend of mine told me that on coming in to the city from the Drumcondra side he did not see any policeman until he reached Parnell Square.  And from that to the centre of the city there were only four policemen at a normal time in the morning.  It is obvious that if you have seventy-five men scattered from Drum-condra to Killiney and from Ringsend to Terenure, there will be areas where there is no traffic control, and it is important to train recruits to traffic control as soon as may be, even if it necessitates the putting on of new men.  Another point is this epidemic of retirement from the Force.  Why are we confronted with a Force fifty per cent. new? I think one reason is that there was a feeling of insecurity amongst the men, not so much founded on the reduction of pay as on a feeling that there might be in the future an altered state of affairs in which they would get no pensions at all, and that they might just as well claim their pensions now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, there was no possibility of their getting pensions on a higher scale than under Article X. of the Treaty, and in the interests of themselves and their families, they thought that they should get out as soon as they could.  There was a further feeling; the D.M.P. in the last four or five years has come through a very difficult time, because they were placed in the humiliating position of being the only people in the city who had not a gun. They did not enjoy the guns in the short period that they had them, and asked to have them taken back.  It must be degrading to the morale of a police force who had to stand by while a shop was being held up, because they had nothing but their batons.  In some cases they had the more humiliating experience of being held up by girls. That is a thing no man who takes a pride in his uniform can stand.  Self-respect forbade them to come out, but now that that time is over, they come out for a rest.  I hope that the Minister will tell us whether anything was done to combat that feeling.  Was any special appeal made to those men? <Col N="755" /> Did the Minister parade them and tell them they were stretching the Treaty to an unfair extent in claiming pensions, and that the country and the city needed their services, and that the country would be grateful for those services, because the moral factor is one of very great importance now?  I feel that, possibly, if men had been appealed to in that way, and been shown the situation in the way that the Minister has shown it to-night, we should not have been faced with this position. That is a point which causes a certain amount of anxiety and disquietude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Cooper, I am uncertain as to whether the question I wish to raise belongs to (A) or (KK).  I think it belongs to (A).  The Chief Magistrate of the Dublin Metropolitan area had a salary of £1,200 plus a bonus of £263. Under the recent Courts of Justice Act he becomes a District Justice with a maximum salary (and no bonus) of £1,200.  That is to say, were he to continue as a District Justice his position would be so much the worse.  Is the amount under (KK) a compensation under Article X. of the Treaty which is set down as for probable additional charges made to cover the case of the retirement of the Chief City Magistrate? When the Courts of Justice Act was a Bill passing through this House, I had the temerity to set down an amendment with a view to preserving the primacy of his position and the security, that is, that the status and tenure should not be made worse by the alteration in the system.  That amendment in a slightly modified form, to the best of my recollection, was accepted by the Attorney-General of that day.  However, it appears now from the Minister's statement that the Chief Magistrate, as a District Justice, will have a maximum income of £1,200 from that office.  Consequently, I have assumed, perhaps hastily, that he is bound to retire.  If so, is the provision for that retirement included in the proposed Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather reluctant to say anything in connection with the debate on this Estimate, lest it might <Col N="756" /> be said by the Minister that anything I had got to say was brought forward in a rather mischievous manner.  I do not think the Minister can fully appreciate the fact that the large number of retirements that have taken place, or of which notice has been given by the individuals concerned, are not due to the fact that they seek to get the benefit of the conditions which the Treaty entitled them to, so much as to provide for any future reductions of pay which affect their pensions.  I think if the Minister, in regard to the future conditions of the D.M.P., gave something in the nature of an assurance to the House that the pay of the D.M.P. was not to be affected by the fictitious figures put forward as affecting the cost of living, there would be a greater desire on the part of the old members to continue to serve in the D.M.P.  I think everyone is anxious to do everything that is possible to continue the service of the old men, because the effect of the retirement of a large body of the older members of the D.M.P. is not likely to have a good effect on the work which members of the Force are called upon to perform. I would like to make a protest that the figure of eighty-five per cent., which is given as the increase over the pre-war cost of living, is found in practice not to be the actual figure which prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the average housewife goes out to purchase anything which could be regarded as being a necessary of life, she will find that the figures presented to her in the Government statistics do not really represent the conditions which prevail.  Therefore, the figure of 85 per cent. should not be stressed in this matter by Ministers who are so accustomed to trotting out these figures when there is a question raised as to the conditions of service, either in the D.M.P. or any other body of State servants. We know that the members of the D.M.P. are used to taking a drink in the canteen&mdash;taking a pint as it has been referred to.  The cost of a pint to a D.M.P. man to-day is 400 per cent greater than it was in 1914.  If they like to take advantage of the holidays which are allowed them, they will find that <Col N="757" /> railway fares are anything from 120 to 150 per cent. higher than pre-war. These are things which should not be overlooked by the Minister.  If the Minister pursues the matter further he will find, with regard to everything which the D.M.P. require, that the figure of 85 per cent. does not represent the conditions which prevail at the moment.  If I understood him properly, he stated that there was not likely to be any further reduction in the pay of the D.M.P. unless the cost of living figure, which is given as 85 per cent., is reduced to 70 per cent. or under.  If the Minister makes a definite statement that there is no likelihood in the near future of anything in the nature of a drastic reduction in pay, so far as the Force is concerned, as far as I can gather from speaking to some of the men, he will get an assurance, perhaps from a good many who have put in their papers already, that they will continue to serve the Free State Government.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister absolutely that the terms which have been given under Clause X. of the Treaty to members of the D.M.P. who express the desire not to serve the Government set up by their own people, have been strained beyond any degree that could be regarded as a commonsense degree. For instance, I came across a case the other day of a young member of the Force who came to me and told me that he had put in his papers to retire. He stated that he had no prospects of finding any other employment, but that the pension he was likely to receive would amount to 15s. 10d. per week.  That will give Deputies an idea of the anxiety to take advantage of the very good conditions offered.  I told him that it was a shame for a young man like him, who had no prospects of finding any other employment, to resign and accept a pension which, without any additional income, would not be sufficient to support him.  Employers should definitely state that while there is such a large amount of unemployment in the country no inducement would be held out to young men of that type to take advantage of the taxpayers' money with the prospect of finding employment in any other business.  I merely quote that <Col N="758" /> case to show that there is a desire on the part of such young men to take advantage of the very good conditions of pension.  Such an attitude on their part should be counteracted by the general body of employers stating that they are not prepared to provide employment for such men, especially when there is such a large number of other men unemployed, who have no other means of earning a livelihood.  I hope the Minister will make something in the nature of a definite statement with regard to the question of any further reduction in pay.</P>
    <P>There is, I think, no comparison between the figures in the Estimates for the uniforms of the Gárda Síochána and the sum provided for the uniforms of the D.M.P.  I find that an inspector in the D.M.P. is made an allowance of £15 per year for uniform.  I do not know how many uniforms an inspector would require, or what the cost of three or four uniforms would be, but I am sure that he could get a uniform under better conditions than the average citizen can get clothes.  The Minister stated the other day that 15/- was the allowance given to a member of the Gárda Síochána for a &ldquo;make up.&rdquo;  Although that is only for a &ldquo;make up,&rdquo; there is a considerable difference between that 15/- and the £15 given to the D.M.P. inspector for uniform.  I think that ought to be explained.</P>

      <P>A great deal of dissatisfaction has arisen&mdash; whether it be justifiable or not I am not going to argue at present&mdash;as a consequence of the recent cut, and the Minister in using that deft word &ldquo;readjusted&rdquo; in respect of it has justified such a cut, because of reference to conditions that prevailed before the war. I would like to urge in this matter&mdash; and it would follow upon other matters, too&mdash;that if cuts are to be made, or are not to be made, that they should be justified by reference to conditions relative to the National Exchequer and that there should not be this reference back to some pre-war period, as though that had any extraordinary or peculiar sanctity about it.  When police constables, like others, have their pay cut by references to conditions which prevailed at a time, the details of which are not very immediate to them, and when they imagine that their condition, perhaps, is a great deal worse than it was, or a great deal better than it was, I think that that kind of argument is not really going to help.  I suggest that we are now ten years away from the pre-war period and that if anything has to be done it should be done by some standard that would be more immediate to the conditions we are faced with to-day.  I do know&mdash; and the Minister will have experienced it and other Departments will have experienced it&mdash;that a great deal of irritation is caused, and is in this particular case being caused, by reference to a pre-war standard, that the rate of living is so much higher than it was ten years ago, when it would be just as practicable to say that it was so much per cent. higher or lower fifteen or twenty years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if there be justification for the D.M.P. cut, justification lies in the fact not that the standard of living has changed within ten years, but simply owing to the fact that the National Exchequer cannot afford certain burdens which it had hitherto undertaken. While referring to that I would like if the Minister could give any information regarding what we have already <Col N="760" /> seen notice of in the Press.  That is the attitude of the Ministry in regard to the challenge to the cut.  As that cut would be governed by Article X of the Treaty it underlies this Estimate to this extent, that if that challenge be sustained in the courts of law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like if the Minister could give any suggestion of how the computation of £25 for white gloves was arrived at.  Does he assume that £25 worth of the present white gloves will be lost in the washing in the present year, or that they will be worn out?  I do not know how many pairs of white gloves he expects to buy for £25.  It seems a pretty large sum.  Under sub-head (F) there is a large increase for advertisements. The amount is £124, while it was only £92 last year.  I wonder could the Minister give us some explanation of the extraordinary increase with regard to newspapers, whatever it may mean.  Finally, there is the general question under sub-head (KK), which I protest should not be included in this Vote.

I think, possibly, that some of the difficulties of the Minister might have been avoided if the D.M.P. had been treated under Article X in the same manner as other sections of the public service.  If they had been put down under Vote 16 it would be clearly understood that the <Col N="761" /> Force is being paid as part of the Treaty by the British Government because of resignations, and that the money would be refunded from this State.  I think, possibly, it might be done.  If the sub-head was not under this Vote, but under Vote 16, the Minister might have been saved some of the expense and trouble incurred as a result of Article X of the Treaty.  The last point I wish to make is to draw attention to sub-head (L), some of the items in which are rather grotesque.</P>

      <P>I wish not to support him, but to ask the Minister to buy as many gloves as possible, because as far as I can discover, we appear to be voting an establishment of 1,287 sergeants and constables, and only clothing 1,050 of them.  I presume it is a matter of book-keeping, but when I read the Estimates I did form a horrible picture, only dissipated by this consolation, that there were white gloves, and that 240 odd received an allowance for boots, so that they were clothed at any rate, so far as the extremities are concerned.  I suppose that is merely book-keeping.  I think Deputy Hewat will agree that it is not business to enrol 1,287 men if you are only clothing 1,050, because the others would not seem to be qualified to carry out any very active functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Tailteann Games are in order, but as far as I can gather from the posters, all those concerned in the Tailteann Games are going to be very heavily-clothed indeed. Possibly, these constables have been lent for that purpose, and therefore do not require uniforms.  Coming to (KK), I do not entirely agree with Deputy Esmonde's contention that this sub-head ought to appear in Vote 16. But the inclusion of these pensions does inflate this Vote in a very serious manner, because we have actually arrived at the position when the Vote for pensions and compensation is 50 per cent. of the total Vote for pay.  That is not a usual concurrence in any such Vote. The total Vote for the pay of the Force is £253,000, and the Vote for compensation and pensions is £129,000.  That is a very striking contrast.  Normally, one estimates about 10 per cent. for pensions.  This is a burden that will go on, because as Deputy Davin said, many of the men retiring are comparatively young men, and we shall have the ordinary pension burden of people retiring owing to age going on side by side with it.  I do not pretend to suggest what can be done.  I do not suggest a violation of the Treaty.  I think, if possible, steps should be taken to check any further retirements, even to the extent of a personal interview with the Minister.  It might be a deterrent if it was held up before the eye of the prospective retirer, that he would have to go to the Minister and explain why he wished to retire.  Even if we have to go to that, I think it will be preferable to a further inflation of this very large Vote.</P>

I desire to ask the Minister why he agrees to reinstate twenty-eight men who resigned from <Col N="763" /> the D.M.P. from reasons of national sympathy and to give them credit for their service after reinstatement, and why it is that he is not giving the same concession to resigned R.I.C. men who might be considered fit and suitable candidates for the D.M.P.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Because one man has got a pension and the other has not. There is really no analogy; the Deputy rushes his fences.  You are dealing with the ex-members of a Force that has been disbanded, whose cases have been considered by a committee and who are in receipt, or will be in receipt, of pensions.  In the other case, you are dealing with men whose Force is still in existence.  Deserving cases in that Force are offered and given reinstatement. I suppose I might as well deal now with Deputy Esmonde's white gloves.  Each constable gets two pairs per year, and about 360 pairs are bought yearly.  Deputy Professor Magennis asked if specific provision were made for a pension for the Chief Magistrate.  No specific provision is made.  When the Estimates were being prepared, there was no reason to suppose that the Chief Magistrate would retire under Article X. of the Treaty, and the Courts of Justice Act had not then been enacted, so that we made no forecast in respect of retirement in that quarter.  If the Chief Magistrate is not reappointed as a District Justice the position with regard to his pension will not be in any way prejudiced by the omission.  Deputy Hewat asked a question about pensions.  The position is that 2½ per cent. is deducted from pay as contribution to pensions, and the pensions are then paid out of voted moneys under the Pension Scheme, which is covered under sub-head (K).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears under sub-head (B).  The Deputy will notice a note there at the bottom as to the deduction of 2½ per cent. from the pay of officers and men on account of pension, and a deduction from the men's pay for fines and so on.  This pension <Col N="764" /> business and Article X. of the Treaty have figured a good deal in the discussion. I did, and the policy of the Ministry generally was to do everything reasonably possible to prevail on these men to remain in the Force and to continue to serve.  I did not, as Deputy Cooper suggested I might have done, hold any parade or address the men on the subject, but I know that the Commissioner went to considerable pains to show the men that they had every security by remaining, and that it would be an unfair thing, and perhaps not a very wise thing for themselves, to persist in retiring.  But the lure of the pension was there, and the prospect of easy money, with nothing to do appealed, I suppose, to certain men.  I have known cases of where men asked for reinstatement in the Force on the ground that they had been dismissed from political bias and because of their perfervid national sympathies, and then having secured, by letters and testimonals from Deputies, reinstatement, their names next crossed my desk as men seeking to resign from the Force under Article X. of the Treaty.  So that they wanted to get in in order to get out under favourable conditions.  That, of course, was rank dishonesty.</P>

      <P>It was not allowed. It was not allowed in spite of rather urgent entreaties from public representatives that it should be allowed. Deputy Davin set me a conundrum. He asked me to explain why it is that an inspector of the D.M.P. gets £15 per annum as a uniform allowance although a Guard only gets 15/- for the stitching of a uniform which is served out to him.  Now £15 is adequate to buy an inspector his uniform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>One in the year. The position with regard to a constable in the Guard is that he gets 15/-.  The inspector has a higher rank and his uniform is somewhat more costly.  He buys the complete uniform and all that is allowed is £15 per annum for that purpose.  The Guard, on the other <Col N="765" /> hand, is served out with the cloth, cut up in standard sizes and ready for stitching.  It is sent down to him to his station, and all the local tailor has to do is to stitch the seams, having seen that the thing is a fair fit for the patient.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper mentioned with regard to traffic that he considered 75 men inadequate and that he was quite sure that a certain amount of traffic duty was done in 1914.  The position is that in 1914 no men were specially allocated for traffic duty, and such little point duty as did go on at the time was haphazard.  There were no men at that time definitely allocated to the work, whereas there is now a daily call on the Force for 75 men, which may seem inadequate, but which is all that we can spare for the work out of the present strength of 1,140.  I harped on that aspect, and on the increasing population, and the increasing number of streets and houses and so on rather with a view to showing the strength at the moment was on the moderate side and very much on the conservative side, and that certainly there is no extravagance in regard to it.  I think I have covered practically all the points raised upon the Estimate.  I would like to say generally, as in the case of the other police force, that we are satisfied with the progress that has been made in this Force, and I think there is a steady upward tendency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discipline and the morale of the men is extremely high, despite references made to the reduction of pay and so on.  That has been contested in the way in which men are perfectly entitled to contest it, but it has not affected the efficiency of the Force or the morale of the Force, which is quite good, and there is considerable progress in a great many desirable lines, and there is a fine spirit generally in the Force.  Their keenness on athletics and on all that makes for <i>esprit de corps</i> in a police force is something we regard with great pleasure.  Generally I feel that there is good progress being made, and in the case of the new Detective Branch of this Force I am particularly pleased with the conditions there.  The men have done, and are doing, fine work for the restoration of normal conditions in the capital.  They have grappled with a really serious situation, and they have practically <Col N="767" /> eliminated armed crime from the city. They deserve extremely well of the people of the capital and of the people of the country.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £61,977 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1925, for payments under the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, etc., and for other purposes connected with Irish railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move this Vote.  Most of the services mentioned in this Vote under these five sub-heads are services transferred from the Office of Public Works.  The amount under (C) is, of course, statutory. Most of the other amounts will be minimised, if not entirely wiped out, by the effect of the Railway Bill.  Three of them will almost entirely disappear, and the first will be lessened considerably, and will entirely disappear after the ten years' period.  Now, to take them in order, (A) represents repayments to County Councils.  This arises under the Tramway and Public Companies (Ireland) Act, 1883, and the Light Railways (Ireland) Act, 1889. The Government agreed to pay in respect of the baronially guaranteed lines to the counties one-half of the amount contributed by these counties towards the guaranteed dividends, with this limitation, that there was to be a maximum of 2 per cent. per annum on the paid-up guaranteed capital of the companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimate of the payment definitely and directly due under that Act for the year for which we are estimating, is £17,594. but there is an addition of £16,575. and that arises in this way. The terms of the Act are that the Government shall repay to the County Councils up to the maximum I have mentioned, sums paid by them in respect of the guaranted dividend.  The <Col N="768" /> Government cannot make payments until the counties have paid.  The Government sum is repayment; consequently when certain counties fell into arrears in their contribution the Government contribution for past years was not paid, and it is now estimated that certain of these counties that have been, and are up to the present, in arrear will make payment this year, and we have to bring forward, consequently, as the Government contribution a sufficient sum to meet the amount that will be paid by the councils this year.  That amount is £16,575, the details of which will be found in the paragraph at the bottom of the page.</P>
    <P>The total liability, therefore, which falls to be met this year is estimated at £34,169.  That is to be compared with £23,080.  The figure above on the top of the page 194 is an error; it is put down as £22,080, whereas it should be £23,080, and the increase for this year is practically all attributable to payments by way of arrears.  The second item, &ldquo;Special Railway Undertakings,&rdquo; is a service also transferred from the Office of Public Works.  The estimate here covers the working of the Castlecomer and Wolfhill Colliery Extension and the Arigna Extension. These lines are worked at cost&mdash;the first two by the Great Southern and Western Railway and the other by the Cavan and Leitrim Railway.  These railways were constructed during the war, and so far the revenue has not been equal to the expenditure.  The difference between the sums for last year and this year is about £1,700, and is due to certain additional maintenance works which it was found necessary to have put in hands in order to keep the lines in a safe condition.  These lines, it is expected, will be made over to the amalgamated undertaking, and the Government will be saved the loss that has arisen and is arising since their construction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the amalgamated company pay anything for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend to ask for payment for them, but we are not going to pay the amalgamated company anything for them. It is a matter that falls for judgment <Col N="769" /> to the Tribunal.  The Government contention will be that as considerable capital expenditure has been involved in the making of the lines, the amalgamated undertaking should be glad enough to get these lines without asking anything further.</P>
      <P>The third item arises under the Acts mentioned&mdash;the Railways (Ireland) Acts, 1896, and the Marine Works (Ireland) Act, 1892.  The object of the 1896 Act was to open up poor districts in the country by facilitating the construction of railways and other means of communication.  The object of the second Act was to carry out the construction, reconstruction, and repair and improvement of marine works necessary to the development of any particular industry in the Congested Districts.  Section 4 of the Act of 1896 provided that issues on account of grants were to be met by borrowing from the National Debt Commissioners, and those issues were to be repaid by an annuity chargeable on the Vote. That annuity was not in term to exceed 30 years.  The total issues amounted to £552,000, and the provision required in this financial year is £28,878.  A similar sum was required last year.  Those amounts are statutory.  The fourth item is the expense incurred by the Government in order to keep these lines in Tirconaill working.  In Tirconaill there is the Letterkenny and Burtonport Railway, the Buncranna and the Carndonagh Railway and the Letterkenny Railway.  These are worked by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Co.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the condition in which these lines were found after the period of control had ended, the lines were in danger of closing, and application was made to the Government.  On application being made to the Government, an agreement was entered into by which the Government would advance a sum equal to half the loss sustained in 1923 &mdash;£13,800.  In the last financial year a sum of £1,510 was advanced.  There are to be three equal instalments this year of £1,810, making altogether a sum of £6,940, equal to half the loss incurred in these lines in 1923.  This was an advance as a grant-in-aid to keep the lines working and to prevent the county being left without any railways <Col N="770" /> operating in the area.  It is not exactly a free gift, although there is not much hope as to the recovery of this money.  The whole position is to be reviewed at the end of this year, and it is hoped that with the coming of better times in Donegal that the railways may be able to carry on, and that possibly some repayment of the money may be guaranteed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>Not directly arising out of this.  There is no connection between anything happening in the British House of Commons with regard to this railway company that arises directly or even indirectly from this loan.  I am not clear how far I can throw any light on the question raised by Deputy Davin.  I think he asked me to say whether there was an obligation on the railway company to run certain trains.  If that is what the Deputy asks, there is, I understand, a particular undertaking, but there is an Act, the Abandonment of Railways Act, which would have a certain repercussion. <Col N="771" /> In the case of a railway which has its head office outside the territory, there is, of course, an obvious lack of control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to its being constructed at the expense of the State.  I am clear that the only asset that I could seize upon on foot of this debt, if I were disposed to do so, and if I could legally do so, is the permanent way.  I have no control whatever over the rolling stock.  The portion of the permanent way that lies within the Saorstát is the only thing that could be seized.  With regard to the last item, it is to be taken in conjunction with Section E, which has reference to the acquisition of land for these two colliery railways.  These two railways were constructed during the European war, and owing to the fact that certain owners could not prove their title completely, the land on which the railways were built was not completely paid for.  The settlement of the compensation has been delayed owing to the fact that the owners could not immediately prove title.  It is anticipated that the outstanding claims will be disposed of in this financial year, and the provision here made is certainly ample to cover the liability.</P>
      <P>Take this vote in general, and view it in the light of the legislation now proposed.  You find (A), Repayments to County Councils, etc., which stands at £34,169.  Next year that item will be substituted by an item the net amount of which will be £21,986, because the provisions of the Railway Bill is that the State pays £48,688 and recoups itself to the extent of £6,804 from the Local Taxation Account, and the amount of £19,898 from the Guaranteeing Baronies.  That net sum of £21,986 will disappear after ten years. It is expected that item (B) will disappear completely.  The other item will have to continue, certainly to the same amount for the next year.  Item (D) is expected almost entirely to disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> Indeed, if there was a good season there might be a repayment there.  But it would be too optimistic to hope for that.  Item (B) will entirely disappear, so that this net amount of close on £78,000 is expected next year to be substituted by an amount of £50,864.</P>

There is one item that I would wish to draw attention to.  It is the item covered by (D), which has not been provided for in any Estimate that we have hitherto discussed in this House.  On the last occasion that this Estimate was discussed I did raise a question as to the general policy of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company.  A footnote to this Estimate says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government has agreed to advance £6,940 to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company to meet the losses in the working of the Letterkenny and Burtonport, Buncrana and Carndonagh, and Letterkenny lines, payable in four quarterly instalments.  Three instalments of £1,810 each fall to be paid in the current financial year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this point for Deputy Hewat's information.  Legislation was passed in the British House of Commons which gave certain concessions to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company and which, at the same time, placed upon them the obligation of running what is known as &ldquo;parliamentary trains&rdquo;&mdash;two trains each way on certain sections of this line.  If, in face of an existing Act of Parliament, the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company failed to do certain things, and failed as a private enterprise to carry out their duties to the public, then the railway, which should provide a service to the State and which failed to do so, should revert to the State.  I hope the Minister is quite satisfied that the amount which he is going to give to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company will <Col N="773" /> be used for the benefit and development of the traffic on that portion of the railway which is within Free State territory.  I complained, on the last occasion this Estimate was discussed here, that the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company was not carrying out its obligations under the Act of Parliament I have referred to.  They have refused the request of the people of Donegal for proper facilities for carriage of traffic.</P>
    <P>Their rolling stock, which was bought out of the funds of taxpayers in the Free State area, was transferred to another section of the Company where the interests of the people in the Six County area were catered for rather than the interests of the people in the Free State territory.  I hope the money to be voted in this case will not be used to the advantage of the people of the Six County area as against the interests of the taxpayers in Free State territory who have to find the money. I would like to be convinced&mdash;I am sure it would be difficult to convince the Minister&mdash;that there has been a certain and actual loss in connection with the Letterkenny and Burtonport, and Buncrana and Carndonagh sections. It would be a matter of interest, from what one knows of the presentation of railway accounts, to see how that was worked out.  I am quite prepared to admit that the manager and directors of this Company are very able men, and that it is quite possible for them to bring forward figures that might blind the Minister in connection with this matter.  If the Minister is satisfied that the money to be voted by us and to be provided by the taxpayers of the Free State is going to be used in their interest and not in the interests of the people of the Six Counties, I will be prepared to let this Vote go without further question.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am rather an exploded force in reference to railway matters, and that Deputy Davin's reference to me is more complimentary than effectual.  Dealing with the Lough Swilly Railway Company, Deputy Davin propounds the accusation that the railway company were saddled with a liability to run trains on a section of their line, and that they were not carrying out their bargain.  I <Col N="774" /> think it is perfectly obvious that if that were a private transaction the people who had the mortgage would foreclose on the railway company for not carrying out the arrangements.  I am not clear whether that would be any great hardship.  What I would like to see and what I have advocated here is that the people concerned should make themselves independent of the railways in a case of this kind.  Modern improvements have placed these opportunities in their hands, and the Minister in advancing this sum that the mentions to the Lough Swilly Company is, in my judgment, throwing away the money of the people.  He says himself he is not likely to get it back.  I think that that is so, and that the money could be more usefully utilised in other directions.  That is my only criticism of the provision which deals with the celebrated Lough Swilly Railway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>History covers a multitude of sins.  The Minister tells us that there is a liability on the Estimates for £77,000 for the year.  If we were to tot up all the seventy-seven thousand pounds spent in this way and find how it would work out as an ordinary business proposition, the profit and loss account would not, I think, be very satisfactory to the shareholders concerned.  I now come to (D) and (E). For many years there was a constant agitation in the papers and attacks made on the Great Southern Railway for not making these connections.  The railway company, with the knowledge and information at their disposal, thought it was not a commercial proposition, and not being nationalised at the time they declined to spend the shareholders' money on a proposition that had no possible chance of being remunerative.  I would ask the Minister in connection with these two headings what is the total amount of money that is being spent on these connections and what is the return per mile in the way of traffic.  I ask him, as being successor to the Government who undertook this work, was there any assurance at the time which would lead him to believe that any reasonable return would have been got in any shape <Col N="775" /> or form for the expenditure of the money?</P>
      <P>Was there any guarantee to induce the Government to spend the money on them, and what further liabilities are connected with them?  Of course, the Minister has, under the Railway Bill, camouflaged the whole situation as far as these railways are concerned, because he said that in connection with the amalgamated railways &ldquo;You have got to take this in hand.&rdquo;  That does not get rid of it.  It is like taking a copper out of one pocket and putting it into another.  It is the people have got to pay, and changing it from one account to another does not get rid of it.  The liability is still there, and will be there for all time.  I must apologise to the House for referring to this Railway Bill, which is an obsession with me, and I thought this was an opportunity of leading from the sublime to the ridiculous. I put these conundrums to the Minister, and he will probably bear with me and answer me in accordance with his lights.  The others, of course, are hereditary and they are things that have been undertaken in the past, and, of course, as a business man, I do not say that the House should shirk them in any way.  These liabilities are there, and I accept them.  So far as the Donegal and Lough Swilly Railway is concerned, I have nothing to say on that point.</P>

      <P>I could have wished that I had some intimation that this estimate was going to be taken up this evening.  I did not anticipate we would have reached it in the ordinary course.  It is a very important one from the point of view of the county for which I am one of the representatives. I should like to have it dealt with after more careful consideration, but I have not had time to go into the particulars.  However, I do not see why this particular railway company should have acquired a subsidy of £6,940. Here is a line of 100 miles odd in length and has received from the Treasury some £420,000 for the construction of this line as a free grant.  That was given for the construction of the Burtonport-Carndonagh Railway, and then <Col N="776" /> through an agreement they got the right to work it.  In conjunction with these railways that were constructed by a free grant, they were working as well 13 miles of their own.  During the long series of years they have continued to have the use of this money that they got free and the profits they derived from these lines&mdash;and these profits were considerable&mdash;were carried on to the parent line and found their way into the pockets of the shareholders. When it comes now to a bad spell, and when the weather gets, perhaps, less favourable, they begin to lose money, according to themselves, on the lines that they had formerly made a huge profit on.  Whether these losses arise through deliberate action on their own part, which is rather much like the thing, and which has been, so far as the service of the county for which these railways were made to serve, is concerned, disastrous for the county&mdash; whether that arises from a deliberate policy or not I do not know, but the fact remains that there has been no regularly maintained service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people have been disappointed, the railways are alleged to have been losing, and now they come to us and say: We must close down upon the whole line or ask the Government to stump up to try to keep them running. At the same time some three miles out of the hundred miles they work is within the Six County area between the City of Derry and the junction where the barrier exists.  Recently they have been working strenuously to get a Bill through some House or other in order to enable them to erect a station at Derry.  The idea of facilitating the erection of a station at Derry for the management and the working of the Lough Swilly Railway does not seem to have much sense at the present time.  We, at least, could not afford to give sanction to a proposal of the kind until we find out whether Derry City, which has always been portion of the County Donegal, is to stand in with Belfast or not, or whether this station that is to control the railway within a big area of our county is to be managed, directed and controlled through an agency in the Six County area.  Should the Provisional Boundary, as it exists at present, <Col N="777" /> be consented to by the City of Derry and that they still continue to agree to maintain a barrier between themselves and the people in their own hinterland, and thereby ordain that grass should grow on the streets, it is not a question so much for us as for them.  In the meantime, the question we are up against is whether we should or not grant a subsidy to this railway.</P>
    <P>I think we should call upon them now to have this supplied from the monies that they accumulated in the past on these lines, and that they should not come to us in a time of stress, when in a time of prosperity they got such a huge revenue.  It is well known that the Lough Swilly Railway some time ago was the highest dividend-paying concern in the Kingdom. Now they say they are a bankrupt concern.  It must not be forgotten that the whole 13 lines referred to in the Schedule are only 251¾ miles altogether, and the capital of them is only something over £1,000,000.  That capital was subscribed by shareholders and that capital has got to be paid on. Here we have a hundred miles on which there are no dividends to be paid on the capital that constructed them, so that I think it is preposterous for these people to come here now&mdash;I do not know what is at the bottom of it&mdash;to ask us to give them a sum of £56,940 to help them out at this particular time.  Besides, as Deputy Davin has stated, they have not given any reasonable facilities to those they are supposed to cater for.  These railways have been a sort of laughing stock. There is no area where a better prospect of a remunerative service is offered than in the County Tirconnail. That has proved to be so in the past. They could prove it is so to-day.  The same opportunities exist now for making profits as existed then, and yet here they come to us with a ledger that is altogether on the wrong side, according to themselves.  I think it is not a question for us to take up at all.</P>
    <P>They should be dealt with on business lines only, and whatever object they may have in view in coming to us, with a balance of that kind, whether it could be justified or not, whether it is due to any action of their own which could have been otherwise directed towards having a profit instead <Col N="778" /> of a loss, is a question for themselves. They have undoubtedly used great pressure in every direction to try to secure a concession from this Government and at the same time they were charged with using questionable methods in managing their lines, so far as our people could view them in the position in which the country was placed.  It was very doubtful whether they were not more or less inclined to give little consideration to the stabilising of conditions in the Free State as they should be stabilised.  This was a very doubtful question; and there were arguments on both sides.  For my part I would not like to say that they were acting in full accord with a desire for stability here.  While I would not say that they were in active opposition, at the same time I would not be prepared to acquit them of passive sympathy with a state of affairs that would possibly bring us in the Free State into difficulty, and I think a great deal of the trouble that they allege now in the way of shortage of returns is largely due to their actions in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is well for the Dáil to understand that and to have the position clearly before them on these things before we begin to vote away money out of sympathy with people who perhaps do not deserve very much sympathy, and as far as the interests of the county are concerned, I am perfectly certain that they will not suffer through the withholding of this money, because I am confident that the material interests that are reposed in the parent line are sufficiently strong to induce this railway company, without this grant, to put their line into such working order and to manage their business in such a way that they will bring the company gradually to the same position of profit with regard to the running of this railway as they were in.  Times were prosperous before, but it is rather a good idea if a concern runs down, whether it is run down deliberately or accidentally, to come to the State and ask for some subsidy and it is very kind on the part of the State no doubt to give it.  At the same time, it is very doubtful policy in the circumstances that exist with regard to this line at present.  There is the duality that exists geographically in the area <Col N="779" /> covered by the line and the doubtful question as to where we must have the new headquarters station on the line in the immediate future and as to whether the traffic of the county of Tirconaill is to be in future directed to and from Lough Foyle or whether it is to be taken to and from its own harbours, where there are at least two better harbours than Lough Foyle, and where the possibility is that should Derry still maintain the attitude that it wishes to remain with Belfast and keep a barrier between itself and its customers in Tirconaill, when this traffic must of necessity go the other way, through our own ports.</P>
    <P>This new proposed station would then be not the centre and headquarters of this railway, but merely an outpost station of the County Donegal, where the line may run past it towards Derry, should such a boundary still remain.  I am very much opposed to the idea that these people should be allowed to get this money at all.  However, perhaps the Minister has arguments in favour of it, and I will hear what they are with interest. No doubt he did not set down a sum of money and did not approach the Minister for Finance, who is very difficult to approach on such questions, without having very strong arguments before he was able to secure a concession of that sort.  I will be very interested to hear what the arguments are, and unless they are better than I think they are I will continue to hold that we should not give this grant to this Lough Swilly Railway.</P>

      <P>The question of a clash between the two Houses.  I do not think we will have that.  The Deputy said that this Donegal Estimate was not discussed previously.  I had thought that the amount which was voted in 1923-24 had drawn certain discussion from the Deputy himself. I do not think that it is likely that an item of £1,510 would have got through without certain Donegal Deputies raising the question of the whole control of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly line, or lines, and I do rather think that Deputy Davin himself passed some comments on the matter previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Minister's information I could not, because a similar item was not provided in the Estimate for 1924.  But I did certainly pass comments, and have reason to remember the manner in which they were answered, upon the general policy of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company, on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made very serious charges, that this railway has failed to carry out its statutory requirements, and has been working the line largely for the benefit not of those in the Saorstát, and that the rolling stock and everything else which represents a certain amount of paid-up capital is taken out, that all that has been drained from and turned against the interests of the Saorstát, and for the interests of the people in the Six Counties.  That, to a certain extent, is on all fours with what Deputy McGoldrick has stated, but Deputy McGoldrick did answer himself in one respect.  He said that there was the question of a subsidy for a limited period until it was seen quite clearly what Derry City intended to do on the boundary question and that is the point that has to be looked at.  I do believe that if we in the Twenty-six Counties set out to-morrow deliberately to do so, we could ruin Derry city as a port.  As Deputy McGoldrick stated, we could have grass growing in its streets very soon, and I think they know that.  But is that going to be a reasonable thing to do until this question has been decided?  Is it supposed <Col N="781" /> that the people in Derry city are anything less pugnacious or obstinate than we are, and that they would give in readily to threats which the people here would not give into?  I know Derry city very well, and I know the people there.</P>
      <P>I do not think you are going to do any good whatsoever by brandishing weapons over their heads.  It is all very well to let certain matters sink in, and to let them see that their interests are very definitely Twenty-six County interests, that their whole economic hinterland is really Donegal. Derry is really a city of Donegal, and not a city of the County Derry, and that should be allowed to sink in.  But for us to go and open up lines of communication whereby traffic can be diverted through Donegal ports, and where a very small section of line would be all that would be necessary to develop traffic in Donegal and join it up with Sligo, is a matter that should not be considered at this stage. That may have to happen; it is to be hoped that it will not, and when Deputy Davin says that its rolling stock and all the money of the company has been used for the benefit of the people in the Six Counties, I think all he means is that, so far as Donegal is concerned, that Derry has been the outlet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct the Minister, because I made that charge last year.  I believe what has taken place in the meantime has altered the situation slightly.  I want to make it clear to him that I am not making that charge now.  I did make it, and endeavoured to justify it twelve months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am not stressing so much the fact that he says this or that he did say it previously, but I am trying to point out that the truth of the statement cannot be denied. The facts are there.  I do not like the suggestion that it was a deliberate policy on the part of the people who were working this line to do something which was abnormal.  What they did happened to work out for the benefit of those in the Six Counties.  What they did was what they had done for years.  When the Deputy makes a statement which he does make it is <Col N="782" /> open to that construction, and if he argued a certain amount of malevolence on the part of the people who worked this line I say it is a distortion of the facts.  Let there be that conflict between us as to what is the motive impelling certain things.  Once the boundary question is settled and once Donegal and Derry make their respective stands as regards the boundary, we can see that a different state of things will take place for the future.  Deputy Hewat has said that some of these items represent money thrown away, particularly this money advanced to the Derry and Lough Swilly Railway.  In the same way the amount of the guaranteed capital may be regarded as money thrown away.  It may be that some railways do not bring in profit, but from the point of view of transport and for the wider interests of the country and not from the point of view of the investor it was profitable to have them kept going and used for the general good.  That is my answer to the statement as to whether I had reckoned the cost regarding the £77,000 for a number of years.  You cannot deal with railways on that basis.  You have to view the whole transport conditions together and see whether they have given good service.  And they are going to give better service to the people.</P>

      <P>I might say that it could also be regarded as a considered answer of the statesman, but it is not for me to praise myself.  I cannot give the Deputy figures with regard to item B.  If he is very keenly concerned about this matter I will try to supply him with the figures, but I do not know that I could give him the complete returns per mile of these colliery railways even after a search. Deputy McGoldrick, I think, argued mainly on the lines of Deputy Davin, and asked if I could state what were the arguments as the result of which this promise of an advance of money was made.  I have only to state that this promise was made before I had anything to do with this Ministry.  I find that a promise had been made. These arguments operated on the previous <Col N="783" /> Minister, and all I could do was to see that certain arguments were advanced on a deputation.  The argument tended to this, that, be it accepted or not accepted, the shareholders had got considerable dividends in years past, and this has been followed up. Whether that is accepted or not the fact that faced the Minister was that the railways were going to close down. It is all very well for Deputy McGoldrick to say that those men made good profits, and why should they not suffer a loss in the lean years?  That was an appeal to philantropy and patriotism.</P>

      <P>That is a general appeal to railway shareholders.  I do not want to particularise them, and I would like if Deputy McGoldrick would pass this Vote for the time being. He can convince me that those railways would continue to run, and that there would be some inducement which would make the working of the lines reasonable without the payment of the money.  Then we will see if the money cannot be stopped.  It is for Deputy McGoldrick and the other Deputies who represent that county to say that they are satisfied that if you take away this money the railways would still operate in that county.  If they are convinced of that and can show to me that I have some other weapon in my hands than the weapon of holding out a certain sum of money then we can see.  The main argument was that the county would be left without transport.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he can state why an old age pension has been refused to Mrs. Josephs, of Bride Street, Loughrea, Co. Galway, in view of the fact that the Local Pensions Committee recommended her for pension on two occasions.</P>

      <P>The two claims put forward in this case were disallowed on the ground of means.  The claimant assigned her licensed house and premises, by deed dated 26th July, 1923, to her married daughter in consideration of a payment by the daughter of £60 to the claimant's son.  Mrs. Josephs resides on the premises.  The means were, on each occasion, for old age pension purposes, estimated to exceed £49 17s. 6d. a year. On the facts the estimate appears reasonable, and debars the claimant from any pension.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if a decision has yet been taken in the matter of the granting of an old age pension to Redmond O'Halloran, of Inishboffin, Co. Galway, Appeal No. C.F. 4201; whether evidence was produced to show that O'Halloran was appointed as schoolmaster in Glenamaddy Workhouse on the 30th July, 1872, and that the regulations required that no one under the age of 21 could be so appointed.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first and second part of the question is in the affirmative.  The decision to allow a pension of 10s a week as from the 14th April, 1924, was conveyed to the local Sub-Committee on the 15th April last.  As stated in the third part of the question, the General Regulations of 1882, Article 31, fixed 21 years as the minimum age limit for appointment of schoolmasters in workhouses, but Article 32 authorised exemption from this requirement in individual cases on sufficient grounds.  The facts did not warrant a decision to allow the pension prior to the 14th April last.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is yet in a position to say whether payment has been made to Matthew F. O'Reilly, of Clare Road, Ballyhaunis, Co. Mayo, in respect of a claim for motor hireage, etc., which has been lodged by him and for payment of which repeated applications have been made; and whether he is aware that O'Reilly is in straitened circumstances owing to the great delay in settling his account.</P>

      <P>A claim for £43 16s. 0d. in respect of motor hire and accessories supplied during the period from July to November, 1922, and during March, April and May, 1923, was received from Mr. M.F. O'Reilly, Clare Street, Ballyhaunis, through Mr. Austin Crean, Solicitor. The claim was assessed at £36 9s. 3d., and payment was made on the 26th December, 1923.  The difference between the account furnished and the amount paid represents deductions in respect of charges in excess of the rates laid down.</P>
      <P>A further claim in respect of motor hire amounting to £87 7s. 0d. for the period from September, 1921, to April, 1922, has been received from Mr. O'Reilly through Messrs. T. Dillon-Leetch and Son, Solicitors.  Portion of this claim, amounting to £60 13s. 0d., arose prior to the formation of the National Army, and cannot, therefore, be settled from Army funds. The general question of the settlement of claims incurred prior to the 1st February, 1922, is, however, under consideration.  The remaining portion of Mr. O'Reilly's claim is under investigation, and it is expected that it will be disposed of at an early date.</P>
