      <P>The (late) Congested Districts Board did not purchase the lands of Dromtrasna, but they purchased a farm from Mrs. Honor Lyons at Brosna, otherwise known as &ldquo;Flynn's Farm,&rdquo; on the Collis Sandes Estate, which they allotted to tenants of small holdings in the district.  The (late) Board constructed a suitable accommodation roadway at the time through this farm, giving access to each plot allotted. It was not intended then, or at any future time, to maintain the road after the lands had been disposed of. The maintenance of the road is the duty of the persons using it.</P>

      <P>We are, I take it, in a little difficulty in the event of an amendment coming from the Seanad which does not commend itself to the Minister.  I should say that the normal procedure, until we arrive at some settled method, is that this would be moved, the Minister saying that he could not subscribe to it; but in order to put the matter in such a position as that the Dáil could debate it, I am prepared to move that this amendment be accepted, making it perfectly clear at the same time, that I do not subscribe to it, that I cannot recommend it, and <Col N="1506" /> that I am not going to vote for it.  I think, in deference to the Seanad, when they send down an amendment it should be moved.  I am moving it, therefore, for the purpose of having it definitely turned down by the Dáil.</P>

This morning I got the permission of the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad in his position as such, apart from his personality as Senator Douglas, to do this.  In reference to Government amendments in the Seanad, I think it is due to the Seanad that when they send down an amendment it should be put forward here for discussion before the Dáil.  I accordingly move it.  I am not recommending it, and I would speak against it if it is recommended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move Amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In the Schedule, First Part, page 12, to delete the words &ldquo;The Old Age Pensions save as regards appeals governed by Statute&rdquo; and to insert in the Third Part the words &ldquo;The Old Age Pensions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that this service shall not be assigned to the Ministry of Finance. The Minister for Finance is certainly entitled to scrutinise the total expenditure, but I contend that he is not qualified to deal with the administration of this service, and that this service properly belongs to the Ministry of Health.</P>

      <P>The fact is that Old Age Pensions must necessarily come into Finance.  They are administered by officers who come under the Department of Finance, that is Excise officers throughout the country.  It would be impossible, I think, to get any other adequate machinery for dealing with the Pensions.  The ultimate decision as to whether a pension shall be granted in a particular case or not rests with the Minister for Local Government, but the actual investigation of the claims is with the officials of the Revenue Department, and it would be impossible for the Local Government or Public Health Department to set up machinery to deal with it.</P>

      <P>That is the position at present, but will it continue to be if the Schedule is passed as it stands? Will the Minister for Public Health, as he will then be, have the final decision as to whether a person is entitled to the pension or not?  According to the section the particular branch of the department <Col N="1512" /> which is to be assigned to the Ministry of Finance, includes Old Age Pensions.  It has this saving clause:&mdash;&ldquo;Save as regards appeals governed by Statute.&rdquo;  Does that reserve the present right to the Minister?</P>

      <P>I am afraid I find myself in some difficulty.  It is provided that this Department of the Civil Service Commission shall be assigned to the Ministry of Finance, but the operative part of the Second Section says the Ministry shall comprise all the duties of the office concerned, yet we have the Civil Service Regulation Bill, which states that the Civil Service Commissioners are to be appointed by the Executive Council with certain duties assigned to them.

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>

      <P>There is one point I would like to raise.  It is in regard to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  I would like to know what the argument is in regard to this officer who, one would imagine, should be under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, inasmuch as the greater part of his office is concerned with administrative work which is under the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Friendly Societies, Trade Unions and Societies of that kind come under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the greater part of the work of this office and the register of companies should certainly come under Industry and Commerce.  I fail to see why the Registrar of Friendly Societies should be brought under the Ministry for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for that is that the Minister for Finance has to authorise certain persons as fit persons to audit the accounts of Friendly Societies, and that is a very necessary provision for these societies. It is considered that the Ministry of Finance would be the most capable of dealing with that class of business.</P>

I should imagine that a task quite technical in its character, and, to my mind, at least, with the present knowledge available, dealing largely with strictly Survey matters, should be brought under some other department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was very carefully considered, and the reason that department was assigned to Finance was that its work was so closely associated with the work of the Commissioner of Valuation.  The Valuation Office is the one through which maps of the Ordnance Survey <Col N="1515" /> are issued, and Ordnance Survey was brought under this head in order to prevent duplication and to bring it into close association with the work of the Commissioner of Valuation.</P>

      <P>I beg to move an amendment: To insert in the Schedule, Second Part, page 12, the words: &ldquo;The Public Trustee in Ireland,&rdquo; and to delete these words from the Fifth Part. The main object I had in putting down this amendment was to discover the actual position with regard to the Public Trustee, or whether we were to have a Public Trustee in the sense that such an officer exists in other countries. I understand there is a Trustee in connection with the Land Acts.  If he is to deal with land only, I think he should come under the Department of Agriculture in the Fifth Part of the new Schedule. I would like to have a statement from the Attorney-General as to what the position is with regard to the Public Trustee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in Ireland is that the only Public Trustee is the Trustee under the Land Act of 1903.  His functions are solely concerned with the sale of land and with the proceeds of estates sold through the Land Commission. There is no Public Trustee in Ireland in the sense that an official occupies a position of that kind in England.  In England the Public Trustee is the person who administers estates generally for anyone who chooses to send in his name to have an estate administered by a Trustee.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not wish to be taken as indicating, should such a demand be made, that it ought to be complied with.  Anyone who has carefully studied the comments on that Department, as it exists in England, especially in recent years, would, I think, agree that it has not been an unqualified success.  There are <Col N="1516" /> alternative methods of dealing with this matter which, perhaps, at a later date you may consider here for the protection of estates which have to be administered by a Public Trustee.  I do not think there is a real genuine public demand for the setting up of an official of this kind in this country, nor do I think that the public who have studied the operations of that department in England would altogether support the appointment of such an official here.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can altogether agree with what the Attorney-General has stated with regard to the Public Trustee in England. I am concerned with some estates in England which are administered by the Public Trustee, and the only complaint against him is, and this is not an uncommon complaint even against members of the Bar, that his fees are too high.  That is due to the pressure of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make that Department a lucrative and revenue-producing one. I hope that by passing the Schedule as it stands we shall not bar the Dáil against the appointment of a Public Trustee in the future.</P>

      <P>That would be a matter for legislation, or it might be dealt with in some other way.  The question would arise, of course, whether such an appointment would be necessary in a country like this of small estates.  In England the large estates administered by the Public Trustee can afford to pay the large fees charged.</P>

    <P>I think the revised edition of the Schedule embodies the amendment of Deputy Corish, but I have been reminded that there are, in fact, two bodies, and perhaps Deputy Sir James Craig may be able to enlighten us on that point, as to whether the General Nursing Council is one body, and the Central Midwives' Board another body.

      <P>I would like to make a general comment on the Schedule, and it is, that I think the Ministry is making a mistake in retaining under this single Minister all these various Departments, which are not really related.  A Minister for Public Health is required, and that Minister may be the most competent person in the world for that purpose and yet the least competent to look after elections. There seems to be really no connection between some of the duties of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Some of us had hoped that the opportunity would have been availed of to constitute a Minister for Public Health, who would have, in fact, that duty as the sole duty of his office.  It would require a Minister's whole time, and I want to express my regret that the Government has not taken advantage of the opportunity to set up that Ministry and to re-distribute some of the other functions amongst other Ministries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask for a little information about one service that appears under the Fourth Part of the Schedule since the Bill was originally drafted, and that is meteorological services which are now proposed to be conferred on the Minister for Education.  I really cannot imagine a more inappropriate Minister to deal with meteorological affairs.  I have a certain interest in these things.  For the last twenty years I have supplied meteorological information to whatever Government happened to exist at the time, rainfall and temperatures, without payment, and I do not know why the Minister for Education is dragged into this.  The functions of the Minister for Education, as set forth in the Bill, are</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The administration and business generally of public services in connection with education, including primary, secondary and University education, vocational and technical <Col N="1519" /> training, endowed schools, reformatories and industrial schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What in the world have they got to do with meteorological services?  The only connection that could possibly be imagined is that you would require a certain amount of education to read a thermometer or a rain guage, but so do you to be a registrar of District Court Clerks.  This does not concern the Minister for Education at all.  It does concern the Minister for Agriculture. Rainfall statistics, temperature statistics, and information of that kind are of vital concern to the Minister for Agriculture.  It also concerns the Minister for Fisheries, and it might concern the Minister for Defence if one follows the British precedent, because in England the Air Minister&mdash;and I suppose the Minister for Defence is responsible for the air as well as for the land and the sea&mdash;is responsible for these statistics.  But the Minister for Education is the most inappropriate person in the world, both by reason of his functions, and I would say in the present case also, as an individual, because if you want to control meteorological services you have to be some thing of a prophet, and the Minister for Education is both too old and too wise to be a prophet.  I think the Minister for Agriculture is a much more suitable person to prophesy.  I feel that you then might get what you call a Stop Press prophecy.  I should like to know why this is being put on to the shoulders of the Minister for Education.  He is already in control of the National Museum, the National Gallery, and the Metropolitan School of Art.  These are, to a certain extent, connected with education, but the meteorological services are not concerned with it in the smallest degree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering whether the Ministry were not wise in putting this service under the Ministry of Education.  I take it that part of the duties of this service would be the issuing of daily reports regarding the weather.  Any of us who have been connected with schools know that the attendance is exceedingly bad, and the reason usually given is the state of the <Col N="1520" /> weather.  If the Minister for Education were in a position to broadcast every morning that the shower that threatened over the neighbouring hili would not be as serious as parents thought, it might have the effect of improving the attendance.  Possibly it might be as well if the Minister for Education was acquainted with the state of the weather for another reason. We know that most of the school buildings throughout the country are in such a state that a shower of rain would have a very serious effect on the inside temperature of the school, and it might be well that he would be in a position to say that such and such a school should be closed on a particular day, as a cold snap was coming over the Kerry hills on that day.  These are some of the reasons that I see in favour of keeping this service under the Ministry of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>It was recommended that this service should be put under this Ministry, not perhaps for the very practical reasons suggested by Deputy O'Connell, but because it involves research, and it would probably be associated with the College of Science rather than other services. That is the only reason that it is associated with this particular department.</P>

I think at a very early stage of this discussion it was explained that these schedules are not exhaustive schedules of the functions of the department. But the description in the descriptive part in the Section is an exhaustive description of the functions of the department, and it does include statistics.  The schedule comprises existing organisations or departments which are handed over and grouped into Ministries already described, but if there were statistical commissioners they would be in this last one.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;&ldquo;In the Schedule, Sixth Part, to delete the words `Electricity Commissioners.' &rdquo; I would ask the indulgence of the Dáil to go rather into the whole matter of the position of electricity in this country. I should explain that although I rise as a Deputy, and take the responsibility of doing so, I have also a position in connection with the Association of Electrical Generating Stations, and this Association comprises all, or practically all, of the generators of electricity in the Free State, and in that way has got, I take it, all the experts in the electrical world as far as the Free State is concerned. The English Act of 1919 provided for the appointment of Electricity Commissioners.  That Act was accepted in Ireland by default rather than with any degree of confidence in the measure itself.  In fact, it is thoroughly recognised by, I think, everybody concerned, that that Act is not very suitable for adoption as regards the developments of electrical undertakings in the Free State.  This Association was asked by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to advise them in connection with the preparation of a Bill which would govern the progress of electricity and electrical <Col N="1522" /> undertakings within the Free State. The Association voluntarily and very willingly gave assistance in the preparation of the Bill.  That Bill is in being, and there is nothing, as far as I know, to prevent its having been brought forward except the convenience of the Dáil.  I do not say that everything in the Bill would be supported by the experts in connection with our Association, but at all events the Bill would provide a method of dealing with all these things, but one thing it does not propose, and which would be resisted strongly, would be the saddling of the industry with Electricity Commissioners.  The Electricity Commissioners are very excellent as applied to the highly developed industry in Great Britain, but they are unnecessary in our area, because unfortunately we are very backward, and the few electrical industries could not be called upon to bear the expenses that would be entailed by Electricity Commissioners, who must of necessity be very expert and have very high qualifications.  These things you do not get for nothing.  This Association I have referred to has volunteered to give all the expert assistance that is required.  It is controlling the industry as a whole; it has a very broad knowledge of the subject, and it is particularly interested in the progress of electricity within the Free State.  The Ministry and this body to which I have referred have been in close touch with the Bill, and the members of the Association and I may be pardoned for failing to look for anything concerning electricity or electrical developments in the Ministers and Secretaries Bill. Otherwise this matter would have been brought before the Dáil long ago, and this is my apology for bringing the matter before you in connection with the amendment I have proposed.  First of all, I say there is absolutely no need for including the Commissioners in this Sixth Part at all.  There is no object in perpetuating the term as applied to the electrical industry in this country.  The Bill which is in some pigeon-hole or other deals with the whole subject. Why complicate the matter by bringing into this schedule powers and giving them to the Ministry of Industry <Col N="1523" /> and Commerce?  In that respect, it seems to me, while I do not want to impute any bad motives to anybody, to be very strange that in the circumstances the Ministry have been parties to putting in this without in any way bringing it under the notice of the Association.  It may be said there was no obligation on them to do so.  I say it was, because there was an understanding as between the Ministry and this Association that the Association would be kept in touch with any development in connection with the Bill that was on the stocks, and in connection with any electricity development as a whole.  Further, the inclusion of this provision which gives to the Ministry the power to appoint Electricity Commissioners, or Commissioner, in essence, if it was put into operation, leaves the Ministry in the position that as far as their Bill is concerned to control the future of electricity they are in the happy position that they can carry on and scrap that Bill, or bring it forward or not, just as they like.  In other words, this undermines by a side-issue the principle of the Bill which they themselves have drawn, and which is being held up.  I ask the Dáil to delete any reference to the Electricity Commissioners, and I do so feeling that its inclusion is unnecessary and even dangerous, and that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should not be given this power in this way.  I may be entirely wrong, but I feel that by the inclusion of these words the Electricity Bill will be at the very least considerably delayed.  I have no doubt the Attorney-General will tell me that this is a nice little thing that means nothing, and all that sort of thing, but if it means nothing, if it does not give the Ministry of Industry and Commerce any extra power, then why include it?</P>

      <P>I was expecting to hear the Deputy say that the authority <Col N="1524" /> over these Commissioners ought to be the Ministry of Fisheries.  There are only three other Ministries to be passed through, and I think the connection of the Ministry of Fisheries with the electrical shark and other electrical fishes, alleged to exist in the seas around the West Coast of Ireland, represented by Deputy O'Connell and others, would bring that authority under that Department.  The Ministry for Posts and Telegraphs might also be the right Ministry for this particular Department.  I can hardly imagine that even Deputy Hewat would desire to put the Attorney-General in charge of the Electricity Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really nothing sinister in the inclusion of these Commissioners under their natural heading.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce permits me to say that a Bill dealing with the whole subject of electricity, and the subject matters of those Bills in England, is in course of preparation, and as soon as it can be put into form, it will include provisions such as those in the Electricity Clauses Bill, and so on, as well as suitable provisions corresponding to, or in substitution for, those in the Act of 1919.  As soon as it is ready it will be introduced.  It is not being lost sight of, and it is engaging the attention in the rough draft form in which it was presented to the legal draftsmen in my Department.</P>
      <P>This inclusion here of the Electricity Commissioners has nothing to do with the Bill, which must be introduced to deal with this subject in Ireland, because the English Bill is not applicable. The inclusion here of the heading of the Electricity Commissioners simply provides for the administration of such matters pending the introduction of legislation, which will be at the earliest practical moment.  I can also give Deputy Hewat an assurance, if it will further sustain him, that pending the introduction of the Bill, there is no intention to appoint Commissioners.  In the meantime, however, the matter cannot be left hanging in the air, and some Department must take it over, and the proper Department for that is the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>That Department has already that power, as it takes in the powers of the Board of Trade, who were the parties who appointed Commissioners. The people whom I more or less speak for, say that this Clause is unnecessary, and are very anxious that, if possible, it should not be put in at all, but if, for any technical reason, the Attorney-General makes a point that it should be included, if it is not going to be operative might we have an assurance to that effect, and if it is not going to be operative would it not be better to drop it, as the Department is carrying on very well without it?  If they appoint these Commissioners they would put themselves in the position of being able to take on all the powers of the Electricity Commissioners, under the Act of 1919, which we maintain should not be put into operation in this country as it is unsuitable and quite unnecessary.</P>

It is absurd to say that these hypothetical invisible people do not exist and therefore their powers cannot be transferred. If Deputy Hewat carries his motion to a division I shall vote for it.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Deputy realises that what I said was that the Commissioners are not proposed to be appointed under the Act of 1919, but whatever public services are to be administered arising under that Act, which is in force pending legislation of our own, should be the concern of some department and I think the department should be this one.  I submit that for this reason it is properly introduced into this Schedule.</P>

      <P>I would be very loth to divide the Dáil, but I feel strongly on this matter and I appeal to it to say that the Attorney-General has not <Col N="1526" /> made any case for the inclusion of these words in the Schedule.  The Department is carrying on perfectly well, as things are, and has not found any embarrassment for want of powers in connection with electricity undertakings. If there is going to be any delay about the introduction of this new Bill, I say that it will provide for a new state of affairs entirely.  The interval between now and the passing of that Bill will not be any more embarrassing to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce than the period through which they have gone.  If there was no legislation on the tapis dealing with the matter, the Attorney-General's argument to include this might have more force than it has at present.  I think, however, it has no force now, as pending the new legislation the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will not be embarrassed.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, I think, ought to have given some history dealing with this matter.  Up to the time of the introduction of the Act of 1919 the Local Government Board functioned, I think, as the Electricity Commissioners function now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>They were under the Local Government Board before the Act of 1919.  That is a position that might reasonably have been explained. In the Act of 1919 these powers were transferred to the Board of Trade who appointed Electricity Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board of Trade is represented here by the Ministry for Industry and Commerce.  Obviously, if there are any powers which the Board of Trade should exercise, those powers should be in the competence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Yet we had a Bill before us dealing with electricity, the Electricity Undertakings (Continuance Charges) Bill, and the Minister, I think, said, in introducing the Bill, that it would be necessary to arrange for somebody to review those charges and to give an authority for varying any increase over the pre-war cost from August last.  I do not know at the <Col N="1527" /> moment whether or not the functions to be performed under this Act were functions which under the British Government were administered by Electricity Commissioners.  If so, and we exclude now, in deference to the Deputy's wishes, Electricity Commissioners, we might find ourselves in a dilemma, and I do not think the Deputy ought to press his point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The real position with regard to Electricity Commissioners is that under the functions laid down by the Act of 1919 they are unsuitable to this country.  They would not have been adopted if things were in a normal condition when the Act of 1919 was being passed in the House of Commons. The local authorities here, including the Dublin Corporation, would have appeared to resist the application of the Electricity Act to this country, but in 1919, as you all know, we were in a very disturbed state here, and no part in connection with the Bill was taken. The Electricity Commissioners had been condemned by yourselves, because you have not adopted the subsequent Act of 1921 of the British House of Commons, but you have taken up the stand that you are prepared to legislate for electricity in a separate Bill with knowledge of your own requirements and in that Bill the Electricity Commissioners have no place whatsoever, and would not be accepted by yourselves, because of the unnecessarily extravagant charge that would be placed on the undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Great Britain a small levy on the undertakings pays for the expenses of the Electricity Commissioners.  They are men of high standing, getting a large salary&mdash;I have no doubt they earn it&mdash;but it is said that a levy that would pay for that service would be a very heavy burden on the undertakings as they exist at present.  The point we make is that there is no need for the Electricity Commissioners.  We are satisfied that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have control.  We are satisfied, as a body of experts, to give all the technical advice necessary to the Ministry and that there is no <Col N="1528" /> need to appoint Commissioners.  Why then include them in this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have assured the Deputy that there is no intention of appointing Commissioners, and I think I have explained that what this does is to transfer the administration of the functions hitherto discharged by Electricity Commissioners to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That appears to be the thing Deputy Hewat's Association wants.  I cannot see, with the repetition of the protest on the one hand, and the assurances I have given on the other hand, why this matter should be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am persuaded by Deputy Hewat's speech that we ought not to accept his motion.  I would draw attention to the head of this paragraph of the Schedule, &ldquo;particular branches of administration assigned to the Ministry for Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;  I take it there are certain branches of administration which have been by statute allocated to some body called the Electricity Commissioners, or some body, in the absence of Electricity Commissioners, who are doing the work assigned by that statute.  Deputy Hewat tells the Dáil that his Association has been in consultation with the Ministry regarding a Bill to deal with the control of the electrical supplies, and then tells us a little later that if there were any proposal to establish Electricity Commissioners, his Association would not have it, and rather suggests that his Association is trying to control the Ministry, incidentally the Oireachtas, in regard to electricity.  I do not know what powers Electricity Commissioners have, or are intended to have, but it almost seems to me from the speech of the Deputy that it is necessary to have such Commissioners, and when he says that the Association, which I am quite sure is an important and influential body of gentlemen, would not have such a thing, it may be very desirable that that thing should be imposed upon them.  Because of that speech, I am decidedly in favour of retaining this, for fear of possible lapses on the part of the Ministry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain <Col N="1533" /> that in connection with this particular amendment it is not that we are standing for or recommending the reconstruction of houses so as to enable two-roomed flats to be made available for accommodation.  But it was put to me that there was a certain type of house which, by reason of the size of the rooms in it, and other considerations, would not be suitable for letting in three-roomed flats; and, that by reason of the figure 3 coming in, we would exclude quite a number of houses which in themselves would afford sufficient cubic capacity perhaps in excess of those houses which would accommodate three-roomed self-contained flats. The only reason why we put forward this particular amendment is in the event of there being houses capable of reconstruction and letting as two-roomed self-contained flats, which would, to some extent, relieve congestion. We thought that it was desirable to insert an amendment of this sort. Generally, I should say that the Ministry and anybody who has any experience in the matter of housing does not approve of the proposal to have two-roomed self-contained dwellings at all.</P>

      <P>So that when the house is reconstructed so as to contain three or four-roomed flats it seems to follow that the provisions of the Schedule, Part I, allow in the case of three-roomed flats £40 and four-roomed flats £55.  I think that follows from the amendments and provisions as the Bill stands.  But I do not think it was the intention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The £40 that the Deputy has mentioned refers to a three-roomed house; £53 6s. 8d. to a four-roomed house, and £66 13s. 4d. for a five-roomed house.  The amount proposed for a two-roomed flat would be £26 13s. 4d., so that if one were to put in another column the £26 13s. 4d. would be followed by £40 for a three-roomed flat, £53 6s. 8d. for a four-roomed flat, and £66 13s. 4d. for a five-roomed flat.</P>

      <P>If a body of gentlemen such as those to whom the President was speaking the other day agreed to erect or reconstruct a number of houses each containing five rooms they are entitled to a grant of £100 per new house, or £66 13s. 4d. for a reconstructed house, which may be a single house reconstructed.  Now, the original provisions do not provide, as I understand, for turning a mansion into four houses, that is to say, four self-contained flats.  But the Bill has been amended so as to allow a grant being paid for a mansion to be reconstructed and turned into flats, and if such reconstruction resulted in four-roomed flats being the outcome of the reconstruction, then four times £46 13s. 4d. would be paid for that operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much afraid that very little of it will go in that direction, from the experience we have had in Dublin in this matter. There is the fact that if we had in Dublin, ten, twelve, or fourteen years ago, five or six of these large houses, which at one time housed the aristocracy of this country, presented to the Corporation of the time for nothing, it would have been a more economic proposition for the Corporation to have built new three-roomed cottages than it would have been to reconstruct these houses.  The real point with regard to reconstruction is that those who reconstruct get but two-thirds of the subsidy which is given for the building of a new house.  I believe the examination which we had of the problem at the time I have referred to disclosed the fact that the bricks and mortar constituted only one-third of the price of the house, and the many alterations that had to be made, and the extent of the reconstruction, rendered it an uneconomic <Col N="1536" /> proposition.  I fear, although we are making provision for this, that unless some such bodies as have already interested themselves in the problem take it up now it will not be a success.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of those bodies are mentioned in the report of the Departmental Committee which inquired into housing in 1913.  Only such bodies as those that have experience of the problem and who are, by virtue of their experience, in a position to get very much better value for any money expended, will make a success of the scheme.  There is one other matter I would like to mention.  The actual amount of the subsidy for rooms is £20 in the case of a new house, and £16 13s. 4d. in the case of a reconstructed house.</P>

      <P>In Section 3 (1), page 3, to delete paragraph (f) and to insert a new paragraph in lieu thereof as follows: &ldquo;(f) in the case of the reconstruction of an existing house or building, that existing house or building shall be certified by an appointed officer to be capable of reconstruction as a house fulfilling the foregoing conditions, and except where the reconstruction is begun before the passing of this Act, such certificate shall be given before the reconstruction is begun.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>The paragraph which it is proposed to delete limited the operation of the Section to houses which were in a ruinous or defective condition.

      <P>Presumably, it was expected they would be let, and it would have been carried through quite irrespective of this Bill.  One does not quite understand why it should be necessary to say to those people, who have already begun the work of reconstruction and rebuilding, that they may now apply for a grant.  Perhaps, it is the intention that they will agree only to charge so much rental, and that they expected to get more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the main point.  There is another point.  If the Deputy had any experience of building, I do not know that he would be in as happy a frame of mind as he is in at present.  He probably would have had the experience that the contracts he got, which he thought would not be exceeded, would at some time or other scarcely bear an exact resemblance to the original contract.  In a case of that sort, where a person was in good faith going to reconstruct, and would find afterwards that the sum he had earmarked for the purpose was not sufficient, he would have some satisfaction in knowing that there was a grant like this available.  There would be these two instances; in the first instance, we might get a reasonable reduction in the rent proposed to be charged, and in the second instance, the person having embarked on a certain commercial experiment that far exceeded the amount of money he thought would be expended, there would be relief for him here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the objects I think the President had in mind in bringing forward this amendment was to clear some ambiguity that existed in the Bill as introduced with regard to these reconstructed houses.  I have a little doubt as to whether that object is achieved by this <Col N="1538" /> amendment.  If the Deputies will refer to Sub-section (f) in the Bill as reported from Committee, they will find in the case of the reconstruction of existing houses that those existing houses shall have been in a ruinous or defective condition.  That, to my mind, seems to be the condition precedent to any grant for such a house, and it was pointed out when the Bill was in Committee that it would be very unfair to limit the application of this particular grant to such houses.  In fact it was pointed out that it would be a great matter for the general appearance of our city if many of these old houses&mdash; fine old houses&mdash;which we find surrounding these squares could be adapted to the new conditions before they get into a state of decay.  In all interests it would be a very advisable course to take.</P>
      <P>That is the view, I think, that was generally approved by the House, and the President undertook on report to have the matter looked into.  Now I find that unfortunate condition still exists, and I am afraid its interpretation will prevent, notwithstanding what Deputy Johnson has said, a good deal of work being undertaken under this Section that one would like to see undertaken.  I do not know whether the President has considered that aspect of the question.  It was considered pretty fully in Committee, and, if so, I would be glad to know how this proposed amendment meets this particular provision under Sub-section (f) of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (f) goes out so that in the Bill there will be no reference whatever to a ruinous or defective house. Sub-section (f), as it left the Committee on the last day, is moved out, and for that there will be substituted a new paragraph which states that in the reconstruction of an existing house or building, that existing house or building shall be certified by an appointed officer to be capable of reconstruction as a house fulfilling the foregoing conditions, but there is no house such as the Deputy has in mind that would not lend itself to be capable of treatment under this new sub-section.</P>

      <P>I think the Section as originally framed was intended for ordinary houses and not for flats, and the suggestion was that such a house must be in a ruinous condition, and that an ordinary house could not be turned into flats.  The suggestion was that the house must be in a ruinous condition; that, being in a state of ruin, it would be used as a fully self-contained house.  I do not think the amendment covers that kind of a house. It was moved in order to meet the objection raised on the last day, and this objection arose because the word &ldquo;flats&rdquo; was used.  The amendment now moved in substitution for Sub-section (f) will cover self-contained houses being converted into flats, but I do not think the proviso about an ordinary house being in a ruinous condition before it could be converted into a fully self-contained house will be found in the new provision.  I am sorry to see that gone.  I think the original intention was quite good, referring to a particular type of house to which it was applicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <P>I think the condition that houses should be in a ruinous condition was a perfectly reasonable provision in the Bill as it originally stood.  That is not now a condition, and I think it is a pity. Here a person can get a grant for taking up a house which is in rather good condition and making some repairs to it, whereas originally it was intended that if a house was in a ruinous condition and a man made a habitable house out of it he would get a grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say, in answer to Deputy O'Sullivan's point, that the provision of flats is not mentioned in the new Sub-section we are proposing.  A ruinous and defective house would scarcely lend itself to any reconstruction. For the provision of bricks and joinery work and plumbing and slating the amount proposed to be given would scarcely be sufficient to induce any person to take on the work, and from that angle the very exclusion of the word &ldquo;ruinous&rdquo; is rather helpful than otherwise.  The point in regard to this is that a house may have a defective roof or one floor may be defective, and in that case it would lend itself to reconstruction, if certified by the competent officer.  I take it that the competent officer, or the appointed officer, has in mind what the Bill aims at&mdash;that is, if it is a house that is going to go out of commission, and that a certain sum of money expended on it would keep it in commission.  We give two-thirds of the grant that we give for the construction of a new house, exactly the same as if a new house had been constructed, and to that extent there would be an advantage in it.  The difficulty that has been experienced in Dublin is, that a house reaches a certain stage of deterioration.  At that moment, if a man were assisted by the local authority or the Government it is very possible he would invest money. It is just that proportion that we think will be of use in this case.</P>

      <P>In Section 8 (1), page 5, lines 7 and 8, to delete the words &ldquo;any county, county borough, town, district or other area&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann or any particular parts or part thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is introduced in consequence of an undertaking given to Deputy Johnson in Committee.  The intention is for the Minister to hold a local inquiry in any part of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1541" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say there is a slight improvement provided for by the amendment, but I cannot understand yet why, having agreed to hold an inquiry as to prices in Saorstát Eireann, the Minister should still confine the inquiry to a local inquiry. The Section says: &ldquo;The Minister may, at any time, if he thinks fit, order a local inquiry into the cost&rdquo; in Saorstát Eireann.  That obviously refers to an inquiry into a particular place, and suggests that it is only where something excessive, or apparently excessive, in relation to other parts of the country is being charged that an inquiry will be held, whereas I want to submit for the consideration of the Minister that there might well be an arrangement in the trade to charge excessively all over the country, and in such a case the Minister has deprived himself of any power.  Why the restriction to local inquiries is retained I cannot understand. If the Section read: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time, if he thinks fit, order an inquiry as to prices in Saorstát Eireann and after the holding of such inquiry, and so on,&rdquo; all that he is aiming at would be attained, and something more if necessary, but while you retain these words &ldquo;local inquiry&rdquo; you are limiting your powers, and I submit that the amendment, while it is a slight improvement on the original Section, does not go far enough in removing the objectionable restrictions, and would leave the Minister in this position, that even if he thought fit to order an inquiry into charges covering the whole country, this Bill does not allow him to do so.  It restricts him to a local inquiry, so that he would have to make inquiries into twenty different localities when he might secure the same end by one national inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Deputy will hardly credit me with giving him information when I say that there are two Governments in this country There is the ordinary Government and the local Government.  The Local Government Board always inserts the word &ldquo;Local&rdquo; wherever it holds an inquiry or does anything of that sort. Even in the case of the inquiry held in Dublin in 1913 into Housing, it was called a Local Government Housing <Col N="1542" /> Inquiry.  Strangely enough, when in International affairs a Government is mentioned of a particular area it mentions the local Government; that means the Government of the place in question. In the same way the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; here has not got that restricted interpretation which Deputy Johnson puts on it.  The fact of a Local Government inquiry in Dublin does not postulate that it is held only with reference to the city of Dublin.  Local Government inquiries, as such, are inquiries which in the minds of the officials and of, I presume, the Minister&mdash; it was mine when I was Minister for Local Government&mdash;always mean that the inquiry was one in which the person authorised to hold it had authority to administer oaths and to hear evidence on oath, and later in the same Schedule it is provided that Article 32 of the Application of Enactments Order shall apply, meaning that he has got that authority.  There is no restrictive interpretation to be put upon that.  That is all the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; means.  It simply synchronises with the terminology inseparable from that second Governmental institution we have got in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>A point I was anxious to make clear is one that was not at all clear when the Bill was in Committee, and that is with regard to the operation of Section 8.  I have not altered in the least with regard to the opinions I expressed on several occasions as to the effect of Section 8, and I would like to point out to Deputies that the Dáil was not at all clear as to the limitation of operations under Section 8.  Some Deputies so expressed themselves in voting in its favour.  Deputy O'Mahony stated that it was quite obvious that the operation of Section 8 was limited to houses erected under this Bill.  I differed from that view.  Deputy Egan agreed with that view, and went further and said that it was only right that the person who paid the piper should <Col N="1543" /> call the tune, so that it was quite obvious it was in the Deputy's mind, when he voted for the Section, that if the Government provided a certain sum of money for the erection of these houses they had the right to have a say as to the cost of the materials that would be included in these houses. From these two statements, I think it is quite clear that what was in the mind of many Deputies was that the operation of Section 8 applied only to houses included under the Bill.  I differ from that view, and in the last speech the President made on the subject, he expressed the view that the operation of this particular Section in this Bill was not confined to houses built under this Bill, but that it would apply to all houses built during the time the Bill was in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that was giving a much wider interpretation to this clause than either of the Deputies who voted for the Section gave to it, so that Deputy Egan&mdash;I am sorry Deputy O'Mahony is not here&mdash; will see from the statement of the President&mdash;I can refer the President to his speech if necessary&mdash;that this particular Section, in his mind, applied to houses outside the Section, in fact, to houses which may not be getting any Government grant at all; in other words, to houses erected during the period of this Act, quite irrespective of whether they came under the jurisdiction of this Act or not.  The plenary powers under this particular Act would apply to these houses because they happened to be erected at this particular period.  Even in that view of the President's, he was beginning to see exactly what apparently he had not seen previously, the wider field that this particular Section would have.  That particular view did not satisfy me, because I expressed the opinion on that occasion that I was quite satisfied, from information I had, that though it was his view that the operation of this Section was confined to the time that the Bill was in operation, that that was not so.  A body which I happen to be connected with has, in the meantime, got an opinion from one of the leading lawyers in our city on that particular aspect of the question, and he says, beyond any <Col N="1544" /> doubt, that the operation of this Section is not confined either to the houses proposed to be built under this Bill, nor is it limited by the time limit attached to this Bill, bearing out exactly what I stated that it was a much wider and a much more drastic Section than ever was intended.  That being so, I would like to hear from the President what course he proposes to take with regard to this Section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very good point.  I stated last day that it was not intended to exercise this particular authority for a longer period than it was intended that the Bill should run. I do not think that it would be right, when we introduce legislation dealing with one particular matter, that we should put into one of the clauses a power that would extend the particular term of the Bill further.  To that extent I think that I would not be justified in asking for this particular right for the Minister for Local Government for a longer period than the life of the Bill.  I admit that I have not examined the problem since from that angle, and the Deputy has had the advantage of legal opinion of the very highest standing. I will undertake, before the Final Stage, to consider it from that point.  In regard to the houses, I certainly did intend from the very commencement to influence the construction of houses and the whole building industry by this Bill.  In other words it might have been put up to us, as I think I stated here on one occasion, that certain accommodation could have been procured, say, from the operators, if that would be the proper description, when building these houses, and I said no, we would not take that, that we were concerned with the whole building <Col N="1546" /> industry, in all its phases and in all its aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important phase of the building industry to our mind is the provision of houses for a class whose needs have not been ministered to in the last 30, 40 or 50 years.  That is not the only trouble in connection with this matter.  We do know, and it has been put to me by business people, that the high cost of building limited development which, in other circumstances, they would be inclined to indulge in so far as their business is concerned, and therefore we do consider that the housing problem is not a service in itself distinct but is a part of the building industry and should not be separated from it; while it should be ministered to, that it should not be ministered to in that respect; that so far as the building of a particular class of dwelling is concerned, that alone should get consideration from one side and not from the other.  If that be our interpretation with regard to the operatives, surely we have a right to say, in connection with the provision of building materials, that there should be some corrective all round so that business itself, contributing its due share to this £300,000, would get any of the benefits that might possibly be derived from the inclusion of a clause such as this.  To that extent I think I did make it clear all through that when we were considering this Housing Bill we had at the back of our minds the fact that a very considerable sum of money would be decreed before, during, and after the passing of this Bill for the reconstruction of certain houses destroyed during the last two or three years, and that as those houses had to be paid for out of State funds it was our obvious duty to see that the compensation would be on a basis which would get for the State as much value as it possibly could for its money.  It was not intended at any time that this Clause 8 would operate longer than the lifetime of this Bill.  I anticipate that there will be another Bill next year; I anticipate that there will be a Bill for the year after; I anticipate that there will be a clause such as this in next year's Bill and in the Bill the year after, until we arrive at that time when everybody in the building <Col N="1547" /> industry can place his hand to his heart and say &ldquo;I am an honest man.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is scarcely a modification.  It is a fact which has been brought to my notice that there are infirmities which affect not only the point of view held by Deputy Johnson, but the point of view held by Deputy Good.  It comes to this, that as it stands it suffers from an infirmity. The Order made by the Minister, I have been told by one legal opinion&mdash;I have not had an opportunity of consulting the Attorney-General&mdash;would stand.  That Order made by an Appeal Court might stand, and what I would like to have inserted would be an attempt to limit any Order made by the Minister; in other words, if the price of a commodity is £100 to-day, and it comes down to £90 to-morrow, I do not think it was Deputy Johnson's intention that an Order made by the Minister to-day would entitle the ordinary dealer in that particular commodity to charge a higher price when the lower price was the market value.  It is with regard to that particular angle that I would like to see that this clause was fool-proof, and I believe the Deputy will agree with me in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>This correction may seem a simple matter on the face of it, but when we are making Section 6 applicable to the grants made under this Bill we will find it makes a very drastic change in the amount of the grants. The note it is proposed to alter is as follows: &ldquo;Where assistance is granted by a local authority under Section 5,&rdquo; and under Section 6 as is now proposed, &ldquo;the maximum price on sale or maximum fine on lease shall be reduced by an amount equal to half the value of such assistance, and the maximum yearly or weekly rents on letting shall be reduced correspondingly.&rdquo;  There is a little ambiguity here like a great many other Sections in this Bill when it says the selling price is to be reduced by a sum equal to a moiety of the State assistance.  When you reduce the sale price you reduce the price the building owner will get for the house; in other words you reduce the Government grant by a moiety.  I might remind the President that it has been pointed out on many occasions during the discussion on this Bill that it was the basis on which this Bill was framed that certain works, including the provision of the site, the lay-out of the site, and the incidentals thereto, were to be carried out by the local authority, and the amount included in the houses in the Schedule is practically the minimum amount, taking all these and other factors into consideration, at which a house could be sold.  If the operation of this clause is going to take a further £50 from the value of a five-roomed house, and reduce the Government grant by that amount, it will only put another mile-stone around the neck of this Bill, because it was always the intention that these local authorities were to carry out this work.  Having carried out that work, if the building owner is to have the selling price cut by £50 it is obvious that we are taking away in fact a moiety from the grant which is <Col N="1550" /> one of the attractions of this Bill.  I am quite satisfied, as one who knows all the difficulties of getting houses at the rating set forth in the Schedule, that it would be an exceedingly difficult matter for local authorities to get houses erected under the Bill, but if the grant is to be reduced&mdash;which is what it means in substance, the reduction of the grant by a moiety, and in fact it might be more than the moiety&mdash;under this particular clause, the Bill is dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension with regard to this.  Where the local authority gives a grant which the Minister estimates at £100 the sale price of that house, which appears in column 5 of the Schedule, Part I., is set down at £450, and it will be £400. I think the Deputy had in mind that, where the local authority gives a grant, the Government grant is reduced in consequence.  That is not the case. The case we are putting up is this&mdash; take a five-roomed house, the Government can give a grant of £100 and the local authority is entitled to give the equivalent of £100 either in site development, acquisition of land, or other things of that sort.  Whatever way it is put there is the £100 and, in addition, the local authority may, by order of the Minister, which I should say will invariably be the case, be compelled to give the reduction in the rates which is laid down in another Section of the Bill, paying only 5 per cent. of the rates in the first year and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantage in this case is given to the tenant&mdash;most of it is given to the tenant, not the whole of it.  There was in mind this particular type of town or county borough and the cost of the acquisition of land and the development cost might be excessive.  In other words, the actual cash value of the advantage might be more nearly £50 than £100.  In consequence the reduction might not be honestly arrived at, and you would be entitled to take £50 off.  It was also made for such cases where there was not a sufficient number of persons capable of putting down £450.  In other words, there would be a market for a £400 house, but not one for a £450 house.  If the <Col N="1551" /> Deputy had in mind the idea that wherever the local authority gave a grant or advantage the Government grant was reduced, I would like to correct him, as that would be a misrepresentation of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The criticism I have heard of this note with which the Deputy has dealt is just from the other angle.  It is that under it the builders will get a special advantage, and that the grant which the local authority might be allowed to make up to £100, is going to be shared as to half of it by the builders.  The criticism I have heard is that that was too generous to the builder.  The Deputy seemed to approach his consideration of the Bill on the assumption that in all cases the local authority would make grants equal to that of the Government grant.  If he approaches it from the point of view that local authorities will not make such grant, then he would find that in so far as they do depart from that, that half the value of the grant will go to the builders.  Probably he will see that it is not so detrimental to their interests as would appear at first sight on the other assumption.  I was asked if I would object to this note on the ground that it is simply a special subsidy to the builders and an invitation to builder-employers to use their influence with local authorities to make the grant.  That is, the builders would get the advantage from the local authorities. In accordance, however, with the policy which I have adopted in regard to this Bill I refrain from making that criticism.  Deputy Good approaches it from the other side, and rather desires that the whole advantage should go to the builders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied with regard to this particular proposal. The President does not apparently see the effect of it.  If he takes £50 off the selling price by reason of something that is to be done by the local authorities he is really taking £50 off the grant.  I do not mind whether it is taken by the Government or by the local authority, but it is taken by one <Col N="1552" /> of them.  It reduces, as I said, the value of the grant which is one of the attractions of this measure.  One of the difficulties, as I pointed out, which the local authority would be in is to limit its expenditure to a sum equal to the Government grant.  It is unnecessary to take up the time of the Dáil at this stage, as I went into the figures in connection with this point when the Bill was in Committee, and pointed that out to the President.  His reply was that the Minister would have power to average these things.  That is another of these wait-and-see proposals.  We will have to find out what they mean as time goes on, but I think the figures which I gave were reasonable, and the local authority will find itself in considerable difficulty, particularly one anxious to provide three-roomed houses. They will naturally say: &ldquo;The cost of building is so high, let us get as many families housed as we can with the money at our disposal.&rdquo;  Naturally they will go for a three-roomed house. The cost of purchasing the site and developing it would be practically the same as in the case of a five-roomed house, and there would be very little difference with regard to a scheme embodying three-roomed houses, and one embodying five-roomed houses.  The local authority is thereby handicapped by this proposal from getting the largest number of houses it can, at the least amount of expenditure.  My experience leads me to think that if this Section is rigidly carried out by the Minister for Local Government, local authorities will be compelled to go in for larger houses, much as many of them would like to go for smaller houses.  From that point of view I think it is very inadvisable to put in such a clause as this.  I do not mind whether the money is deducted under that particular note or not, but it means the reduction by one-half of the amount of the Government grant whether it is taken by the Government or the local authority.  It is taken from the builder and it takes from the attractiveness of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take the case where the local authority supplies land, roads, sewers, and so on, and <Col N="1553" /> where the cost estimated by the local authority for that particular advantage is £75, and that in addition they put up a sum of £25.  The total value in that case is equivalent to the grant that is given by the Government of £100.  I think £500 would be a fair cost for building a five-roomed house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It does not provide for the site or development.  In the ordinary way a house of this sort is subject to ground rent.  If the local authority gives a free site, and has it developed, there is no necessity for ground rent.  That £460 will be actual cost.  I would not mind putting on a few pounds to make it £500.  There is £50 open for somebody.  The builders say that there is no money in this Bill. They apparently look to a free market rather than to the real needs of the situation.  If the case is that they are not employed, everybody knows if you want to make a business a success you must attract the public, and the only attraction we can see is that there ought to be something to show that it is going to be a commercial proposition. £450 is the sum we have down for the sale of this house.  If the local authority gives value, it can be sold for £400. What is a man getting who pays £400 for that house?  He gets £100 Government grant, £100 from the local authority, and for £400 he gets £600 value. Obviously there is something in the nature of a commercial proposition there.  I imagine that we shall see every young man anxious to get married in order to get a house worth £600 for £400&mdash;if the builders respond, that is <Col N="1554" /> the real issue.  Where assistance is granted under Section 5, the maximum price on sale, if £100 is given, is £400. We will take it, on the other hand, that the local authority will give the same grant as the Government, namely, £100. Can there be built anywhere in the City of Dublin a five-roomed house for £600? I believe there can, and that the misgivings in regard to the Bill will be removed when the Bill is in operation.</P>

      <P>I would like to see the President work out those figures on a three-roomed house.  Under this a three-roomed house must be sold for £240.  Can he give us any figure to justify £240 for a three-roomed house?  £270 is the maximum selling price.  Under this foot-note, assuming that the local authority can get its portion of the work carried out for £60, the amount of the Government grant under the foot-note, there is £30 taken off the selling price.  That would require a three-roomed house&mdash;even were sewers and water mains provided&mdash;to be sold for the sum of £240.</P>

      <P>I beg to move to delete Sub-section (4) of this Section. That is the sub-section that gives power to a judge to sentence to flogging. Somebody has expressed a hope that there should not be very long speeches made on these amendments.  I have said nearly all I have to say on this question.  I oppose the principle of flogging, and I therefore oppose it in its application to this Bill.  I think it is not a means of effectively preventing the crimes which are intended to be prevented.  It does not deter and it does not make a good citizen out of a bad citizen.  All it does is to satisfy the elemental passion of man, called vengeance.  When the State takes upon itself to become an instrument for this purpose, simply that it may wreak its vengeance upon an offender, it is bad for the State.  On that ground I oppose this sub-section and move its deletion.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, have said pretty nearly all I have to say on this sub-section, and in particular on the matter of prescribing this particular penalty for these offences.  The amendment which the Deputy has moved is practically identical in effect with the amendment which follows it on the Order Paper, certainly with regard to one of the offences mentioned.  The ordinary law, for which the Deputy has so much reverence, prescribes that a judge may impose this penalty of flogging for the offence of robbery under arms.  So far as that offence is concerned the only difference between this Bill and the ordinary normal law is that instead of the permissive or enabling provision of the existing law there is this change, that under the Bill it runs that the Court shall, unless it is satisfied that there are special circumstances in the case which constitute a mitigation of the offence, impose a penalty.  So, the difference is not one of principle, but one as between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall, unless there are mitigating circumstances,&rdquo; not a very fundamental difference.</P>
      <P>The effect of the subsequent amendment would practically be the same, that is, to leave the law as it stands, to leave a permissive and enabling power to the judges to impose this penalty. Neither of the amendments would have the effect of abolishing the penalty of flogging for robbery under arms, because that penalty is embodied and enshrined in the existing law.  The only effect of the amendment that the Deputy has moved, and it is exactly the same as the effect of the subsequent amendment, would be to leave the permissive power.  Now, as between the statement that the Court may impose this penalty, if it thinks fit, and that the Court shall, unless it is satisfied that there are circumstances which constitute a mitigation of the offence, impose that penalty, there is really little to choose.  I prefer the latter, and standing over that preference, I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is a case of defending the Bill as it is, or making a case, if you wish, against the amendment.  I do not think the Minister has made any case against the amendment.  I do not think he could make any case against it.  Really, I do not think he can make a case for such a measure of punishment as flogging.  He may be satisfied that if a criminal commit an offence he ought to be punished.  We will agree that a criminal should be punished, but after all any punishment inflicted on any criminal ought to be considered, not only from the point of view of punishment for an offence committed, but from the point of view of the effect on the individual; the effect on the mind of the criminal as well as on the body.  I am not inclined to think that flogging as a punishment would have such an effect on the mind of the individual who commits the offence that it will be a preventative in future.  In my view it is really savage treatment which would tend not to raise the mentality of the individual who committed the offence, but rather to lower it, and in that sense it would really not be a preventative nor a deterrent against crime.  It would rather lower the standard of mentality in the individual and have a reactionary effect, the opposite to what the Minister hopes it really would have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>The other day, when this Bill was introduced I said a few words upon it, and what I am going to say now is more or less a repetition of what I then said.  I agree with Deputy Baxter that, of course, for an ordinary criminal who is only beginning his criminal career, flogging would be most undesirable.  But there are people who are beyond that stage, and who are irreclaimable.  In spite of what Deputy Johnson, who evidently has a very good opinion of mankind, has said, I am afraid there are some criminals who are entirely irreclaimable.  To my mind, to reach such persons as these who understand nothing else, it is desirable that the Section should stand. <Col N="1560" /> These men understand nothing else.  To them the punishment of imprisonment is nothing.  To these men flogging would be a deterrent and flogging should be used.  I mentioned the other day that in addition to robbery, which is very rife at the present time, there are complications that require to be dealt with in a very severe manner.  If not, there may be very serious results all over the country.  To the lonely man or woman living by himself or herself these times are very terrible.</P>
      <P>No doubt it is a matter of common knowledge now that there are gangs of ruffians going about the country who have not yet been made amenable to the law.  The Minister for Home Affairs will be aware of that.  A lot of these people are known, and some of them are known to be desperate characters by whom nothing but a very severe punishment would be understood. Within a few years I have known of three or four cases, and there are many more, where these gangs have entered the houses of lonely people, and have committed offences that entail severe punishment.  They work in gangs and not separately.  For such people there is nothing for it but the &ldquo;cat.&rdquo; They understand the &ldquo;cat.&rdquo;  They would not understand penal servitude to the same extent.  They would sooner have penal servitude than the &ldquo;cat.&rdquo; That is generally agreed, I think, and I have read that they fear the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; more than they do any imprisonment or penal servitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a very merciless person, but I think that for an offence like that against aged, defenceless women, who are living in lonely districts, and who have no one to defend them, there is no other punishment.  There has been a case quite lately, not far from my own district, of a most deplorable kind.  I say again for such criminals there is nothing like the &ldquo;cat.&rdquo;  They will understand that.  They will not understand anything else.  I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs will be able to introduce something that will adequately deal with these cases.  I would like to see set out in the schedule something that would meet these cases. There is nothing but the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; to <Col N="1561" /> deal with these offences in an adequate manner.  I refer to offences that must be put down at once.  To my mind there is no way of doing that but by introducing in this Section something that these criminals will understand.  It is for that reason I propose to vote against this amendment.  I am firmly persuaded that if serious cases which are becoming very prevalent, and which are not generally known, because the people do not tell about them unless it is unavoidable, are to be put down, it is necessary that this punishment of the &ldquo;cat&rdquo; should be inflicted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wolfe has made a case in favour of flogging for certain offences.  He began by saying he did not believe that flogging should be inflicted on persons unless they were irreclaimable.  That is to say, not for first offences but only when it was being proved that the ordinary punishment of imprisonment was not effective. On his own case I claim his vote. Deputy Wolfe has been commended to the world as a Deputy carrying great weight, and having much experience, whose judgment should receive great consideration.  He has not, however, taken very great care in reading the Bill, or if he has, he has not considered the effect of his argument upon the Bill. He does not think that the penalty of flogging should be applied to the first offence of robbery under arms.  He does not think that the penalty of flogging should be applied in the first offence in the case of arson or burnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh!  Then we learn as we go along that for the burning of property, even for the first offence, the penalty of flogging is not merely justified but required.  It is a greater crime to burn a house or a rick than to commit robbery under arms.  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean to say that such a case as that should be left optional with the Judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we are getting along nicely.  There is to be an option. The Judge may have the power, or <Col N="1562" /> should be empowered with the option, of inflicting the flogging penalty in cases of arson, even for the first offence. Will the Deputy say how many offences of robbery under arms should be committed before the penalty of flogging would be inflicted?  Is it for the first or the second or the third or the fourth offence?  I have not seen any amendment in the name of Deputy Woulfe indicating that the particular offences which he has described or hinted at, are to be punished by flogging. So, notwithstanding his desire to have that particular offence punished by flogging, he has not been careful to try to embody that in this temporary and exceptional legislation.  Is it because he is satisfied that it already exists in the ordinary law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, as a matter of explanation, say that the reason I did not put down an amendment is that for the last five weeks I have been laid up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But since the last time when this was discussed in the Dáil there have been opportunities for putting amendments.  The same case was made on the last occasion, and yet the Deputy has not thought it well to put down an amendment, presumably because he recognised the punishment of flogging may be applied to such offences as he described.  Notwithstanding the fact that the punishment exists, the offences continue.  The fact that flogging may be a punishment in such offences has not prevented the offences taking place.  On every count, Deputy Woulfe has made a case for my amendment. There is, of course, more than one question involved in this Section. The Minister has said that the penalty of flogging may, under the ordinary law, be applied in cases of robbery under arms, and that the difference which this Section brings about is that it is mandatory upon the Court, unless special circumstances exist, to inflict this penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He did not say whether the penalty of flogging may be applied under the ordinary law in cases of arson.  I take it from his silence that it does not.  So the ordinary law is altered in that respect, and it is made mandatory in both <Col N="1563" /> cases.  On account of the fact that I move for the deletion of this Section, because it imposes as a mandatory punishment the penalty of flogging, I need not be twitted on the ground that flogging is applicable in similar cases under the ordinary law.  I would abolish the punishment even under the ordinary law if I had the opportunity.  I object to the punishment, not solely or chiefly because it is cruel and unjust to the prisoner, but because it is harmful to the common conscience of the community, whether the community feels it or not.</P>
    <P>One might ask: &ldquo;Why make these exceptions?&rdquo;  If it is a good thing to inflict this kind of physical torture upon a man who has sinned or committed crime, and you want to make him feel the enormity of his offence in his body, why do you hesitate about imposing a similar penalty upon a man whose state of health is delicate or who is old?  Surely you may go the whole hog in the matter?  If you are going to tear the man's flesh, you ought not to hesitate about his age.  If society, in its corporate capacity, is prepared to act the brute, to deliberately move in an organised fashion with all the resources of the State at its disposal, and to take an individual and beat him with thongs after disabling him, disarming him, tieing him up, and putting him into a position where he is absolutely helpless, and then considers that that is a good thing for Society, I am undone and I have no further answer to make. I cannot think it in any way justifiable at this stage of the world's history, that we should, as an organised body, attempt to treat a human being in that fashion, no matter what the crime.</P>
    <P>It would be far better to take his life, because you prevent him committing similar crimes again.  It would be far better to inflict capital punishment, because it is an absolute deterrent against that man committing that offence again.  This punishment does not prevent the man committing the offence again.  He may come out and do the same thing over again, as has happened in many cases after flogging has been administered.  But you are hurting the moral sense of the community <Col N="1564" /> and you are preventing the development of that moral sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment, not so much from the humanitarian point of view&mdash; although I believe the humanitarian point of view ought to be considered&mdash; but from the practical point of view. I look upon this matter from the point of view of the effect of flogging and the question of whether flogging will have the effect of preventing crime.  I think the history of modern civilisation and modern legislation is contrary to the imposition of such punishment.  I think the main reason why this punishment has not been inflicted is that it has not been found to be a deterrent in preventing those upon whom it is inflicted from committing those crimes. I could understand this punishment last year in the conditions which existed in the country, the great difficulty of apprehending criminals, and the uncertainty, when they were apprehended, as to whether they could be retained in prison.  It might have been necessary in such a period as that to impose a penalty which would be certain and quick.  Under present conditions, however, I do not think such a penalty is necessary.  From my knowledge of humanity, and from history, I do not believe that it has been proved that the flogging of criminals has had the effect of preventing crime or of frightening criminals from committing the same crimes again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be much more advisable if the Minister, and the Department for which he is responsible, devoted their attention more to the actual catching of criminals, and making the executive arm of the law much more effective, and more certain in its application.  We know that under the Bill a man can be flogged for committing the crime of arson.  That crime is one from which the farming community has suffered to a great extent.  It would be better for <Col N="1565" /> the peace of the community if we could be sure that the forces of the law would catch criminals.  At present the trouble is that criminals are not caught.  There may be ten crimes of arson committed and the chances are that not one criminal would be caught for any of those crimes.  It would be better if the forces of the law and the Civic Guard, about whom we hear so much, would devote their attention to bringing those who commit serious crimes to justice, rather than be devoting so much of the attention they are giving at present to catching farmers who have no lights on their carts at night, and hurrying people out of public houses because they are five minutes after closing time. I think that would be a more effective measure of dealing with crime in this country than by inflicting a very severe punishment upon one man and hoping by that to deter other members of the community and to frighten them from committing some such crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support this amendment, because I am opposed to flogging as a punishment which will deter people committing the crimes mentioned in the Schedule.  The Minister and every member of this Dáil must recognise, and I am sure will recognise, that we are dealing with a different type of criminal order now from what were known as criminals in pre-war days.  During the critical period of the struggle with England respectable men, and others, were encouraged to do things that we now look upon as crimes.  They were encouraged to do those things with a certain object in view, and now they find it very difficult to understand why people who encouraged them to do these things, which were not then considered as crimes, are going to punish them under this measure that we are dealing with. That is one reason which has added to the number of criminals and added a class unheard of in pre-European war days.</P>

Whether it was done under orders, or in the name of a certain authority then existing, is a matter for the people and those here to judge.  At any rate, I want to come to the point that we are not dealing with a criminal of the type that was in existence in the pre-European war days.  I am not opposing&mdash;and I want to make that clear to the Minister and everyone else&mdash;this punishment, because I have no desire, far from it, to protect people who are committing the most horrible crimes in the country at the present time.  Some of these crimes have not been reported and are, perhaps, not known either to the Civic Guard or the military authorities. I have in my mind two or more revolting cases that occurred here in recent times, and where certain men have been arrested and will be later on charged with the commission of a number of offences in which, perhaps, the lives of one or two people are involved. I would prefer that individuals, such as those responsible for the commission of crimes of robbery under arms, should be sent to some place of detention where they would not be able to get away, and instead of getting good healthy food, and having people to wait upon them, they should get whatever they would be entitled to, considering the type they are, and where they would be compelled by the State to do a certain class of useful work to pay for their detention in that Institution. That is the view I take of punishment, and I think it is a type of punishment that will deter those people from committing such crimes as those to which I refer.

      <P>I would like to say that this subject has so far received from the critics of the proposals of the Government an examination which the circumstances of the time did not warrant. Nearly every Deputy who has spoken in favour of the deletion of this Sub-section dealt with humanity, with humanity in the abstract, and not with the particular circumstances of the days <Col N="1568" /> in which we are living, and not with the particular class of persons whom it is proposed here to deal with.  Now the facts are&mdash;that people's property has been seized under arms, that arms have been used for the personal benefit and personal pelf of individuals who placed themselves outside of, not responsible to, and indifferent to, society as a class. Usually when cases like that occur in every country the attitude that has been taken has been to deal sternly and immediately with such persons to show them that they cannot, with impunity attack society and not pay the penalty. A good many years ago when a particular form of crime was prevalent in England, a certain judge adopted stringent and strong measures with regard to it, and within six months the crime was no more.  It is not in an attempt to wreak the vengeance of the State or the vengeance of society on these persons that it is proposed here to administer corporal punishment, but it is that every person who has in his mind or contemplates the act of seizing property which is not his by arms or with arms in his hands, that that person is going to be dealt with in such a manner as will deter others of his class or order from making the same experiment.  The facts are that quite a large number of those who have committed these crimes against society have been arrested, quite a large number of them.  I saw from a recent report which I had from the Minister for Home Affairs that we had a proportion of thirteen persons arrested in respect of say seventeen offences&mdash;a fairly large proportion for a young and courageous body that is doing its work under extraordinary difficulties.  Everybody knows that if you are to have an efficient police force it will require years of training and of study of its particular work to enable it to function. Here these young men have been thrown out in some parts of the country where some of them were never before, and the results they have achieved are a credit to them.  What now is going to be the action on the part of the Government in assuring these young men that the strong arm of the State is behind them?  What else except this thing of administering such punishment as will prevent a repetition of <Col N="1569" /> these experiments in the future. What has happened?  Quite a number of Civic Guard stations have been raided.  In some cases the uniforms of the Civic Guards have been taken, and in other cases their bicycles were taken.  The Guards themselves have been maltreated, and I wonder will those who will come under this particular Act and who will get this punishment, ever consider what a serious thing it was to have maltreated these servants of the State when they were carrying on their nefarious designs throughout the country?  There is no use in pointing to humanity and saying humanity is against this punishment. We are all against it, and none of us wish to have this particular form of punishment in our statutes; none of us ever see a sentence of that kind imposed on one of this class that we do not feel it just as much as any other person who will speak of it and condemn it.</P>
      <P>I put to Deputies the case of the Civic Guard robbed under arms, thrown down on the ground and jumped upon.  Will those who committed these particular acts ever feel what corporal punishment is unless there be a corrective, such as this, to deal with them?  Let me take, say, the case that Deputy Baxter on leaving this House and on his way home is saluted by some gentleman with a blow on the chin; that when he gets up he finds his watch gone and sees his assailant move off.  Is it the Deputy's idea that he must run after his assailant and say to him, &ldquo;Erring brother, let me embrace you and restore you once again to society and show you what an awful thing you have done&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not, but if you do not, the question is, how are we going to correct it?  I am sure Deputy Baxter would not countenance anything like that and would not like to see Deputy Heffernan assaulted in the same manner when going home.  I am sure that if Deputy Baxter saw one of these gentleman assault Deputy Heffernan the first thing he would do would be to knock down that man.  If <Col N="1570" /> that be the case, is there corporal punishment in that?  I take it that there is, and that any man who would be knocked down would feel the blow unless devoid of all sense of feeling. That is the first impulse any man who would be knocked down, the impulse of self-defence.  When you get back to normal conditions, and normal conditions mean that when robberies take place they will not be carried out under arms, then I say it will be time enough to wipe out this punishment, and no one will welcome it more than the Minister for Home Affairs and myself.</P>

      <P>The President has made a speech he might have made had he been advocating whipping or flogging for any variety of offence what ever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If we see a man coming out of a jeweller's shop with a handful of watches are we to fall upon his neck and say &ldquo;come back to the paths of rectitude, brother?&rdquo;  If we see a man having forged his employer's name are we to come up to him and say &ldquo;come back, brother, do not do that sort of thing again; come and ask for forgiveness,&rdquo; but do not attempt to punish him.  We might argue the same way for every offence imaginable and say there is nothing to be done except to put that man into such a position as he will feel the enormity of his offence.  The same kind of argument was used when it was proposed to abolish capital punishment which at a certain time was awarded for sheep-stealing. The same kind of argument was used at every step towards the abolition of flogging or the use of capital punishment.  A man attacks a Civic Guard and jumps upon him.  How is he to be made to feel that that sort of crime cannot be condoned unless we inflict corporal punishment upon him. The President used that argument after six months of a Bill which inflicted corporal punishment and gives us references to offences of this kind which are being committed up and down the country in spite of the fact that this punishment of flogging has been embodied in the Temporary Provisions Act passed last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, and also because of detection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Then every effort of the Government in the promotion of peace has nothing to do with it.  It is merely the flogging punishment that is responsible.  If then, the Minister can point to flogging as the reason why these various crimes are growing less, why does he not, as the logical deduction of that argument, ask for everything to be included&mdash;for all those offences, even those of summary jurisdiction, to be included.  If flogging is a corrective, why limit it to these cases? The Minister will say because it is intended for the particular kind of offence.  Deputy Wolfe told us of the particular kind of offence that he wants.  Each Deputy has a different kind of offence for which he would inflict flogging on the offender. In one case it is a sexual offence, in another arson, in another it is a case of robbery with violence, and in another it is held up against a blackleg in a trade dispute.  Each person or class of person, according to their training and character and social position, have a different kind of punishment as specially applicable to the kind of offence which those most interested have the greatest objection to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the fact that the offences, while happily growing less as I am glad to hear, still continue even in a smaller number of cases, proves at any rate that the punishment embodied in the Act which has now expired, has not been effective in deterring others from committing the same crimes, and I think that the Dáil must get its mind clear as to what is the intention.  Is it with the object of deterring the offender from committing the same <Col N="1572" /> offence again, or is with the object of deterring other people from committing that kind of offence?  The figures adduced show that it has not been effective in deterring others, and I do not know whether it is likely to have been effective in deterring the prisoner himself, because he has not had another opportunity.  But if he is the kind of person that is addicted to this kind of offence, such as Deputy Woulfe had in mind, then he is not being dealt with in this Bill, because this is a temporary Bill, and expires at the end of one year, so we are not dealing with the repetition of offences.  I will ask the President, when this Bill has been securely passed in his leisure moments to read some of the speeches that were made respecting flogging and capital punishment at any period, say, since the beginning of the seventeenth century, and he will find, if he compares them with his own speech to-day, exactly the same sentiments, that for certain kinds of offences you must inflict this kind of punishment, and that if you do not, what is to deter the criminal.  But it has been found, as a matter of fact, that notwithstanding the repetition of the old story about six months after the infliction of flogging by Mr. Justice Day the offences ceased, that they did not in fact cease, and that Judges of even greater experience than Mr. Justice Day proved that in their experience flogging had had no deterrent effect upon that particular class of offender. The case that has been adduced respecting other kinds of offences than those referred to in the Section need not be discussed, because they will not be affected, and as I said earlier, Deputy Woulfe is logically bound to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is Deputy Heffernan's view that people should be allowed to roll out of public houses half an hour after closing time and drive home without lights on their cars, but it struck me that the Deputy was somewhat out of order in airing grievances of that kind on this particular Sub-section.  Deputy Johnson said that really of the two he would prefer the capital punishment to <Col N="1573" /> the punishment prescribed in this Section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I do not really know whether there is much to be gained by covering all the ground we covered last year, and treading the dreary round as to whether this particular form of punishment had or had not stopped garrotting in the year of grace 1780, or thereabouts, but there is one fallacy, at any rate, that ought to be exploded.  The Deputy says these crimes still occur: therefore, the penalty was no deterrent.  Now, you cannot prove a negative, and it is not possible to say, as the Deputy seems to suggest; that because crimes still occur there was no deterrent effect.  I could just as well say that ten times as many crimes would have occurred but for this penalty, except that I could not prove it, and I do not like to put forward statements for which I cannot produce evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said it. The point is that you have arms sown all over the country.  You have revolvers dumped here and there, and people willing and eager to use them, perhaps, particularly willing and eager to use them for their own personal gain, and I am convinced that the State, or society&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;in self-defence must resort to extra penalties, penalties over and above those prescribed by the ordinary law, which is held in such reverence, and which were <Col N="1574" /> adequate in a more normal situation. That is the position.  Some men think because they commit a crime with a gun that in some way the crime becomes idealised; that whereas mere robbery is a shameful thing and a disgrace, if you rob with a gun it becomes a heroic and ennobling act.  It is necessary to get rid of any delusions of that kind.  It is necessary to take the halo, or any vestige of a halo there may be, from the head of the man who goes out to rob his neighbour with a gun.  It is the deliberate policy to brand these two crimes as cowardly and disgraceful crimes.  In a few cases where this particular sentence was imposed relatives sent in petitions saying: &ldquo;It is all right that John should serve a term of imprisonment; we know that he over-stepped the line, but we would be glad if you would remit that particular portion of the penalty, because it is a disgrace.&rdquo;  I am glad that they consider it a disgrace, and I hope that the person on whose behalf they petitioned will also consider it a disgrace, and will come to realise that the State imposed that ignominious penalty because a cowardly and disgraceful crime had been committed.  All the sympathy, all the benevolence, is poured out on the side of the offender.</P>

      <P>A few other wise men.  I invite Deputies to look at the other side of the matter, to put themselves in the place of the man trudging home with his week's wages who is held up and robbed.  Such cases have been reported to me, where men to whom certain arrears of pay were due were waylaid within a few hundred yards of the factory or workshop where they were paid, and not only their week's wages but the arrears that were known to be coming to them were robbed from them on their way home, and the unfortunate men had to trudge home with empty pockets and report that to their expectant families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> These crimes are routine.  They are common, as Deputies know, in many parts of the country&mdash;cowardly, base crimes of that kind&mdash;and there should be no apology due from a responsible Minister for taking the line that the situation is a special one, and an abnormal one, which the ordinary current law of the land is inadequate to meet. And, therefore, so far from being in any way apologetic for this particular sub-section, if the crimes increase in degree and increase in frequency, my only remedy for that would be to come to the Dáil and ask for still more stringent remedies.  You cannot meet the situation otherwise.  You cannot meet the situation by playing Brase's Band to the criminal.  I did consider last year the advisability of tabling a proposal for the capital sentence in connection with robbery under arms. Every man who goes out to rob with arms is a potential murderer.  The President, I think, put his finger on the gist of the matter when he described this as self-defence on the part of society.  In the individual it is a truism to say that self-preservation is the first law of nature; and the State, no less than the individual, more than the individual, must defend itself, and defend itself by the most effective means, to use a phrase that has become famous, against the crimes that tend to undermine the social fabric, crimes that tend to bring back the barbarism of the Stone Age, with every man's hand against his neighbour.  I did not wish to speak at length on this amendment, and I had made a good resolution not to speak with any vehemence; but lest the very few words which I said in expressing my opposition at the beginning should be misunderstood as any mood of apology, any mood of doubt as to the necessity for these provisions, as to the wisdom of these provisions, I thought it better on the whole to speak again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always tried and been cautious in dealing with any measure put forward in the Dáil to look at the proposals, so far as my views on them are concerned, at any rate, from the point of view of what I would do if I were on the other side <Col N="1576" /> of the House.  I have always realised that a Party such as ours, which probably may look forward in the near future to sitting on the other side, with perhaps Deputy Johnson where the President is to-day&mdash;I am not anxious for the day especially under present conditions&mdash;that any Constitutional Party appealing to the people to put them into the position of governing the country must realise that when they have got into that position they must deal with and punish criminals according to the nature of their crimes.  It is from that point of view alone I have tried in any contributions I make here to any debate to give serious consideration to any proposals put forward.  The President has stated, and perhaps it is one of the few examples he could give, that in a particular area 13 criminals out of 17 were detected and punished.  That was a well-deserved tribute to the Civic Guard, or whatever body was acting on behalf of the Government, but I can tell the President that is not a typical example of the position as we find it in many parts of the country.  I fully realise that it is due to the apathy or lack of courage on the part of the people who are interfered with and robbed.  They are not prepared to come forward and assist the servants of the Government to deal with and punish the criminals who are infesting these particular areas.  So far as I can judge in a number of cases where robbery under arms, arson, and other crimes of that nature are committed, the individuals concerned in their commission are not very large in number. They operate in many cases over a very wide area.  Therefore, I have been forced to the view, and I would like to hear the President or the Minister on it, or that the Government must, if these crimes are to be put down, provide places of internment for these people where they will be made to work hard and give a return to the State for their internment.</P>

The Minister has said here that it costs the Government at the rate of £1 per week to keep the men who have been interned. Many States have been faced with a condition of things such as this State has passed and is passing through, and they have dealt with the situation in the way I suggest, and perhaps if the Government adopted that method it would act as a greater deterrent to those criminals who are committing these offences to-day.  I put that suggestion to the Government in a serious way, and I hope they will consider it and withdraw the proposals they have put forward.</P>

      <P>I think that there is a very important principle involved. We discussed the principle on various occasions here as to the propriety of putting, in the Bill, minimum penalties. That applies to a greater extent here. I think it ought to be left to the discretion of the judge whether the penalty of flogging should be inflicted. That is the purpose of the amendment. There is not much that I wish to say in the matter because the effect of the amendment is obvious.  I do not think it is right that a judge should be in the position, as did happen in some cases recently, of feeling that he was forced to inflict a penalty which he himself did not think should have been inflicted. I think that the matter should be left to the discretion of the judge.  I will only, in this connection, seeing that the object to be obtained is a deterrent, emphasise what was said in the other debate by Deputy Heffernan, and the others, that it is not the actual punishment will prevent crime so much as the apprehending of the criminal. If crime has become less frequent, I believe that it is due to the fact that in recent months a greater effort has been made in capturing criminals, and these efforts have met with greater success. I am firmly convinced that it is not so much the punishment the criminal will get when he is caught that will prevent crime being committed as the belief that potential criminals will hold that if they commit a crime they cannot get away without being captured.  It is that comparative immunity from capture which criminals have had in the last three or four years during the disturbed state of this country that has led to the present position, which is, happily, becoming less and less acute every day, and I believe that it is along that line that success in putting down crime will be achieved rather than going along the lines of this Bill.</P>

      <P>It would be discourteous if I said nothing in reply, though I feel that everything that should be said on this amendment has already been said.  The difference is not, as the Deputy suggested, between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; because the Bill says if there are special circumstances which in the opinion of the judge <Col N="1580" /> constitute a mitigation of the offence, this penalty need not be imposed.  The Deputy spoke of judges being forced to impose this penalty, as if there were no remedy.  There is, first of all, a remedy in the Bill.  It is that if there are special circumstances which the judge thinks constitute a mitigation there is no obligation to impose a penalty, and in any case in which a judge entertains doubts as to whether the penalty is fully deserved it is open to him to make representation to the Executive to that effect.  Any representation that has been received from any judge or magistrate has not been lightly treated or set aside.  My position with regard to this amendment is quite simple.  I believe that in the setting this penalty is necessary for these two offences.  That is the position in the abstract.  If a special case arises where there seems to be mitigating circumstances, and where the court is satisfied that there are such mitigating circumstances, then this sub-section as it stands, provides a remedy, and in such cases there is no obligation on the court to pass this particular sentence. There have been cases in which there were mitigating circumstances. There has been one case in which a robbery was committed, with arms, and for one reason or another&mdash; I am not in a position to say for what reason&mdash;the stolen money was returned. The person who committed the robbery was caught, but the fact that the money was returned was regarded as a mitigating circumstance, and the penalty was not imposed.  There will, no doubt, be occasional cases in which the degree of guilt seems somewhat less than in the average normal case, and that case is met in the sub-section as it stands. The net effect of the amendment, if carried, would be simply to revert to the ordinary normal law which provides that this particular penalty may be imposed for robbery under arms.</P>

      <P>The Minister now evidently has come to the conclusion that the object of this particular kind of penalty is to get back the money which has been stolen.  The deterrent effect of the punishment is not the object now.  It is because it has the effect of getting back the money which has been stolen.  I realise, of course, that the Minister has spoken two or three times ironically in reference to remarks of mine regarding the ordinary law.  He has spoken of the ordinary law which is held in such reverence.  It is quite evident that what the Minister holds in reverence is not the ordinary law but special and temporary coercion Bills.</P>

      <P>I think it would be wrong for me to allow the Deputy to misrepresent me.  I have not stated that the object of the penalty is to get back stolen property.  I mentioned, in a purely passing way, as an instance, that there had been a case in which, prior to the trial and to the conviction, particular stolen funds had been returned, and that was regarded as a mitigating circumstance, and the penalty of flogging was not imposed.  On this ordinary law question, it seems to me the idea is that the ordinary law, which incidentally is the law that was not made by ourselves, is worthy of every respect and reverence.  But, if we consider a particular law necessary to meet a particular situation, then that is looked on with horror; that is an abomination.  Yet the object of all law is simply to meet the requirements of society from time to time.  But the home-made article is essentially wrong. The sound conservative mind of Deputy Johnson keeps harping back to that which was made prior to our times.</P>

      <P>I beg to move: &ldquo;To delete Sub-section (5).&rdquo;  The language used in the drafting of this Sub-section I think is the best argument that can be put forward in favour of its deletion. This Bill, which is a temporary Bill to meet a situation which is far from normal, lays down certain penalties for certain crimes referred to in the Second Schedule.  These penalties, we take it, are not penalties to meet a normal state of affairs.  If the existing law, which has been passed to deal with a situation and conditions which are normal, lays down more severe penalties for these crimes, then I fail to understand why this particular Sub-section is drafted in the way it is.  The Minister must know, especially in regard to crimes such as arson, whether the existing law lays down more severe penalties than the penalties laid down in this Sub-section. Therefore, I think, if the existing law does provide for that, there is no necessity for the insertion of this Sub-section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

      <P>This Bill was intended to provide an expeditious method of dealing with crimes set out in the Schedule.  It is of a temporary nature, and because it is temporary we do not think it worth the trouble of finding out in each particular case whether the punishment prescribed in the Bill is less than the punishment prescribed by the ordinary existing law. It was not the intention when the Public Safety Act of last year was passed that it would operate to the exclusion of the ordinary code.  But some Judges and some District Justices took the view when a prosecution was brought under the Public Safety Act that then of necessity only the penalties mentioned under the Public Safety Act could be imposed.  Without professing to pronounce on that view it was thought wise to put in this Section to make it clear that there was no intention to hamper judges or magistrates in that way, and wherever, in a special case, the ordinary law enabled them to prescribe and impose a heavier penalty than is mentioned in this Bill that they would have power to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lord Chief Justice in trying one particular case which came before him <Col N="1583" /> remarked that as the charge was formulated under the Public Safety Act he was precluded from imposing the sentence which he thought the crime deserved and he expressed the opinion that the criminal as a result got off too lightly.  He said that the penalties imposed by the Public Safety Act with regard to the particular offence, the nature of which I forget at the moment, were inadequate to meet an aggravated case, and that, in fact, under the ordinary law which existed prior to the passing of the Public Safety Act, heavier penalties could be imposed.  It so happened that that particular charge was formulated with specific reference to a Section and Sub-section of the Public Safety Act and in the circumstances the judge felt that he was confined to the penalties which the Public Safety Act prescribed.  This Section 5 is simply inserted so that, if it should happen in a particular case that a heavier sentence could be imposed under the ordinary law than is mentioned in this Bill, Justices would be at liberty to impose it.  I see nothing objectionable in the Section.  I see a certain advantage. It meets such a special case as was commented on by the Lord Chief Justice and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question I want to draw attention to Sub-section (1), and to relate it to Part I. of the Schedule, paragraph 2.  One of the offences in Part I. of the Schedule reads: &ldquo;Unlawfully inducing or attempting to induce any officer of the Government of Saorstát Eireann to refuse, neglect or omit to discharge his duty as such officer.&rdquo;  I want to suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider the effect of this Sub-section and that paragraph of the Schedule. There are very many officers.  I take is that originally it was thought &ldquo;officer&rdquo; had reference particularly to military officers.  Let us assume the case of a Customs officer on the Border.  Some Deputies perhaps will be interested in this.  One of their constituents attempts to pass through the Border without disclosing that he has a certain quantity <Col N="1584" /> of cigarettes in his pocket.  The customs officer is in duty bound to report.  It is a minor offence, let us assume, and the person concerned quite unlawfully attempts to persuade that officer to neglect, or omit to discharge his duty in the matter.  Undoubtedly that is an offence.  What kind of penalty is provided? Nothing less than penal servitude, and there is no option.  &ldquo;Every person found guilty on indictment of any of the offences mentioned in Part I. may be sentenced to suffer penal servitude for life, or such term of penal servitude as the judge may decide.&rdquo;  It may be said of course that that person would not be charged on indictment, but we do not know.  Offences that are not so minor as the one I have instanced may still be of a kind which would not justify the minimum penalty of penal servitude.  Yet, we are obliging a judge to inflict a penalty of penal servitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, &ldquo;may be sentenced.&rdquo; If guilty, he cannot be sentenced to anything less than penal servitude, and penal servitude, I think, implies not less than three years' imprisonment. There are very many classes of officers of the State carrying on a very great variety of duties, and many attempts may be made to induce such officers to neglect or to refuse to discharge their duty.  If we are going to impose these minimum penalties, such as penal servitude, under indictment, and these other imprisonments, with or without hard labour&mdash;of course, there is more option in paragraph 2, but in paragraph 1 there is no option to the judge but to impose a penalty of penal servitude&mdash;I submit that paragraph 2 of the Schedule, which is related to Section 1, requires amendment to confine the offences to officers, and I would suggest military officers or members of the army.  There is no amendment down in this matter, but I would like the Minister to pay attention to this criticism, because I think it will be found when we get to the Schedule, if it is passed in its present form, that possibly grave injustice and over-penalising for certain classes of offences may be embodied in the law.</P>

      <P>I will consider what the Deputy has stated, and will consult with others on the matter. Meanwhile I would like to offer some comments.  The paragraph which the Deputy quotes, Part I. of the Schedule, sets out two offences, and Sub-section (1) of Section 1 deals only with conviction on indictment.  For a minor or trivial offence the State is not likely to formulate a definite charge and bring a man before a jury.  Minor offences would be dealt with in a summary way. The objection to confining the matter to officers of the army, officers of the disciplined forces of the State, police or military, is that resort to terrorism against civil officers of the State is not infrequent.  District Justices, Under-Sheriffs, State Solicitors, who are essential factors in the machinery of the State, have from time to time been subject to threats and terrorism in various forms.  It would, of course, be a question of degree, and the degree would decide whether the State would formulate an indictment and put a man forward for trial before a jury of his fellow-citizens or proceed by summary charge.  It is necessary to extend the sub-section to officers of the State other than officers of the army or of the police forces.  Meanwhile, what I said holds, that I would undertake to look <Col N="1586" /> more closely into the matter in the light of the remarks made by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I would like to supplement what I said and correct a slight misconception of my own, and I think a slight misconception on the part of the Minister.  As it appears to me, any offence in Part I. of the Schedule must be the subject of an indictment. At least that is suggested here.  There is no suggestion of an offence under Part I. being the subject of summary jurisdiction.</P>
