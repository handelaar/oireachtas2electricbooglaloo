      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Army Pensions Act, 1923, lays it down that pensions, etc., shall be granted by the Minister for Defence with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  There is no provision for the existence of a Committee such as the Deputy has in mind. An Inter-departmental Committee is, however, in being for advisory purposes, but it would not be proper for me to appoint thereon a person of the kind suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he can state why payment of dependents' allowance was discontinued from 18th December, 1923, to Mrs. Bridget Donohoe, of Grange, Eyrecourt, Co. Galway, in <Col N="3087" /> respect of her two sons, Thomas and Michael Donohoe, who are serving in the Army, and if he is aware that they were her principal support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of dependents' allowance to Mrs. Donohoe was not discontinued from 18th December, 1923, in respect of either of her sons.  It was, however, discontinued from 22nd December, 1923, in the case of Thomas, as the soldier re-attested on that date, and in accordance with the current regulations relating to pay, etc., the allowance is not issuable in the case of a soldier who re-attests.  The allowance in respect of Michael ceased on the 13th March, 1924, the date of his re-attestation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that answer, will the Minister take some steps to inform the dependents of soldiers who re-attest that they are no longer eligible for dependents' allowance, as in many cases they are not aware of it?  Could a circular or something of that kind be issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to examine, first of all, the case from the point of view of the number of letters that should be sent out in that connection. As we are now approaching Easter I could not promise, having regard to the large number, that it would be possible to do that immediately. But the soldiers themselves know the new circumstances.  I will consider the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that the President should put in an advertisement in the Press to that effect?  I am sure every Deputy receives many inquiries on this matter.  Personally I do, and it would be advisable, I think, that the people should be notified by public advertisement that they will not get this allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Sergt. Whelan's claim arose during the period prior to the inception of the late Provisional Government.  The question as to what extent and from what funds claims arising during that period will be met, is under consideration.  Pending a general decision, it is regretted that it is not practicable to consider the particular claim in question.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that answer, may I ask if the President will see if anything can possibly be done for this man?  His is a very hard case.  This motor car was dragged in from Kill practically in smithereens, and he had to purchase parts for it.</P>

      <P>It is involved, as I have stated in the answer, in a matter that has not yet been decided, that is how far, and from where, applications of this kind can be considered.  There are no particular funds available, and it will need a vote by the Dáil to meet payments such as this if it were decided to make such recommendations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to have been misinformed on this matter.  The full agricultural grant for the years 1921 and 1922 has been paid to the County Council.</P>
      <P>Following upon the release of the grants withheld by the British Government a sum of £47,387 5s. Od. was paid over to the County Council in September, 1922, in respect of three half-years grant to the 30th September, 1921.  The grant of £15,795 15s. Od. for the half-year ended 31st March, 1922, was paid in February last, while grants of like amounts in respect of the half-years ended 30th September, 1922, and 31st March, 1923, were paid in March, 1923, and May, 1923, respectively.  The delay in the issue of the grant for the half-year ended 31st March, 1922, was due to the fact that the grant was attached in the Guarantee Fund to meet charges under the Land Purchase Acts in consequence of large arrears of land purchase annuities.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on Motion by Mr. P. McKenna:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Minister for Agriculture be directed to take action in the matter of the conditions obtaining with regard to the importation of Irish cattle into Great Britain on the lines suggested by the Irish Cattle Exporters Association at their meeting on the 12th March, 1924, viz., that the Free State and Northern Ireland Governments hold themselves responsible for payment of compensation for live stock compulsorily slaughtered in British Lairages until the usual detention period of ten hours expires, and after that that representations be made to the British Government to accept liability for payment when proof is established that the disease was contracted in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>I moved the adjournment of this debate last week because I was impressed by the appeals <Col N="3095" /> of the Minister for Agriculture that he should receive enlightenment from every Party.  He now, apparently, anticipates receiving that enlightenment from every Party in the Dáil&mdash; and there are more than there were&mdash;within the space of ten or fifteen minutes.  I fear he will be disappointed, but I will not take very long.  I venture to think that the Minister's diagnosis of the injury caused to agriculture when he spoke last week, was not an entirely correct one.  He spoke of an injury amounting to £5,000 in a year inflicted on a few individuals, but that loss, which is no doubt the net loss, is not inflicted, as a general rule, on the farmer.  The farmer has sold his cattle before they are shipped to England, so that the loss on the cattle slaughtered in England during the period of detention, does not fall on the farmer.  It falls on the dealer.  But the dealer, not being in business for his health, safeguards himself by giving the farmer a lower price when he buys his cattle, in order to provide for this possible contingency, so that the real loss to the farmer, what I might call the gross loss, is a great deal more than £5,000 a year.  It means, perhaps, a shilling, or possibly even five shillings&mdash;I do not know the standards that the trade adopts&mdash;off the price of every bullock sold in Ireland.  The Minister dissents.  Does he think that the dealer does not safeguard himself against possible loss?  If so, the Minister has less experience of selling cattle than I have.  It does, and must, affect the farmer in the long run, because the farmer is the producer of the raw material.  I agree with the Minister that it would be very unwise if we were to admit any liability in this matter of foot and mouth disease, if we were to admit that foot and mouth disease could possibly be developed here, because under existing conditions, almost by a miracle, we are free from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister's Department is entitled to very great credit for that, that the arrangements made for disinfection, and so on, have worked satisfactorily, and although England has been a hotbed of foot and mouth disease, we have so far escaped, and we ought not to put ourselves <Col N="3096" /> in a position of admitting any liability for it.  But I venture to think that, taking a wide view, there is some cause for what Deputy McKenna asks, that a man should not suffer merely because his cattle happen to have been shipped across the water.  I do not say that the whole of Deputy McKenna's motion is a possible one. To begin with, it involves the concurrence of the Government of Northern Ireland, and we here have no power to bind that Government, for the time being.  In addition, there is a very different case; there is the case of cattle bought at fairs in the Saorstát and shipped from ports in Northern Ireland.  If Deputy McKenna's motion was adopted, I am not clear who would be liable for compensation in such cases.  Would it be the Government from whose ports they were shipped or the country of origin?  The bulk of the cattle bought in Sligo are shipped either from Belfast or Derry. I would imagine that the bulk of the cattle from Tirconaill are shipped through Derry, so that in the doubtful and disputed cases each Government would deny liability, creating friction between them.  That is quite a different case, and it is not met by the motion on the Paper.  I would like to suggest&mdash;it is only a suggestion; it would require much more than my resources to say whether it is entirely a practical suggestion &mdash; a general scheme of insurance for cattle under the auspices of the trade; insurance against foot and mouth disease as long as these cattle are in Irish hands and belong to Irish proprietors. The adoption of that would relieve the State of liability in cases where cattle are slaughtered for foot and mouth disease in Ireland.  In return for being relieved of that liability legislation would be necessary. The usual barrier&mdash;the Minister for Finance&mdash;would probably not be set up in this case, because it would relieve him of a very considerable contingent liability.  If the State were relieved from that liability it might reasonably be expected to guarantee the financial soundness of the scheme, and to facilitate the trade in organising it by every means in their power. <Col N="3097" /> Of course, actuaries would be required. It would be necessary to have calculations made, for no private individual has the means of making them&mdash;probably even the trade itself has not the means of making them. That does seem to be a way out of it, and under such a scheme the farmer would know for a certainty that his cattle were covered by insurance against the possibility of foot and mouth disease as long as they were in Irish hands.  I think there is something to be said for that, and I hope that the Minister will take it into consideration.</P>

      <P>No subject that has arisen for a long time in the Dáil requires more looking into and more attention than this question of the cattle trade.  I want to appeal to the Ministry, particularly on behalf of a body of very hard-working, industrious men&mdash;the smaller cattle dealers, men whom I have known all my life, men whose whole savings, in some of these cases, have been swept away at one sweep in Glasgow when their cattle were destroyed and when they got on an average 20 per cent. of their value. I would like the Minister to remember that he is not dealing in this case with fat cattle, because, as we all know, when fat cattle are slaughtered on the threat of foot-and-mouth disease in the neighbourhood the loss is very little, if any.  The fat beast brings practically its full value, the carcase value, as we call it.  But the majority of the trade, particularly in the district I speak of, is in store cattle&mdash;the poor man's cattle.  He is not a big, strong farmer, as we call him in the midlands and the south, and it is for him that I make this appeal to the Minister.  He told us recently that £5,000 was not much of a turnover on £26,000,000 or £25,000,000, and I quite agree with him.  He also told us that he would not object to finding the money, and the only reason why he was not prepared to pay this £5,000 in compensation to these men who are hard hit was because it might raise a question in future negotiations with Great Britain on the subject.  I am afraid I cannot see&mdash;I may be wrong, of course&mdash;how this is <Col N="3098" /> going to imperil these negotiations.  A certain number of cattle arrived in Glasgow, free from disease, on the 27th October.  After about eight hours of the ten an outbreak occurred at Paisley, and the cattle were not allowed to be removed.  They were kept there for eighteen days, and eventually they were all destroyed.  During that time none of them contracted the disease.  The Minister has told us time and again, I have constantly checked his figures, that the value of the agricultural industry varies from 70 to 80 per cent. of the total industry of the country.  I think that the cattle export trade is a very large proportion of the agricultural industry, and if we are going to lose this trade, and I am afraid we are, I do not see what is the good of trying to carry on in this country.  If £5,000 will recompense these men, and if some scheme on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture will put them into a position in the future so that they can carry on their trade, and not always be in fear and terror of this outbreak, it would save the situation. What happens when there is the slightest chance of an outbreak?  It is not alone the cattle dealer who suffers; in every fair you go to there is a rumour started, probably in some cases by blackguards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To lower the prices of cattle, and the result is in most fairs at present no one will get the value of his cattle.  That is not due to the cattle dealers, but the effect is that the cattle dealers and the farmers are hit, and through them everybody else in the country.  It has been going on for some time, and I think it is time some scheme was devised.  I have not heard that any approach has been made to the Ministry on the other side.  Has the Minister ever asked England to pay, and has the question been gone into at any time since the Treaty was signed?  Before the Treaty we were not in this position.  I submit, with all respect to the Ministry, that the question should have been looked into long before now as to whether we were not entitled to some of the arrears that accrued from our money previous to <Col N="3099" /> the Treaty, when a sum of money was set aside by the then United Kingdom to pay for foot and mouth disease. Another item that I find in the Appropriation Accounts is &ldquo;General Cattle Diseases Fund,&rdquo; in which a certain amount of provision was made for diseases of animals.  I find from that that there was a certain amount of money spent for swine fever, and for foot and mouth disease nil.  That is because we had no foot and mouth disease, but the amount of money that was spent on swine fever in this country would have paid the unfortunate men who had been caught in the first rush of this disease on the other side.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the case of another Ministry of this State which&mdash;it was last year, I think &mdash;expended a considerable amount to relieve an almost similar case in the fishing industry, when the transit was broken down in the South of Ireland.  The Ministry of Fisheries spent several thousands of pounds, and chartered boats to carry fish to the English markets, and when the accounts were presented to the Dáil I do not think one word was said in condemnation of their action&mdash;quite the reverse.  I submit the Minister for Agriculture has a very good precedent to go on, and if he carries it out, and compensates these people, he will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that he has saved some men from absolute poverty.  I think in dealing with the largest industry we have, that those who suffer in times of almost national calamity, should be compensated, and receive the sympathetic consideration of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point, that only a loss of £5,000 would be incurred, I wish to point out that if you were to do as the Minister for Agriculture told us last year, that those cattle arriving at this no man's land on the other side should be insured, the amount of money which would be necessary to cover shipments of cattle&mdash;and you would have to cover the whole of them to be safe&mdash; would be far in excess of the amount the insurance company would have paid <Col N="3100" /> out.  That is the point.  If you are going to cover the loss, you must look at it, not from the point of view of the actual loss incurred, but from the point of view of the probable loss that could occur, and, therefore, that insurance would be an almost impossible scheme. I want also to emphasise the point made by Deputy Gorey, that these cattle are slaughtered in the interests of the people of Britain, and not in the interests of the Irish farmer.  I fail to see why representations should not be made to the British Government pointing out that they are destroying cattle in their own interests, and, therefore, that they should pay compensation to the people who are losing them.  That is the point of view I want to emphasise, although it is not quite in accordance with the motion.  But, at the same time, it could be used in connection with this motion. It is not a question of the dealer so much as a question of the farmer.  We know perfectly well that the dealer will always have this margin of profit, while he points out to the farmer that he is in danger of incurring a loss through this foot and mouth disease, and whether or not the disease will occur he will always ensure that he will make no loss.  There may be individual instances where dealers lose, but on the whole they make themselves secure, and every man who is selling his beast is losing.  As I have said, we quite understand there may be individual cases of dealers losing, but on every batch of cattle bought this fetish of a probable loss owing to cattle being held up in England is made use of, and bad prices are obtained as a consequence. These are points we would like the Minister to look into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>One point I would like to draw attention to is the implications and the deductions to be drawn from the arguments of Deputy Cooper and Deputy Wilson.  I was rather curious to know whether Deputy McKenna would agree with the statements made by Deputy Cooper and Deputy Wilson, that in the purchasing of cattle in the market the buyer does in fact take account of the risk, and pays a smaller sum for the cattle than if there were no such risk, and if he were not aware of that risk.  Does Deputy McKenna, I wonder, accept that view? <Col N="3101" /> He does not answer, but I think it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major MYLES Major MYLES">
      <NameTxt>Major MYLES</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I think it was I brought out that point.  Most of these men were hit before the disease became rampant, and since that they have been very careful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite accept the proposition that there is, as a matter of fact, account taken of these risks, and when the risk is greater and more obvious the greater account is taken in the purchasing, but in such a case does it not appear that the insurance premium ought then to be paid by these people and should not be placed upon the State directly, or upon the farmer again if it has already been taken from the farmer in purchasing?  I suggest that the reasonable course to be adopted in such cases is to apply to this trade, what has been applied to other trades even though it only begin now, namely, a compulsory insurance on every head of cattle exported.  That insurance might well be under the control of, say, a combination of dealers farmers, and, perhaps, the State represented by the Minister for Agriculture, so that when a risk has been taken and has to be met, a loss having been made, there is a fund available.  Though the amount may be £5,000 this year, bear in mind that according to the law, as expounded by the Minister for Agriculture, if there were an outbreak in Ireland there would need to be an immense fund available to meet this compensation.</P>
      <P>I seriously suggest that the principle of insurance should be adopted, and that it might even be retrospective, so far as the losses are concerned that are due to this latest outbreak, but that it would have to continue for quite a long time, and a big fund should accumulate, and also that such a proposal might well be considered by the organisations connected with the cattle trade in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture.  If it were known quite clearly that the risk was covered by a certain sum there could be no excuse in the mouths of dealers that they had to take off so much and so much because they did not know whether their cattle would be slaughtered in England.  I think something of that kind might be considered, and it would probably meet immediate cases as well as future risks.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson seems to lose sight of the fact that the people of this country in paying for the protection of English interests ought not to be penalised either by insurance or State contributions.  That is a different point altogether from his.  It does not matter in what way we deal with this question, there is a loss that ought not to be borne by any citizen of this State inasmuch as the slaughter is done to protect English interests on English soil.  It would be just as reasonable to say, if England were shipping cattle here and we killed cattle, say, at the North Wall, in order to protect our own interests, that the English farmer, dealer, or English Exchequer should suffer accordingly.  I think it would be unreasonable if we took up that attitude, and I think it is unreasonable for England to take up the same attitude towards us.  This is an English debt, and should be paid by England.</P>

      <P>I think the deductions of Deputy Johnson are not correct.  The difficulty about an insurance is that the premiums paid will in all probability be in excess of the amount returned in cases of slaughter, and it will undoubtedly have the effect of lowering the price of cattle by the amount of the premium, and probably by a larger amount.  It is well known that such obstructions give an opportunity to people to lower the price of our cattle by a still larger amount.  Deputy Johnson referred to the fact that in the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the amount paid by the State will be in excess of the premiums paid to the insurance companies.  My answer to that is that in the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England, the cattle trade would be stopped altogether, and the liability for compensation would not arise in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are only dealing with one risk here.  There are so many questions connected with the Diseases of Animals Act that if we wander over the whole field we will get nowhere. There is one point which is probably the most contentious of all which arise in connection with the administration of this Act, and it is the one upon which I would like to concentrate. The only risk Deputy McKenna wishes to safeguard against is the risk of Irish cattle being slaughtered at English landing places, where no compensation is paid by anybody.  That is only one of the risks.  Deputy Cooper, as well as other Deputies, referred to the fact that cattle are automatically made cheaper by the operations of dealers and other people who take advantage of the fact that foot and mouth disease exists in England, and they do their best to buy cattle at a price which will leave them well insured against any risk they may take. From the point of view of this resolution, the question is not so much how far they take into account the various risks incidental to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England, but how far they take into account this particular risk, and in my opinion the dealer and farmer generally take that into account.  This is not the reason that cattle are cheap at Irish fairs&mdash;because of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England.  The dealers and farmers know that the chances of cattle being slaughtered at landing places are extremely few.  A dealer buys cattle, and though the ports may be closed here, he can ship them.  It may be possible to get them into Cheshire or Sussex, and these are the risks the dealers have to protect themselves against.  I do not believe that that risk affects the price of cattle one iota.  The effect on the price of cattle of this particular risk is as nothing compared with the other risks incidental to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England.  We should not go into the question as to whether cattle slaughtered <Col N="3104" /> in Ireland should be paid for through an insurance scheme.  The State pays for that, and in my opinion that is a farce.  It is also not the most efficient way of doing it, because as Deputy Heffernan points out, insurance is wasteful, and the farmer would pay far more money than he would pay, say, in taxes.  If it were to be done by insurance, I expect the State would do it, but in any event, I would prefer to see the charge spread over the ratepayers, because there are individuals in the State who get more profit out of cattle than the farmers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case that does not arise.  We have enough of contention.  The State has to pay for cattle slaughtered in Ireland, and we can leave it at that.  The suggestion here is that we should offer to the English Government that we would pay for all Irish cattle slaughtered at the landing places within a minimum period of 10 hours.  That is Deputy McKenna's suggestion.  Deputy Gorey is different.  His position is mine in the matter.  That is to say, we should not admit liability for any cattle slaughtered in England.  It would be an extremely dangerous precedent to make, and we might well put up a proposition to pay for cattle slaughtered in ten hours, and then it is open to the English to answer ten weeks.  At any rate, it would be a dangerous thing to do.  I am told this particular difficulty is there since 1922, and, in fact, one Deputy seems to think it is there since the signing of the Treaty.  The Treaty made no difference whatever to the legal aspect of this question. It was not until 1922 that the Act which admitted Canadian cattle was passed, and it was that Act which changed the law.  That Act put Irish cattle and Canadian cattle in the same category as far as this liability is concerned. It is a difficulty that has been there, I admit, for over a year.  It has been a difficulty of ours for over a year.  It has been a difficulty of the Northern Government for over a year, and the Northern Government, if anything, have a far greater grievance than we have, because they have no control whatever in the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act.  It is a reserved service, and the veterinary surgeons <Col N="3105" /> in the North are English officials. When cattle are slaughtered in the Northern landing places they get exactly the same treatment as our cattle. We put up this problem in connection with the passing of the 1922 Act.  We put it up since, and the Northern Government have been doing the same thing.  Our position is that we will not pay for cattle slaughtered in England, whether they are slaughtered within ten hours or ten weeks.  That is our simple position in the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the ultimate solution of this problem will be, but I do know that we should not prejudice it by anything which we might do at this stage.  It would be very short-sighted, to my mind, for the Farmers' Party or any other party in the Dáil to let it be understood that we were in any circumstances in favour of paying for Irish cattle slaughtered in England.  I know that is not the view of the trade.  In negotiations various offers may be made and we may have to accept them, but my one point is that at this stage we should not attempt to admit any liability, and we are admitting no liability.  There is no reason, because, after all, all that is involved is £5,000.  That is the maximum.  It is the amount of liability during the worst outbreak that ever occurred in England, and if the figures for the last thirty years are examined it will be found that a sum of about £7,000 would be a sufficient fund completely to cover this risk for a period of about thirty years.  For the sake of that £7,000 should we make admissions which would lead us into a liability perhaps of £700,000?  The cattle trade should not force me to make an immature offer. There is time to agree and time to differ. If we get a decent offer we will accept it, but it is a sorry state of affairs if a trade which controls twenty to twentyfive millions, for the sake of £7,000, forces me to make a proposal before the time is ripe for a proposal.  That is the position, and, with all respect to the Farmers' Party, there is no answer to it, and I think the trade themselves realise that.  I am not saying now for a moment that we will get all we want.  I may have to come here after conference with the British and Northern Governments <Col N="3106" /> and admit that I did not do as well as I thought.  At least our hands should not be weakened beforehand, and if it is a fact, as it is, that there are three or four small farmers who have lost five or six thousand pounds worth of cattle, probably all the cattle they had, we are not to blame.  Arrangements at least should have been made by the trade to meet such a contingency three or four years ago.  I admit with Deputy Wilson that insurance is not the way.  It ought to be easy for the trade to collect five or six thousand pounds out of a yearly trade of twenty-four or twenty-five millions.  That would give people time to consider the matter.  If it comes to dealing with it ourselves, I would be against the State paying and against insurance against a risk like this that is so casual.  Foot and mouth disease may break out this year, may not occur again for ten years, then may come on again, and during all those outbreaks there may be no cattle slaughtered at the ports.  Insurance is not the way to deal with that.  The way to deal with it is to raise a fund of £5,000, put 2d. a head on all the cattle going out of Ireland and ask a man, say, shipping sixty cattle to give you 10s.</P>

      <P>As this matter has been discussed at full length, I will not detain the time of the House very long. I brought this motion forward at the request of the members of the livestock trade for the purpose of bringing this matter to a head, because both the farmers and exporters of livestock considered, unfortunately, that the Government had been very dilatory up to the present in not announcing its intentions regarding the situation, which is a very unfortunate one for the men engaged in the livestock trade in this country.  Deputy Myles struck the nail on the head when he said that up to the passing of the Free State Act no such thing as this could happen.  People were safeguarded in exporting livestock from Ireland to Great Britain, but immediately after the passing of the Free State Act this situation arose. The Minister for Agriculture denies that.</P>

      <P>The Treaty was signed on the 6th December, 1921.  The Importation of Animals Act removing the embargo on Canadian cattle was passed in 1922, but previous to the passing of these Acts the same regulations, so far as the removal of animals from Great Britain to Ireland, existed and applied to this country.  After the passing of the Free State Act lairages and landing stages in Great Britain were looked upon as a &ldquo;No Man's Land,&rdquo; so that the position to-day, that is the position of exporting of livestock to Great Britain is a very precarious one. As regards the feeling in the trade, the Minister says, and we, all of us, know that there is great difficulty ahead of us in this matter.  I would be very sorry in anyway to do or say anything that would militate against the Minister in his dealings with England and the Northern Government in this matter.  But I say that we never had a cleaner bill of health than we have at the present time.  Sir Stewart Stockwell, <Col N="3108" /> the Chief Veterinary Inspector of the Board of Agriculture in England, said that his impression was this, that under present arrangements thousands of head of cattle were held up in Ireland at the ports, yet he was satisfied that the disease did not originate in Ireland.  Since he was in the Ministry since 1905, only three cases, I think, were discovered in Ireland, and in one of these cases the origin of it was traced back to England, and he went on to say that the trade was worth £75,000,000.  I suppose he meant the home and the export trade.</P>
      <P>Now, the position is that here in this country we have one of the cleanest bills of health of any country in the world so far as livestock trade is concerned. Yet, we cannot get into a country at the present time which is plague-stricken.  I say that our Department of Agriculture must stand up and must tell the English Board of Agriculture that we cannot stand this treatment from them.  The trade do not object to compensating the owners. We are told to insure, but if we insure the tax is certain to fall upon the farmers.  Deputy Johnson said that if insurance was put in force the tax would fall back upon the farmers and on the dealers.  The dealer would take care to take the amount that he would have to pay into account when buying, and he is not going to pay the amount out of his own pocket, and thereby suffer a huge loss.  The farmers and the dealers both say that it is the State that should compensate the same as formerly, and before the Act of 1922 was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I think we should refer to in connection with this question.  We all know that the pillars of the State were shaken and that it was very dangerous to try to develop a trade such as the huge live stock trade that existed, and we know that many engaged in that trade during the trouble took great risks and took their lives in their hands and risked their money, and we also know that if it were not for them things would be in a very much worse condition than they were.  Instead of doing anything to antagonise these men the Government should try to secure their hearty co-operation.  Whatever is <Col N="3109" /> going to be done should be done quickly, and I think the Minister for External Affairs, together with the Minister for Agriculture, should approach the British Government at once upon this matter. If you are going to have an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country it is going to put the tin hat on the people.  I remember the outbreak of 1912, when we had three million pigs in this country, and we suffered huge losses.  In the present instance the traders lost more than £100,000, though the Minister talks about £5,000. What about the cattle held up at the ports until they are examined for this disease?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made it clear that £5,000 was for loss in connection with this.  There is another loss, a much bigger figure, caused by the holding up of cattle at the ports and failures to enter the counties and so on, as I pointed out.</P>

      <P>If the figures could be got it would be found to be something like £100,000 of loss, and the English Board of Agriculture should not be allowed off of their responsibility in this matter.  We know it is not an easy thing to go to these people and say these things are not managed as they ought to be.  We know they are our masters in a sense&mdash;they are the buyers and we are the sellers; but where we have a trade like this, which is the principal industry in the country, some attention should be paid by the Government to have this matter settled once and for all.  I desire to say that in view of the fact that the Minister has promised to do what he can, I do not intend to divide the House, and would ask leave to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>When this debate was adjourned I had, contrary to my previous intention, intervened to offer some observation on the course of the discussion.  I have frequently abstained from intervening in discussion here lest I should impose an impression of legalism, or what is supposed to be the narrow legal view, on the debate of matters which seem to me to require the political, the ethical or the economic outlook.  Yesterday I had intended to impose on myself the same self-denying ordinance, but having left it to the laymen I found that the debate had become more wrapt in legal mystery than if, perhaps, I had intervened.  Deputy Johnson delivered a speech on the highest plane upon which the subject should be approached &mdash;the big view of policy and of our national status and dignity.  Afterwards other elements were introduced, and there came forth from bags concealed behind back benches portly volumes with very fresh margins, and snatches from legal text books, taken from their context, were dropped here into the debate, and led, in my view, to a complete misunderstanding of the whole situation.  Now, if Deputy Esmonde should devote his future career, or any part of it, to the practice of the law, one of the things he will come to guard himself against is legal text books.  Having had some experience, I speak with some bitterness on the subject.</P>
      <P>There is hardly such a thing as a legal text book, or a sentence in a legal text book such as we have been treated to here, which does not require, on examination, qualification and modification by reference to practice, usage and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Johnson's observation more especially applies to this very subject of international law, because there is no such thing as international law.  Deputy Esmonde does not seem to have discovered that yet.  You have groups of <Col N="3111" /> countries bound by Treaties, with certain sanctions attached, and as between these countries there is a kind of obligation analogous to law.  You have Treaties which exist among members of the League of Nations and which have the sanctions of the Covenant of the League of Nations.  There you have something analogous to law. But international law really is made up of two things.  It is made up of the usages which have developed in international relationships, and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>A moment ago the Attorney-General said that there was no such thing as international law.  Now he says it is made up of two things.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the inverted commas to the words &ldquo;International law&rdquo; are not visible in my oral remarks.  The thing that is called international law is made up, on the one hand, of the usages that have grown up, particularly since the time of Grotius, and of the opinions of text writers.  These opinions of text writers are of two kinds.  They are either an analysis of facts, common facts of international life, or they are the opinions of the particular writer as to what should prevail.  They bind no one.  They are not law.</P>
      <P>In this matter of Treaties, I think I have read most of the classical writers upon the subject, certainly the American writers.  I would advise my friend Deputy Esmonde to have more regard to the American writers, who are usually people with diplomatic experience in a big way, rather than to the temporary holders of chairs at Cambridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Attorney-General that I have studied the works of the principal American text writers on this subject under the tuition of the late President de Valera, in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>That accounts for a lot.  My friend, Deputy Esmonde, quoting from the gospel according to the prophet Oppenheim, stated that certain things were essential <Col N="3112" /> to treaties.  Now, like other gospels, extracting other passages, he could prove the opposite proposition, and the fact is that as regards the form of treaties, there is no such thing as an established form of treaty.  A treaty may exist orally; it may have been created orally, and it may have become ratified by conduct without written ratification.  I think the safe propositions, having regard to classical writers and classical opinions upon the subject, that one can make about treaties are something on these lines.  First of all, it is well to remember that they are contracts, and that in dealing with them and discussing them they are commonly examined from the point of view of contracts between persons, and usage has not prescribed any necessary form of international contract.  A valid contract may exist between two nations as soon as one of the nations has signified to the other the intention to do, or to refrain from doing, some particular act, conditional upon the other party agreeing on his part.  Between the binding force of informal contracts without any legal technicalities at all and the binding force of the most magnificent document drawn up in the most flamboyant language and with the most grandiose titles there is no difference, once you have concluded a contract, ratified and agreed to, between two international parties. Consent is usually negotiated by agents and ratified by principals.  That is all that is required.  Now, that is in essence the actual position as regards treaties, and all this talk about a preamble being essential and so on, is a kind of grammatical analysis manufactured by some text writers.  No preamble is essential; no form is essential.  What you want is substance, agreement on the substance of the terms of the thing that is set out in these articles.  As regards ratification, at an earlier period when sovereigns, in the full, old-fashioned sense existed, it was doubtful whether any ratification was necessary.  Ratification is now a matter of usage, regarded as an implied necessity in all contracts, but more particularly where the United States happens to be a party to the contract, because the treaty-making power in the United States is not vested in an individual; and applying the ordinary <Col N="3113" /> principles of contract when one man deals with another he is supposed to ascertain whether the other party can or cannot conclude the bargain.  So is it between nations.  It is assumed that a nation, like the United States, knows that the President of the United States cannot alone conclude a treaty.</P>
      <P>Under the American Constitution the treaty-making power is vested in the President, but can only be concluded with the advice and consent of the Senate.  One may refer in passing to a remark made here last night by Deputy Davin.  In our Constitution there is no reference to the question of treaty-making. As a matter of fact, in the Dominion position the last few years have seen a remarkable development.  It would have been very foolish to have attempted to take a thing that was in process of growth and to stereotype it in our Constitution.  From the year 1917, certainly, the individual participation of the individual Dominions in the conclusion of treaties was recognised more and more, until it was, one might say, finally established within very recent times indeed.  The position that the Executive Council has taken is this. It has come here to the Dáil and submitted the substance of an agreement which has been negotiated with its knowledge and has asked approval for an agreement in those terms.</P>

      <P>For ratification, for approval of its being a party to and advising the ratification of those terms.  It seems to me that if we get rid of all this stuff that has been taken from text books and bandied about here; if we approach this matter by, say, adopting the two amendments that stand, one in the name of Deputy Duggan, the other in the name of Deputy Magennis; if the Minister would insert these in his original motion, if the Dáil so agreed, we can get away from a maze of technicalities and a discussion of a kind that leads nowhere and get down to the substance of the actual heads of agreement, which is the only thing that matters.  I put it to the Minister that he should ask the Dáil to permit that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3114" /> There is one other matter that arose in the discussion to which I would like to refer.  It is the use of the term &ldquo;Dominion.&rdquo; I rather gathered that a number of Deputies were under the impression that the word &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo; was used in the sense of a sovereignty in Great Britain over the other members of the Commonwealth.  What may have been the origin of that idea I do not know.  But if the thing is examined historically it will be found that that is not so.  I think the first use of the term &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo; in this connection was in the case of Canada.  When the Canadian Constitution was being moulded the original proposition was that there should be created a Kingdom of Canada.  The contiguity of the great Republic of the United States suggested to the people who were responsible for remodelling the Canadian Constitutional position&mdash;possibly also some idea of the Monroe Doctrine&mdash;that the idea of setting up a Kingdom on the Continent of Northern America might be unwelcome. It appears that the word &ldquo;Dominion,&rdquo; which was chosen in substitution, was actually chosen by the Canadians themselves.  It is generally stated that it is not known from what source or from what individual it actually came.  But in a recently published book by a Canadian judge it is stated as a fact that the term was borrowed from the Psalms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a legal text book?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a text book which states at its maximum the present point of growth to which the Canadian constitutional and international status has reached.  He does say that the term &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo; was suggested by an expression in one of the Psalms, &ldquo;Dominion from sea to sea,&rdquo; and that it meant, not the Dominion of Britain, but the Dominion of the Canadians themselves.  He shows how that idea has been carried on since the year when the North America Act was passed, down to the present time, and how it has been recognised, in several decisions of the Privy Council in which it was raised, that &ldquo;British Dominion&rdquo; does not mean&mdash;and this goes back for a number of years &mdash; any <Col N="3115" /> subordination.  It means the dominion of the occupants of what had been these British territories over their own territories and within their own territorial limits.  It means and implies absolute sovereignty; sovereignty as great as the sovereignty of Great Britain within its own territory.  This Judge&mdash;Mr. Justice Riddell &mdash; points out that the position of a Dominion, while up to a certain point it was territorial, has now extended even into external affairs. There is no question as regards the power to negotiate commercial and trade Treaties abroad.  As regards political Treaties, he shows the development until Treaties which affect Dominions are now recognised as involving the participation of the Dominions themselves as sovereign nations in the negotiation and conclusion of them. This may be a slight divergence from the strict letter of the amendment, but I refer to it because I think it is important to remove, as it will appear on the records, any suggestion that the use of the term &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo; implies any other dominion than our own dominion over our own country.</P>

      <P>Be it resolved that whereas Articles of Agreement for a Treaty respecting the regulation of the Liquor Traffic outside the territorial waters of the United States of America (where of the tenor appears by the Schedule hereto) were signed at Washington on the 23rd day of January, 1924, on behalf of the President of the United States of America and His Majesty subject to ratification, and</P>
      <P>Whereas the provisions of the said Articles of Agreement for a Treaty affect the interests of Saorstát Eireann and it is expedient that the same should be ratified in respect of Saorstát Eireann,</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (Mr. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was on Friday last I moved this motion in its original form.  At that time I explained that the Government placed this proposed Treaty before the Dáil exactly as we received it, and exactly up to the point that we approved of it. After that a great deal of discussion waged round a so-called Preamble which had only come to the knowledge of the Executive Council after it had approved of the Articles contained in the Treaty.  In moving the motion at that time I gave some history of the progress of the negotiations which went on dealing with this matter.  The one point I would like to repeat is, that the American Government had urged for a long time that such a Treaty should be concluded with them, because it was extremely important that they should possess the powers allowed to them under this proposal to wage war against the illicit and immoral traffic that has been, and is continuing to be, carried on in American waters.  We feel that this, the first proposal for a Treaty that comes before the Dáil, is actually an indication to the Government of the country in which most of our fellow-countrymen at present reside, to the country in which our people are most interested, that we feel entirely with them, and that we are anxious, not merely not to hinder, but as far as we can to assist them in putting down any traffic in their country which the American people consider is detrimental to the American nation, or to the people of America.  Inasmuch as prohibition is the law in America, I think we have no option but to agree <Col N="3118" /> with America that that law should be maintained, and that all powers, no matter how full and drastic these powers may be, will be put in the hands of the American Government, to see that their law is maintained.  I do not wish to delay the Dáil by going over the general terms as I did about a week ago.  I have much pleasure in proposing this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the terms of the Treaty itself I would like to put in a word of dissent from Article 1:</P>
      <P>The High Contracting Parties declare that it is their firm intention to uphold the principle that three marine miles extending from the coastline outwards and measured from low-water mark constitute the proper limits of territorial waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Saorstát Eireann is asked to enter into an agreement with the United States of America relating to the protection of the American States from the irregular importation of alcoholic liquors, and we are asked to agree with this Article, which says: &ldquo;It is our intention to uphold the principle that three marine miles from the coast constitute the proper limits of territorial waters,&rdquo;  I think we should demur.  Whether our demur should go so far as to vitiate the agreement that has already been entered into by another country with America or not I shall not say, because it may imply interference with the actual embodiment of the intentions of the Treaty itself.  I think we ought not to allow it to pass that we are firmly convinced, or that it is our firm intention to uphold this principle of the three miles limit.  I understand it is the desire of the American Government that this limit should be extended, and I would hope that it is the desire of our Government that this limit should be extended beyond three miles.  In such a case I suggest it is not beyond the requirements of the decencies that we should inform the American Government that we would be very pleased to enter into an agreement with them, and with nations generally, with regard to the extentions of the three miles limit. For Ireland I think there is no case to be made for limiting these territorial waters to three miles.  Our interests in <Col N="3119" /> this matter are largely the interests of fisheries.  A number of countries would be glad to agree with us in this matter. and perhaps eventually would be able to make a new international compact regarding the limit of territorial waters. If we do agree to this Treaty proposal we should at least indicate that it is not our firm intention to persist in upholding this principle.</P>
    <P>We only do it more or less as a formal matter for the purpose of bringing the present agreement to a rapid conclusion, and to conform to the requirements of this particular agreement.  I would much prefer, of course, if it were practicable, that we should delete Article 1. I am not sure that it is practicable.  At any rate, we should let it be known that we do not desire to maintain this three-mile limit, and we do not wish it to go forward that we are in disagreement with the American Government in their desire for the extension of this limit.</P>
    <P>Another question arises, which I hope the Minister will be able to explain. That is, if we agree to this contract we are using these terms for a period of at least a year.  The British flag and private vessels under the British flag &mdash; British vessels in all cases&mdash;are referred to. That, again, may be subject to new Acts of the Oireachtas that will, I hope, be accomplished before long, and the British flag here will mean the Irish flag.  The Articles of this Agreement appear to have been drawn up without reference to the desires, wishes and intentions of the Executive Council of the Saorstát.  They have been drawn up in reference to the desires and wishes of the British Government, and latterly they have been referred to the Saorstát for approval.  It is asked now that we should approve of the tenor of these Articles.  With, shall I say, the demurrer that I have made, I would agree to approval being given to these Articles, but I would hope we should have from the Minister an assurance that there will be conveyed to the American Government the view that the three&mdash;miles limit ought to be extended, and that, so far as we are concerned, when we use the term British flag it is merely temporarily and provisionally, and that we are rather interested <Col N="3120" /> in vessels which will carry a flag representing the Saorstát.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know upon whose behalf Deputy Johnson speaks. I object to the extension of the three-mile limit by a hair's breadth.  He certainly does not talk on behalf of the United States Government, nor on behalf of any other government of the world whose men go down to the sea. The contention of the United States Government was really that the limit for the purposes of this Prohibition Bill&mdash; and that may be quashed in a year or two &mdash; should be extended to twelve miles. Really, outside the United States Government, it was done upon the initiative of the Liverpool shipowners, the owners of fast steamers, running with passengers to the large American ports. It was a very great inconvenience that they should be held up for hours within the three-mile limit, while the Custom officers rummaged their ships from end to end.  They considered that it was a greater convenience, both for the passengers and the owners, that the officers should come on board twelve miles off the coast, go through the bills of lading, and do as much rummaging as they wished while the ship was steaming into port, which would take about two hours. I certainly object to the extension of the three-mile limit.  I would not like to be held up a hair's breadth outside the three-mile limit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Johnson that the three-mile limit is an anachronism.  It is a survival of the past.  It was, originally created because that was the utmost range which a gun on the coast could carry.  The country was supposed to have control of the waters they could command by artillery, and three miles was fixed.  Now the range of artillery has increased to such an extent that instead of the three-mile limit, if you were to follow that principle, you would have to have a fifty-mile limit, and that would involve many problems.  There would be, I suppose, between here and Holyhead, waters that would be both English and Irish territorial waters, and the French territorial waters would lap the cliffs of Dover.  It is obvious that <Col N="3121" /> that standard can no longer be maintained. Therefore, what the limit should be is simply a question of expediency.  But it is a question of expediency that affects not merely Great Britain and the Saorstát, not merely the British Empire and the United States, but every country that has a sea coast.  It affects China; it affects Peru.  That being so, I would suggest to Deputy Johnson that surely the proper tribunal to take up this matter is the League of Nations.  If on balance, taking into account Deputy McBride's objection, and taking into account the views of the Ministry of Fisheries, we find it desirable to urge an extension of the three-mile limit, the place we should do it is the Assembly of the League of Nations. Unfortunately the United States are not represented there, but if they found that assembly was doing useful work in dealing with questions in which they were interested, it might possibly be a lever to induce them to come in.  I hope that the Minister for External Affairs will take that point into consideration and not merely enter caveats in connection with this Treaty.  I hope he will consider the great advantage we should gain, if it is an advantage, by taking an independent line in this matter and bringing it before the League of Nations for consideration.  With regard to the other points, I think, on the balance, this is an advantageous agreement. Deputy Johnson spoke of a desire &mdash; a desire which I share &mdash; to see our ships with our flag differentiated from the British ships and the British flag, but I would remind the Dáil that there can be no greater handicap in the way of establishing our own marine under our own flag than the suggestion in the United States that that marine is likely to be used for rum-running and purposes of that kind.  Therefore, it is directly in our interest to accede to this agreement, and I hope the Dáil will do so.</P>

      <P>I will not discuss this question of the three-mile limit. I admit it is a matter of controversy. Deputy McBride seemed to imply that there was general agreement amongst <Col N="3122" /> all nations in this matter.  As far as my information goes, the majority of States are opposed to the three-mile limit.  France, Italy and the South American Republics are anxious for an increase.  The suggestion that it is a universally accepted rule of international usage &mdash; I believe law is out of the question&mdash;I think does not altogether hold water.  With regard to the general question of the Treaty, I myself was almost delighted in discussing the amendments yesterday that we succeeded in so rattling the Minister that he produced quite a respectable statement with regard to the status of this country.  I think the Dáil should congratulate itself on having extracted that statement, particularly from such a phlegmatic Minister.</P>
      <P>I have been seriously indicted to-day by the Attorney-General, who alleged that my case was based upon legal text-books.  I maintain that I based my case not on text-books, but on what I claim to be commonsense.  I only quoted text-books in support of my original contention, which, I maintain is based solely on commonsense. We have had statements both from the Minister and from the Attorney-General that there is no such thing as international law.  I do not think that that is the kind of statement which ought to come from responsible officers of a small, non-military State.  It is in the interest, in my opinion, of small States such as ours to foster and encourage the development of international law, because they have no military power to defend their rights; they have only the power of law and of custom and of those international conventions which have been decided upon by the Great Powers of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I maintain, on the contrary, there is such a thing as international law.  I maintain that the relations of States are governed by definite rules, which can only be described as law&mdash;by definite rules which have grown up in the same way as municipal law, either by custom, as common law, or by conventions, as statutory law, in this country. I submit that it is in the interest of this country, particularly, to foster the growth of international law, and not to revert to the position of the <Col N="3123" /> cavemen in the relations of one State with another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">

      <P>I submit that there are sanctions beside sanctions of the League of Nations; that there is the sanction of the general consent of the civilised communities throughout the world.  That is the sanction on which international law is based.  I have been accused of suggesting that there are certain parts which are essential to treaties. The two parts of treaties which I maintain are essential are, in the first place, a statement as to who is making the treaty; and, in the second place, the signatures to the treaty at the end.  I maintain that if there is to be a treaty, one must know for whom the treaty is being made, and between what States. It is for that reason &mdash; I think it is commonsense&mdash;I have maintained that the preamble to a treaty, stating between whom the treaty is made, is an essential part of a treaty.  The Attorney-General referred to ratification, and to the original or former opinions of jurists that ratification was not essential.  In the first two days of this debate on the original motion, the Minister talked about &ldquo;a treaty which we were going to ratify.&rdquo;  At a certain moment the Government changed their minds and decided it was not a treaty&mdash;it was &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty.&rdquo; There was no treaty.  They suddenly discovered, in the middle of the debate, that the former intention that we were advising the ratification of a treaty was not correct.  In view of the fact that the King, in his act of ratification, will describe that act as ratifying the treaty which was concluded and signed on the 23rd January, I prefer to follow the opinion of the King himself as to what he is doing rather than the opinion even of the Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to support this Treaty because it affects the interests of Saorstát <Col N="3124" /> Eireann.  What exact interests of Saorstát Eireann are involved?  This is a Treaty dealing solely with British ships &mdash; with ships sailing under the British flag.  We have no ships going to America either under the British flag or under an Irish flag.  The Minister stated, then, I understand, that we might have ships sailing under the British flag and, consequently, they would come within the terms of this Treaty, and that if we do have ships in the future which might sail under the British flag, then they would be prevented from bringing liquor under seal into the United States territorial waters.  I maintain that that contention is absolutely groundless.  According to the terms of this Treaty, no matter where a ship is registered, if it is sailing under the British flag it is entitled under this Treaty, whether we approve its ratification or not, to bring liquor under seal within the United States territorial waters.  That contention is borne out by the fact that in 1911 Great Britain signed a Treaty with Japan which dealt with the privileges or rights of Japanese and British subjects and with ships and goods in the Japanese and British Empires, respectively. The Commonwealth of Australia withdrew from that Treaty. And what was the result?  The result was that although Japanese subjects had not the same rights in Australia that they had in Great Britain, still Australian citizens and Australian ships, in their capacity as British subjects and British ships, had the same privileges in Japan as the citizens and ships of Great Britain.  It was definitely decided, as a result of that Treaty of 1911, that no matter what portion of the Commonwealth withdrew from the Treaty, the Treaty had to be carried out in the letter and that any ships or any persons, so long as they were described as British ships or British subjects, had the same rights under that Treaty, whether they were registered or whether they were resident in Australia, in England, in Canada or in any other portion of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, my contention that this Treaty in no way affects the interests of Saorstát Eireann, and that it <Col N="3125" /> is in no way necessary that it should be brought before the Oireachtas for approval. Furthermore, I maintain that in approving of this Treaty we are setting a most dangerous and, I believe, most lamentable precedent which you will only realise later.  Here is a Treaty which does not concern us, which we did not initiate, which we did not negotiate, and which we did not sign, and it is brought before the Oireachtas for approval.  What is the result?  That when we are making a treaty which only concerns us and does not concern Great Britain, when we are making a treaty which we initiate, and which we negotiate, and which we sign solely for our own interests and solely concerning our own interests, that treaty can be put before the British House of Commons for approval of ratification or for rejection.  I maintain that is a most dangerous precedent that we are setting, and in support of that we have the statement of Mr. McKenzie King in refusing to accept responsibility for the Treaty of Lausanne when he states, as quoted in the &ldquo;Freeman's Journal,&rdquo; of April the 4th: &ldquo;We take the position that while we have not been represented and are not signatories, the Treaty does not impose obligations on Canada and that, therefore, it is unnecessary to ask Parliament to ratify it.&rdquo;  Well, the Executive Council may aver in this particular Treaty that we are considering at present, Canada did ratify it, but they ratified it, as I understand, under protest.  They ratified it because if they did not they would be placed in a very difficult legal position, in view of the fact that they have very many ships going under the British flag between Canada and the United States, and from the statement in the Canadian House of Representatives by Mr. McKenzie King, Canada is entering into separate negotiations with the United States to deal with the matter of liquor-running between Canada and the United States, both on land and on sea.  This ratification has only been a provisional ratification in order to tide over the short time before Canada makes a definite and separate agreement with the United States to deal with this matter.  I raised my first objection to this Motion in order that the <Col N="3126" /> Dáil should have all the facts before it came to a decision.  I did so in order that, if possible, the full text of the instrument should be placed before the Dáil, in order that, in taking its decision, if the Dáil decides to approve of the ratification of this Treaty, they will do so with full malice aforethought.  I think I have nearly succeeded in getting the full facts of the situation.  We have had statements from the Minister and from the Attorney-General which have thrown a lurid light on what was happening, what the actual situation was between our Government and the British Government before this Motion was put down.</P>
    <P>I will briefly recite the order of events leading up to that particular situation in which we are placed today, and the Minister can correct me if I say anything that is not as I describe it.  In the first place, we have heard from the Minister that the British Government sent over to him, or to the Irish Government, the Articles of the Treaty as they appear on the Order Paper, without the signatories, and without the Preamble stating between whom the Treaty had been made.  As I understood the Minister, he said that the Government had been asked to place these Articles before the Oireachtas, and that they had agreed to do so. Then we find that the British Government sent over, or by some other means the Irish Government came into possession of, the full text of the instrument as it was signed.  Then we find that the Minister, possibly in confusion of mind and possibly not, went to the Attorney-General in order to put his Motion in form before the Oireachtas.  Now, the Attorney-General is not a sovereign State; he has no decision in this matter. It is the Minister who makes the decision. The Minister was faced by a situation in which he had already agreed to put these Articles before the Oireachtas, and then he got the full text of the instrument which, in the opinion of the Attorney-General, was such that the Dáil could not approve of the text of the whole instrument as it was signed.  The Minister was placed in a dilemma, and the result was that this present Motion appeared on the Order Paper, as amended.  There were <Col N="3127" /> suggestions that a confidence trick had been played in the Dáil.  I am a charitable person; I always impute the highest motives to everyone, and I do not suggest definitely that there has been any confidence trick.  But if there has been, then that same confidence trick was played upon the Minister before he tried to play it upon the Dáil. To crown the whole situation and to bear out my whole contention in this matter that the Minister was placed in this ridiculous situation, and then tried to shoulder his responsibility on to the Dáil, he circulated this preposterous document, the first circulated to Deputies, very appropriately on the morning of the 1st of April.</P>
    <P>If that is not a sufficient reason for Deputies voting against this motion, I do not know what will satisfy them.  I maintain that the Minister has definitely transferred his responsibility in this matter from himself to the Dáil.  He was faced by the situation, as I understand has been admitted, that he undertook to put the text, without the preamble and the signatures, before the Dáil, and then the full text arrived.  He has put to the Dáil the duty of solving the problem which he has refused to solve himself.  In my opinion what he ought to have done when he got the full text was to write to the British Government stating that it was obviously impossible to place such a document as that before the Dáil, in view of the term &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and so forth.  He did not do that.  He was confused in mind, in view of his first undertaking to place the Articles of Agreement before the Dáil, and therefore he shelved it on the unfortunate Dáil, which, had I not brought up my amendment, would have been in absolute darkness as to the whole situation.  He shelved on the Dáil the responsibility of solving the difficult point with which he was faced, having agreed first to put certain Articles before the Dáil, and then finding that the full text was not before the Dáil.  That is my contention, that the Minister has devolved his responsibility in this matter on the Dáil.  Therefore I do not see how, by any possible consideration, this can be considered as a matter of Government <Col N="3128" /> confidence.  It cannot be, in view of the fact that the responsibility of solving this problem is upon the Dáil, not upon the Minister.  The Minister has refused to take the decision, but has left it to the Dáil; and it is for that reason that I would appeal to Deputies, irrespective of party, not to approve of the Treaty, which, I believe, does not in any way affect our interests.  We would be making fools of ourselves by approving of a Treaty that has nothing to do with us.  I believe, furthermore, that we would be setting a very bad precedent by approving of a Treaty which does not affect us, seeing that treaties which only affect us can likewise be discussed and approved or disapproved of in other Parliaments of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to Deputies not to approve of this motion, and I appeal to the Government if possible to withdraw it, in view of the ridiculous situation in which the Dáil has been placed. I am not interested in the King's titles. That is not the matter.  The matter is as to who are making this Treaty; between what States this Treaty is being made.  That is not a question of King's titles at all: I do not care if the King is called Emperor of China.  I am only interested in knowing what this Treaty is going to be described as.  By the League of Nations and the American Senate it will be described as a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland on the one hand, and as a Treaty of Great Britain with America we have no objection to it.  We have no interest in it, as it only affects British ships.  We have no ships, either under the British flag or the Irish flag, and even if we had ships under the British flag they would be covered by this Treaty, irrespective of what we do.  If we had ships under the Irish flag they would not come under this Treaty, and we would have to have a separate Treaty for ourselves.  I feel that during the last year or two members of the Dáil have not been sufficiently alive to their duty in standing up for their rights won under the Treaty of the 6th of December.  If Deputies are not prepared to stand up for the international position that this nation has won at the cost of so much sacrifice; if they are <Col N="3129" /> not prepared to defend the rights of our people wherever they may be, then I say, thank God, the nation will find other Deputies and other representatives who will defend that position and uphold those rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I possibly attributed more information to the Deputy than he possesses.  He quoted the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911. To begin with, the status of those nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations, has radically changed since 1911.  In 1911 there was a Treaty between Britain and Japan. Australia refused to fall in with that; that is to say, she refused to give what was given on the British side to the Japanese, and the Japanese, as a mere act of generosity merely because she did not want possibly to create machinery to differentiate, actually allowed the same privileges to Australians as were allowed to the British. <Col N="3130" /> That Treaty was not based fundamentally on a reciprocal arrangement, as this Liquor Treaty undoubtedly is, inasmuch as Australia received but did not give.</P>
      <P>The Lausanne Treaty, to which the Deputy referred, had, as he knows quite well, attached to it a regime for foreigners, an agreement which specifies most clearly that no rights will be given to foreigners in Turkey which are not given to Turks in the countries administered by the Governments adhering to it.  Deputy Esmonde knows perfectly well that this liquor Treaty is essentially reciprocal.  This liquor Treaty is roughly this: that in consideration of American ships being allowed to search foreign ships up to a certain distance from their coastline, the American Government will allow the ships of those nations that agree to that to have liquor under seal; it is a reciprocal arrangement, and it is ridiculous to say that we can be bound by any Act to which we are not parties. If, as the Deputy says, whether we concur in this or not makes no difference, whether we have ships carrying liquor or not, that is a definite attempt to misrepresent entirely the constitutional position of this country.  The Treaty of 1911 was made at a time when the constitutional position of the nations forming the British Commonwealth had not reached the stage which it has now, and independent of that it was merely slackness, or generosity, as I suggest, on the part of the Japanese Government not to insist on the full reciprocal arrangement being given by Australia, inasmuch as Australia got the benefit of it.  Unless we concur of our own free will as a definite act in any Treaty which is negotiated, signed, and ratified, the sovereignty of this State which, as I said yesterday, is unquestioned and unquestionable, necessarily means that we are not bound by any such agreement unless we concur in it. The Deputy's statement is that we are bound by agreements to which we are not parties.</P>

      <P>I think enough has been said about the Preamble to this Treaty and the position of the King, and I will not touch on them.  I think it furnishes one very good reason why this Treaty and its obligations should be left to the parties directly concerned. However, I would like to make a few points against its ratification by the Dáil.  To begin with, the Treaty is a dishonest document from beginning to the end.  It settles nothing.  Deputy Cooper, I think, said it was a bad solution of a difficult situation; but I do not think so.  In the first place, the United States does not recognise the three miles limit, although she agrees in Clause 2 to the three miles limit; but, if she does, why does she in another clause insist on extending her territorial jurisdiction three or four times beyond this limit?  In the second case, England does not recognise the American limit.  She has always insisted on the three miles limit against all and sundry.  She does so formally in this Treaty, although it is quite evident that the American insistence on her rights of search drives a coach and four through Clause 1 of the Treaty, and makes it absolutely nugatory.  The real facts of the case are that England has always asserted the right of search in any position, and she has always asserted that territorial waters extend to the three mile limit out to sea at low water. She has made one exception, and that is in the case of Ireland on the Irish Coast.  In the case of the Shannon Estuary, she has on more than one occasion insisted on the twelve mile limit outside low water.  That is a very important point for us in discussing this Treaty.  That is the English point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point of view which is the world's contention, and that is that territorial waters extend twelve miles out to sea at low water.  The whole world, with one or two insignificant <Col N="3132" /> exceptions, has always accepted that doctrine against England, but England, wielding the big stick, has always been successful in maintaining that the three miles limit constitute territorial waters.  That was all right until another big stick came into the world.  There are two big sticks in it now, and this Treaty is the result. There are two big sticks contending for two different contentions relating to territorial waters.  This Treaty is merely an effort to avert what must come later on, a conflict over territorial waters. I agree with Deputy Johnson on this matter, that we should wait for the findings of an international court or conference to settle this matter of territorial waters.  It may be contended that we are not very much interested in this Treaty.  It may be so, but certainly I believe that we would be very much interested in some of its consequences. I believe that we are among the three principal naval powers of the world&mdash; France on one side, England on the other, and America on the other&mdash;and I believe that if ever there is a naval war Ireland and the Irish seas are going to be the cockpits of the world. Therefore, I say that this subject of territorial waters is of the very deepest interest to us, and, pending an international conference, we should not commit ourselves to any view on this question. We would only compromise ourselves if we do.</P>

I appeal to the Dáil in the interests of the country and in the interests of Irish fisheries, and also in the interests of the Irish people who may have to come into contact with one of these big naval wars that we should refuse ratification to this Treaty, and leave it to the people who are directly concerned in it.</P>

      <P>I am courageous enough to take the risk of the uninitiated. I do not know whether Deputy Magennis will be as sympathetic to me as he was to another on another occasion. I approach the question of this Treaty from a different angle entirely to the one that seems to be kept in view here by other Deputies.  We listened yesterday to declarations as to the sovereignty of the Irish nation.  Whether these declarations were made here or not, Ireland is a sovereign State and was a sovereign State before the 6th December, 1921, and whatever comes to this State, Ireland, I am sure, will still retain its sovereignty.  The point that I have in mind in the making of this Treaty is that from the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs, Ireland did not exercise her sovereign rights in arranging the terms of this Treaty.  I do not think that it is constitutional usage that a sovereign State will permit an ambassador or a foreign representative of another State to make an arrangement with a third State, and when those two high contracting parties come to an agreement, that the first sovereign State will sit down and, after discussion, sign the agreement that these two high contracting parties made between them.  It may be all right to say that the Ministry was daily kept informed of what went on, but I do not think that that should be the method of a sovereign State in dealing with matters that are really very vital.  This is a very vital matter.  It establishes a precedent, and if that is the method by which these highly constitutional issues are to be arranged in the future I think that it is not really standing on Ireland's sovereignty.  It is not really maintaining that we are a sovereign State with an absolute right to make any treaty we think is necessary and possible for us to make.  There may be a good deal in the argument that this Treaty is advantageous to America, and there may be something in the argument of Deputy Cooper that it may be of advantage <Col N="3134" /> to Ireland to accept it, and it may be to the advantage of an Irish industry from which a considerable quantity of Irish liquor is exported, but would it not be the straight way, Ireland being a sovereign State, to go directly and make a treaty with the United States?  Certain delicate matters over our representative in America might have made that difficult, but if there is necessity for this treaty I think there is no great urgency, and it could be held over until Ireland's direct representative would have made this Treaty direct. Now, I think on that point, that it would be a fatal error for the Dáil to lose sight of it.  I am positive that whatever the Dáil decides on this matter the sovereign people of Ireland will still maintain that England's representative has no right or mandate to make a treaty for us, and that we have nothing to do in the making of that treaty, but we have been told to-day what are its contents and how the negotiations proceeded.  As to the form of the treaty I do not know.  With the exception of the words &ldquo;Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and the amendment introduced by Deputy Magennis, I see no words to indicate that it has reference to Ireland or to the Saorstát at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see very many words that indicate that the Treaty has been made for England and England mainly, and when we come to the words in the body of the Treaty which tell us that His Britannic Majesty agrees, I do not think that ought to have any place in any treaty that is made between Ireland and a foreign power, other than England.  I cannot see where it could be in any treaty made between Ireland, and a foreign power other than England.  I quite appreciate the fact that the Minister for External Affairs may have felt that under the circumstances, and because of the fact that America was anxious that this Treaty should exist, that he should be prepared to assist the American Government in this matter.  I think Ireland must be considered herself, and I think that the sovereign status of the Irish nation is really at stake in this Treaty, and in the decision taken in this Dáil.  I do not think the Minister has made any effort to gainsay the point that this Treaty was really signed by Sir Auckland Geddes on behalf of Britain.  It was signed on <Col N="3135" /> behalf of Britain by Geddes.  He said that unless we agreed to it here there are no obligations imposed on us by this Treaty.  I think the Minister could very well afford, and the Dáil could afford, to wait, and I do not think America will put on considerable pressure until the time comes when Ireland's direct representative will be in a position to sign a treaty directly with America.</P>

      <P>That reference was repeated once more by Deputy Baxter, and I am represented by another Deputy, Deputy Heffernan, in the Official Reports, as trying to stifle the free expression of opinion in so far as my individual protest could.  I think I am entitled to resent any such insinuation as that.  I quite agree with what was said by Deputy Wilson, that any other Deputy has a right to get up and express his point of view on any matter, and nothing must be reserved for specialists, or people who think they have a right to monopolise discussion on any particular subject.  I quite agree <Col N="3136" /> that every Deputy has a right, and did not seek to intimidate anyone from a free expression of whatever opinion he may have formed by whatever method that accident or design may have formed it for him, but I do, and I think I am entitled to, protest against the free expression of ill-considered opinions, more particularly when they are heralded with the announcement that they proceed from imperfect information. It was against the declaration of this type that &ldquo;although I do not know much about this subject,&rdquo; or, in the case where this originally arose, &ldquo;although I have not read the report completely, yet,&rdquo; etc.</P>

      <P>I expect nothing but those disorderly interruptions. It has become a practice in regard to me, and I think the Deputies who indulge themselves in those interruptions should learn long before this that they cannot effect the purpose which they design.  I am not so easily put out as to have the continuity of my discourse broken by disorderly interruption.  I was about to point out to you, Sir, that Deputy Baxter is a further example of those who rushed into a discussion of this sort, and expect to be reported in the Press, where those more ignorant than themselves in the matter will very naturally conclude that a thing cannot be utterly erroneous, cannot be wholly wrong, and the result is that they are, whether they intended or not, joining in &amp; propaganda that can have no other result than interfering <Col N="3137" /> with the stability of the Free State. I do not suggest that it was intended for that purpose, but it requires one to make a claim to no powers of divination or prophecy to foretell that that would be the inevitable result.</P>
      <P>Now, a great deal of the, I will not say heat, but energy, fervour and zeal that has entered into the discussion on the subject which has been wasting the time of the Dáil for the last few days is due, unquestionably, to the idea in the backs of the heads of certain Deputies, that because the King's name is mentioned in the Treaty and in the Constitution, that in some way the liberty of Ireland, or her international status, is being jeopardised, and that we are to conceal the fact that there is any reference in any of our instruments of Government to the Crown or to the King, or to the same function or the same relation under any other name.</P>
      <P>At the risk of being attacked again for deprecating the attempt to instruct the public without a serious effort on the part of the teacher to be well-informed himself, I would declare that the association of ideas, a very hateful association of ideas in the Irish mind between the names &ldquo;British Empire,&rdquo;&ldquo;Britannic Majesty,&rdquo;&ldquo;British citizen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;British flag,&rdquo; is allowed to operate in 1924 as if all the things denoted by these names were precisely to-day what they were in 1914.  I am waiting for someone on the back benches to ask am I in order.  What was the British Empire in 1914?  It was a single State in the eyes of every international court.  There were English possessions, or more correctly, British possessions, British meaning here Great Britain which is England and Scotland. Those Dominions with which Ireland is given under the Treaty equal status, were practically self-governing Colonies, struggling, and consciously struggling, under heavy odds, into the position which they now occupy of being States with international recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with those who object to the title &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and I will enter upon that later, if time will permit; but the point I wish to deal with for the <Col N="3138" /> moment is the point that has been raised specifically by Deputy Johnson a few moments ago.  Let us see the facts as they are, and clear our minds of prejudice and cant if we can.  The British Empire that existed in 1914 is as extinct as the Dodo.  Because these tremendous changes, great revolutions in point of constitutional relations, have been effected under our very eyes, not in ten years, but since the outbreak of the war, or rather since 1917, there are people who are absolutely blind to the facts and to the significance of the facts.  Burke speaks of people who are retrospectively wise, people who can understand the history of a past century and remain grossly ignorant and unobservant with regard to the great historical events of their own day.  Just as we have many of our fellow-countrymen in most inexplicable blindness of the fact that Ireland is now a nation among the nations.</P>
    <P>With your permission I would recite briefly the history of the changes since 1917 that have determined the present status of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  In that way we would be better able to appreciate what is the meaning of the phrase in Article 1 of the Treaty &ldquo;the high-contracting parties&rdquo; and still better able to understand what is meant in Article 2 by &ldquo;His Britannic Majesty&rdquo; and the &ldquo;British flag.&rdquo;  Because, I suggest, to begin at the end, his Britannic Majesty does not mean King of Great Britain and Ireland as used in that official title, and the British flag does not mean the English flag.  That is my thesis, and it may take a little time and, therefore, a little indulgence on the part of the House to enable me to reach it as a conclusion.</P>
    <P>I have taken the precaution of writing down the more important documentary evidence for my purpose, so that no one shall accuse me of depending on my memory merely, and of falsifying the documents through misquotation. That is one of the usual methods of impugning my arguments here.  I begin with the document handed in to the Imperial Conference in 1917.  It was drafted, I believe, by that great statesman, Sir Robert Borden, who has done more than any other man to assert, and <Col N="3139" /> to develop what he had asserted, as to he claim of his country&mdash;of Canada&mdash; to be a nation among the nations.  At the period at which this document was written there was an Imperial War Cabinet, and various negotiations went on with regard to the separate expeditionary forces from the different portions of the Empire.  It was agreed that the adjustments of the constitutional and political position should be deferred until the termination of the war, but what I am about to read out declares the terms upon which the Prime Ministers of the various Dominions were willing to postpone the consideration of these political readjustments: &ldquo;They deemed it their duty&rdquo;&mdash;in this context I should explain that Prime Ministers mean the Ministers representing the Dominions&mdash;&ldquo;to place on record their view that any such re-adjustment, while thoroughly preserving all existing powers of self-government and complete control of domestic affairs, should be based upon a full recognition of the Dominions as autonomous nations of the Imperial Commonwealth, and should recognise the right of the Dominions to an adequate voice in foreign policy and in foreign relations, and should provide effective arrangements for continuous consultation in all important matters of common concern and for such necessary concerted action founded on consultation as the said Governments may determine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the culmination of the constitutional developments, so far as relates to the connection between the Dominions and the so-called United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, was the signing of the Versailles Treaty in June, 1919.  You will see that after a very slight interval, a bare two years, what is claimed in that document is actually realised in practice, and I think those who, like Deputy Grattan Esmonde, have disordered conceptions as to the nature of a Treaty and the relation between the signing and the ratification of a Treaty, would do well to consider these facts.  The various Ministers representing the Dominions at the Peace Conference in Paris acted <Col N="3140" /> as plenipotentiaries, and they signed the Treaty of Versailles in the name of the Dominions that they respectively represented.</P>
    <P>I have taken down particularly the words used with regard to the Canadian part.  They are these: &ldquo;Concluded and signed on behalf of His Majesty for, and in respect of, the Dominion of Canada.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I call this the culmination of the constitutional developments, not in itself, but taken in connection with the significant facts and the significant acts that accompanied it.  What are these facts?  Pressure was being brought to bear by France, for instance, upon England, and, through England, upon various other co-signatories, for haste. Lord Milner suggested that the signing of the Treaty by the Dominion Plenipotentiaries might be taken as equivalent to ratification.  That was suggested on account of urgency as a method of saving time.  Sir Robert Borden replied to that in a form of memorandum, which was really an ultimatum.  In diplomatic matters things are not always called by their proper name. The memorandum was drawn up by Sir Robert Borden, and put in on behalf of all the Dominions, and was more particularly urged by General Smuts on behalf of the Union of South Africa.  This memorandum claims for all the Dominions equality of nationhood; requires the abandonment of the old procedure, by which the British Government&mdash; under this context that means the Ministers of the English Crown operating in Downing Street and in Westminster&mdash;acted on behalf of the Self-Governing Colonies and Dependencies, should be abandoned, and a new practice set up which would put each Dominion on an equal footing with the United Kingdom, or with any other of the signatory nations, and in that connection any other of the signatory nations mean France, Italy and the rest. The British reply to this insistence upon the principle of freedom and constitutional equality was given by Lord Milner, who had been the high priest of Imperial federation, to which all this is utterly opposed&mdash;this doctrine of cooperation on the part of free and constitutionally <Col N="3141" /> co-equal nations in a combination or Commonwealth. Here is Lord Milner's reply. It was published as a Command Paper: that is, it is an official statement on behalf of the English Government.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Peace Treaty recently made in Paris was signed on behalf of the British Empire by the Ministers of the self-governing Dominions as well as by the English Ministry.  They were all equally plenipotentiaries of His Majesty the King.&rdquo;  They were all equally plenipotentiaries of His Majesty the King who was &ldquo;the high contracting party for the whole.&rdquo;  I think that explains the term &ldquo;high contracting party&rdquo; as used in Article 1 of the Treaty.  They were all equally plenipotentiaries of His Majesty the King, who was the high contracting party for the whole Empire.  That is the procedure.  Lord Milner goes on to illustrate the new conception of the Empire which has been gradually growing up.  The United Kingdom and the Dominions are partner-nations, not yet, indeed, of equal power, but all of equal status.  Now that is a very important pronouncement.  In fact, I might say it is impossible to overrate its importance, and yet in connection with this constitutional development there is another fact to be mentioned which is not less important. In the British document, which states what happened at the framing of the Covenant of the League of Nations, these words were used.  I am quoting from an English Parliamentary paper: &ldquo;Thirty-two allied and associated Powers, signatories to the Treaty of Peace.&rdquo;  There is no differentiation there between one power and another. Canada, the Union of South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and so on are signatories. They are referred to here in this official Parliamentary Paper as the thirty-two allied and associated powers, and the associated powers referred to, of course, include the United States of America who are signatories to the Treaty of Peace.  Now, a very interesting thing, to my mind more interesting in some respects than any of these, is the attitude taken up in the beginning of the League of Nations with regard to the application of those Dominions to be received into the family of nations.  In <Col N="3142" /> the first draft of the covenant there was no separate representation for the Dominions partly because there were still die-hard Britishers at work who believed rather in Imperial Federation and who resented this tremendous growth of liberty and co-equality on the part of Canada and the Union of South Africa and the others.  There was ignorance on the part of some of the European countries&mdash;stark, crass, crude ignorance, such as prevails in Ireland for example to the present hour with regard to this matter. That ignorance was heightened and intensified by the suspicion that England was putting in her Colonies under the guise of being separate nations in order to multiply her own vote in the League of Nations' decisions.</P>
    <P>Time and enquiry brought a change of mind through illumination and enlightenment, and at the second stage &ldquo;the status of complete nationhood was internationally recognised.&rdquo;  That is a quotation from General Smuts in a farewell letter that he wrote on leaving England.  He was challenged in his own Union of South Africa Parliament by General Hertzog and others &mdash;for they have their Irregulars, their extremists and fanatics there also.  He was asked if the registration of the Union of South Africa in the League of Nations was not really that of a dependency of England, and his answer was: &ldquo;We are absolutely independent of England; we have equal status, with group unity.&rdquo; Now that happy phrase of General Smuts&mdash; whom, by the way, because he was a wiser man and a man of broader views than Mr. de Valera, it is the custom to regard in certain circles in Ireland as a sort of traitor to the cause of freedom&mdash;indicates what the ideal was amongst those Canadians and Australians&mdash;who, unlike us, have no past history of unhappy memory, but look to Great Britain; that is, England and Scotland, as a mother country&mdash;to have freedom of nationhood and cooperation of group.  The group unity is for them marked by the fact that what was once the British King&mdash; King of Great Britain and Ireland&mdash; has become the Crown of the Commonwealth&mdash;the Commonwealth Crown&mdash;<Col N="3143" /> and the mark and symbol of Commonwealth unity is the Crown.</P>
    <P>Here is a quotation from one of the principal documents issued by Sir Robert Borden, and it is backed up by another, which will have more authority with Deputy Johnson, because when I appealed to an English coin he preferred to have the inscription on a Canadian coin:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Crown is the supreme Executive in the United Kingdom, and in all the Dominions, but it acts on the advice of different Ministries within different Constitutional units.</P>
    <P>That declaration is the key&mdash;if I am not mixing my metaphors&mdash;to the solution of many things that are difficulties for people who confound the King of England with the permanent and hereditary President of the Commonwealth of free nations, and who cannot understand what the new character of the British Empire or British Commonwealth has become, and the altered relation of the Crown to the various Executives.  When the Prince of Wales had returned from one of those little expensive excursions which, for political and social reasons perhaps, he occasionally is made to take, this document was issued&mdash;I am quoting now from the London &ldquo;Times&rdquo; of December 19th, 1919&mdash;&ldquo;The King is the Constitutional Sovereign of the Empire...&rdquo;&ldquo;Empire&rdquo; is the word used, it will be remembered, in the first Clause of our Treaty as the equivalent for the Commonwealth, although I am sure Deputy Grattan Esmonde, who is so fastidious for exact fact in all its minutiæ would distinguish between the Empire and the Commonwealth.  In our Treaty and in this document from which I quote, the Empire is the synonym for the Commonwealth&mdash;that is to say, for the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and so on, including the new arrival, India, with a measure of development which, I do not think, we are quite able to appreciate as yet through the fact of India being more a continent than a country.  This declaration with regard <Col N="3144" /> to the Prince of Wales' tour was&mdash;</P>
    <P>The King, as the Constitutional Sovereign of the Empire, occupies exactly the same place in Canada (I would ask the special attention of Deputy Wilson to that) and in the whole British Empire as he does in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>That is to say, he is the head of the Executive. That is the position with regard to the other elements of the Commonwealth previous to the making of the Treaty with Ireland.  I desire to emphasise that very strongly&mdash;that between the years 1917 and 1921 Canada has developed from being a self-governing Colony, striving, occasionally with success, now and then with only partial success, at other times with considerable failure, to assert nationhood, or Statehood rather, and becomes a cosignatory with France and other countries, on equal terms, of the Treaty of Versailles, and enters in her own right into the League of Nations.</P>
    <P>Now I turn to our own Treaty for a moment, and I notice that it is headed in the Schedule to the Constitution as &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;  It will probably interest Deputy Grattan Esmonde to read in the Preamble to the Act enacting our Constitution these words, on page 83 of the volume that was handed to all of us on becoming members of the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The said Constitution shall be construed with reference to the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland set forth in the Second Schedule hereto annexed (hereinafter referred to as `The Scheduled Treaty').&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course Deputy Grattan Esmonde would prefer to read Oppenheim and foreign works.  He has not time, perhaps, to read our own enactments.  However, that is by the way.  In our own Treaty, Article 1 declares that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland shall have the same Constitutional status in the community of nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, with a Parliament <Col N="3145" /> having powers to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Ireland, and an Executive responsible to that Parliament, and shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Article opens with the name &ldquo;Ireland,&rdquo; which is not a merely geographical expression, but an expression that has its place and significance in history.  Ireland, historically and geographically, is declared to have the same Constitutional status in the community of nations as all these others.  I have just now read to you from Lord Milner, and from other documents, what is the precise Constitutional position of these.  I shall no doubt be told that legally we must go back to the British North America Act of 1867 and there find a number of things.  It then becomes necessary to dwell on the difference between legal right and Constitutional right.  Again, I quote from General Smuts, who, when the point was put to him by General Hertzog, and when he was asked a variety of questions as to what South Africa could do, said: &ldquo;It is not a question of what is legal, it is a question of what is constitutional.&rdquo; Sir Robert Borden, founding upon the man who was the real maker of the nationhood of Canada&mdash;an Irishman named Blake&mdash;has put in the most unmistakable language, which has been accepted everywhere, this difference between legal right and constitutional position, constitutional power and constitutional right.  The important thing is Article 2:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position of the Irish Free State&mdash;that is, Ireland, the historical and geographical Ireland&mdash;in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern the relationship to the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Consequently, what the Crown is for Canada so long as that Treaty operates the Crown is for the Irish Free State. Article 12 of this Constitution and Article <Col N="3146" /> 51 set out the relation of the Crown.  By Article 12 the Crown is a component of our Executive.  It is the depository of executive power if at any time we had no Executive Council.  I would direct special attention to Article 51, more particularly as it was dwelt upon, I see from a newspaper report yesterday, by Deputy Johnson.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Executive Authority of the Irish Free State ... shall be exercisable, in accordance with the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the exercise of the Executive Authority in the case of the Dominion of Canada by the Representative of the Crown.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Crown in all these cases in relation to the Executive and legislature of the various units of the community of free nations is the Commonwealth Crown.  That requires to be named in international documents, and the name known to international jurists and known in all the diplomacies of the world is His Britannic Majesty.  His Britannic Majesty in 1924 is the Crown, as the Crown figures in these various Constitutions, and the British flag is the flag of the Commonwealth.  I have no doubt that there will soon be an Irish flag to indicate the statehood and sovereignty of Ireland.  But pending that, this description, for the purpose of Treaties entered into, is the only available form of description, and has to be used.  I believe that is exactly the same reason why this objectionable term is employed in the Treaty, or in the Preamble, as Deputy Grattan Esmonde loves to call it, to this Liquor Traffic Treaty.  The objectionable title is used not, I believe, because of any love for it on the other side of the water as something to insist upon to our annoyance, or even to our detriment, but simply because for the time being it is the recognised name, and there is no other.</P>
    <P>We, at any rate, through the amendment which was graciously accepted by the Minister to-day, are taking steps to bring under the notice of all whom it may concern that we regard that as an incorrect description of the present facts.  While it is the term employed, His Britannic Majesty and the British flag are not to be interpreted in any <Col N="3147" /> narrow sense.  Deputy Baxter treated us to his view of international relations and constitutional practice.  I should be very glad if we could make international law according to our own desires. Unfortunately, we live under a system of things in which the individual wish and the working out of realities are very frequently in conflict. All the time that Irishmen uttered the aspiration, &ldquo;Ireland a Nation,&rdquo; and sang Davis's poem, &ldquo;A Nation Once Again,&rdquo; what we were craving for, and what we were demanding, was that position of independent statehood, that position which President Cosgrave as the incarnation of Ireland's bodily presence was able to assert and to receive international recognition for when Ireland was registered amongst the League of Nations and entered into the family of nations.  &ldquo;A Nation Once Again&rdquo; was the aspiration for that. According to Deputy Baxter, Ireland was always a sovereign nation.  Will he forgive me if I say: what a confusion of thought!  A sovereign nation is as much a thing of definition as, say, an internal combustion engine.  An internal combustion engine is a thing of definition.  Deputy Davin is, unfortunately, not here or he would quote me the conventional definitions, or the terms by which they regulate traffic and tariffs upon goods on the railway lines.  They differentiate between goats and pigs, tortoises and insects.  Ireland was not a sovereign nation when she was being dragooned by England, and her laws made for her in an alien Parliament. Ireland was not a sovereign nation when the taxes raised from her were imposed upon her in an alien Assembly, and collected practically at the point of alien bayonets.  The very fact that it was English law and English police systems, English codes, under an English Viceroy, that regulated our lives is the test fact of sovereignty in regard to these international and constitutional matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Baxter is confusing the inextinguishable sense of nationhood that survived amongst the Irish people, and the determination of every right-minded Irishman that he would assert that right at all costs.  That is a very <Col N="3148" /> different thing from the technical position of having secured the recognition of statehood.  We are now what Deputy Esmonde called technically &ldquo;international persons.&rdquo;  That is to say, just as every person is equal before the law under English law, in this international code a soverign State, or a State that is recognised so far as to be received into the family of nations, at the League of Nations, is a person. And they are equal.  Whatever conventions may regulate intercourse they are all entitled to.  Surely to have achieved that is worth a great deal.  Why is it necessary to belittle the achievement?  Why is it necessary to befog our minds and the minds of those outside this Assembly by harking back to language and connotation of words which are completely out of date, as dead as Queen Anne, although so recent?  Now what is there in this that is so objectionable, that time that ought to be devoted to constructive work has been spent upon it? It would seem as if we were gathered together here to make a public exhibition of the shortcomings of our information on things which our constituents have a right to expect that we have informed ourselves upon.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I would like to be made a little clear on the actual situation at the moment.  If there is to be any vote taken I would like to have it made clear what the vote will be taken on. Yesterday I stated that I was anxious to know if Deputy Duggan's amendment was accepted, whether Deputy Magennis' amendment would be ruled out.  I stated at the time that Deputy Magennis' amendment more or less met my point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is contingent, of course, on the Minister in his reply proving to my satisfaction, at any rate, that it is necessary that we should ratify those Articles of Agreement.  I want to be satisfied, and I am sure he will satisy me on this portion of it: &ldquo;Whereas the provisions of the said Treaty&rdquo; (which now reads &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&rdquo;) &ldquo;affect the <Col N="3149" /> interest of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  If and when I am satisfied that our interests are concerned in this thing my course is clear, but the amended motion which has been accepted and passed round this evening is not exactly clear.  I think that there is another alteration necessary, because there was an amendment accepted to-day which inserts &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty,&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;Treaty.&rdquo; In the last paragraph of Deputy Magennis's amendment the same word is used.  It occurs in the phrase, &ldquo;As one of the parties to the Treaty.&rdquo; Something is missing there.  I was anxious with regard to that because it appears to me if that amended motion is accepted by the Dáil we would hear no more of this, and that is the end of it. On Friday last the responsible Minister stated: &ldquo;We have not yet discussed the terms of the preamble&rdquo; (it was the Executive Council I expect he was referring to) &ldquo;which only reached us at a later day, and which Deputy Esmonde will be relieved to hear,&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After that he went on to say: &ldquo;The Dáil is only asked to be committed to the terms of it,&rdquo; and then he goes on to say: &ldquo;It leaves it perfectly free to the Executive Council to take up with the British Government the terms set forth in the preamble which we only received at a later date.&rdquo; Later on he said: &ldquo;At the present moment the Dáil is only asked to assent to what it has before it, and assenting to that leaves it open to discuss the meaning of that preamble.&rdquo; I would like if the Minister would make the position quite clear.  If the Articles of Agreement have been passed&mdash;if that be the case&mdash;and that our interests are concerned in this matter, my course and the course of the other people concerned will be equally clear, and we will know what to do.  I agree with the last speaker that there are three days wasted on this, but if the matter had been properly handled at first, and if the amendment, which was reasonable, had been accepted, we would have the full document before us, and in three or four hours the whole matter would be discussed and straightened out.  I want to place it on record that I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind that the withholding of the preamble was a deliberate <Col N="3150" /> effort on the part of the Minister or Ministry to blindfold, as it were, this Dáil.  I am thoroughly satisfied of that in my own mind, and I think it right to put it on record.  The whole matter appears to have been muddled in a very bad way.  As a matter of fact they had to split up the amendments.  The Attorney-General yesterday made that very clear in his opening remarks&mdash;perhaps he let it slip&mdash;when he stated the purpose of the amendments, referring to the two which were in different names entirely. Of course it is quite clear to-day when the amendments have been accepted.</P>

      <P>There are two points to which I would like to draw attention.  The first is a statement made here by some Deputies concerning the three-mile limit.  I do not know what were the sources for the international miscalculations or misquotations that were made.  But the facts are that Great Britain, the United States, Japan, Germany, Holland, Belgium, Portugal and Austria have a three-mile limit and are recognised. In the case of Spain, they claim six miles.  It is an old-standing claim for all purposes.  In Norway, Sweden and Denmark the extent of the territorial waters claimed is four miles for all purposes.  That is also an old-standing claim, mutually recognised by the three countries named, but not by other powers.  In Norway and Russia it is 10 miles in the first and 12 miles in the second case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware. Perhaps the Deputy could inform me himself.  In any case, they recognise it.  I think some part of Austria touches the Adriatic, or did touch it. France has the six miles, but they accept three miles as the exclusive fishery limit for the North Sea and the English Channel.  Italy has ten miles for control of merchant vessels <Col N="3151" /> under the law of 1912.  Greece has ten miles put forward in 1913, but that was apparently not agreed to.  Uruguay has five miles, Ecuador 12 miles, and Colombo 12 miles.</P>
      <P>Strangely enough, in one particular document it is mentioned that somewhere about 1793 the French captured an English vessel off the American coast, and as it was claimed by the Americans to have been within the three mile limit, the French yielded the vessel.  I mention those things for the better information of Deputies who may not be acquainted with them, because I am sure Deputies do not like to make statements not in accordance with the facts.  I would like to mention that the chronological statement made regarding the Articles of Agreement was not quite correct.  This matter came before me first last year, as President of the Executive Council.  It was either in the late spring or the early summer, I cannot remember which.  It is a matter which does concern this country, and the proposals put forward are proposals which have been put forward by the United States Government.</P>
      <P>It does affect this country by reason of its manufactures&mdash;those alcoholic beverages which are now anathema in the United States.  The United States have that right and it is our duty to respect that right and to accommodate that Government.  It is for that purpose the Treaty is put forward here. It has been asked, What is the interest we have in it?  We have this interest: although at the moment we may have no shipping, it is very unlikely that we would have shipping registered here in this country unless there was such an understanding as is arrived at in these Articles of Agreement.</P>

If, when we get our ships, we are going to wait another year, or if we then have to wait another year before we negotiated a Treaty, during that year our shipping would be at a disadvantage.</P>

      <P>What has been said by the Minister for External Affairs is rather intelligent anticipation of what I was going to say.  I should say in answer to Deputy McGrath that it does not take 12 months in order to get our own shipping, and if we were to start making the Treaty now, very considerable hardship would have to be borne by the shipping companies in question.  In fact, it would be a great bar towards getting such ships if we had not this instrument ratified with the United States.  The only other thing is the last paragraph of the amended motion. The Articles of Agreement are one thing, and they are put before you for your consideration.  The Treaty is the completed document, and the particular reference here to the ornamentation of one of the signatories of the Treaty is necessary, because when signed it is the Treaty.  Previous to being signed we have only the Articles of Agreement.  I understood the Deputy appreciated that fact.</P>

      <P>Deputy Magennis is fond of censuring those people who are misinformed.  I would like to tell him that he was misinformed himself when, in the opening of his speech, he gratuitously referred to the members of the Labour Party.  I happen to be one of those Labour Deputies who do work in the sense indicated by Deputy Magennis, but I do not make that an excuse for being absent from the discussions here, or being absent from where I was elected to sit by my constituents. Deputy Magennis, and other Deputies, have spoken of this discussion as a waste of time.  I do not agree.  I do not agree that the time which has been spent on this matter, the time which has been spent in making plain to the people of this country, and to the people outside this country, what is our national status, is a waste of time.  I think, on the contrary, it is time very well spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt on a point of explanation. I did not call the whole thing a waste of time.  I said I welcomed the amendment because of the opportunity it afforded.  It is the devotion of three days&mdash;three whole days&mdash;to a thing which, as Deputy McGrath declared, could have been dismissed in four hours &mdash;that is a waste of time.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure that Deputy Magennis did not regard the whole time as a waste of time.  I am sure he did not include the time spent by himself as a waste of time, and if we did not have the three days, we would not have had the Professor's eloquent speech on the matter.  In spite of all that has been said, or perhaps because of it, I am not satisfied that I should vote in favour of this motion; and, quite candidly, I do not know why I should be asked to vote in favour of it.  I think it was the duty of the <Col N="3155" /> Minister for External Affairs, or the Executive Council, to make a case for the motion; and, as far as I am concerned&mdash;and I had a completely open mind on the matter&mdash;a case has not been made which would satisfy me that it is necessary for me to vote in favour of this motion.  That is my position in the matter.  In the second paragraph it is stated: &ldquo;Whereas the provisions of the said Treaty affect the interests of Saorstát Eireann, and it is expedient that the same should be ratified&rdquo;&mdash;that is the only reason that is given to us for bringing this motion before the Dáil, and, as I say, the case is not made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps the Minister, when replying, will dilate on that.  But I happen to have a document which is entitled &ldquo;Summary of the Proceedings of the Imperial Conference,&rdquo; at which this country was represented, and, in passing, I might express my surprise that this document has not been circulated to Deputies.  I do not know whether it is on sale as a Government publication.  It is a British Government publication.  It contains matters of very great interest to Deputies.  One of the sections of this Summary deals with the negotiation, signature, and ratification of Treaties. I think it was most important, before the consideration of this motion, that that should have been circulated to Deputies. It says that the &ldquo;principles governing the relations of the various parts of the Empire in connection with the negotiation, signature and ratification of Treaties seem to the Conference to be of the greatest importance,&rdquo; and a Committee was set up, of which our Minister for External Affairs was a member, to go into the matter, and they came to an unanimous resolution. Among other things in that resolution I find that, dealing with the matter of negotiation of Treaties, it says, &ldquo;Before negotiations are opened with the <Col N="3156" /> intention of concluding a Treaty steps should be taken to ensure that any of the other Governments in the Empire likely to be interested are informed, so that if any such Government considers that its interests would be affected it may have an opportunity of expressing its views, or that its interests are intimately involved, of participating in the negotiations.&rdquo;  If we are interested under this Treaty I would like to know, first of all, if our Government, considering that its interests would be affected, did express its views, or did set forth any views with regard to its special interest, or give an expression of its views to the people who were carrying on the negotiations, or if, as the President would rather seem to imply, our interests were intimately involved, they considered that it was their duty to participate in the negotiations. We have not heard anything with regard to this matter from the Minister or the Government.  If our interests were involved&mdash;and that could be the only reason for bringing forward this Motion&mdash;it was the duty of the Government to give those who were negotiating, on its behalf evidently, the benefit of their views as to how those interests should be protected; either that, or if our interests were intimately involved, then they should have insisted on participating in the negotiations directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there are many other provisions in this resolution, which is a very important one, and which has a direct bearing on this Motion which is before the Dáil, and I believe that it is because of the agreement entered into on that occasion, and in pursuance of it, that this Motion is brought before the Dáil. The Minister for External Affairs indicates dissent from that statement, and, as I say, I hope that he will explain that. There are also agreements with regard to the signature of a treaty.  It says that &ldquo;Where a by-lateral treaty imposes obligations on more than one part of the Empire, the treaty should be signed by one or more plenipotentiaries on behalf of all the Governments concerned.&rdquo;  I would like to know if the Minister holds that this Treaty does impose obligations on the Saorstát.  Again, the Summary describes the usual procedure for ratification, and it says: &ldquo;Ratification of treaties imposing obligations on more <Col N="3157" /> than one part of the Empire is affected after consultation between the Governments of those parts of the Empire concerned. It is for each Government to decide whether Parliamentary approval or legislation is required before a desire for or concurrence in ratification is intimated by a Government.&rdquo;  It would appear from that that the Government would be first expected to express their desire for ratification.  That may not be the interpretation, but it seems to me the natural interpretation to put on that paragraph.  &ldquo;It is for each Government to decide whether Parliamentary approval or legislation is required before a desire for or concurrence in ratification is intimated.&rdquo;  It seems, then, that unless a desire for the ratification of a treaty was expressed there was no necessity for ratification on the part of any Government concerned.  With the actual Articles themselves I have nothing to say, but I do feel that the manner in which they have been brought before the Dáil is open to objection.  I do agree very largely with the position taken up by Deputy Baxter in this matter.</P>
    <P>The position of the Saorstát was explained very fully to us yesterday.  It is a position of sovereignty and independence. We have as much right, if that position is correct, to make treaties with foreign countries as, say, France has.  If the United States was anxious, in order to carry through the laws which it has introduced in its own country, to negotiate a Treaty with Great Britain or any other power, naturally it approached those powers and asked that the Treaty should be negotiated.  If it was anxious that the Saorstát should be a party to this Treaty, naturally it would approach the Saorstát.  Has it done so?  Or if we thought, on the other hand, that it would be advisable that such a Treaty should be negotiated, it would be our duty then to approach the country with which we wished to make the Treaty, but that has not been done in this case as far as I can see. Although a sovereign and independent country, we seem to be in the position of allowing the representatives of another sovereign state to negotiate our treaties.  That seems to me to be the position.  We are certainly not in <Col N="3158" /> the same position with regard to Britain in this matter, as we would be, say, in regard to France, because if Britain makes a Treaty we come into it more or less automatically.  If France, for instance, made a Treaty we would have nothing to do with it at all.  If we are sovereign and independent our status towards Great Britain should be exactly the same as our status towards France.  As I say, I agree with the position taken up by Deputy Baxter.  I do not object to the Articles of Agreement in themselves. I do object to the manner in which the matter is brought before us for our ratification, or concurrence, and again I repeat that the Minister has made no case for the motion.</P>

      <P>With my limitations of education which did not extend much further than a penny a week at a Tirconaill National School, it can hardly be expected that I can follow all the grandiloquent eloquence and intricacies of those masters of dialectics and intellectual millionaires who have taken part in this debate.  It strikes me very forcibly, considering the state of the country, with unemployment rife, and thousands on the verge of starvation for want of work, the Dáil could surely have employed its time better than wasting a couple of days on an academic discussion on these constitutional technicalities.  The hungry man in Donegal or Mayo will scarcely appreciate the constitutional dialectics of whether the title of the King should be &ldquo;King of Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; or &ldquo;King of Great Britain and the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  It will not be much relief to his hunger to know that Deputy Grattan Esmonde scored a great point against the Government by insisting that the Minister for External Affairs should have included the preamble in this Treaty.  The preamble which the Donegal or Mayo peasant wants is the preamble of a good breakfast or a bag of seed potatoes, or the chance of earning the price of either. He is not concerned with the constitutional niceties of Treaties dealing with boot-leggers thousands of miles away from Ireland.  It seems to me that this discussion was availed of by some Deputies to let the people see their objection <Col N="3159" /> to the name of the King being introduced into this document.  I would have more respect for their views and for their objections had they made them known before they took the oath prescribed by the Treaty.  For men who took this oath now to be indulging in these antics is neither commonsense nor patriotism.  It only serves to justify the taunts of the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; and the English die-hards, that our acceptance of the Treaty was not honest, and it justifies the action of the Belfast Parliament in refusing to make any advance towards the unity of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I run the risk of earning the displeasure of my colleague by taking up a little more of the time of the Dáil.  I am also confident that the Dáil has, to a large extent, wasted a great deal of time; but I may say this: that those who impressed on the Dáil the fact that we were wasting time, were those who wasted by far greater portion of the time&mdash;and I say wasted. I listened to Deputy Magennis talking for a considerable time.  In my opinion I never heard a better argument in favour of Republicanism.  I think that type of argument and metaphysical reasoning has turned the plain people to listen to plain talk, and to try and understand matters in a plain way.  The ordinary citizen is not prepared to follow logicians through these mazes of metaphysical reasoning.  They like to hear plain facts and to deal with plain facts.  I am largely in sympathy with the statements made by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Baxter.  I <Col N="3160" /> believe the situation in connection with this Treaty has arisen largely because of the manner in which it was mismanaged by our Ministry of External Affairs.  I think, as we have authority as a sovereign State to be represented at any meetings which take place for agreement as to Treaties, that if we were represented as we should have been this question would not have arisen at all.  We have it from the President that matters were dealt with under this Treaty with which we were concerned, and, despite the fact that we were concerned, we were not represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me on that account that this situation has arisen that we are faced with an agreement for a treaty which we have either to ratify <i>in globo</i> or to refuse to ratify.  We have no power of amendment, and that is, in my opinion, a very bad thing.  A treaty might, in a large measure, be acceptable, but there might be a clause in that treaty which, taken in detail, we were not prepared to accept.  As this treaty concerns us, I believe we have no right to accept a treaty which is given to us as an accomplished fact.  I am not concerned personally with the matter of the King.  I have no particular objection to the title which is used by the King&mdash; that of Great Britain and Ireland&mdash;but I believe there are many people in this country who do object to it, and I think that strengthens the fact that it would be much better for us to reject this treaty and refuse to sanction it rather than definitely form a precedent and bind ourselves and the people of this country with such an agreement.  I need not assure the Deputies that if we do consent to an agreement which will recognise the phrase or words, &ldquo;King of Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; we will hear about it for many days and years to come, and in consideration of that, I am not satisfied that it has been proved to the House why, in the circumstances which at present exist, it is the wisest thing to accept this Treaty.  I believe we would be better advised, and I think the Minister for External Affairs would also be better advised, if he did not recommend this in its present form for acceptance by the <Col N="3161" /> House.  I think that the amendments added to this have not made it a great deal better.  With regard to the last amendment of Deputy Magennis, it is something in the nature of an oath taken with reservations.  We take an oath and then add reservations.  This reservation will not be incorporated in the treaty.  I doubt if it will be conveyed to the signatories of the treaty.  At any rate, it will not be given on the records of the country in whose municipal records it will be recorded.</P>

      <P>I confess, like Deputy White, that I have been unable to follow some of the reasoning in these arguments.  The education of <Col N="3162" /> people in this country has scarcely ever exceeded the three-mile limit, and I must confess that is my limitation.  But through the smoke screen raised around this Treaty one thing has emerged, that is, that we are either a distinct sovereign State or not.  If we are a distinct sovereign State entitled to make our own terms, why do we introduce those terms in the preamble which gives offence to certain sections of the country?  If we are not a sovereign State why not have the courage to say it?  What is the use of introducing the King into the preamble and cutting it out after?  Why should we introduce the King in the preamble and cut him out in the postscript?</P>

      <P>In the first place with regard to the three-mile limit, owing to the fact that the great naval powers of the world recognise the three-mile limit, it is effectively in operation.  It is not the result of any written or ratified treaty, but, as far as I am aware, it has come into being because it is generally accepted.  It is operative through usage and the fact that the great maritime countries do recognise it.  Article No. 1 here says, in effect, that this Treaty is not intended in any way to affect the three-mile limit, and the three-mile limit is generally recognised.  This Treaty is actually driving a coach and four through it.  This Treaty, with regard to one certain matter, at any rate, ignores the three-mile limit, but it safeguards itself in a way by saying that although we are breaking it we are asked to be regarded as not breaking it.</P>

      <P>A new one would be a matter for an international agreement. This three-mile limit is operative and effective, because the great maritime countries obey it.  That makes it the rule.  It can be altered, but there might be considerations which I have not taken into account. I have only considered it so far as it has come under my notice.  To some extent the three-mile limit has not been observed in this country.  It was actually over-ridden by the by-laws with regard to fisheries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as regards how far it affects us, unfortunately, it does not affect us as much as I would like.  Though we have a coast line, and though we export a great deal, we actually have very little shipping.  Somebody spoke about what obligation it puts on us.  The obligation it puts upon us is that, whereas the American Government has had to search ships a certain distance away from the coast without direct sanction, we now sanction it.  As a matter of fact, we are not a great naval Power, and whether we make the Treaty or not, I agree that if we send a ship over, the American Government can search that ship beyond the twelve-mile limit, and we cannot do anything to prevent that. In this Treaty, however, we say to the American Government: We agree to your doing that.  On the other hand, we are not a great ship-owning country, but we have some ships, and we hope that we will have more ships.  We are a liquor exporting country, and it is likely that on many occasions an Irish ship containing a mixed cargo, part liquor and part something else, may have two destinations, one, say, in New York and the other in Rio Janeiro.  It may want to go to New York and off-load a cargo of potatoes, and then want <Col N="3164" /> to proceed to Rio to off-load a cargo of liquor.  If we are not agreeable to accept the Treaty our ship could not get in.</P>

      <P>I differ there, because a ship registered here from an Irish port is subject to the Irish Government, except when it comes under the jurisdiction of another country when it goes into the territorial waters of another country.  I hold that if Ireland withholds from this Treaty, some arrangement would have to be made to make it clear that this Treaty does not apply to ships of Irish registration.  It is, as I say, of that importance that if we want to send in a vessel containing liquor to an American port, under this Treaty it will be necessary to put the liquor under seal and demonstrate to the American authorities that it was under seal.  If we do not agree with this Treaty, the American authorities claim &mdash;and it is their law under the Volsted Act&mdash;that that liquor has no right to be in American territorial waters, and that they have a right to seize it.  It is to that degree important to us. The smallness of its importance is only due to the smallness of our shipping. The non-ratification of the Treaty would very likely mean that it would be a hindrance to the development of our shipping.  Apart from that, it is an act of friendship to America to ratify it, and I feel that, inevitably, our non-ratification would be misinterpreted and misrepresented as a desire to use the breaking of the law in America for the aggrandisement of our citizens.  I have been told by a good authority that there are people in this country interested in bootlegging, and making money out of it. As a member of the Government, I <Col N="3165" /> wish to say that we are anxious that the wishes of the American people should be given effect to, and we would be anxious to do all in our power to discourage and prevent that immoral traffic.  I think Deputy Johnson suggested that the Treaty had been drawn up according to the wishes of the British Government, and only latterly referred to the Irish Government. That is not correct.  The first drafts were drawn up by the American Government.  There have been certain modifications and alterations since.  I could not give you in detail what they are, but Article 6 is certainly an Article of later date.  We were kept informed of every step in these negotiations. Actually, as to meeting America in this matter, we proposed it, and it was our voice that was heard in conference before the voice of the British representative.  We did make recommendations, and had there been anything in this which we thought was unnecessary and detrimental to us, we would have protested.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about the King as King of Great Britain and Ireland.  People seem to have misunderstood the point.  The objection was taken to the &ldquo;King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo; We did object to that.  I think it was Deputy McGrath who suggested that there had been an attempt to conceal from the Dáil.  There was no attempt to keep the Dáil in ignorance, but there was an attempt&mdash;there was a desire&mdash;that the Dáil should not be committed to anything which we thought it should not be committed to. That was why the preamble was omitted.  We accepted Deputy Magennis's amendment because, inasmuch as the preamble was discussed here, there might be some grounds for thinking that in giving approval to this document it would be taken as including that particular royal title in the preamble.</P>

      <P>No. We stated exactly what we approved of.  Following <Col N="3166" /> on Deputy Magennis's motion, we stated what we approved of and what we disapproved of.  It is so long since Deputy Esmonde spoke, that it seems ridiculous to refer to his protestations about the existence of international law.  You might as well say that as we are aware of the existence of ether by the phenomenon of light, so we are aware of the existence of international law by the phenomenon of war.  As regards international law, there is the League of Nations, and with that body the Irish people are in sympathy, and are prepared to give it all the assistance it is in their power to give.  Deputy McGrath seemed to think that because the word &ldquo;Treaty&rdquo; is used in Deputy Magennis's motion that that is in conflict with the terms &ldquo;Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&rdquo; earlier. Perhaps I will be allowed to explain that that is not so.  We might bring a motion into the Dáil here that the Dáil should vote £100,000 for the provision of building material for the erection of houses, and the Dáil might put in a clause saying &ldquo;provided that said houses shall have doors and windows.&rdquo; The &ldquo;said houses&rdquo; there, as the &ldquo;said Treaty&rdquo; here, is anticipatory, and looks forward to the possibility at a future date of the Articles of Agreement being embodied in the Treaty. If the House desires it, we would change that to &ldquo;to proposed Treaty.&rdquo; The Government did express its views during the progress of these negotiations, and Sir Auckland Geddes did actually act on behalf of the Irish Free State.  I think I went into that matter yesterday at some length.  It is not unheard of for the representative of one country to act for the representative of another.</P>

      <P>Diplomatic arrangements have to be put through what is known as &ldquo;la voie diplomatique,&rdquo; and I explained yesterday we have not &ldquo;la voie diplomatique&rdquo; for dealing with America, but we have taken steps to remedy that at the earliest possible occasion, and I hope it will be operative within a month or so.  Now in the League of Nations the same sort <Col N="3167" /> of thing happens very often.  The Council of the League of Nations often adopt a thing and then come forward to the Assembly of the League of Nations with the recommendation.  The individual representatives at the Assembly of the League of Nations often ratify a decision that has been recommended by the Council of the League of Nations.  In effect, that means that in the Council of the League of Nations the representatives of the four countries represented in the Council are acting for the other countries.  For instance, you might say that France, England, Japan and another country act for Ireland, Spain, Belgium, and so on; that is to say, act for them subject to their ratification; and that is exactly what has happened here.  To place the whole thing briefly, let me say: This Treaty does affect Ireland only to a limited degree, because Ireland only has a very limited amount of ships.  We think that an encouragement of Irish shipping would be brought about better by ratification than by non-ratification.  We think also that it is desirable to show America our friendly feelings towards her.  I agree that in the negotiations of such <Col N="3168" /> agreements on behalf of Ireland that a direct representative of the Irish Government should carry on these negotiations. I would agree with the assertion possibly that the sovereignty of a country exists by being exercised, and I believe in exercising the sovereignty of this country to the very fullest.  For that reason, and as an indication of that being the policy of the Government, I pointed out yesterday that Ireland will be the first country to occupy that status; that is to say, the first member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, other than England, to have a fully accredited diplomatic representative in a foreign capital.  The life of a nation is rather slow-moving compared with the life of an individual; and although some people may think that it is now more than two years since the Treaty was signed, and that we might have moved a great deal quicker than we have done, yet it is only two years, and during that time, with all our internal troubles, we have done more than any other country to push forward and to define our constitutional position by making it operative.</P>

    <P>This matter effects no change in the law in this country.  Roughly, it was decided at the Conference of the International Labour Bureau in 1921, held in Geneva, that agricultural workers should have the same right of association and combination as that possessed by industrial workers.  Under the present law in Ireland there is no differentiation, and both sets of workers have the same right of association and combination.  The Second <Col N="3171" /> Schedule merely states that workmen's compensation should operate in favour of agricultural labourers as well as in favour of industrial workers.  That is the situation in Ireland at present, and the Dáil is merely asked to recommend the Executive Council to ratify this Convention, which makes no difference in the existing law here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word in opposition to the view expressed by Deputy McBride.  I had the impression that he was one of those who in the past held the view that Ireland was more than a parish and ought to have some regard to the influence of other nations upon Ireland and of Ireland upon other nations. Apparently that was a mistake.  The <Col N="3172" /> views of Deputy McBride regarding Irish nationality were only intended to express a vague opinion without any regard to the purpose which a recognition of nationality might effect. The Convention that is now before us undoubtedly is, as he says, a formal ratification or approval of something which has to be applied internationally which already exists here.  I would ask the Deputy and all those interested in this and similar questions, to bear in mind that when an International Conference is held and proposals are agreed to that will have the effect of levelling up the most backward nations, these Conventions and proposals must be ratified by the separate countries.  But there is a very positive value to this country to have a Convention of this kind approved of by other countries which have not hitherto adopted the same kind of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard&mdash;and I do not know whether Deputy McBride will agree with Deputy Milroy and others&mdash;that there is a disadvantage and a handicap on Ireland when Ireland's products are competed against by countries having more backward conditions.  Here is a positive attempt made to level up conditions regarding labour, regarding employment in agriculture in all countries, to that level which has been attained, as is admitted, by Ireland.  Surely it would be an advantage to Ireland if these other competing countries are going to be brought into agreement in regard to the level of conditions under which the people in these countries are working?  You are lessening the handicap, and I say that is a positive value. We will find, I have no doubt, as time goes on, probably in the very near future, that conventions similar in their purpose will be brought before the Dáil with a view to confirmation.  And I would hope there will be a continually increasing number of Conventions of this kind, which are going to be approved of by those other countries, gradually raising the level of conditions to the level of the highest.  I would hope that it would be a continual improvement, and therefore that a continual succession of Conventions of this kind will be brought before us. <Col N="3173" /> I say that is a positive value, and should be welcomed by every person who feels that Workmen's Compensation Acts, and other matters dealing with conditions of labour, are a burden upon the employers in these industries.  That is alleged, very often without good ground; but once we have adopted such legislation, surely it is to our advantage that other countries which are competing should be induced to adopt similar legislation.  That is what is done by this kind of Convention, and that is why I hope Deputy McBride's belittling of the efforts of the League of Nations in regard to labour affairs will not be received with any approbation by the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like on this occasion to support in every way possible what Deputy Johnson has said on this matter.  I think the world's progress in the future rather lies in these international communications afforded by the meetings that take place through the League of Nations.  To-day it is in its infancy; but in future years, I should think and hope, that international status for the improvement of the social welfare of the people of the different countries will make substantial progress. The value of the work done should not, I think, be measured in pounds, shillings and pence.  Deputy McBride has, I think, made an ill-timed contribution to this matter.  Even on the basis of his argument, that this costs money, the Convention we are asked to ratify is dated the 12th November, 1921, and that, I think, was before <Col N="3174" /> Ireland had entered into the League of Nations at all.  I take it, therefore, that Ireland has not been contributing towards the expenses of this particular Convention.  As regards the Convention itself, the main principle is the right of the workers in any particular industry to combine.  I think that the future safety of all countries lies in the workers being educated, and in voluntarily accepting not only the benefits they can obtain by what may be called trades unions or combined effort for the improvement of their social status, but also in the steady and increasing realisation of the responsibilities they must have in connection with the countries in which they are operating.  That, I think, will be of gradual growth.  To-day we sometimes look upon actions of trade unions and of the men themselves as arbitrary and as not realising the importance of the actions they indulge in.  Let us all hope that we are marching, if only gradually, towards a more perfect state of things, when the workers themselves will realise that industrial strife is just as destructive as other forms of strife, and that in their own interests real progress will lie in the different parties joining together to make the best of things as they are.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether a sum amounting to £35 16s. was, prior to and on demobilisation, stopped from the pay of Military Policeman James Brennan, son of Mrs. Kate Brennan, Crutt, Castlecomer, because of overpayment of dependents allowance; whether the amount coming to him on demobilisation was, as a result, but £2 3s.; whether this soldier bore an exemplary character while in the service for 2 years and 47 days, and whether he is aware that, if there were an overpayment of any kind to his mother as dependent, Volunteer Brennan never signed any papers, or knew anything about his mother being overpaid, and whether the Minister will see his way to have this young man refunded the £35 16s. stopped from his payment, and which has left him without a penny on his discharge.</P>
