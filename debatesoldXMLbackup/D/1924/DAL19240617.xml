      <P>asked the President if it is the intention of the Government to hand over Keogh Military Barracks, or any of the other military quarters in Dublin to the Dublin Housing Authorities with a view to coping with the very abnormal demand for housing accommodation, and if such is intended, if he will also take into consideration the insufficient accommodation for school children in the city so that suitable buildings will be reserved for school purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided to hand over Keogh Barracks for the purpose of a housing scheme.  A proposal for the accommodation of the working classes therein is under consideration by the Commissioners for the County Borough of Dublin.  It will be open to the promoters of the scheme to lease or sell portion of the buildings, if suitable, for the purpose of providing any necessary school accommodation.</P>
      <P>As regards other barracks in Dublin, I am not at present in a position to say definitely whether any of them will be released from military occupation.</P>

That should have enabled him to meet all cases where fees to Presiding Officers and Poll Clerks were due.  There are some matters in respect to conveyance and transport in which the vouchers should be examined and where he might not have enough money.  He certainly should have paid the fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The disability contracted by Mr. Considine was not due to a specific wound or injury received in the course of duty whilst on active service.  His case does not therefore come within the provisions of the Army Pensions Act, 1923.  Mr. Considine states that he suffered a breakdown of health.  The amendment of the Act to cover cases of severe or permanent illness arising out of active service is, however, under consideration. Pending the necessary legislation, I regret <Col N="2389" /> that I have no power to entertain Mr. Considine's application, and Mr. Considine was informed accordingly on the 17th April and the 7th ultimo.</P>

      <P>A copy of such a statement was handed to me by the Deputy. I have inquired into the matter, and I am satisfied that two strikers who were following one of the Asylum workers, were required by a Gárda to come to the Asylum gate for identification, after they had declined to spell their names or give the English equivalent.  It was merely a question of identification, and it is common knowledge that on the occasion of strikes picketers frequently resort to obstruction.  One must exercise a little commonsense in these matters. In the copy of the statement signed by the two gentlemen in question, with the Irish form of their names, I note that the words &ldquo;Civic Guard&rdquo; are used, although the official statutory title of the force is &ldquo;Gárda Síochána.&rdquo;  By the time members of the Fáinne, such as one of them is reported <Col N="2392" /> to be, learn to give the police their proper Irish title and thus show good example, I anticipate that most of the Gárdaí will be able to identify people through the Irish form of their names.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the President to allow me some time to-day in which I, personally&mdash;and there may be others interested&mdash;would have some opportunity of making a statement in reference to this inquiry, the Report of which is published to-day. He will appreciate the fact that the three General Officers concerned with myself in this inquiry, have not sought any publicity of any kind in spite of a certain amount of provocation brought about by published statements and by non-published statements or whispered statements.  I do not think it is fair, in view of some things which I see in this Report which has been handed to me&mdash;or should I say, obtained by me in the Clerk's Office at a quarter to three o'clock to-day&mdash;to persons who have endeavoured to conduct themselves in the matter of this inquiry in the way in which we have, that this Report would get publication to-day, and that it would have 24 hours start at least of anything that any of us would have to say on the matter.  I am relying on the Dáil for publicity.  I do not want to go into any series of publications about this matter, but I would ask the President to realise my position at any rate, and to grant me some time this evening to make some remarks which I feel I have to make on this Report as it stands at present.</P>

I do not want in any way to interrupt the business of the Dáil, and I would be prepared to take half an hour sometime late this evening, say at the adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be a matter that requires a decision first as to the form that such statements, or shall I say, an initiation of such a discussion might take.  It might well initiate a discussion, and I would suggest that it is a matter of urgent public importance, and that we had better adopt that form, so that at a certain hour, as fixed by Standing Orders, you would take a motion from Deputy Mulcahy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that Deputy Mulcahy was anxious to make a statement, and it would be for him subsequently if he thought fit to table a motion.  I thought he merely meant to make a statement now.  If he is quite agreeable, I am prepared to allow him to make the statement at 9.30.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered that Deputy Mulcahy may make a statement, or any other Deputy may make a statement, which would be required to be followed by another Deputy's, unless it is in the nature of a personal explanation.

      <P>I feel that what I have in mind may place other Deputies, perhaps, in an unfair position. I am looking at the matter from a purely personal point of view.  I do not want the report to get a 24 hours' start of some remarks that I want to make on it.  That is really the position from my point of view.  I have no doubt Deputy Johnson will appreciate that point of view.  While I really am seeking a certain privilege in this matter, I do not want to cut across the privileges of any other Deputy.  The comments I have to make on the Report, as far as the Dáil is concerned, would be more in the nature of raising the matter on the adjournment.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that <Col N="2398" /> the procedure suggested by Deputy Johnson would be the best to adopt, because it gives 1½ hours' discussion in a normal sitting.  That would be, say, from 7 to 8.30.  If the President agrees to take the matter on at 9 that would give us to 10.30, or if it is taken at 9.30 the discussion could go on until 11.  That would be within the Standing Orders, and would give a fair opportunity to everybody to be heard. After Deputy Mulcahy has spoken it probably will be necessary for some one to put the point of view of the Committee before the Dáil.</P>

Deputy Mulcahy would have a right to half an hour after the time fixed for the adjournment.  If the President would give him an additional hour of Government time we could have a discussion from 9.30 to 11 or from 9 to 10.30.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT (Minister for Defence)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That this Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;  In doing so, I should say that I shall find it necessary to either withdraw, or modify an undertaking given by General Mulcahy last year that men would not be recruited for a longer period than two years, with one-and-a-half in the Reserve, or one-and-a-half years, and two years in the Reserve.  I have not the exact figures, but I anticipate having them before the Second Reading Stage is completed.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to recruit something like 50 per cent. for two years service, and from recollection I would say that the other figures run in the form of 10 per cent. for 12 years service, and 15 per cent. for 7 years service; 15 per cent. for 5 years service; and 10 per cent. for 3 years service, but at any rate, as far as the twelve years service is concerned, I think I am right in saying that it was 10 per cent., and in the case of two years service, it was 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, under which the Defence Forces are at present maintained <Col N="2400" /> and disciplined, will expire on the 2nd August next, and it is necessary to obtain fresh statutory authority from the Oireachtas.  It had been intended to introduce, early this year, a Bill dealing with the Defence Forces on a more permanent basis, but this was not possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes first to continue in force the Act of 1923 until the 31st of March, 1925.  It does not follow that the Act of 1923 will continue in operation until that date, because it is intended that the Bill which will be introduced in the autumn will be put into operation as soon as it becomes law.  This Bill seeks to effect in last year's Act certain amendments: (1) There is the introduction of an oath of fidelity for officers, and a change in the form of the oath prescribed for soldiers; (2) power to reduce an officer or a non-commissioned officer (3) changes in the disciplinary provisions in reference to the following matters, including (a) powers of Provost Marshal and Military Police; (b) the introduction of an accused's right to elect to be tried by court-martial in certain cases instead of having his case dealt with summarily; (c) changes in procedure on the investigation and summary disposition of charges; (d) provisions with regard to jurisdiction of courts-martial not being ousted by non-compliance with provisions as regards preliminary investigation; (e) power to order accused for trial by court-martial in certain cases without previous investigation as prescribed by the Act; (4) changes as regards forfeitures and deductions from pay of officers and soldiers; (5) change in reference to the transfer of a soldier from one corps to another.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the Minister to reduce an officer who fails to pass his necessary qualifying examination for the rank to which he was gazetted for a commission to the next highest rank for which he is qualified.  And it also enables the Minister to reduce a non-commissioned officer to a lower non-commissioned rank or to the ranks.  At present there is no power of dealing with cases of that sort, except to dispense with the services of that non-commissioned officer who might be a <Col N="2401" /> well-conducted man.  There were also some verbal amendments in the Bill. The term &ldquo;constable&rdquo; is, I think, employed under the present Act, and it is proposed to substitute the more correct terminology, that is Gárda Síochána, for that of Civic Guard.  It is also proposed to substitute the expression &ldquo;military defence forces&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;armed forces.&rdquo;  Armed forces would include the Army Medical Corps, and I think it would not be contended that that was an armed force. Power is also given to employ civilians and prescribe the term of their employment. This is principally to regulate the position of nursing sisters who are employed in military hospitals and who are neither officers nor soldiers.  I formally move that the Bill be now read a Second time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Under normal circumstances, I should wish to discuss this Bill at very considerable length, because it raises questions of the very highest importance.  It can hardly be considered without discussing the function that the Army is to play in the State, and that function is, as yet, somewhat vague and indefinite, and requires to be more accurately defined and determined.  But, under the existing circumstances, this is an Act that is to expire in little more than a month's time, and it must necessarily be replaced if the whole fabric of law in the Army is not to disappear.  That being so, I propose to reserve any general criticism that I might have delivered, till the permanent amending Bill is introduced, and I hope it will be introduced early in the Autumn Session, so that we may have a full and adequate opportunity for discussing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one point which the President referred to in his opening remarks, that is the fact that 50 per cent. of the Army are only taken for a period of two years' service.  He is very wise only to make it 50 per cent., because if you enlist any larger proportion than 50 per cent. for a term of short service, you would find it very hard to get the necessary specialists and necessary non-commissioned officers in that time. You can train an infantry soldier in something like six months, and have him effective.  You cannot train a sergeant <Col N="2402" /> in very much less than two years, and as regards artillery men, signallers, and specialists of that kind, two years is all too short a time if they are to be trained and are to be made thoroughly efficient.  I am inclined to demur, even to the wisdom of retaining 50 per cent. on a two years' service basis.  Two years service is, I think, a term taken from the conscript armies of Europe, and it is not applicable to a voluntarily enlisted army, because you take a man out of civil life and keep him in the Army for two years.  By doing that you unfit him for civil employment, and then when he is still a comparatively young man, ordinarily about 21 or 23 years of age, you send him back into civil life after having missed the two most important formative years in whatever trade or industry he was being brought up to. You send him back into civil life with only a smattering of military knowledge that is of no great value to him. It is possible to do that on the Continent of Europe, where they have conscript armies, because there everybody lacks that same formative period.  It is cut out of everybody's life whether he likes it or not.  But I believe it will place the soldier at a serious disadvantage in industrial competition here if he is removed from the labour market for two years.  It would be better, really, to remove him for a longer period, and let him make military service a career in life, and then let him get a pension at the end of it.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to hold&mdash;of course, there are arguments for and against on both sides&mdash;that our Army should be a very small army of expert men, of men having special training, with an Officers' Training Corps and organisations of that kind, and that we should provide the necessary machinery for expansion in case of need for our permanent Army, or an army regularly paid and equipped on a permanent footing.  This could be described as a system of highly expert men, of specialists in their work engaged for a long period and obtaining a pension at the end of that period.  But, on the whole, I believe that our Army must necessarily be a small Army.  I believe that would be the most economical system. I am sure, too, it would be the most <Col N="2403" /> efficient sort of army to have.  I hope, therefore, that before the permanent Bill comes up for consideration that the President, or whoever will then be occupying the position of Minister for Defence, will consider these points carefully. As I say I do not propose to debate this Bill in detail, because it is only put in as a stop gap, and under the conditions under which the Government has chosen that we are to discuss it, criticism is wasted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat at a loss to understand the purpose of this Bill.  I could have understood quite well if it had been a continuance Bill for the period that is stated as from August until March next, provided that there had been already indicated for the public consideration what the intentions of the Government may be regarding the permanent organisation of the Army.  It seems to me that we ought to be informed, or, at least, shortly informed, of what the intentions and the proposals of the Government in general outline are regarding the future Defence Forces of the Saorstát, so that by the time March arrives the country will have been informed, and will have had some opportunities for a general discussion upon the principles that should be applied in the case of a permanent organisation of the Army.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we have not merely a Continuance Bill, but an Amending Bill, an amendment of the Temporary Provisions Act.  The amendments are fairly numerous, and I looked for some explanation from the Minister in moving the Second Reading as to why some of these amendments were required.  I am not prepared to discuss any of them in detail.  I will ask the Minister for Defence to tell us whether or not everyone of these changes in the Temporary Act is, without doubt, necessary for carrying on for six months.  I would have thought that some of them are not necessary, and that, consequently, they would not have been introduced in a Bill of this kind which is purely temporary, and what one may call an emergency measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement of the Minister in this <Col N="2404" /> matter rather suggests that his mind has been made up, that the future military organisation is to be on the lines of the Temporary Act that is now in force, an Act which, bear in mind, though very long and detailed, was run through the Oireachtas without any consideration whatever or with about ten minutes' consideration in Committee. I do not know how many sections there are in that Act, but we all remember that it received no consideration whether in principle or in detail.  One gathers from the Minister's statement that the plan embodied in that general Act still embodies the intentions of the Ministry with regard to the future.  I think it would be advisable in the public interest that we should know from the Minister for Defence whether we are to assume that the scheme outlined in the Military Defence Forces Act of 1923, is the scheme which he is proposing to make permanent, so that long before the introduction of the Permanent Bill we shall have fitted ourselves for the proper consideration of such a Bill.  I think it is almost unnecessary to go into further details at this stage, but I would like the Minister for Defence to tell us quite definitely whether every one of these amendments is assumed to be inevitable and necessary for the proper conduct of the Army between now and March next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill which was introduced last year contained 246 sections, and when it reached the Committee Stage it was pushed through in about ten minutes.  It was obvious from the debate that took place on it, that the greater part of that Bill had practically been adopted from English Army Acts by a process known to editors as &ldquo;scissors and paste.&rdquo;  I take it that the main function of the present amending Bill now before the Dáil, is to change the wording of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, and merely to make it look somewhat more like a Free State Act, and also to adopt certain changes that have been required by the training of the past year in matters of discipline. The principle, nevertheless, remains the same.  I would join with Deputy Johnson in urging the Minister for Defence to make a somewhat fuller statement <Col N="2405" /> than he has made when closing the debate as to the lines which he has in mind for the more permanent force which, in his judgment, and in the judgment of the Executive Council, this country is likely to require.  We remember that last year Deputy Fitz-Gibbon and several other Deputies urged a definite form of Army quite distinct and separate from the kind of Army we have at the present moment, an Army very like that which has been practised in the British Dominions with success, and on the lines which Deputy Cooper has commended in the Dáil to-day.</P>
      <P>I think it would be right, now that Army matters are forward, and it is quite impossible to discuss this Bill in any detail pending some kind of decision of that kind, that the Minister for Defence should indicate to the Dáil some kind of decision that the Executive Council is likely to arrive at, because unquestionably there are indications in the present Bill that seem to suggest that the Executive Council has had this matter under consideration. There is only one outstanding matter in the present Bill that certainly is changed, and changed for the good. The Minister for Defence has referred to it in his opening comments.</P>
      <P>Last year, when the Defence Forces Bill was being passed, I urged that the oath to be required of the Army should be exactly the same as had already been adopted for the Civic Guard, by which every person, officer, and of the rank and file, would require to pledge himself to abstain from membership of all secret societies, and the Minister for Defence, then speaking on behalf of the Executive Council, rejected that amendment.  The amendment was proposed by me, not without certain knowledge of what was likely to become more evident in months that were to come.  These events have come to pass, and the amendment has now been adopted, providing whatever army be adopted in the future should be an army that is bound only by one principle, and that is the principle of subjection to this House and to this Parliament as representing, as it may change from time to time, the will of the people.</P>

We are pressed for time in regard to legislation, and I suppose that, if one looks for an example in the matter of being brief, one should look to the head of the Government. That was what I had in mind.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Cooper's remarks with regard to the length of time for recruitment which have been borne out during the last twelve months in our experience. Something might be said with regard to that in the amendments which we are putting up.  It has been found in practice that these are necessary.  They are necessary, I think, in the majority of cases, in the interests of the soldiers themselves, in the interests of discipline; in other cases necessary in the interests of the State, and generally for efficiency.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the question of period, I would remind the Dáil that last year it was regarded as almost a necessity that we should not recruit beyond a period of eighteen months or two years, but this year it is seen at once that if we are to have an efficient machine such a period as two years is really too short to enable people to learn this profession of arms and to be efficient in dealing with it.  Some of the speakers dealt with what are the functions of the Army&mdash;what is the policy of the Executive Council with regard to it.  I do not know that it would be possible to say what is the policy of the Executive Council with regard to the functions of the Army, nor of any Executive Council which might be called on to pronounce upon the same subject.  One has got to remember that a large number of institutions have been handed over for guarding; I think in Dublin city alone something like twenty guards have to be mounted.  They are a considerable number, absorbing a very considerable number of men, and whatever views one may have about discipline and training, it is certainly hampered very much by having to mount guard in such a large number of places.  The same thing might be said of other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the Army will depend to a very great extent upon the requirements of the State for the time being.  During the disturbed periods through which we have passed it was hoped to get the Army concentrated in particular places where discipline and training might be indulged in.  To some extent it was found that there was very <Col N="2408" /> great opposition by the people to their removal from smaller posts in outlying districts, but there has been a gradual concentration.  That concentration, however, has been offset up to this by the large number of guards which have to be put in different places. In the City and around it there are something like seven barracks, and while one might discuss what the functions of the Army might be in theory, in practice it has come down to this, that the chief business of the Army for some considerable time past has been to mount guard.  With regard to the amendments, I am not in a position to say in connection with each one as to its vital and absolute necessity, but as regards the whole of them, they have been found during the year to be necessary, and are recommended as such by those who have had experience during the last twelve or eighteen months of the running of the Army.  It would be better, I think, to deal with each of them in detail when we come to them, and I could be then in a position to give examples in certain cases, and reasons in other cases.  It is absolutely essential that this Bill should pass before the 2nd of August, because last year's Bill only runs to that date.  I am not in a position to promise Deputy Cooper that we would introduce it in the autumn, but it is our intention certainly to introduce the new measure before the winter begins.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That where in the case of persons dying on or after the 1st day of April, 1924, property situate out of Saorstát Eireann is bequeathed to or settled on different persons in succession and legacy duty or succession <Col N="2409" /> duty has, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, been paid thereon, such duty shall, for the purposes of sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1894 (which provides that property situate out of Saorstát Eireann shall be deemed to be included in property, passing on the death of the deceased only if legacy or succession duty is payable in respect thereof, or would be so payable but for the relationship of the person to whom it passes), be deemed to be payable in respect of the property on the death of each of those persons in succession notwithstanding that the whole amount of the legacy was paid on one death only, as in the case of a legacy to one person.</P>
    <P>This Resolution is necessitated by the fact that the decision of the British Courts in the case of the <i>Attorney-General v. Burns</i>, in 1923, upset, so far as Great Britain is concerned, the practice that had prevailed from 1914 onwards, and presumably if a case came before the Irish Courts, the result might be the same.  The British Government rectified the position by legislation in Section 37 of their Finance Act of last year.  The Resolution I now propose is in the same terms. The position of estate duty is that payment, so far as movable property outside the Saorstát is concerned, depends on the fact as to whether or not the legacy duty would have been payable on that property.  The custom and the law is that where property is settled or bequeathed to certain persons in succession, if the same rate of legacy duty would be payable on the property passing from one to the other, that the entire legacy duty should be charged in the first instance.</P>
    <P>If a man left, say, £10,000 worth of Guinness's shares to his brother for life, and afterwards to his brother's children, the amount of legacy duty payable on that would be charged on the actual sum; consequently, on the brother's death no legacy duty would be payable, the amount having been paid, as it were, in advance.  The practice was to regard the legacy duty as being payable on the brother's death, but as having been paid merely <Col N="2410" /> in advance, so that estate duty was charged when the brother died, and the property passed to his children.</P>
    <P>To follow the illustration, suppose a man left property to his brother in the first instance, and then to some stranger, the rate of legacy duty that would be payable in the second case would be different, and consequently in the first instance the value of the brother's life interest in the property would be calculated, and legacy duty would be charged only on that.  When he died, and it passed to the absolute possessor, who was a stranger, the legacy duty would be calculated at the proper scale and would be paid, and consequently estate duty would be chargeable. The present position is, assuming that the ruling of the British courts would be upheld here, that in the case of a man who left to his brother, and then to his brother's children, the entire legacy duty would be charged on the death of the first testator.  The estate duty would be duly paid.  The legacy duty would be charged not on the value of the brother's life interest, but on the capital value of the property passing, because the entire legacy duty would be, as it were, paid in advance.</P>
    <P>In that case, as the British court has held, legacy duty would not be payable on the brother's death, and estate duty would not be payable at all.  In the case where the property would pass first to the brother, and then to a stranger, the British court did not upset the practice, because this legacy duty would be charged in the first instance on the brother's life interest, and on his death, on its passing to the stranger, the legacy duty would again be charged on the capital sum, and estate duty paid.  So far as property situated inside the Saorstát is concerned, in both cases estate duty would be payable, but this decision which arises out of the peculiar way in which the British Act of 1894 was drafted, creates an anomaly, and causes the general rule that estate duty is payable when the property passes at death to be evaded or broken.  The resolution proposed will simply restore the practice that, as I say, has existed from 1914 onwards, and will put movable property outside the Saorstát in the <Col N="2411" /> same position in regard to liability for estate duty as property situated within the Saorstát.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is charged on the capital sum rather than on the life interest.  If the rate would vary then it would not be charged on the capital sum, but on the value of the life interest of the person to whom it passed, as I understand, in the first instance, and the remainder would be charged on the capital sum at his death. The same amount of legacy duty will be paid.  Even when the rate of legacy duty was the same the practice was to charge first on the life interest, and then on the capital value on death to the person to whom it was bequeathed in the first instance.  This clause does not at all affect the payment of legacy duty, but as the payment of estate duty depends in certain instances on liability to legacy duty it simply enables the estate duty to be recovered.</P>

      <P>This amendment was accepted by me in the Seanad in response to a suggestion that a person may be absent from his home, and on coming back to it may find that property had been seized but not actually removed; that the official act of seizure or taking custody of the property would have been complete but that the removal would not be complete and on a strict reading of the Bill, in such a set of circumstances, it was not mandatory on the sheriff's officers to produce their authority.

    <P>&ldquo;From and after the coming into operation of Part III, of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924) the under-sheriff or other officers executing the decrees of the District Court in civil cases shall, in <Col N="2414" /> the execution of such decrees have the like rights, powers, duties, and obligations as are by this Act conferred or imposed on an under-sheriff in relation to the execution of a writ of <i>fieri facias.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendments No. 2, 3 and 4 are really the same and arise out of section 82 of the Courts of Justice Act.  Section 82 of that Act provides that the future District Court decrees shall be executed, not as in the past by the police, but by the under-sheriff, and the Bill does not define the powers of the under-sheriff in doing that work.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion that this was before the Dáil I think the Minister took us by surprise, and a little consideration of the matter does not make it any more palatable.  The Minister, in explaining the provisions of the Resolution, gave us an instance where income tax payers were benefitting by the difference between the letting value of a house and the valuation. It seems to me that he is taking a very big question up piecemeal, to the detriment of a worthy class of the population, the class that own their own houses.  One would have expected in the present state of affairs that so far <Col N="2416" /> from discouraging people from becoming owners of their own houses, the Minister would, on the contrary, have encouraged people by purchasing their own houses to spread that principle more broadly, rather than curtail the efforts of people in that direction.  In fact, the whole policy adopted recently has not been in line with the Minister's proposal.  It has, as a matter of fact, been rather the reverse.  In other words, in connection with any building schemes which are in operation, the great incentive is to get people to buy houses, own them, and occupy them permanently for the good of the country generally and to help to solve the housing problem more rapidly than it otherwise would be solved.  Now, however, the Minister comes along and says that he is going to penalise people who own their own houses.</P>
      <P>This grant or allowance of one-sixth has been in operation for a very long time.  The Minister proposes to withdraw that on grounds which I think are not sound.  It is clear that a Finance Bill is not the place to open up the whole question of valuation, and it is not, in my judgment at all events, and I appeal to the House that it ought not to be, in their judgment, the proper way to deal with a big question of this sort.  What it amounts to is this.  The Minister says the valuation of the houses are too low, relative to their letting value.  That may be so, or it may not, but at all events, on the question of valuation as it stands, the important point is really this, that the valuation, as far as houses are concerned, taking the city of Dublin, is very much more up to date than the valuation of other properties which are also liable to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All over the country there is a certain basis of valuation which, as far as I know, is unalterable, and has been in operation for a long period of years. Why should the Minister select a class of the people who really want encouragement not discouragement&mdash;that is, a class of people who buy their own houses, occupy them and keep them in repair?  The allowance of one-sixth of the valuation has always been understood to be in connection with repairs, undertaken by the owners.  If the <Col N="2417" /> Minister raises this question of the proper valuation of those houses, I submit to this House that he is dealing with a big question piecemeal, and to the detriment of people who really are not deserving of being penalised.  I do not say that as regards any class of houses but we all know that this question of income tax is a very heavy one, on the country as a whole.  Income tax on houses paid in accordance with the valuation is not unjust, either to the State or to the occupier.  If it is unjust, the injustice is very much more broadcast, and goes very much further than where the Minister is attacking it in this Bill.  I certainly rise to oppose this measure, as I think that if the Minister is out for increase in revenue he ought to do it without injustice to one section as compared to others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I only referred very incidentally to the question of the valuation of houses in general, and the fact that the Poor Law valuation had very little relation to the real value of the houses, and that the Income Tax derived from house property in this country is very much lower than if it were collected along the lines that prevail in Great Britain.  I referred to that merely incidentally.  What I did wish to say was that the poor law valuation makes allowances for repairs. What I am proposing here is a reform that is long overdue, and which was not of sufficient importance to the British Government to induce them to undertake it.  As a matter of fact, you have to consider the question as I put it, of two houses, side by side, of equal value. They really should pay equal income tax, provided the owners are not exempt.  There is no reason why a particular house, on passing from the ownership of one person to another, should receive a deduction, due merely to a change of ownership.  That is an inequality we should not perpetuate, and we should not increase by continuing the present arrangement, and have to make deductions in considerable numbers in every year on the passing of houses from the ownership of people who let them to a tenant, to the ownership of people who occupy them.  There is no penalty in this at all.  What simply is being done is, we are preventing <Col N="2418" /> people getting a deduction for which there is no call in equity, which has no relationship at all to any reality, but arises simply from the fact that provisions which were applicable in Great Britain were applied to different conditions here in Ireland without considering that they should have been normally modified.  We now are dealing with the problem, and I think we should not continue to make those deductions in increasing numbers to the detriment of the revenue, that is, the general public, because if any person escapes a payment of tax somebody else has got to pay, and we should really, so far as we can, get equity in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister has let fall one very important statement.  I asked for the figures on Friday when this proposal was under discussion. The Minister told us then that he had not got the figures, and he has told us to-day he is endeavouring to get figures, but he has not got them.  He has told us the British Government did not consider that the savings that would be effected by this alteration were worth while.  Consequently they did not take the step the Minister for Finance here proposes to take.  That is exactly what I had in my mind when I asked the question on Friday&mdash;that the saving that would be effected, or at least the income that will accrue from this proposal will be so small compared with the irritation it will cause amongst householders that the Minister would have been well advised to have considered the matter from that point of view before introducing this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out by Deputy Hewat, if the basis of valuation in this country requires alteration&mdash;I am not quite sure that it does&mdash;but if the point of view be that the basis of valuation is not as up-to-date as it might be, there are other means of putting that right.  To bring in, under the cloak of a Finance Bill, a change in a system of valuation is, I think, hardly warranted. We would scarcely be warranted in following the Minister into a discussion on the question of valuation under this particular proposal. But he has expressed the view that <Col N="2419" /> Poor Law Valuation does not fairly represent the profit rental accruing from a property.  Before making that statement I hope the Minister has made inquiries into the matter.  My view is that the Poor Law Valuation in most cases very fairly represents the profit rental of a property.  Of course there are old valuations that have been in existence for a number of years, but they are a comparatively small numbed. In these cases the Minister might fairly allege that the valuation does not represent the profit rental which would be subject to income tax.  But the modern valuations put quite a different complexion on that proposal, <Col N="2420" /> and if he were to take a number of modern valuations I think he would find that by taking the poor law valuation as the basis for income tax he would get a larger return than he would on the basis of profit rental.  So that if he is going on that assumption I am afraid that he will find on investigation that the assumption is not well based.  Therefore, I would like, before this particular proposal is allowed to pass on any further, that we should have more information at our disposal than we have.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 17, to delete the words &lsquo;five shillings&rsquo; and substitute therefor the words &lsquo;four shillings and sixpence.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first sight it will appear somewhat inconsistent and incongruous that a Farmers' Deputy, with a true realisation of agricultural conditions in the country, should propose an amendment which would have the effect of reducing income tax, because as far as our industry is concerned it will at once be apparent that very few farmers are called upon at the present time to pay income tax. But notwithstanding all that, we farmers must think in terms of the Nation, as has been very expressively said here some time back.  We must take a comprehensive survey of our financial conditions. And we have to ask ourselves: What is the effect of this five shillings income tax?  We look around and we see across the Irish Sea and over the Northern frontier States with an income tax of 4/6 in the £.  We see States where conditions of life are easier, where perhaps the amenities of civilisation are more perfect.  We see States which have a uniform system with us, and almost identical political institutions.  And viewing these facts and seeing that capital is a volatile essence that is not tied to any particular place or country, we can see at once <Col N="2424" /> that there must be a large withdrawal of the wealth of this country and its re-investment abroad, to the great loss and injury of this State.</P>
    <P>I sympathise exceedingly with the difficulties of the Minister for Finance in his efforts to balance the Budget, but I think that it is a very short-sighted policy to impose taxes which, by their operation, will have the effect of withdrawing capital and the reinvestment abroad of that capital.  When capital goes abroad the proprietors of capital follow, and once they go abroad they are lost as tax-bearing agents to this country.  Under these circumstances I say that it is wrong, and a very short-sighted policy, to have an income tax at five shillings.  The competitive element must enter into the matter.  We are in competition with other countries and we must make this country attractive for well-to-do people to live in.  The conditions of life are quite suitable for them abroad.  This extra sixpence is not very much, you may say, yet the effect of it is to cause people to leave the country.  They have left the country and are leaving the country in large numbers.  We want to call halt to that.  There is another aspect that has to be considered.  What is its effect on industry at home?  It has the same effect on industry.  Industry is strangled and there is no expansion. People will not invest money while taxes are so high.  Men must get an adequate return for their money, otherwise they are prepared to leave their money lying idle; they are not prepared to run the chances of insecurity and the risks of high taxation by investing.  I expect the Minister will come along in a very short time and tell me the evil result and the evil effect and the reaction on our credit that will ensue as a result of reducing the income tax.  Credit is something, but even in the wider sense I deny the implication that the reduction of the income tax will affect our credit.  It will not affect the credit of the commercial community; on the contrary it will enhance it.  Will it affect the credit of the State?  That is what I want to know.  Will it affect the ability of our Minister to borrow money to maintain the national services? I do not think that it will, when <Col N="2425" /> it is realised that an effort is being made to keep the country on a stable foundation.  I do not think it will affect the credit of the country or make it more difficult for the Minister to borrow or compel him to pay a higher rate of interest.  By no stretch of the imagination can an income tax of four and sixpence be regarded as inadequate taxation.  I deny altogether that the reduction by sixpence of the income tax that he wants to maintain will adversely affect the national credit for borrowing purposes.</P>
    <P>In this country we have got now and then to have regard to business methods&mdash;even in this Island of Saints and Scholars.  Notwithstanding that there are so many scholars, they have lost themselves in the implication and significance of the watermark of the Crown on certain covenanted and uncovenanted documents known as No. 1 and No. 2.  And even though some of the Saints have run amok through the country, slaughtering each other, the Minister must still have regard to the businessmen.  Businessmen must be protected, and the prosperity of industry must be brought about by any means by which it is possible to bring it about.  I hold that it is strangling industry to have to pay an income tax of 5s. in the £.  We have to come down to the British level.  I wish we could go below it.  If all mobile wealth is not to leave the country, and if there is to be an expansion of industry at home, it is essential to reduce the income tax to 4s. 6d.  The reduction must come sooner or later.  Is it not better that it should come now and give us a chance of recuperation rather than that it should come five years too late?  That is the question I want to put to the Minister, and that I should like the Minister to answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Connor Hogan.  I have already spoken on this matter two or three times in the different stages that the Financial Resolutions have gone through, but I think this is a matter which cannot be emphasised too much.  My idea is that the ideal which should be aimed at by the Minister for Finance in his taxation is as far as possible, <Col N="2426" /> to keep our taxes on a level with those prevailing in England; that is, to keep our income tax on a level with the British tax, and to keep all our other taxes on a similar level, and to keep them on a level with those prevailing in Northern Ireland.  My reason for suggesting that that should be done is because, as far as Northern Ireland is concerned it would facilitate any negotiations which are taking place, or which may take place with regard to the rectification of the Boundary, or, still better, would facilitate negotiations in regard to the removal of the boundary altogether.  And as far as England is concerned, it is in order that people in possession of mobile wealth, as Deputy Hogan, says, shall not leave this country and go to England and live on their incomes there, and further to encourage people with incomes from foreign securities to come here and live on their incomes here.  I made a speech on a previous occasion, and said that it was my opinion that income tax, like most other taxes, has a tendency to be pushed on to the consumer, and in this country, to the producer.  Deputy Johnson differed with me on that statement, but still on consideration I think there is a great deal of truth in it.  I believe that income tax is very often pushed on to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus the man who has to pay 5/- in the £ instead of 2/6 in the £, as income tax, takes good care that his profits are so enlarged that they will be larger after the income tax is deducted than they were when he was paying an income tax of 2/6 in the £.  The tax is pushed on to the consumer and producer&mdash;to the farmer and the man living in the country&mdash;who cannot push it on to anybody else.  The original intention, I think, when income tax was introduced, was to make it a tax to pay the expenses of war.  As we all know, income tax in England was enormously increased for the purpose of meeting war expenses.  We are not meeting war expenses with income tax here. We are meeting the ordinary normal expenses of the country, and I think the object should be to reduce income tax at least to the level that prevails in <Col N="2427" /> neighbouring countries.  I know the inevitable answer, an answer which is regarded as indisputable by almost everybody in the House, is that the finances of the country cannot stand it. We heard a lot about economies.  We heard a lot about the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; that would be made.  We know that &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; were made in the old age pensions and the teachers' salaries.  I, for one, voted for those cuts very reluctantly, and distinctly on the understanding that attempts would be made to have similar &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; enforced in all possible Departments of the national service.  We have no indication that such &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; have been enforced.  We have no indication that a Committee of Inquiry will be set up or that the setting up of such a Committee to consider what economies could be enforced, has been considered.  That these economies could be enforced I am convinced, and if they were enforced it would be possible not only to reduce the income tax by 6d., but to reduce the sugar tax to the level of the English sugar tax, and the beer tax to the level of the English beer tax.  It might be possible to reduce the taxes to a lower level than the English taxes, which in my opinion would be a very desirable object to aim at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to follow Deputy Heffernan into consideration of the possible economies which might reduce taxation, for two reasons. One reason is that the Minister knows my remedy&mdash;a Geddes Committee&mdash;and the second is that it would be out of order.  Before he answers the very able argument of Deputy Connor Hogan, I would like to bring back to the Minister's mind his own speech at an earlier stage on this measure, when he referred to our taxable capacity and to the yield of our taxes.  There is no doubt whatever that in this problem, with which he is grappling so seriously, the greatest difficulty he has to encounter is the fact that Irish taxation yields a much poorer return than taxation in England.  A penny in the £ income tax or a penny in the £ tea tax produces a  return than a similar change in the taxes in England.  Why is that?  part, because we are a poor country, and also, in part&mdash;I venture to think in <Col N="2428" /> large part&mdash;because a very considerable number of taxpayers have gone out of the country in the last five or six years. I do not suppose anybody who is not brought frequently in contact with, and who has not seen all the homes he once stayed in now shut up or reduced to ruins, realises what a loss the country has sustained in this way&mdash;the loss of employment, the loss of expenditure that benefited the country towns and the loss of taxpaying capacity.  We have been bleeding in that way now for four or five years, and if that bleeding is to be stopped desperate measures are needed.  The Minister will have to commit an act of faith and an act of courage, if he wishes to allure these taxpayers back.  The concession he made&mdash;and wisely made&mdash;in regard to super-tax does not appeal to most of them.  The number of people who pay super-tax on the rate the Minister has singled out for favourable treatment are very, very few indeed.  I could count them on the fingers of one hand. But there are a very large number of people with incomes from £1,000 to £5,000 who wish to spend those incomes in this country, and who are now spending them, not so much in England&mdash; though a certain number of them do spend them there&mdash;as on the Continent of Europe, where they find that with a little ingenuity they can escape income tax altogether.  In Brittany and other centres there are large Irish colonies now&mdash;the new Wild Geese.  They may be as foolish as their name implies, but I do not know.  At any rate, those colonies exist, and I think it would be a good thing for this country, from every point of view, if those people could be induced to return.  They would yield revenue to the Minister, customers to the shopkeeper and an element of sport and good humour to the life of the country, which is not without its value.  While I appreciate the Minister's difficulties.  I do earnestly hope he may be able to make some sort of concession on this measure.  Since the European War, the multiplication of income tax to the extent of nearly 400 per cent., has done more to alter the fabric of society in Great Britain and in this country than probably anything that has happened in recent years&mdash;an alteration of spending <Col N="2429" /> capacity, a cutting-off of many services and amenities that were good to the country as a whole.  There has not come, side by side with that, any preponderating benefit in the condition of the working classes.  Before the war, I have no doubt, Deputy Johnson would have urged that if you increased the income tax of the capitalist 25 per cent. you would make the world a better place for the worker to live in.  But the world is not a better place for the worker to live in at present.  Wages are higher, but employment is more precarious and less certain than it was ten years ago.  Going about amongst the very poor workers&mdash;even amongst the day-to-day labourers&mdash;you constantly hear the regret: &ldquo;The old times were better times.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments on this Bill were urged in this Chamber a year ago.  I suggested then, and I think circumstances have proved the truth of my suggestion, that higher income tax means a lower yield in revenue.  I can imagine that while all the arguments might not have sufficient power to penetrate into the Minister's mind, this is an argument he ought to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that if a year ago income tax had been dropped from 5/- to 4/6, so as to keep on a parity with the rate then introduced in Great Britain, the yield to-day would be higher for the Minister than it actually is.  And, further, if he were to drop income tax to the same level as the level in Great Britain, I suggest the yield in twelve months' time will be more advantageous <Col N="2430" /> to the Exchequer than the yield is going to be at the level the Minister has now instituted.  I have left out of consideration all the other points in the argument.  I understand that all these other arguments that might be advanced here&mdash;that it would be good for industry and for the health of the country&mdash;are arguments that might incline the Minister to say: &ldquo;These are luxurious considerations that we can only enter into when we have balanced our Exchequer, and the prime consideration for the Minister for Finance is to consider the tax that will yield him the highest amount of revenue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is to meet that that I have advanced the argument that I am now putting before the Minister.  He knows very well there are many instances of what may be termed the point of saturation.  There comes a time when a tax, the higher it is rated, the lower its yield in revenue.  That would come in any case.  Particularly is it going to come when alongside of this country there is another country to which the citizens of this country can go, especially if they are living on income. They can go and live with greater comfort, with the same amount of money at their disposal in any country they choose.  We find that kind of person emigrating in very large measure to-day.</P>
    <P>There is one further development of that argument I would like to put before the Minister, and it is this: Not only by dropping income-tax to the same level as that prevailing in England will he get a higher yield in income tax, but he will get a higher yield in other taxes besides, and the benefit gained by a drop in income tax would be extended over an entire range of taxation in the Finance Bill.  I noticed at various stages of this argument, whenever it has been brought forward here, there has been perfect quietness, with an occasional ironical cheer, from the Labour Benches; but this is an argument Labour ought to support just as firmly as any other branch in the Dáil.</P>

That is one of the causes of the grave unemployment problem we have to face to-day.  I believe it would be a sound measure to bring this income tax, not merely to the same level as prevails in England, but to a lower level.  In any case, with Great Britain beside us ready to tempt from this country those who are living here and who have capital to expend, it is not a wise policy.</P>
      <P>I only wish to make one further reference before I conclude.  It is a reference to a speech made by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil last November. I believe I brought forward the argument I am now stressing early last year.  I have not got the actual copy of the Official Debates in my hand, but if the Minister will cast his mind back to that occasion he will remember that he himself used the argument, and said that if we could bring our income tax to the same level that prevails in England, it was a fair consideration that the actual yield might not be any less, and might conceivably be higher. Therefore, for financial considerations rightly within his proper interest in bringing forward this Finance Bill, I suggest he might accept the amendment moved by Deputy Connor Hogan.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased <Col N="2432" /> that Deputy Connor Hogan has brought forward this amendment.  I hope the Minister will take very serious notice of all that has been said.  I do not know of a finer argument for the Minister for Finance than some of the statements that I have listened to. They were magnificent arguments in favour of the Minister bringing forward his tentative policy of Protection in his Budget.  Deputies have complained that capital has left the country and has been invested elsewhere. They have talked about the unemployed and the need for employment, and they refer to the sixpence less in the income tax duty across the water in comparison with the Free State. They appear awfully sorry that capital is not in Ireland.  Still, when the Minister made an effort to bring capital to Ireland and have it retained here, those Deputies adopted a different attitude.  If a way were found for giving employment in Ireland and inducing people to place their money here, then the Minister would have power given him to look for income tax, because the people would be in a position to earn so as to pay income tax. With increased industry and with more money invested in the country, there would be a bigger field for income tax. I hope the Minister, whilst rejecting the amendment, will take serious note of what has been said, and on a future occasion when introducing his Budget he will remember how very keen certain Deputies were for bringing capital into Ireland for the promotion of industries. That will give the Minister an opportunity that he can easily avail of for charging income tax on the results of a combination of labour and capital in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Figgis suggested that it was very important even for those who are wage earners that income tax should be reduced and that that was a very good reason why we should vote for this amendment.  If he had argued on a basis of well-grounded estimates rather than upon prophecies he might have carried us a little further. So far as I have been able to examine such figures as have been provided I have not been able to see any reason for thinking that the same revenue <Col N="2433" /> would be derivable from a 4/6 tax as is expected to be derived from a 5/- tax.  Presumably, the Minister has grounds for assuming that he is going to be better off on a 5/- tax than on a 4/6 tax.  If Deputy Figgis had been able to bring forward any evidence in support of his contentions beyond a general opinion it might be more effective as an argument.  But then suppose that were true, the question that I would ask the Deputies to face is this, are they going to derive a greater revenue or not.  If only the same revenue is obtainable from the income tax payers, then they are not losing anything.  The argument runs that by lowering income tax a greater volume of trade and greater production would ensure and there would be more general prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Deputies to consider whether this motion had better be deferred until we see whether they are prepared to vote in favour of a reduction of any taxes upon sugar.  If they would vote for a reduction of taxes on sugar they can then reasonably suggest a reduction in income tax.  Can they do both?  Is the revenue of such a nature as to warrant a reduction in both?  If not, which are they going to take first? Are you going to reduce taxes on incomes before you reduce your high taxes on sugar?  And unless you can prove with absolute certainty, or as near absolute certainty as anything can be, that a reduction from 5/- to 4/6 will mean a maintenance of revenue, then you will not be justified at all in reducing income tax until you have previously reduced the sugar tax very considerably.  Deputy Heffernan seems to think that income tax is a tax that can be passed on.  I ask how does the civil servant pass on his income tax?  To whom?  How does the farmer pass it on&mdash;and the farmer may occasionally pay income tax?  Does he pass it on to the price he gets for his produce, and how?  If he could tell us that, we should be very much wiser than we are.  Because the thing we have always been learning is that the Irish farmer is not able to determine the price at which his goods are sold. How does that odd farmer who does pay income tax pass it on to the consumer? Again, may I suggest if his <Col N="2434" /> view of this matter is correct, all the advantages will lie with the small producer. The small producer earning a small income would have practically no income tax to pay.  Therefore all the advantages would be with the small producer rather than with the large producer.  The large producer earning higher profits would be handicapped by the income tax.</P>
    <P>I suggest that Deputy Heffernan will have to find another way to sustain his argument, for he cannot in the ordinary course of things, as a producer and a capitalist, pass on his income tax.  If he were dealing with finance as finance, and as a banker and dictator of financial policy, then there might be something to be said, but as a manufacturer and income tax payer I think the Deputy is quite wrong and he cannot sustain his contention that the tax is passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Figgis and Deputy Cooper used an argument in regard to the effect of higher income tax in Ireland than in England upon the national social life which I cannot accept at all. I take it that people that are affected in this matter are either those who live in Ireland and have monies invested in other countries or are able to draw upon properties in other countries of one kind or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Or pensioners. They are inclined to go to the place where their monies come from.  By the lowering of income tax we may induce these people to live in Ireland, although all their thoughts are with that other country from which their money comes.  Now I suggest that it is not good policy, and it is not a correct attitude for us to adopt to mould our financial legislation to meet the desires or the fancies of this section of the community who are going to be affected by those considerations.  It means if you do that you are asking the State to allow its policy to be dictated by people whose interests are in other countries. I say that is not a good argument to use to the Dáil in favour of a change in fiscal policy.  As for those who, living in Ireland, have incomes coming from other countries, if their interests <Col N="2435" /> are mainly with the country that their interest comes from, then I think though there might be a certain social loss, it is better to risk that loss rather than to have those people over-influencing the political policy of the country. On the other hand, if there are people who are so much bound up with this country in their industries that they could not afford to leave the country, and who are quite prepared to invest their capital abroad, then I say that we should so alter our financial laws as to make it unprofitable to them to invest their capital abroad rather than at home.</P>
      <P>And it is, I submit, bad policy to urge an amendment of this kind on the plea that there are many people in the country whose financial interests and, therefore, whose hearts lie in other countries. If we are going to do that, we are practically saying that the policy and politics and social life in this country is to be diverted or determined by those people whose financial outlook is that of some other place than this place.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson asks me whether it is possible, in the financial state of this country, to make a substantial reduction both in income tax and in indirect taxation.  I am absolutely convinced that the finances of this country do permit of such.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment of Deputy Hogan, but I am afraid he will not.  I am afraid the Government <Col N="2436" /> is now getting so deep into the rut of huxtering finance that they are unable to get out of it.  The Minister for Finance said, when introducing his Budget, that to make this reduction of 6d. in the £ income tax would involve a loss of half a million to the Exchequer, and therefore it was absolutely impossible to do this if the Budget was to be balanced.  But I am convinced that the whole imposing structure upon which the Government places their financial policy is rotten from top to bottom.  I am absolutely satisfied, from the figures that the Minister has supplied to the Dáil, that reduction in taxation is absolutely possible if the ordinary Budget of this country is to be balanced.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that in the current financial year there would be a deficit of eight and a half millions.  That implies that that eight and a half millions would have to be raised by borrowing. But the Minister did not mention the fact in that connection, although he mentioned it in another part of his speech, that there were three and a half millions over in the Exchequer at the beginning of the year from the last loan, so that in reality the sum of money to be borrowed on the present estimates only amounts to five millions.  The Minister made an extraordinary statement in answer to a speech made by Deputy Professor Magennis some time ago in which Deputy Magennis pleaded for this very matter of reducing the income tax.  He said that the Government was borrowing all the money necessary for the purpose of paying extraordinary expenditure.  But that all depends upon what the Minister calls extraordinary expenditure.  I am absolutely satisfied that the extraordinary expenditure incurred by this State could be met&mdash;</P>

It is my contention, and I am absolutely <Col N="2437" /> satisfied, that it is possible, and absolutely reasonable, that this reduction should take place, because I am satisfied that the extraordinary expenditure this year amounts to well over £10,000,000, hidden away under all kinds of obscure votes throughout the Estimates.  It amounts, certainly, to over £10,000,000, possibly to £14,000,000, considered as extraordinary expenditure in the Estimates of this year.  Yet, the actual amount of money we will have to borrow will only be about £5,000,000.  And taking into consideration the extraordinary Revenue, such as £2,000,000 from the British for compensation and various other matters, I am satisfied that there must be, and could easily be, a reduction not only in the income tax, but even a greater reduction in indirect taxation for the benefit of the farming and the working community.  Deputy Hogan referred to economies which the Government might make.</P>

      <P>The main argument of the Minister is that he must balance his Budget.  The Minister for Agriculture is always holding up to us Denmark as an example to follow.  The reason Denmark is successful, and putting us out of the markets we formerly held is, because Denmark has an intelligent financial policy, and for many years Denmark has not balanced its Budget.  I am sorry I have not got here the figures; I would like to have them to try and persuade Deputy Johnson that this is a reasonable proposition and that there could be an equal reduction both in income tax and in indirect taxes which he desires.  As I say, unfortunately I have not those figures, but at a later stage when I have them available I hope to be able to persuade Deputy Johnson on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to persuade Deputy Johnson on this matter of the sugar tax.  The way to persuade the Minister for Finance is to get enough votes on your side; then he will agree. Deputy Johnson says that because no reduction is made in the sugar tax, it is impossible to ask for a reduction in <Col N="2438" /> income tax.  I put the matter to him in this way.  He is a protectionist.  The tax on sugar is at the moment causing sugar factories to be erected in the Saorstát.  That means that these factories will bring employment that would not exist but for the sugar tax. Therefore, that is one reason why in the interests of labour it would be a mistake to take the tax off sugar.  Again, to give 6d. in the £ off income tax would mean a loss of half a million, according to the Minister for Finance. The reduction in sugar would only mean a halfpenny in the lb. to the consumer, and I hold that the consumer would not get the benefit.  In the fluctuations of trade, it would go to the middleman and the merchant, and not to the consumer.  If the reduction could be put at 1½d.in the lb., as in England, it would be to the benefit of the consumer I agree, but when the amount is so small as a ½d. the benefit would not go to the consumer.  I am debarred from going into the question of expenditure by reason of the ruling of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I believe that is where the whole trouble is.  We should be able to run this country on lower expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take another line of argument. We have on our frontier a country where the income tax is 4s. 6d. in the £. The merchants in that particular area have the advantage of 6d. in the £ income tax, and they are competing against the Dublin merchants, particularly in the West of Ireland.  In addition to that, and to cheap overhead charges, they have the advantage of lower railway rates than in the Free State.  The result is that they are capturing the trade which, by reason of the locality, should come through Dublin, and the Minister is thereby losing revenue which he would derive if trade were diverted to its proper channels to Dublin.  That is a considerable item.  The Minister for Finance ought to have the keen business acumen of the men in the North, and he ought to put us on the same level as our friends in Belfast.  It affects the farmers, because when trade is bad the farmers get bad prices for their goods. When trade is bad, everybody is grumbling, and there are no prices for <Col N="2439" /> anything, and although I admit that the farmers' income tax is based upon annuities, if less than the rateable value, still if we had a community making money they would be able to assimilate the farmers' produce, and give us better prices than they are getting at the moment, and for these reasons it is my intention to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want also to try and convince Deputy Johnson in favour of the amendment, but I am afraid it will be a very difficult matter. I will try at least to refute his argument to some extent.  I am still convinced that to a large extent income tax is passed on to the consumer, and unfortunately the consumers in Ireland are composed, to a very large extent, of the farming community.  I am aware that the consumer is also very often a producer and at the same time an income tax payer.  The majority of income tax payers in Ireland are the middlemen who come between the producers and the consumers.  We know quite well that as far as they are concerned they will measure their profits in accordance with the income tax which they have to pay.  When they find that their income tax is £100 a year, instead of £25 which it was some years ago, they will see that their profits, instead of being £200 or £300 a year, will mount up to nearer £1,000 a year.  When they make their margin of profit higher than what it was some years ago when the income tax was not as much as it is now, it is the consumer who will have to provide that higher margin of profit in the way of an increased price for the articles which he purchases.  The result of all this is that the cost of living is increased.  At the present time the cost of living is higher in the Saorstát than it is in the Six Counties or in England.  That should not be the case in a country like this which produces so much agricultural commodities.  I acknowledge that Deputy Johnson is right when he says that the farmer has no opportunity of passing on the income tax which he has to pay.  The Minister for Finance said that there are not many farmers <Col N="2440" /> who are income tax payers.  I can tell the Minister that farmers who are paying income tax should not be paying it at all, for the reason that they have no income from which to pay the tax.  Any of them that are paying the tax are, in my opinion, paying an extortionate duty imposed by the Minister, and principally for the reason that farmers, as a rule, do not happen to be expert accountants.  The farmers, I admit, have no opportunity of passing the income tax on to some other section in the community.  I admit, too, that civil servants are much in the same position.  They cannot pass on their tax to anyone either.</P>

I submit that it is advisable to have the income tax rate reduced to 4/6d. in the pound.  I want to answer Deputy Johnson with regard to the effect of the present high rate of income tax on civil servants.  They cannot pass the tax on to anybody else.  Because of the present high rate they are asking through their organisation and their unions, that their salaries should be maintained at the highest possible level.  They give us an excuse for that, that a very large proportion of their salary is taken from them in income tax.  The result is that their salaries are maintained at their present high level, and eventually the heavy expenditure involved in maintaining these high salaries percolates down to the farmer who has to meet these charges in the shape of income tax which he cannot pass on to anybody else.  The prices for his produce are fixed by a market over which he has no control.  Therefore, from the farmer's point of view it is desirable that the present rate of income tax should be reduced.</P>

      <P>I want to convince Deputy Johnson of a sin which he has committed.  His suggestion to Deputy Esmonde was that if we were to wait <Col N="2441" /> for the debate on the sugar duty this matter could be brought up.  That, as Deputy Johnson knows, would be inconsistent with the rules of the Dáil.  If the amendment is negatived now a similar amendment cannot be moved on the Report Stage.  The Deputy laid a trap for Deputy Esmonde which, however, the latter did not fall into.  I ask Deputy Johnson if he is now going to preach a doctrine of narrow nationalism. I forget the precise number of the International to which Deputy Johnson is affiliated.  I do not know whether it is the third, fourth, or fifth International.  I had always thought that Labour was telling us to set our eyes on Moscow.  I really think that of the two proposals mine is less startling than the suggestion of Deputy Johnson.  I do not think the Deputy was quite candid in coming here and saying that you must consider nobody except the actual worker who is the producer in Ireland.  On other occasions we have been told to promote direct relations with Moscow and to have a revival of the Council of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point I wish to make which none of the Labour Deputies made so far, nor did Deputy Johnson deal with this question of employment, which is at the root of this whole thing. When I found myself confronted with an income tax demand multiplied by four I found that I could not live up to the standard on which I had lived in the past.  The result is that I am employing fifteen people less now than I employed ten years ago.  Some of these employees had their board as well as wages, and, of course, a certain number of them were thrown on the unemployed labour market.  The result of that, too, was that my dealings with business firms have fallen off to a considerable extent.  That, I suggest, is the crux of the whole matter.  Nobody likes these taxes, and no one is enthusiastic about them except, perhaps, the Minister for Finance.  I dislike the sugar tax very much.  The reason that there is this opposition to maintaining the income tax at 5/- in the pound is mainly because it has such a disastrous effect on employment.  The present rate is largely responsible for the unemployment that we have.  I do not <Col N="2442" /> say that if we were to reduce the rate to 4/6 that it would solve the problem, but in a residential country such as this was up to some years ago, and as England is at present, the high rate of income tax has had that effect.  Deputy Johnson will find that in the more residential portions of England, such as Surrey, there is the same phenomenon to be faced.  In my opinion, it is the present high rate of income tax that is at the root of this whole matter of unemployment, and until Labour is prepared to meet that point they ought not to oppose Deputy Hogan's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to meet that point.  The Deputy is thinking, as I imagined he would, of employment as being created by rich people who are giving employment to personal servants and the like.  The Deputy said that we sometimes think on parallel lines, but we never meet. That is exactly true; he is thinking on one scale of life and I am thinking on the other.  I do not think that the health and well-being of this country will be secured by having rich men employing servants round about houses and parks and in luxury occupations. No doubt a reduction of annual income on any individual taxpayer may lead him to reduce his expenditure on personal servants and luxury trades, but if you reduce the possibilities of spending moneys by the poorer section of the community you are reducing an amount of employment of a larger number; and unless Deputy Cooper and others can show us that by reducing the income tax you are not going to put on a higher tax still upon the poor, through indirect taxes&mdash;unless he can do that, and nobody has attempted to do it yet, I am not going to support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want it to be thought that I am in favour of high income tax simply for the sake of taxation, as Deputy Bryan Cooper seems to think is the case.  But I am not going to approve of a reduction in tax upon the higher incomes while maintaining taxes upon the essentials of life to the poor.  I know that to-morrow morning in the newspapers we shall have headings about the Labour Party in association with Moscow.  They will not be able to <Col N="2443" /> reproduce in those headings the smile on the face of Deputy Cooper, and it will go abroad that Deputy Cooper has made a statement which, because it was not contradicted, must be accepted as truth.  There is no truth in it, of course. We are not receiving any communications or instructions; we are not in close confabulation with anybody in Moscow, or any other part of the world; there is no question of Internationalism in this matter, and if Deputy Cooper had read as much as he pretends on these things he would know that Labour in this country, and in most countries, realises first that its duty and allegiance is to its own before going abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last words of Deputy Johnson, very strongly and very emphatically.  A year ago I urged that income tax might be reduced, and in arguing that it could with advantage be reduced I agreed with Deputy Johnson then, and I agree with him now, that the duties that chiefly pressed upon the poor should receive first consideration.  I suggest to Deputy Johnson, and I suggest to the Minister for Finance, that the situation has materially changed within the past twelve months&mdash;materially changed. We have, for example, this one remarkable fact to record, which most deeply influences every consideration in regard to this matter, and that is, that for the first time for twenty-six years our imports have been higher than our exports. <Col N="2444" /> That can only mean one thing; it can only mean that there is less production in the country because there is less of the means of production.  That has its incidence, and directly affects the proposition that Deputy Johnson put to me, which I accept, and I accept it in the spirit in which he put it to me. I would have agreed a year ago, and did agree a year ago, that a reduction of sugar tax should precede any reduction in the income tax, but to-day I say that the situation in the country is such that if something be not done to encourage the investment of capital in production in this country, relief of sugar tax might happen to be of very little benefit for people who are not able to get even the means to buy sugar.  I agree with Deputy Johnson: I am the first candidly to admit that my argument that a lower income tax would yield a revenue at least equal to the income tax set out in this Bill is a hypothetical argument; it must by the nature of things be hypothetical. We have not got the facts upon which to argue.  But what we do know is, and what is not hypothetical, is that people are leaving this country.  We know more.  The Minister for Finance may know&mdash;it is very easy to discover information in the city that will soon convince him&mdash; that there are a large number of people living in Ireland who have investments in England, and whose investments in England are not only banked in English banks, but are never declared here.  The Minister for Finance must surely know that.  It is very easy to say that that is a very improper thing to do, but that is being done and will be done while the two countries are so near to one another, and where the income tax in one country is so much higher than in the other.  It is an inevitable temptation, and it is a temptation that is being taken advantage of to, a very considerable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find a very great deal of difficulty in following Deputy Johnson's argument in this particular regard.  He spoke about consideration being given to persons whose capital was invested in other countries, and he might have suggested actually in the words, as he did in his argument, that where their <Col N="2445" /> treasure was their hearts were also. But that does not follow.  I have a particular example before my mind now, a lady who is proposing to leave Ireland.  Her capital is not invested in England.  Her capital is invested in some South American shares, but the dividends received from these South American shares are no higher than they were in 1914, when the income permitted her to live with a degree of comfort. At the present moment that income is the same but the rate of living is very much higher, and consequently she has to consider the expenditure of every sixpence.  She finds that that consideration of the expenditure of every sixpence has persuaded her so strongly that the relief she would get by living in England at a lower rate of living, and also at a lower rate of income tax, is sufficient to take her from this country. That is only one example of many. There is less money spent here, and there is a lesser yield for the revenue as a consequence.  There is a lesser circulation of money, and consequently there must be lesser employment.  As Deputy Cooper has said&mdash;and I join very heartily with him&mdash;this question of employment is going to be the test of the success of this State, and I believe that the question of unemployment is the strongest argument to be raised in connection with the considerations put forward here for a reduction of income tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson, in reply to Deputy Cooper, said that his arguments seemed to refer to rich people keeping houses and parks.  These are not the only people who have the expenditure of capital.  There are also those who have the running and continuance of factories that give employment.  Let me give one actual case that came within my knowledge within the past month. I give it to the Minister for Finance. I believe it to be symptomatic; I believe it to be very grave and important in itself, and more grave and more important because of the valuable symptom that it is.  A certain company in Ireland that has had the employment and to-day has the employment of a large number of people, whose goods are being sold equally in the Free State and in Great Britain, and the goods, which are at the present moment, or <Col N="2446" /> have up to this past week, been manufactured in the Free State, where there is no duty one way or the other, simply because of this relief, because of the relief of 6d. in the £ available in Great Britain, determined during the past month to close up its factory here, and to open its factory in Great Britain, as a direct consequence of the fact that we have an expenditure on income tax higher than that which prevails in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>They have not brought in the question of wages. I happened to have been present when the decision was taken; it was taken purely on the grounds of income tax, and I presume the announcement will appear in the course of a few days, or weeks, that this particular industry will be removed across the water as a result of income tax.  What is the consequence? There are several.  One affects the Minister for Finance&mdash;that is, he is going to get a lesser yield in revenue, as a result of the loss of income tax by the removal of this firm, and the other effect is that by the removal of firms and factories of this kind unemployment is increased.  I feel the full force of Deputy Johnson's argument, that duties that press on the livelihood of the poor should receive primary consideration under normal circumstances, but I suggest that under abnormal circumstances, such as prevail in Ireland to-day, the primary consideration should be, not those duties that press on the actual commodities purchased by the poor, but those duties that press on the monies, salaries and wages, by which these commodities can alone be produced.</P>

      <P>A few years ago there was no income tax whatever in the Isle of Man, but I have not yet heard there was any considerable emigration of manufacturers from England to the Isle of Man, and I have not yet heard that there has been any considerable removal of business firms from Ireland to the Isle of Man, notwithstanding that there has been no income tax in the Isle of Man.  If there is any income tax there to-day, I think <Col N="2447" /> it is very much smaller than in Ireland or England.  Before being convinced by Deputy Figgis's argument I would like to have some evidence that, because of the absence of, or because of a lower income tax, in the Isle of Man, we had a steady removal of manufacturing firms to the Isle of Man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to believe that this motion is put forward seriously.  The position is simply this: I suppose I need hardly undertake any reply to Deputy Esmonde&mdash;that we have a deficit, apart altogether from any abnormal expenditure on the army or on compensation.  We cannot go into the market to borrow money to pay interest on it.  We may, and should, borrow money where we can expend it well for development, but we ought to pay out of our revenue the interest on that money.  We are not now in a position, and we will not this year be in a position, to pay out of revenue the interest on the money we have borrowed.  We will have to borrow to pay the interest. That position is bad enough, and we cannot afford to make it worse by adding half a million to the deficit, and to reduce the income by 6d. would really mean that.  I know very well that income tax&mdash;especially a high rate of income tax&mdash;acts like rust on a machine. It has a clogging effect, and it prevents development here and there.  It causes individuals to invest money outside and to decide later on, when they have made more money, that they will go and live elsewhere.  It has all these effects, but it would take a great deal of development here to give us the equivalent of what we would lose by a reduction.  I do not know exactly what is the production of wealth in the country at present, but at any rate we get something like £5,000,000 income tax on it; I presume the annual production of wealth cannot be less, say, than £100,000,000.  It is probably more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only giving a very rough figure to illustrate the point.  That is something like twenty times the amount of income tax we get.  Is it suggested we will, as a result of knocking off 6d. in the £ in income tax, have a production of something like £10,000,000 worth of <Col N="2448" /> additional wealth next year?  I think it is pretty obvious we are not going to have that or anything like it.  We will not have even a couple of millions. There is no doubt, if we could reduce income tax it might have a stimulating effect, and I believe that we would lose nothing by it in the long run if we could afford it, and that, ultimately, production and development would be stimulated very considerably.  But a period of years would elapse, and in the meantime, instead of borrowing a half or million or so to pay what we ought to be paying out of revenue, we would have to borrow a great deal more.  That would be very bad economy. If we were to reduce income tax this year or next, in my opinion there would be no alternative but to put up other taxes to meet the deficit.  Those taxes would, presumably, be indirect; they would presumably be taxes on articles of common consumption, for you have to put your tax on articles of common consumption if you want to get revenue.  We have reduced the old age pensions; we have reduced the teachers' salaries, we have reduced the pay of the police and Civic Guard, and of the Army; we have reduced the scales of certain classes of civil servants, and we are considering reductions in other scales.  In face of that, are we going to add to the indirect taxation which will fall on the poor, to reduce the income tax which falls in many cases on people who can well afford it, and, at any rate, on people who can afford it a great deal better than many of those who would be hit by the indirect taxation?  I do not think it would add anything to the stability of the country for us to take a line like that in regard to taxation. People have left the country, I know, but I do not believe they have left it because of the extra 6d. on income tax. I believe very few people have left it because of that.  They have left it because of other things that have gone on.  They have left it because of the instability and feeling of insecurity, and in some cases because of the actual fear of violence.  I think a change in taxation that will obviously seem to hit, as you might say, the under dog, is not a change that will produce security or produce the feeling that will lead <Col N="2449" /> people to come back to the country, or to stay in the country when they would otherwise be inclined to leave it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I never realised what an affectionate lover the Minister for Finance is until now.  As a matter of fact, he has become pathetically constant to his sixpence.  He tells us that in the long run a reduction in income tax will not materially ruin or injure the country in any way, but I wonder does he realise that there is such a thing now and then as throwing oil on the waters, and sustaining a temporary loss in order to ensure a permanent gain.  I admit readily that it would mean a loss to revenue, but it is a question of whether it is not better to have this temporary loss at the moment than have a temporary advantage with a very dire resultant hereafter.  The Minister says that people have left the country, not because of the incidence of sixpence, but because of general insecurity. Is he making an effort to coax these people back?  Many of them would be glad to return home, but before they do so conditions here must be made attractive to them, and there is only one way of doing that, and that is by endeavouring to show that if they <Col N="2450" /> come back to Ireland they will not be taxed more highly here than in Great Britain.  Deputy D'Alton endeavoured to urge the Minister to maintain the present high level of taxation, and he quoted the opposition of the Farmers' Party to protective tariffs.  Surely there is no analogy whatever between a reduction in income tax and protective duties.  Remember, if we raise the cost of living in this country it will necessarily affect our exports and prevent them from competing on the same terms with producers abroad.  The result will be that you will have only local trade, and the manufactures set up here will only meet local requirements.  They will not have foreign trade, and will only have the home market.  We cannot be too rigid on this question of finance.  We must defer to considerations of expediency.  It is for the Minister to take the broad view and to realise that, like the farmers, you must sow the seed and it must perish in the ground before you can realise a gain. We must have this temporary loss to ensure the future financial stability of the country.</P>

      <P>Before passing from this section I would like to know whether any information is available as to the effects of reliefs of this kind&mdash; which I understand are reciprocal&mdash;as to whether there is more given away than is received in the interchange between the British Treasury and the Free State Finance Ministry.  The matter was raised last year, and I think we were not able to get any information because of the absence of statistics.  I hope we are in a position now to clear up the effects of these reciprocal arrangements, so as to know whether it would not be advantageous, both from the point of view of revenue and social policy, to encourage investment in Irish industries, or rather, shall I say, to discourage investment in British industries. We are, I think, by implication encouraging Free State investors to put their money into English securities and, unless we are able to show that there is some advantage to the revenue, I think we ought not to continue these remissions on income from investments, where those investments are in British securities.  Further information, at <Col N="2453" /> least, on this general matter is required and I suggest that this is an opportunity for obtaining it.</P>

      <P>On the general question that Deputy Johnson has raised, I have been myself looking for figures about it, and I learn that in about three or four months' time we will be able to know exactly what amount we have repaid or allowed during the past financial year.  By that time the work of dealing with the year will have sufficiently advanced to enable us to know exactly what is the direct and immediate cost to us of the reliefs.  At any rate, we repay or allow a great deal less than is allowed or repaid by the British Government, and so far as that aspect is concerned we gain a good deal in the exchange.  There is, however, the wider question, which Deputy Johnson calls the social question.  That is a matter that will have to be carefully considered.  Owing to the close proximity of the two countries, and to the fact that they had been one fiscal entity up to the present, there certainly was no alternative but to allow reliefs in a great many cases&mdash;not only in cases like this, but over the general system.  But we will have to consider whether, on the whole, it is advantageous to give all the facilities that such a system does give to the owner of money in this country to invest abroad rather than making it much more easy for him to invest at home.  I certainly think we could have done nothing but make the arrangement at the time we did, because otherwise the upset, the hardship and the injustice would have been very great.  In making any change I think we would have to allow time for arrangements to be made.  As soon as I get the figures I will give the information to the Dáil.</P>

The Land Bank discharges on the part of the Government interest in respect of bonds issued under the Damage to Property Act.  As those bonds are running at an interest of about £5 per centum, it will be necessary in order that the State should get its quota of income tax in respect of that particular investment, that power should be given to deduct at source.  How it is to operate is set out in amendment No. 19, which is to insert a new first schedule.</P>

      <P>In respect to damage to property, I do not know if land purchase comes within its purview. I should say not, as in that case a different set of circumstances would arise, and another method of deduction is open to the Minister for Finance. As regards interest on bonds issued in pursuance of the Damage to Property Act, there is no such power and the Minister would have to get a list from the bank of persons getting interest, serve notice and go through the expensive methods adopted in respect of landed property, house property or other property, in respect of which income tax must be collected. This is an easier and more expeditious method of collection.  If it should occur that a person in respect of such deduction is not liable to income tax, <Col N="2455" /> directly that matter is reported to the Revenue Commissioners and such deduction need not be made.  This is the most direct, the least expensive, and certainly the most expeditious method of dealing with it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The duty on musical instruments, including gramophones, pianolas or other similar instruments, which was first imposed by the said Section 12 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, and was continued up to the 1st day of May, 1924, by the said Section 14 of the Finance Act, 1923 (No. 21 of 1923) shall be continued to be charged, levied and paid on and after the 1st of July, 1924, at a rate equal to fifteen per cent. of the value of the article.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is really a very simple one, and its intention is perfectly clear.  An <i>ad valorem</i> duty at the rate of 33? is charged on musical instruments coming into the Free State.  The object of the amendment is that after the 1st July instead of 33? per cent., 15 per cent. be charged.  In order to make the purpose of the amendment clear I would like to recall the origin of this tax.  It was first introduced and known as one of the &ldquo;McKenna Duties.&rdquo;  It was brought in in England to protect the British piano against what was then considered to be the unfair competition of the German piano.  The unfairness of the competition rested in the fact that the German exchange permitted a high-class piano to be introduced into England on terms that were actually cheaper than the lower class piano the British manufacturer made. Consequently this tax was introduced in England to protect what was then spoken of as the poor man's piano that is to say, the piano generally sold to the artisan family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them still, I believe, have desires for harmony.  What happened when Ireland was created a separate fiscal unit was this: that the main purpose of this tax was defeated and that the cheap piano instead of being protected from competition, in order that it might be made available to people who could not afford the more expensive German piano, was at once charged on the same basis as the more expensive German piano; and the result has been that during the past year the cheap English piano has risen to a rate equal to, or within a few pounds of the more expensive German piano.  The result has been during the past year that the purchase of these instruments has been very considerably retarded and that the sale of the German instrument has been to a certain extent increased.  Now, what has happened?  Owing to the adoption and enforcement under the new German financial system of the rental mark the German piano has increased in cost also, with the result that at the present moment, the entire trade in Ireland is threatened with extinction, as I am informed by those whom I have consulted in the matter and who I believe have represented the case very strongly to the Minister for Finance.  I believe some of the larger shops in Dublin are contemplating the closing of their premises or the dispensing of a large portion of their staff on to the unemployment market because of the incidence of this taxation.  That is the actual position of the trade at the present moment.  In urging that this tax be reduced I am doing it principally on the ground that the reduction will be one that will be good for trade and therefore good for employment, in as much as it will keep a number of persons who, at the present moment, might find themselves thrown on the unemployment market, in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is more than that.  I revert to the case I tried to urge before the Minister in regard to income tax. He may or may not agree, and he did not agree with the argument as it bore upon income tax.  I put that same argument now in a form which I think <Col N="2459" /> should carry conviction.  It is this: I have stated that the <i>ad valorem</i> tax should be reduced to 15 per cent.  Let me take a readier figure&mdash;20 per cent&mdash; in order to keep the argument on a parity.  Supposing the duty were to be reduced from 33? per cent. to 20 per cent., the result to the trade will be that the sale of pianos will increase; and if the sales were to increase so that three pianos were sold where only two were sold before, not only would the trade be advantaged, but the actual gain to the Exchequer would be greater.  The Minister will correct me if I have been misinformed as to this fact.  I should like to ask him if the trade has or has not guaranteed him that if he were to reduce the duty from 33? to 20 per cent., there will be no loss in revenue.  I am told that that guarantee has been given.  I do not hold myself at all to the figure of 15 per cent.  I put that figure in, and I urge that there should be a reduction from 33? per cent. to some figure below that. I do not think that any figure below 15 per cent. would have any possibility of acceptance.  I put forward 15 per cent. for the present moment, and I should like the amendment to be considered, not as though that 15 per cent. were a critical or fundamental figure. What is critical and fundamental is that this tax should be reduced from its present position to some lower figure.  I am informed that if it were to be reduced to 20 per cent. the gain to the Exchequer would remain exactly the same, the yield to the Exchequer would not be at all less.  On the other hand, if there be no reduction, I believe that in this city of Dublin there will be a considerable number of persons thrown on to the unemployment market, because the trade is, as I am informed, considering at the present moment whether, with the present rate of taxation, it will be possible for them to maintain the staffs that they are now equipped with.  I revert finally to the argument with which I began.  This duty was never introduced for Irish purposes.  It was introduced as an English piece of protection.  We have no industries of that kind in this country to protect.  Its purpose was not an <Col N="2460" /> Irish purpose; its purpose was not a revenue purpose; its purposes were both English and protective purely.  It is an irrelevant tax in this country and I suggest that it is a tax that is doing more harm than it is doing benefit, and that it should be changed somewhat with a view to its final removal, because its effects are injurious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is correct in the statement he has made regarding the exact period of the McKenna Duties, as he calls them.  My recollection is that in 1916, somewhere about the fall, Mr. Bonar Law was made Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;I may be wrong, but I think that is the case&mdash; and I do not think that Mr. McKenna was in the subsequent months Chancellor of the Exchequer.  In 1915 there was no trade in German pianos with England.  There was a little disturbance between England and Germany at that time, and pianos were not a commodity exported out of Germany or imported into England from Germany. We are not bound here in connection with our fiscal arrangements to follow the lines of the English Chancellor of the Exchequer in the matter of the imposition of taxation.  What we aimed at this year, as the Minister for Finance very ably expounded in his Budget speech, was an experiment in the matter of protection.  This is an experiment in the same direction.  If there are piano people here in Ireland who are sufficiently interested in their business to start the manufacture, they have certainly got a very good backing in the matter of having a 33 and one-third per cent. import duty on German pianos, and 22 and two-ninths duty on British pianos, or pianos coming from Australia or Canada, if there are any manufactured there, and I do not think there are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time last year it was put up to us that the motor tax was prohibitive, penal, impossible, and would ruin the motor trade.  But what are the facts? That the unfortunate people who must walk along the street are almost covered with dust now, by reason of the number of motor-cars that we have got. I suppose one would be told last year that the motor trade was on the point of collapse by reason of the tax that <Col N="2461" /> was put upon English cars and the prohibitive, excessive, penal amount of the tax upon foreign cars; and the case was put to us that by reason of the fact that we are not manufacturing here, these particular impositions should be removed.  Our fiscal system must be necessarily different from that of Great Britain.  There is there a great, rich country, having a big balance of revenue at the end of the year.  Our taxation per head here is relatively much less than theirs.  We have no plutocrats of the type of Deputy Figgis, on whom we can draw for huge sums in income tax, super-tax, and so on, and we must be content with drawing for taxation on such Deputies as Deputy Johnson, who requires a piano to while away the weary hours of night.  This is a luxury and protective tax at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there are many people prepared to pay £100 for an instrument which would amuse Deputy Figgis in the late hours of the night, who would refuse to pay £110 for the same instrument.  Thirty-three and a third per cent. on £80, the initial cost, makes £26 13s. 4d.  The Deputy will correct me if I am wrong, as he is very smart at figures.  That would leave the price £106 13s. 4d.  The Deputy, by this particular amendment, wishes to take off, in the case of a German piano&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;£14 13s. 4d., being the difference between the duty at thirty-three and one-third per cent. and at 15 per cent., and the instrument would then cost £92.  The case is put to us that, by reason of this extraordinary concession on the part of the Minister for Finance, great business is going to be done by all the piano dealers in this country. I hesitate to adopt that view.  I do not think that any person is going to baulk at an expenditure of £115 who is prepared to pay £100 for the same article. Imagine any man going home to his wife and explaining to her that he cannot possibly afford £115 for some particular instrument which he considers he could buy well at £100.  Fifteen pounds is going to disturb the domestic happiness that is there!  Deputy Figgis knows very well that he could not <Col N="2462" /> make an excuse like that to his wife. I think, in the circumstances, there is really no case made for this amendment by Deputy Figgis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two qualities of the President I always admire. One is his courage and the other is the speed with which he gets off untenable ground.  He intervened in this debate just in time to prevent the Minister for Finance from saying that this is a revenue duty and that he could not abate it.  Now, the President has put an entirely different complexion on the case.  This is not a revenue duty.  It is a protective duty.  The President is quite right when he says it is a protective duty.  Nobody would ever think of putting a revenue duty of thirty-three and a third per cent. on anything but whiskey, which is a sort of slave of Ministers for Finance.  This is a protective duty.  It is a duty to encourage the manufacture of Irish pianos.  It must be judged on that basis.  Taking it on that basis and judging it on that basis, it has been an utter failure for eight years.  It was introduced in 1916. Ever since then, the potential Irish piano manufacturer has had the benefit of this protection, and he has not taken advantage of it.  The President has not told us that down in Thomastown or Callan, or somewhere in the backwoods of his constituency, there are dark piano manufactories where pianos are being secretly manufactured for the Irish market.  Unless that is the case, what is the advantage of a protective duty, especially in relation to an industry which does not exist in the country, which we have no evidence is likely to exist, and which more than almost any industry in the world requires extraordinarily-skilled labour.  I would prefer Deputy Johnson's theory about getting motor mechanics to build houses if he can persuade the building trades unions to help him.  That is a more tenable proposition than the proposition to take the unemployed off the streets and set them to make pianos. Whatever the result will be, it will not be harmony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the President's justification for maintaining this duty at its present scale.  It is easy to talk of music as a luxury.  I contest that.  I hope <Col N="2463" /> Deputy Johnson will contest it, unless his newly-found nationalism&mdash;perhaps I should not say newly-found&mdash;so emphatically expressed this afternoon, leads him to contend that the only claim to harmony is to be found in the Irish pipes.  Unless that is so, I think Deputy Johnson will agree with me that music is more than a luxury. Music is an art.  Music is culture.  I am quite certain that neither the Minister for Finance nor the President would have come here to defend this tax if it had not been that it was imposed by the British Government in 1916&mdash;and imposed for a definite and specific reason.  Deputy Figgis's history might have been more exact.  It was imposed, as the President said, in 1916, not against German pianos, which had few facilities for coming into Great Britain at the time, but against American pianos&mdash;against pianos which were being brought across the Atlantic and which were taking up shipping space that was extremely valuable at that time.  Shipping space being valuable, it was necessary to curtail the import of certain articles, and pianos were included amongst those.  If that had not been the case, I am quite sure that we should not be taxing pianos now.</P>
    <P>I take a parallel case.  The Minister is not putting any duty on tennis rackets.  A tennis racket is an instrument of sport.  We do not manufacture anything in that line, perhaps, except hurley sticks.  Tennis rackets are, perhaps, luxuries, but I cannot picture Deputy Johnson raising the fiery cross and saying: &ldquo;Hands off the poor man's tennis racket.&rdquo;  Sport is good and exercise is good.  So also music is good and there is no justification for a tax on musical instruments which does not exist in respect of instruments of sport produced outside this country. The reason&mdash;and the only reason&mdash;we have this tax is because it was an old British duty.  The Minister has given us one concession in taking off the tax on gramophone records.  I am grateful to him for that.  But I do say that he must have regard to the fact that ever since his Budget was framed&mdash; though we are not bound to follow British Chancellors of the Exchequer&mdash;<Col N="2464" /> where there was a 33? per cent. duty in Northern Ireland there is now no duty at all.  That is a suggestion&mdash; and perhaps no more than a suggestion &mdash;that it might be wise to go some distance to meet not the contrast but the scale of expenditure and the cost of one of those instruments which makes people's lives happier.  Those who are fond of music and who are deprived of it know that it is as great a deprivation as being deprived of food or drink. To make the contrast between Northern Ireland and the Saorstát not too great is, I think, the task of a statesman, and because this amendment of Deputy Figgis will do something to that end and will diminish the disparity that now exists, I think it is worthy of the support of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>His arguments were singularly directed to me in this matter, as though I were responsible for this particular tax.  I am open to conviction on this amendment. But it is not directed to pianos only. If the duty of 33? per cent. is protective in respect of pianos, I gather, from Deputy Cooper, it has not had so far a protective effect, and it has not led to the manufacture of pianos, or even the assembling of pianos in this country. In that case it is for the Minister to prove that the revenue value of the duty is worth taking into account, having regard to the advantage of the cheaper pianos.  The Deputy says &ldquo;music is not a luxury.&rdquo;  Unfortunately it is.  It ought not to be.  If the reduction of the duty on pianos was going any distance towards making it less a luxury, then, in view of the absence of its protective effect, I would be in favour of the reduction.  But it is for the Minister to say what the value of the duty is in respect of pianos.  The language of the amendment includes musical instruments of all kinds.  If I read the newspaper advertisements aright some of the musical <Col N="2465" /> instruments&mdash;and I am now giving Deputy Bryan Cooper the credit of considering that Irish pipes produce music&mdash;include pipes manufactured in Ireland.  In this general sweeping amendment it speaks of the duty on musical instruments being reduced from 33? per cent. to 15 per cent.  It means that the protective value of the present duty on bagpipes is lost.  The question is whether it is better to forego the protective value of the duty on pianos for the sake of cheaper Irish pipes, or whether it is better to maintain the duty on the pipes for the purpose of maintaining the industry of pipe-making.  I do not know whether there are any other musical instruments, that are more democratic, manufactured in Ireland.  It has been said very frequently within the last few years that the most exhilarating and pleasant music heard in Ireland was the the short staccato sound produced by the firing of a revolver.  That may be called music; I do not appreciate that kind of music, and I do not know whether there is any protective value in these duties.  But the inclusion of all musical instruments seems to me to mar the value of this amendment from the point of view of assisting the development of an Irish industry.  There is a possibility, I think, of developing an industry in that kind of music, or the instruments for producing that kind of music which is growing in popularity in this country.  But if we pass that kind of amendment we are reducing the protective value of these duties.  Ought we to do so for the sake of cheaper pianos for a small number of people?  I do not think that the number of pianos that is going to be sold is going to be reduced very much by the change from 33? per cent. to 15 per cent.  But I think nobody has the information available which will help us to decide that question except the Minister for Finance himself.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like to deal with the point that Deputy Johnson made.  I am glad in a way that he touched upon that point, that the amendment in its present form might conceivably destroy some of the protective value of the duty as it stands <Col N="2466" /> at the present moment.  I think that is inconsiderable, because it is merely a drafting point.  There is only one instrument which is made.  That, I believe is the favourite instrument of the President.  I do not know whether he plays it himself.  I cannot imagine him marching up and down his galleries playing the Irish war pipes.  I have heard him doing it metaphorically.  But actually I have not.  I am told by those who are in the trade that they are quite prepared to have that protection removed and still to deal with their present business, and that the total gain would be quite considerable.  I had an enormous admiration for Deputy Cooper.  I generally have an enormous admiration for him, but particularly on this occasion I admired Deputy Cooper's courage going in on that question of music in homes, that might, even by a small matter of £15 or £20, be induced to purchase a piano that would otherwise be without one.  I do know that in England you have the average artisan's home with its piano, but you are not likely to get it in Ireland while this duty prevails here.</P>

      <P>I do not think he is, but he will be less able to afford it if the duty makes it more expensive than in England.  I remember during, I think, the education debates last year, that Deputy Johnson developed a very strong and very powerful argument in the Dáil as to the necessity for the cultivation of more than the ordinary bread and butter aspect of life within the homes of the poor here in Ireland.  I did not touch upon that.  I did not deal with it, but I do desire to do so.  I frankly confess that I fear to do so at the last moment, feeling that an argument like that might not perhaps be appreciated to its full value by the President.  But seeing that it has been mentioned, I tread in where Deputy Cooper has shown the way first.  That in itself is an aspect of the case that we ought to remember.  Anyway, my information is, that information has been put, with detailed figures, before the Minister for Finance, who will be able to reply to <Col N="2467" /> the question that I put to him on that point.  That is, if it is not the case, owing to the circumstances that have arisen during the past six or seven weeks, that there will be a throwing of people into the unemployment market if the incidence of this duty is not lowered; and, secondly, if it is not the case that the trade has guaranteed him an equal receipt of revenue if the tax be reduced to 15 per cent.?</P>

We hear the same statements here, but these do not impress me at all.  I had not and could not have any guarantee that if the tax were reduced the receipts would remain the same.  Deputy Cooper said that during the past eight years no Irish manufacturer of pianos had manifested himself.  So far as the protective effect is concerned of any of these duties, they have really been in existence in this country for the past year only.  Because so long as this country was in one fiscal entity with England, which is a much more highly developed country, these duties were certainly no advantage to us from the protective point of view.  I remember seeing an Irish made or Irish built piano.  I do not know whether pianos really could be produced here, even though a great many of the essential parts were imported in such a way as to compete on the market. It is possible they might.  In any case there has not really been time for us to see.</P>

      <P>Drums are produced up there, and I suppose they are produced in other parts of the country as well, and we might discourage the making of various types of musical instruments if we reduced this duty.  We get some £35,000 a year in revenue. It is not much, no doubt, but in present circumstances there are certain considerations in dealing with it as revenue.  If Deputy Figgis' amendment were to get general support, I would much rather drop the tax altogether. If we reduce the tax it would reduce the revenue by roughly one half and it would not be worth the trouble of collecting.  There is a certain amount of trouble in the collection of the duty.  I know the people in the trade do not want this.  I regard this as simply a plea from a small number of people who, owing to recent changes in the course of trade, and fluctuations of prices, find themselves up against certain difficulties.</P>
      <P>In all trades you have certain fluctuations, and we do not alter our system of taxation to meet every little momentary fluctuation of that sort.  In my opinion it would be better to let the tax remain; it may lead to the making of some instruments here. There has not yet been time, with our own Customs system in operation, to see what can be done.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGarry, who is unavoidably absent, I desire to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert immediately after the word &ldquo;music,&rdquo; lines 20 and 26, in sub-sections (1) and (2), the words &ldquo;and on cinematograph films,&rdquo; and in sub-section (2) to delete the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; in line 26, and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;duties,&rdquo; and to delete the word &ldquo;was,&rdquo; line 27, and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;were.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in this case the duties will not be regarded by the President or the Minister for Finance as of a protective nature.  According to my information, the duties were originally imposed by the Finance Act of 1915. The main purpose of putting on duties at the time was to stop the flow of money from the then United Kingdom to America.  I also understand that as a result of the British Budget, the duties will be removed in England in August next.  It is only right and proper to expect when the duties have been removed there that the same treatment should be meted out <Col N="2470" /> to the people suffering because of the duties still in operation here.</P>
    <P>I am informed that those engaged in the film industry are in a very bad way, that a number of places have closed down, and that others have threatened to close down as a result of the duties.  Those duties eventually find their way to the people who patronise the picture houses.  Deputy Figgis seems to think that the only consolation for the poor man is the procuring of a piano at reduced rates.  I say that the only popular form of entertainment is either listening to a barrel organ in Ringsend or Moore Street, or to the speeches of prominent Ministers in bye-elections. As it is not very likely that we will have bye-elections in the near future, that is a reason why the Minister should consider this amendment.</P>
    <P>I understand that representations on the matter have been made to the Minister and that the grievances under which the people engaged in the industry are suffering have been put before him in detail.  I dare say that if Deputy McGarry were here he would be able to go into the matter in more detail.  Seeing, however, that it has been explained to the Minister by a deputation representing the trade, I am sure he has all the facts at his disposal to enable him to say whether the suggestions in this amendment are fair or otherwise.</P>

      <P>The Film Renters Irish Advisory Committee last year made the mistake of telling the President that unless this duty were remitted they would go into bankruptcy, and the film and kinematograph industry would be destroyed; they even put that on paper, which was an indiscreet thing, for the industry managed to carry on.  The trouble here seems to be that there are far too many renters for the number of films to be imported; there seems to be a comparatively big number of renters operating on a very small number of films.  I think that is the root of the trouble.  The amount of duty received by us is not very large, but it is easily collected.  The films mostly go through Dublin, and in any case they would come here for censorship, <Col N="2471" /> so it is a duty that is neither costly nor troublesome to collect.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the relief, if granted, would go to the picture houses or even to the exhibitors, much less to the public.  It seems to me that there is an unduly large number of renters operating a very small market, and these would be able to maintain their prices and live upon a very small market.  It seems to me that that would be the effect of remitting this duty.</P>

      <P>I beg to move Amendment 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 20, after the word &ldquo;music&rdquo; and inside the bracket insert the words &ldquo;and motor cars, including motor bicycles and motor tricycles, also accessories and component parts of motor cars, motor bicycles and motor tricycles,&rdquo; and in sub-section (2), line 26, to insert after the word &ldquo;music&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the duty on motor cars, including motor bicycles and motor tricycles, and also the duty on accessories and component parts of motor cars, motor bicycles and motor tricycles,&rdquo; and to delete the word &ldquo;was,' line 27, and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;were.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to seek for the remission of what are known as the &ldquo;McKenna Duties.&rdquo; These duties are at present imposed on motor cars, motor cycles and motor accessories.  The Minister for Finance is aware that they were imposed in 1915 by the British Government, not as protective or revenue duties, but for the purpose of impeding the importation of American cars into England. As Deputy Cooper explained, that was done for the purpose of saving shipping space, which at that time was very valuable.  When the Irish Government took over the British fiscal system they retained these duties.  In England the duties have an advantage which they have not got here.  They have an advantage in England from the point of view of those who are in favour of protective duties.  They afford protection to the English manufacturer of motor cars.  As the Minister knows, we have practically no firms in Ireland <Col N="2472" /> which manufacture motor cars. The only exception is that of the Ford Company in Cork.  In Ireland, to all intents and purposes, these duties remain as revenue duties, and I think it has been acknowledged by the Minister for Finance that he is retaining them for that purpose.  On a previous occasion the Minister, I think, stated that the revenue from these duties amounts to something like £300,000 a year, and that in the present financial state of the country he could not afford to abandon that amount of revenue. In my opinion the advantages which are derived by this revenue do not in any way correspond to the disadvantages which the public suffers because of the increased cost of motor cars in Ireland.  I think it is a fact that by far the greater number of motor cars in this country are used for purely business and productive purposes, and that only a very small proportion of them are used for luxury purposes.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a poor country.  We are certainly poorer individually than the people in the United States, and yet a motor car in Ireland costs more than a similar type of car in America.  If the catalogues are referred to I think it will be found, in the case of the cheaper type of cars, that they are from fifty to eighty per cent. dearer in Ireland than they are in the United States.  My contention is that this has a direct effect in impeding the trade in the manufacture of motor cars. Motor cars are very much used down the country for the purpose of conveying people around on their business. When the cost of using or hiring motors for business purposes is high, it is natural to expect, of course, that this high cost will be added to the business cost, and the inevitable result is that all this tends to keep up the present high cost of living.  I maintain also that these duties are calculated to impede the development of tourist traffic in Ireland.  We are all very anxious, I am sure, to develop that traffic, but if the cost of transit is maintained at the present high rate as regards the employment of motor cars, that result will not be achieved.  We find in countries which are dealing with tourists in a large way that the latter are catered for by being able to obtain <Col N="2473" /> motor cars at a cheap rate.  It is natural, of course, that tourists should go to the countries where expenses are low.  I think that will be found to be the case in fashionable holiday resorts, such as the Isle of Man and in places of that sort.  I understand that motor cars can be imported free into the Isle of Man.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar state of affairs prevails in the North of Ireland, and the result will be that tourist traffic in the North will have an advantage over the traffic here.  In the North they will be able to provide tourists with a cheaper mode of conveyance than people in the Saorstát will be able to provide.  If these duties were only to be applied to those who use motor cars as a luxury I would not be inclined to put down this amendment.  If the Minister were to make inquiries and have a census taken of the motor cars in the country, I think he would find that very few indeed are used for luxury purposes.  Motor cars are now an absolute essential of ordinary business life.  They are as essential as trains, and as the ordinary conveyances that we have in the country.  Anything that tends to increase the cost of the use of motor cars will, in my opinion, tend to impede the motor trade, and I believe will tend to impede the progress of this State in general. I think, as regards his general policy, that the Minister for Finance is a bit short-sighted.  Regardless of the fact that he must balance his Budget, I think it would be worth his while to take his courage in both hands and remove these duties.  If he were to do so I think he would make in increased licence duties a good deal more than he would lose by the remission of these duties.  These are my reasons for moving the amendment.  I think its adoption would serve a very useful purpose, and that the advantage to be gained by the remission of the duties would be out of all proportion to the loss that might be sustained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan takes a very optimistic view of this. His point of view is that if we were to reduce the income tax and the tax on motor cars that people would drink more beer and that we would get as <Col N="2474" /> good a revenue.  I cannot see how that would happen.  We are getting a sum of about £250,000 from motor taxes.  If we do not get that revenue there we will have, as I said before, to get it elsewhere.  We could have dropped the tax on motor cars and let the tea duty stand as it was, but I do not think that would be a right line to proceed on. The Deputy stated that motor cars are used purely for business purposes.  I know a few people who have motor cars, but I never knew one who had a car for purely business purposes.  Even the motor lorries are not used for purely business purposes now.  You often see them with seats in them, and we all know that they are used for taking excursion parties from one place to another.  I am not altogether satisfied that the tax is going to fall on business people, whether we put it on motor cars or not.  A motor car that is used for purely business purposes or for trade or husbandry is free, except for the protective duty which we are going to put on motor bodies.  The tax on motor bodies will not hit these people very much.  It seems to me that this is a good tax.  It is easily collected. As I have said about another tax, it is a tax put on people who are well able to bear it.  It does not have the effect of grinding the faces of the poor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister able to approach this question from the point of view that if you are able to get everybody to have a motor car, you would get sufficient revenue to make the main roads suitable for the tourists that we expect to come across to this country?  The effect of this tax raises the price of the motor car to the owners, and reduces the number of <Col N="2475" /> owners.  If you take off the tax you would have a considerably larger number of motor cars, and while the Exchequer would gain £20 each year from each car, they would be enabled to make the main roads practically free.  I consider it would be to the advantage of this country that the use of motor cars should be extended.  It would enable us to get through our business more rapidly, and, as a matter of fact, you would save local taxation by means of the licences that would be paid for the cars.  From that point of view, I think the Minister might consider it. The reasons given by Deputy Heffernan have covered the whole ground, and, having regard to the second point I put, I think the Minister should agree to this exemption.</P>

The price in America of a Ford is 490 dollars, or a little over £100.  Owing to the protective duties we are not getting the benefit of the American price here.  The amount of the duty is added to the price of the Ford cars, and goes into the pocket of the manufacturer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to provide that the chassis of motor cars should be allowed in free of duty.  My reason for this amendment is that there <Col N="2476" /> is actually a business in Ireland which is engaged in the manufacture of motor bodies, and I believe it is the intention of the Minister and the Government to protect that industry.  And now that the Minister and the Government are definitely committed for good and all to protective theories, I am giving them a chance by this amendment to still retain their position, though removing the tax on chassis, so that the foreign chassis can be imported free of duty. The duties will be retained on bodies, and the users of motor cars will find an advantage in the cheap chassis, and have, at the same time, the option of buying an Irish product.</P>

      <P>The arguments already used in support of other amendments apply very much to the two amendments I have just moved.  Amendment No. 10 provides for the free importation of motor cars up to the value of £200, and amendment 11 provides for their free importation from Canada, America and France.  The object is to secure the free importation of the cheaper cars while still retaining the duty upon the dearer ones, and so placing the duty on those who, in the opinion of the Minister, are best able to bear it&mdash;that is those who use motor cars as a luxury.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 20, after the word &ldquo;music,&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and accessories or component parts of motor cars, motor bicycles and motor tricycles to the declared value of not more than one pound in any one consignment or parcel, and which accessories or component parts are to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance required for the purpose of replacement or repairs to motor cars and bicycles in use.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down for the purpose of securing that spare parts and accessories for motor cars and motor cycles to the value of £1, when contained in one parcel, should be allowed to enter the Saorstát free from import duties.  This matter was fully discussed on another stage of the Finance Bill and on the resolutions, and I understood the Minister was willing to give the matter his careful consideration and to try if he could devise some system whereby he could allow these parts to come in free.  I notice that even if he has given consideration to this matter, he has not introduced anything into the Bill that will cover the matter.  I believe it is one of considerable importance, because I believe the motor trade has been greatly impeded by duties on small parts.  Agents who require small parts have to wait a very long time before these parts can <Col N="2478" /> be imported, and there are difficulties and obstructions in the way of their importation.</P>
    <P>Those difficulties may be due to a certain extent to lack of knowledge by the importers themselves, and I think they may be due to the inexperience of the Customs officers, but the fact of the matter is that if a motor agent requires to replace a broken axle in a motor bicycle, or any small part for a bicycle, valued at 2s. 6d. or 5s., he sends across to England and the part does not reach him, perhaps, for a fortnight or three weeks.  There are many such cases.  I have had such an experience myself with regard to a part of a motor bicycle, and I had to wait for three or four weeks.  That is impeding business and trade very much.  There are a great many varieties of motor cars and motor bicycles, and there are a great many different grades of each particular make of motor car, with the result that it is quite impossible for the motor agents to stock a large number of spare parts, because there are cars of one year and another, and parts are different in shape and in price.  I think that this amendment might be accepted and might be made a practical proposition.  I am not quite certain if the wording fulfils the necessary requirements, but, if not, I am sure that the Minister and his draftsmen could embody the idea in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a consultation with the motor trade in reference to the question of spare parts, and I found that really it came down to a proposition on their part that a duty on tyres should be substituted for this duty.  That would require consideration, and certainly I would not propose to take it up at the present stage.  The remission of duty on parts would mean such a very substantial loss in revenue that it would have to be made up by some countervailing duty.  In regard to this much more limited amendment of Deputy Heffernan's, I have stated that very small parts were actually admitted free, where the value of the part is regarded as negligible, or very small.  The same thing applies to such instruments as mouth organs which are simply allowed in as an administrative <Col N="2479" /> concession, but as to allowing in parts to the value of £1, I do not think that that could be done.  Once you come to that you would require investigation in regard to it, because you would require to make sure that the articles were not running to the value of £2, £3, or £4, and the delays that the Deputy complains of would certainly not be minimised.  There were, probably, certain delays in the past; if the Customs authorities were to any extent responsible for them they are being got over, and I am prepared to take every step to have that overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we started a Customs barrier where there had been practically no Customs barrier before, and we really had to go into the work.  The Customs people were not assisted by any experienced body from the Customs point of view, by shippers, or by any experienced body of importers. There was a certain amount of inexperience by all hands.  There was a certain amount of unwillingness to take the steps necessary to get goods through, and there was a disposition rather to find fault, saying that the Customs system ought never to have been set up, and all that.  Necessarily, all that caused delay.  Delay was also caused by the fact that in certain ports there was no actual physical accommodation in sheds that would be necessary in view of the Customs system, and that may have caused delay.  If goods are not displayed it is sometimes difficult to find them.  They must be spread out properly.  It is difficult to find a consignment otherwise, and delays might take place.  I hope that all the people concerned will co-operate to do away with delays, and anything that I can do in this matter of motor parts to obviate delays I will do.  I do not think that the Deputy's suggestion would obviate delays.  When you come to goods of the value of £1 where you would have a duty, if it was not a preferential rate, of 6s. 8d., you have to make sure that you are not giving more than you intend to give, and you will have to have examinations to ascertain values in these cases, and I do not think this would carry you any further.  The most you could do would be in regard <Col N="2480" /> to a routine thing like a nut, which is of negligible value, but I do not think we could extend this to anything like the value of £1.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>(1)  A Customs duty at the rate of three and three-fifths pence on the pound shall be charged, levied, and paid on all sugar confectionery imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 26th day of April, 1924, in addition to any duty which may be chargeable in respect of any spirits contained in such sugar confectionery but in lieu of any duty which might otherwise be chargeable on any other ingredient contained in such sugar confectionery.</P>
      <P>(2)  In the case of fruit (not liable to duty as fruit) in syrup, containing not more than thirty-three and one-third per cent. of sweetening matter, the duty under this section shall be charged and levied at the reduced rate of one and one-fifth pence on the pound in lieu of the full rate of three and three-fifths pence.</P>

    <P>(3)  In this section the expression &ldquo;sugar confectionery&rdquo; means confectionery made from or containing sugar or other sweetening matter and not containing cocoa or saccharin, and includes breads, biscuits, cakes, cake mixtures, puddings and powders (other than medicinal powders) sweetened with sugar or other sweetening matter except saccharin, and not containing cocoa, and also sweetmeats, caramel, jams, marmalades, <Col N="2481" /> and jellies not containing cocoa or saccharin, and also peels and fruits candied, crystallised or otherwise preserved with sugar or any other sweetening matter except saccharin, and not containing cocoa.</P>
    <P>(4)  The provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this section with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and as though sugar confectionery as defined in this section were included in the Second Schedule to that Act in the list of goods to which five-sixths of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), after the word &ldquo;matter,&rdquo; in line 57, to insert the words &ldquo;and not contained in bottles.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to remedy what I think is an omission.  In the course of earlier discussions the question arose as to the duty on tinned fruits and syrup, and a remission was agreed to when it was pointed out what the effect on prices of the tinned fruits would be.  These are chiefly imported from California and semi-tropical places, they contain a considerable amount of syrup, and consequently the weight is very high compared with the value.  In the course of the discussions on that proposal the Minister pointed out that it was not his intention to make any remission in the case of bottled fruit.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to tinned fruit, the position is that fruit in syrup imported into this country consists of bottled fruit and tinned fruit.  Bottled fruit, to some extent, is manufactured or prepared in this country, but a great deal of bottled fruit comes in from Great Britain.  It seems to me that there is no particular reason why any bottling that may be required for the consumption that takes place in this country should not be carried on here, and it is desirable that that particular industry should be stimulated.  The effect will ultimately be to stimulate <Col N="2482" /> the growing of fruit here, as well as the industry of bottling.</P>
    <P>Then:</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in the case of tinned fruit the duty would be much too steep, and I propose in the case of tinned fruit, which cannot be produced here, but not in the case of bottled fruit, that the amount of duty should be reduced by, say, two-thirds.</P>
    <P>And further:</P>
    <P>As I say, the duty may be a little steep in the beginning on bottled fruit, but I see no reason at all why bottling should not be carried on here.</P>
    <P>It is pretty definite that the Bill as drafted does not make any exception or differentiation between tinned fruits and bottled fruits, but as a direct consequence of the encouragement given by the Minister, and the definite statement he made at the time the Resolution was passed, a firm in or near the city have gone to considerable expenditure in the expectation of largely developing their bottling industry in the coming season.  Now it is found that the Bill does not make provision for any differentiation between bottled fruits and tinned fruits.  The omission, I think and hope, will be explained as being the result of a mistake.  I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment possibly with the addition of the word &ldquo;glass&rdquo; to bottles.  I think that should be inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter about which I am in some little doubt.  It is true that at the time I made that statement I did not intend to propose any reduction in the case of bottled fruits from the full duty.  Then another consideration was suggested to me to which I felt some weight should be given, and the result was that the clause appears in its present form.  If it had only been the case of what I might call genuine bottling of fresh fruit I would not have thought of reducing the rate of duty on bottled fruits, for I regard it as extremely desirable that we should encourage the bottling industry, and particularly the growing of fruit here, but a great deal of bottled fruit in the market is not really home-grown fruit at all.  You <Col N="2483" /> will see in any shop window bottles of assorted fruits, containing peaches, pears and cherries.  These fruits are imported in tins.  They will be brought in in that way, and pay 1 1-5d., and if the duty on bottled fruits is maintained at the full rate of 3 1-5d., it was suggested to me that there would be a temptation to both retailers and manufacturers to play on the fact that fruit bottled outside the country would pay 3 3-5d. duty, and to charge on the fruit that had actually come in tins, although sold in bottles, and pass the difference on the duties on to the public.  There then remains the fact that a charge of 1 1-5d. on the bottled fruit, when the sugar duty would not perhaps be more than one farthing or the one-third of a penny, would give a certain protection to the genuine bottler of home-grown fruit.  But the form of the section as it stands would not leave the home-grown bottler without some protection, and on the other point it would not provide this temptation to pass a duty on to the public which had not actually been paid.  As I say, it is a matter on which I am in some doubt as to what line I should take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Mininster makes may have a certain value but not very much.  It may be true that there is an importation of certain classes of fruit, which are probably not grown in great quantities here, but which may be encouraged, by the way. Even from those, if they are brought into the country, there is at least a certain revenue, and in addition you have the bottling industry getting encouragement, and possibly, although not under the present scheme, you may have the bottles made here after another year.  The general fact is that it is the smaller fruits that are bottled, and the larger fruits that are tinned.  I think that in the case which the Minister puts forward, even though that temptation remains, and is succumbed to, no great harm is done, but you will not have those small fruits sold as tinned fruits, and if you have, you have got the duty on tinned fruits, but you will have them re-packed and bottled, and you will have the advantage <Col N="2484" /> in this country of that bottling industry developed and assisted, and I think you will directly encourage the growing of the smaller fruits that are at present imported.  I fail to see there is much weight in the argument that the importation in tins of these small fruits is going to be any loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, perhaps, misunderstood me.  I do not anticipate that the smaller fruits will be imported in tins at all.  The fact is that there is a great deal of bottling done of the ordinary Californian fruits which come in under the tinned section.  The syrup is discarded, and a clearer syrup is used, and it is packed into assortments in the bottles.  You can see them in a great many shop windows; in fact, I noticed them very frequently of late.  The actual Californian fruits are assorted into bottles, and the thing that suggested itself to me is that you avoid the temptation of putting on these &ldquo;bottled prices,&rdquo; although the fruit had paid only the tinned fruit duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the main competition is between Irish bottled fruit and English bottled fruit, and that the great majority of people who buy Californian fruits will buy them tinned rather than bottled, but in any case if the rebottling and regarding is done here there is a distinct advantage, and there is no great grievance to the consumers, because they have a choice of buying the same fruits in tins&mdash;it is only that particular fancy that there is for being able to see what you are buying in the bottles.  It is then a case of whether the bottling should be done in Ireland of Californian fruits, or whether the bottling should be done in England of the same fruits, for I expect the practice the Minister has spoken of prevails in England as well as in Ireland.  I think the fact that elaborate undertakings have been entered into on the strength of the Minister's statement, and the Resolution we passed, would justify the acceptance of the amendment, or some form of amendment which would cover the same purpose, at least for the year, inasmuch as these preparations had been made on the strength of the statement made here.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), page 8, line 5, after the word &ldquo;caramel&rdquo; to delete the words &ldquo;jams, marmalades and jellies,&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;cocoa,&rdquo; line 9, to add the words &ldquo;jams, marmalades and jellies shall be subject to the ordinary custom duty on the declared sugar contents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment opens up the whole protective question again, but I do not intend to enter into an argument along these lines.  The intention of the amendment is to see that jams, marmalades and jellies come in free of any duty, except the ordinary duty which the sugar contents should bear.</P>
      <P>The idea lying behind this amendment is that jams and marmalades are essential as a food item for the poorer class in the country, who very often substitute these articles for butter, and the effect of the duties at present placed on them will be to increase the cost of these articles and further increase the cost of living on people who use them.  It is purely a protective duty, and the question arises whether it is protective or not.  I understand that there are many manufacturers in this country who make jam, and who are in a position to compete with foreign manufacturers.  The raw material is in the country if they will use it.  I see no reason why this duty should be retained.  It will have an effect on the increased cost of jams used by the very poor classes, and it will have the effect of giving protection to manufacturers who, in my opinion, should not require protection.</P>

      <P>Apart from the fact that there has been a very considerable import of jam into this country in the past&mdash;jams which might have been made here&mdash;that this is a country in which jam-making might very well be carried on on an extensive scale, and that the increase in the making of jam will tend to increase the amount of fruit grown in this country, there is also the fact that I would dislike very much to return in the case of these confectionery articles to a charge on the <Col N="2486" /> sugar contents with all its delays and the continual analysis and tests which it involves.  There is no doubt that we would need to have, in the future, a large number of small consignments of different sorts of confectionery coming in.

      <P>I had occasion before the Committee of Inquiry to express my own personal sense of national humiliation in respect of circumstances in which the inquiry had been called for, the grudging manner in which it was set up, and then, when it was set up, the fact that Ministers who had made very serious charges or implied very serious charges against very prominent military officers in the State did not come forward before that inquiry to substantiate those charges.  The Minister who came forward, having made charges here, simply dealt before that Committee of Inquiry with what I might call the scum of our very material work for the last two years.  Seeing this Report as it stands now, I feel that it is an additional national humiliation.  Seeing the make-up of this Report, and realising that it is a Report of a very important matter after six weeks' examination of the subject, six weeks' cogitation by an intelligent Committee, and after two weeks in which to prepare their report as a result of the evidence that had been before them, I feel that the Report in its form and in the way in which the Committee has done its work of reporting, is humiliating nationally.  The curt advice of the Executive Council that they have decided not to publish the evidence <Col N="2491" /> that was before the Committee is humiliating, and the further curt notice of theirs that the Chairman's reservations with regard to completeness is also not to be published, is humiliating.  When the President tells us here to-day that this Report, which has been with them ten days, has not yet been considered by the Executive Council, in spite of the very important matters from the point of view of the State with which it deals, that is a further national humiliation.  I think it is very discreditable that no consideration has been given to the position of the three General Officers whose cases have been dealt with in this Report, considering the Report has been with the Executive Council for ten days past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report itself, no doubt, reports positively with regard to what it calls one section of officers in the Army, but if the other section that is referred to here is understood to be the General Officers against whom such serious charges have been brought, the only positive statement I find in this Report with regard to those General Officers is that contained in paragraph 14, where the Committee speak of their failure to appreciate their position as servants of the State.  I want particularly to examine that, and also paragraphs 24, 25 and 26 from the point of view of the three General Officers concerned in this matter.  I want to call attention to the statement at the end of paragraph 14, which speaks of two sections of Army officers.  I take it one section is the Tobin group, and I am taking it the other section is meant to be General Sean McMahon, Lieutenant-General O'Sullivan, Lieutenant-General Sean O'Murthuille, and perhaps myself.  I want to ask why the four, say, of us, are bracketed with what is called the Tobin group, and why we are called two sections of Army officers.  The attitude of one section of officers, that is the Tobin group, in certain matters is set out in paragraphs 8 and 9.  Paragraph 8 says: &ldquo;That the organisation of which they were members did not regard the Army as a non-political servant of the State, but as an engine to be used if necessary, and to be kept in a condition <Col N="2492" /> to be used, for the purpose of obtaining personal and political objectives.&rdquo; Paragraph 9 says: &ldquo;That they contemplated the use of the Army, so controlled, for the purpose of imposing their views upon the Civil Government.&rdquo; I want to know are we bracketed as a second section with the Tobin group, because there is no indication that our outlook was tinged in any way with the outlook attributed to the Tobin group in those two paragraphs, and if not, I want to know in respect of what feeling or actions of ours are we so bracketed.  The President was in actual touch with the members of the Army Council in many matters, and with the Chief-of-Staff.  He was in direct touch with the Adjutant-General. He was in direct touch with him when he was a co-Deputy for the Kilkenny-Carlow constituency, while he was yet an Army officer.  The President has now been more closely in touch with the Army, and I want to know has he found any officer, who may have come under the influence of the Army Council, tinged in any way with the feeling and outlook indicated in paragraphs 8 and 9.</P>
    <P>I want to call attention to the reference to &ldquo;the failure of both to appreciate their positions as servants of the State.&rdquo;  I want to say, for my part, that the three General Officers, as military officers, were absolutely obedient and absolutely subordinate to me both as Commander-in-Chief, when I was Commander-in-Chief, and Minister for Defence, when I was Minister for Defence. They fully appreciated their positions as such, and, I submit, I fully appreciated my position, both as Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces and as Minister for Defence responsible to this Dáil.  If I felt that, at any time of danger to our people and danger to the State here, a charge could be levelled against me that I failed to appreciate my position as a servant of the State.  I would hang my head in shame.  I do not believe that that charge can be levelled against me, any more than it can be levelled against any of the three officers.  I do submit, when you take into consideration the duties that have been imposed upon us for the last two years, and take into consideration that in 1924 the five particular <Col N="2493" /> people&mdash;with their own particular and different traditions&mdash;under the authority of an Irish State here sat on a committee and investigated certain matters concerning the administration of an Irish Army&mdash;that very fact should drive home very deeply the realisation that those who were responsible for the Irish Army during the last two years&mdash;men who had stood at its birth years before&mdash; were very sensible of their position as servants of the State, and that they very loyally and effectively carried out the duties imposed upon them as such.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to paragraphs 24, 25 and 26, and to draw particular attention to these paragraphs.  I want to ask thoughtful Deputies to consider what could have been the mental processes as a result of which these paragraphs have been arrived at.  I want to draw attention to the want of symmetry in them.  I want them to ask themselves carefully: What is there suggested against the Chief-of-Staff by way of charge?  What is there suggested against the Adjutant-General? And, what is there suggested against the Quartermaster-General?  I admit this is a Report made as a result of very awkward Terms of Reference. The Terms of Reference were pretty wrong, but I would expect more symmetry in the Report of the Committee when dealing with the three officers who are dealt with in these particular paragraphs.  I suggest that the thought embodied in these paragraphs is neither the thought nor the phrasing of a Justice of the Supreme Court; nor the thought or phrasing of a Justice of the High Court; nor the pretty direct thought or phrasing to which we have been accustomed in connection with the exposition of the Railway Bill by the Minister for Industry and Commerce; and I do not think that it suggests the straight or clear thinking of either the soldier or the sportsman.</P>
    <P>We have here in paragraph 24:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No evidence was given before us to justify a charge of muddling, mismanagement or incompetence on the part of the late Chief-of-Staff in carrying out his duties.</P>
    <P>That sounds like a grudging statement to the Executive Council that they had not, unfortunately, been able to put up <Col N="2494" /> anything against this officer.  I want it to be asked, and I want the members of the Committee to ask themselves, why that sentence did not read: &ldquo;The Committee are convinced that a charge of muddling, mismanagement or incompetence on the part of the late Chief-of-Staff in carrying out his duties cannot be sustained.&rdquo;  What would be wrong, from the point of view of any member of the Committee, if it were asked that the paragraph in the Report should be substituted by the one I have suggested? Then, even taking the grudging phraseology of paragraph 24 in respect to the late Chief-of-Staff, I want to know why, in respect to the late Quartermaster-General, and in respect to the late Adjutant-General, the two paragraphs dealing with them should not open by this statement at least: &ldquo;No evidence was given before us to justify the charge of muddling, mismanagement or incompetence on the part of the late Quartermaster-General or the late Adjutant-General, as the case may be, in carrying out his duties.&rdquo;  I want to ask these two questions particularly in connection with the three officers.</P>
    <P>Coming to the general matter of the Report, I want to make some comment on it to show that it is misleading, to show that no person could safely form a judgment on any matter or any paragraph that is in it, as it stands at present, and in the absence of the evidence that we are told we are not to get.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to come to paragraph 2, where it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If this Report is published, the Schedule can be omitted, as some of the witnesses may not desire to have their names appear as having given evidence.</P>
    <P>I want to ask are there perhaps others who do not want to have it known that they did not come forward as witnesses &mdash;persons who had charges to state or suggest here, and who, when they got an opportunity to come forward before this Committee did not come?  I want also, in reference to that paragraph, to direct attention to the sentence which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Committee endeavoured to procure the attendance of all witnesses who seemed likely to give material assistance to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2495" /> Would anybody understand from that sentence that no single General Officer Commanding a Command in the country was summoned before this Inquiry to give evidence?  If not, who were the witnesses that were summoned?  One witness who came forward was an officer who had been in direct touch with the Minister for Home Affairs at the time, behind my back and without my knowledge, and who was reporting and complaining of matters to the Minister that he had not made any complaint of either to the Chief-of-Staff or to myself.  Another witness who came forward, in a very long exposition, which stopped short at the time of the Four Courts, showed that, but for the I.R.B. standing in the way of what was his military policy and proposals at the time, the Civil War would not have happened at all.  Another witness came forward to show how everything should be done now and in the future.  Yet, in the very rough days of January, 1923, when that officer was asked to take up the position of G.O.C. of a particular command, he put forward private and personal reasons for not doing so.</P>
    <P>These were the types of witnesses who did come forward.  Not a single G.O.C. was brought forward.  You have to ask yourself what type of witness the Committee sent for in order to give them materials to assist them.  In the same paragraph it says that at the outset the Committee invited the three General Officers and myself to make a statement, but that this invitation was definitely refused.  The Committee might have amplified that by saying that I put it up to the Committee that certain pretty definite charges were suggested against us, and that when we had dealt with these charges, when we had seen these charges, and had an opportunity of rebutting them&mdash;in the light of these charges being either proved or rebutted&mdash;we were prepared to make every possible statement that would be of assistance to the Committee.</P>
    <P>I submit that paragraph three is a pretty fair vindication of the officers who were in charge of the Army.  I would simply like to add in reference to the sentence&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fact that there had not been <Col N="2496" /> sufficient time to allow of the development of a non-political and purely soldier type of mind in the Army&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that, thanks to the efforts of the late Army Council, there was developed in the Army a non-political and purely soldier type of mind.  I think everybody realises that when they see how the Army stood through the circumstances that gave rise to the setting up of this Committee of Inquiry.  In the last sentence of that paragraph the Report says:</P>
    <P>We believe that in all the circumstances the Army Council honestly endeavoured to deal fairly with the question of demobilisation.</P>
    <P>I submit that they are begging the question there.  The question is, did they deal fairly with it?</P>
    <P>In paragraph 15 the statement is made:</P>
    <P>General O Murthuile has stated to us that the I.R.B. was originally reorganised to prevent the Irregulars from getting control of it if it were left derelict, and using its name to stir up disaffection against the State.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Originally reorganised!&rdquo; I do not know what members of the Dáil are going to imply from that.  I gave evidence before the Committee that I was in touch with Lieutenant-General O Murthuile seven days, I think, after the burial of General Collins, in connection with certain matters connected with the I.R.B. organisation that required to be dealt with immediately as the result of General Collins' death. I would like to draw attention to the fact that that is all that is stated in the report, as far as I could see, going through it hurriedly, with regard to General O Murthuile and the I.R.B. Nevertheless, we find in paragraph 5 a statement of the Committee:</P>
    <P>We have already dealt with the actions of the late Quartermaster-General in connection with the reorganisation of the I.R.B.</P>
    <P>It is not so.  In paragraph 15 the so-called reorganisation of the I.R.B. is spoken of as &ldquo;a disastrous error of judgment.&rdquo;  If there was any disastrous error of judgment in it, the &ldquo;error of judgment&rdquo; is mine, and not that of any Army officer.  It does not <Col N="2497" /> appear in any place in the Report that the President, Vice-President, and the Minister for Education were aware of what is called this &ldquo;disastrous error of judgment&rdquo; as early as June, 1923.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 17 speaks of an Officers' Board which was originally set up to deal with these matters.&rdquo;  Would anybody reading that Report understand that this General Officers' Board was set up after 700 old men had been demobilised through the ordinary workings of the Staff Section of the Chief-of Staff's Department?  Would they realise that the responsibility of these four General Officers was to make recommendations to the Army Council, and submit names of persons whom they considered might be demobilised?</P>
    <P>In paragraph 18 the Report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The leaders of this organisation believed that they had been tricked.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that suggests powers of belief on the part of the Committee or powers of belief on the part of the Tobin organisation.  At any rate, is that sentence written from evidence?</P>
    <P>We come then to the letters to Major-General Tom Cullen.  Will it be understood from that paragraph, that that letter is taken from my evidence, submitted to the Committee, either before Deputy McGrath made his statement in Mayo, or a certain pamphlet was published here in Dublin?  Will it appear to anyone reading this Report that I, in putting in that letter, put in an introduction running into fourteen foolscap pages, explaining the circumstances that led up to this particular letter?  Will it be understood that I wrote practically a sheet of foolscap explaining that letter, even down to the detail of saying where the inverted commas came from, and why the sentences included in the inverted commas were inserted in that letter?  I do not know what any member of the Dáil will make out of the word &ldquo;representation&rdquo; in the sentence where it says&mdash;</P>
    <P>He held no further communication with them and did not reply to the representation which was put forward on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I want to ask, would it be a breach of confidence on my part, if I brought out a pamphlet saying what I did in that matter?  Would it be within the limits <Col N="2498" /> of the Standing Orders, if I brought what I had to say on this matter in here, and read it in debate or as portion of a statement of any kind?</P>
    <P>In paragraph 20 the discipline of the Army is spoken of as &ldquo;fairly satisfactory.&rdquo; Yet you are told&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;there appears to have been a steady improvement both in discipline and efficiency from the formation of the Army down to the present date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is discipline?  Does it not differ for different people, for different countries, for different circumstances and for different stages of development? In paragraph 21 you are told, because of certain things, that slackness and indiscipline arose.  In respect of what, and amongst whom?  And in paragraph 22 we are told&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The existence of secret societies, factions and political organisations undoubtedly did affect discipline among officers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as I know, the Committee found out that there was an organisation called the I.R.A. and that there was an organisation called the I.R.B.&mdash; that they were two what might be called secret societies.  But is the ordinary member of the Dáil or the ordinary person in the street who reads this sentence in a position to realise that after six weeks' examination of the situation the Committee found that there were two organisations?</P>
    <P>In paragraph 25, in respect of the Quartermaster General, there is a very very mean sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No other charge relevant to our Inquiry was made against him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The late Quartermaster-General has been made the butt of lie and rumour to a very considerable extent, and by the tongues of people placed in very high and very low places.  And if no other charge relevant to the Inquiry was made against him, why is that sentence put in here?  And as it is put in here, what are the charges, if any, that were made against the Quartermaster-General and that were not relevant to the Inquiry?  The Quartermaster-General himself, in my recollection, in his statement, drew attention to a large number of those things, and the Committee, to my recollection, told <Col N="2499" /> him that he should not worry about them.</P>
    <P>Now, in respect to the Adjutant-General, in an attempt to make a case against him, three disciplinary cases were trumped up.  In addition to the Kenmare case and the Mayo case, there was a third, the Limerick case.  Why is it not mentioned here?  Is it because the Limerick case happened to come into my hands personally, and that some letters of mine on the file would show the way in which I was prepared to deal with the case?</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph 27:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;General Mulcahy accepted full responsibility for the decision to drop the Kenmare case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would anybody understand that the Kenmare case, in the circumstances, was sent to the late Attorney-General for decision, and that he gave his decision in a long statement as the result of his examination&mdash;that there was no shred of evidence against Major-Gen-eral O'Daly, who, it was alleged, was mixed up in this case, and that there was no shred of evidence against the second officer, and that there was only a shadow of evidence against the third?  And it will not appear that the parties who had a grievance in this particular case were advised that there were not sufficient grounds for the State to take up a prosecution, and that, if they considered well of it, they had the Law Courts to go to in this particular case.</P>
    <P>As regards paragraph 28, will anybody reading that paragraph understand in the first place that the three members of the Executive Council I mentioned&mdash;the President, Vice-President, and the Minister for Education&mdash;were as early as June, 1923, aware of what we had done with regard to the I.R.B.?  And with regard to the second portion will it be apparent from the Report that my introduction to the Tobin group was as a result of a letter from the President?  And will they have any idea from that Report that the President, the late Minister for Industry and Commerce, and perhaps the Minister for Home Affairs, knew as much about the Tobin group as I did?</P>
    <P>I make those comments to show that <Col N="2500" /> the Report is misleading, and that those members of the Dáil and the public who want to know what was behind or something of what was behind the recent happenings with regard to the Army, and who want to know that in the interests of the public service, can only know it by an examination of the evidence and by an examination of what additional statements the Chairman has to make.</P>
    <P>There is one comment I should like to make with regard to the Chairman's statement, and I would refer you again to paragraph 18 and to the letter to Major-General Tom Cullen.  The Chairman suggested to me in examination or cross-examination that that letter was written by me in order to affect my return at the General Election of August, 1923.  He suggested that I wrote that letter to those officers to keep them off my track while that election was on.  It gives me some inkling as to the mentality of the Chairman. But, nevertheless, I say that what the Chairman has written should be known here, because whatever lessons have to be learned as the result of our actions or our inactions, or as the result of our judgment or want of judgment during the last couple of years, it is to the benefit of the State that they should be learned.</P>
    <P>I realise that the evidence cannot be prepared for printing, cannot be printed, cannot be gone over in proof, cannot be circulated, cannot be digested and discussed here in the Dáil, for some time.  It is three months since the three officers concerned, particularly in this Report, have been removed from their positions in circumstances that we do not require to detail. I take that Report when conscientiously and critically examined as a complete vindication of those officers, and I want to face the practical point at once of their positions.  I feel that after a careful consideration of this Report the members of the Dáil will be satisfied that they can consider the question of the position and the removal of those three officers from their positions, on that Report, without waiting to see the evidence.  Therefore, while prepared to press in every possible way for the printing and circulation of the evidence, I am proposing <Col N="2501" /> to press right away for the doing of justice to the three officers.</P>
    <P>The President said here to-day that the Executive Council had not considered this Report.  I feel that they should have considered it before this. But I feel also, in the circumstances, that it may not be any harm now.  I ask the President and the Executive Council to realise that those three officers have been taken from their positions for political reasons, whether those political reasons are wide political reasons or narrow, whether they are matters of policy or matters of personality. I ask them to realise and to admit that they were taken from their positions for political reasons, and I ask them to admit the great importance of keeping the Army out of politics and of not creating a situation here that every new administration that comes into office shall interfere with the personnel of the Army.  I want them to leave the consideration of the restoration, or otherwise, of these three officers to their commissions and positions, to the Dáil.  I propose, sir, to bring forward three motions here, somewhat to the effect: &ldquo;That this Dáil considers it proper and in the interests of the State that those three officers be restored to the commissions and positions they were taken from in the Army.&rdquo;  I would propose to make these three separate motions, so that the late Chief-of-Staff, the late Adjutant-General, and the late Quartermaster-General, would have their cases dealt with on their own particular merits by the Dáil here.  I would appeal to the President, as I say, and to the Executive Council, to leave this matter to the Dáil, as a whole, in order that it may be dealt with in as wide and national a spirit as possible, in order that you may avoid a position in which it can be said that these officers were either kept out of their positions or were restored to their positions from a Cumann na nGaedheal point of view, from a political party point of view, or from the narrower point of view of, say, the desire of the President personally himself or of the Minister for Justice himself, or of the late Minister for Industry and Commerce himself, or of me personally.  On consideration, I feel that that line of action will commend itself generally. <Col N="2502" /> Recently, in the opening of our Law Courts, we heard reference to the great love of justice that is a tradition in this country.  I suggest that, in all the circumstances of the past three months, the reputation of the Government for justice and for dignity is bound up in the way in which they treat this particular matter.  I want to emphasise the fact, too, that I have never dealt with this matter inside the Party.  In the meeting that took place on the 11th March&mdash;the meeting that was spoken of&mdash;my intervention was simply to state the conditions on which I was prepared to tender my resignation as Minister for Defence.  I left it to such time as it would come to the Dáil to discuss and debate the matter.  I have not discussed the matter inside Party circles. As a matter of fact, I have not attended Party meetings since, and I would say here, for the benefit of members of the Party, that I consider that by my doing so I am, and have been, best discharging my duty of loyalty to that Party, both as a political party and likewise to the individual members of it, who have, as members of the Party, borne such very serious responsibilities since their election as members of this Dáil in 1922.  That is all I wish to say at this particular stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the matter with any fullness, but I want to say that I think it is quite wrong to approach this matter from the point of view of the officers concerned. This report is a report of the Army Inquiry Committee to the Executive Council.  The Executive Council has submitted it, in its wisdom, to the Dáil.  What its purpose was in doing that, I do not know.  It has submitted a report of the Army Inquiry Committee made to the Executive Council, to the Dáil&mdash;an emasculated and partial report.  In submitting the report to us, they tell us they are only submitting part of it.  Now, the meaning and purpose of that I cannot understand. When this matter was raised, in the early stages, a question arose as to the form of the Committee, the constitution of the Committee, and the responsibility of the Committee.  I, for one, urged that it was not the kind of Committee that ought to be set up for the <Col N="2503" /> purpose&mdash;that it was a Committee to be appointed by the Executive Council and to report to the Executive Council, and that it was within their discretion whether they should submit that report to the Dáil or not.</P>
      <P>I want the Dáil to bear in mind that this was an Inquiry into the administration of the Army by the Executive Council.  The Executive Council was responsible for the administration of the Army, and it was the Executive Council that, in fact, was on trial, not the chief officers of the Army, or any officers of the Army.  The report, in so far as it contains anything in relation to the state of the Army, is a report upon the administration of the Army by the Executive Council, which acts as a collective body and is responsible as a collective body to the Dáil.  It was said that that particular form of Committee was to be set up, firstly, because a report was wanted within a fortnight. It took two months.  Secondly, it was said it was to be set up in this form, because it was to have a Chairman and members who were competent to produce a report in reasonable time and in intelligent form.  You have the report.  If a Dáil Committee would not have been able to do as well as that, then I have little hope of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Executive Council has submitted this report, such as it is, and it says that there are certain reservations in the Chairman's report which it thinks well not to publish, and it has decided not to publish the Chairman's report.  Not a simple individual private member of the Committee but the actual Chairman of the Committee, has sent in reservations, as addenda, and the Executive Council says it does not propose to publish, and has decided against publishing&mdash;though it has not considered the report&mdash;the Chairman's reservations.  Why anything was submitted to the Dáil I cannot understand. The report having been submitted, inevitably invites the Dáil to say it cannot consider this report until it has had the complete report. We have reference to the Kenmare case, and the Mayo case, in the report, but we have no information what those cases are or what they <Col N="2504" /> mean.  Therefore, we cannot consider this report with any sense of intelligence at all.</P>
    <P>I submit that so far as the Report is understandable without these reservations, it attempts to minimise the condition that was found in the Army.  It attempts to minimise the seriousness of the case that they found according to the evidence, and at the same time it suggests that there are more serious things behind that they have not touched upon.  It exonerates the Chief-of-Staff, or rather, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, no evidence was submitted to justify the charge of muddling, mismanagement and incompetence on the part of the late Chief-of-Staff in carrying out his duties.</P>
    <P>So far as the Dáil is concerned, whatever the Executive Council may say, we have no right to think of any alleged muddling and mismanagement on the part of that officer.  If there was any charge of muddling, mismanagement and incompetence, it was a charge against the political heads of that Department of the State, and we must beware&mdash;I suggest it to the Dáil for very serious consideration&mdash;of expecting, or asking officers of Departments to be directly answerable to the Dáil.  Whoever is responsible, it is the political head, and I am afraid that Deputy Mulcahy, in his suggestion, is allowing his mind to run in the direction which put the Army Council into the Defence Forces Bill, and which placed them in a position of exceptional strength in relation to the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, it is the Ministers and Secretaries Bill. The Dáil must look to the Executive Council as responsible.  If it is to condemn anybody, it is the Minister, and if the Minister is a member of the Executive Council, it has to condemn the Executive Council.  We shall be making a fatal mistake if we allow ourselves to be discussing the merits of individual officers in the Army because a Report which the Executive Council itself called for in regard to the administration of one of its Departments has been made public.  This <Col N="2505" /> Report has been made public.  It has been presented to the Dáil, and it can only result in a demand for fuller information. Presumably, it has been presented to the Dáil for a purpose. That purpose cannot be fulfilled until much more information is given to us than is presented in this emasculated report.</P>
      <P>I do not know what course can be adopted for the purpose of having a debate on the Report itself; but it seems to me that the suggested course which Deputy Mulcahy throws out is one which can only be taken up if it is in the form of a vote of censure upon the Ministry for its action in dimissing, or asking for the resignation of, certain high military officers.  It can only be in that form, and I would urgently ask the Dáil not to allow a direct discussion upon the question of whether or not any officers of a Department are to be replaced in their positions, but that it should be wholly and solely a question of the administration of these Departments by the heads of these Departments, and by the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to discuss this document at all.  I need hardly say that my attitude towards the Inquiry is well known now; but I thought at least that my attendance before the Inquiry, on an invitation from them, would have been recorded and that the statement I made to them, or at least some of the main portion of it, would have been recorded. I attended there and stated, as I did in the Dáil, that I would not enter the Inquiry and make charges that I could not definitely back up with the necessary evidence, and that evidence was the evidence of the actual officers concerned.  I will only deal with one point which concerns me that was made in the statement by Deputy Mulcahy.  He said that the attitude of some Ministers&mdash;I imagine he referred to me&mdash;was one that he could not understand, in view of those Ministers having made statements here in the Dáil and then failing to attend the Committee of Inquiry to substantiate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to tell the Deputy that he and others with him took very good <Col N="2506" /> care that I would not attend the Inquiry by the very action for which the officers he is speaking of were called upon to resign, when a very determined effort&mdash;I say it deliberately &mdash;was made to start a blaze in this country that probably would never have been put out.  I refer to the raid in Parnell Street.  It was for that action, and that action only, that the officers were asked to send in their resignations. It had nothing to do with the charges made by me here in the Dáil, and it had nothing to do with the charges made before the Committee. It is all very fine at this hour of the day, when he and those with him have failed in the effort to cause trouble, to state coolly that the charges have not been proved against them, and it is all very well to come before the Dáil and leave it to the Dáil to say that those officers shall get back to the positions that they held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have something to say on that, but I understand there will be time given to discuss this whole Report.  I will say something on that portion of it then.  At the moment I would like to draw attention to paragraph 2 of the Report, to which reference has already been made by Deputy Mulcahy.  I would like to back him up in that matter.  The Report says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Committee endeavoured to procure the attendance of all witnesses who seemed likely to give material assistance to them.&rdquo;  I was asked if I could get the officers concerned to give evidence that would help the Committee.  The Committee asked me if I would help them.  I said I would and that I would give the names of officers who I believed took no sides and would be able to throw a good deal of light on the situation, conditional on my getting a guarantee of indemnity for those officers.  I was promised that guarantee of indemnity. I was written to and told that those officers had got the indemnity, but, benefiting by my past experiences, I asked for that in writing, and I got <Col N="2507" /> it in writing.  I am sorry I have not it with me, but it simply meant that there was a guarantee given to them that they would not be criminally prosecuted if they gave evidence.  That was the guarantee given by the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>Then they expected the officers in the Army to come forward and give evidence, knowing that there was no indemnity there for them.  The only indemnity they gave them was that they would not be criminally prosecuted. I see absolutely no reference in the Report to what one might call &ldquo;documentary evidence.&rdquo;  And documents must have been produced.  I say definitely, if documents were produced, one document would have proved who the mutineers were.  That document has already got publication in another form.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I would like to say that there is no document published in any of the pamphlets that have been issued or any of the statements already issued by Deputy McGrath that I had not Previously placed before the Army Committee of Inquiry.  It is only just in keeping with what the Report leaves unsaid as a whole that it does not mention that.  Much of the material that I personally put in was fully documented, and no documents were kept back that referred in any way to the matters into which the Committee were inquiring.</P>

      <P>If I might interrupt just for a moment&mdash;I would not have intervened, but Deputy Mulcahy stood up to make an explanation.  I believe Deputy Davin put a question to me here, before the Inquiry was set up, as to whether some sort of indemnity would not be given to the officers if they attended this Inquiry.  I think I gave him a very safe answer at the time, and I do not think that I improved on that answer in any communication I had with the Committee of Inquiry.  I put this, I believe, to the Army Committee of Inquiry: &ldquo;Do you want an indemnity to such an effect that an officer giving evidence there has got to be promoted to the top, and on every occasion when any question <Col N="2508" /> of indemnity respecting him is to be given, has he got to step up?&rdquo;  That was my answer, and I certainly do repudiate any attempt at misleading or giving wrong guidance or leading any officer to believe that he was going to get anything that we could not deliver. I made that clear to the Army Inquiry.</P>

      <P>Just before finishing, I want to say that the findings of the Committee, which are contained from paragraph 5 to paragraph 13, refer in the main to the officers who were classed as mutineers.  I think I could say nothing to that.  The evidence on which it is founded could only be of the one type, because of the failure of the officers themselves to appear before the Inquiry.  There is, however, one paragraph that, before closing, I would like to draw your attention to, and that is paragraph 6.  I would be very anxious to see the evidence on which that paragraph 6 is based.  That paragraph says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the organisation which brought about, and many members of which joined in the late mutiny, was in existence, at least in embryo, before the outbreak of the Civil War, and that many of the officers who mutinied and of those who encouraged and abetted them had become a problem to General Collins before his death in August, 1922.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to see the evidence on which that was based.  Again, I am at a disadvantage because of the fact that I did not give evidence or get the officers to come there and give evidence. However, the problem that confronted General Collins before his death was the then G.H.Q.  It was because of G.H.Q. that he had to leave Merrion Street and go into the Army &mdash;because of the way in which G.H.Q. were acting at the time.  That is well-known to the members of the Executive Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to deal in detail with the whole matter covered in this report.  There will be another opportunity.  There are one or two misconceptions which may arise from the speeches that have been delivered, and which, as General Mulcahy says, should not be allowed 24 <Col N="2509" /> hours' start.  First, it is an absolute misconception if anybody in the country or in the Dáil imagines that General Mulcahy, and the officers who were associated with him, were not absolutely candid with the Committee, and put before it all the evidence at their disposal.  Every document that has since been quoted by Deputy McGrath in his speeches, or in the pamphlet issued by General Tobin, was in our hands before these things happened. I do not think we thought them of sufficient importance to insert in the report.  But it is the case unquestionably, and every member of the Committee knows it.  Now, I come to paragraphs 24, 25 and 26, which Deputy Mulcahy takes exception to. He calls paragraph 24 a grudging statement, and he proceeded to give the form in which he thought we should have framed it.  Now, every report of a Committee of five must inevitably be a combination of a number of views, and it cannot be as forceful, possibly, as the work of one man.  But in practice I see very little difference between General Mulcahy's formula and the report of the Committee.  What difference there is arises from the difficulty with which we were confronted and to which none of the previous speakers appear to have given sufficient weight.  That was, that we were called on to investigate charges and there was really nobody to make those charges. The case for the prosecution, if I might put it so, was never formulated.  On the other hand, the case for the defence was put as strongly as possible, with the assistance of counsel and solicitors, who had been given copies of every statement.  That being so, I should say that we could not put it stronger than to say that no evidence was put before us to justify a charge of muddling, incompetence and mismanagement. It represents the facts of the case.  There was no evidence, and consequently General MacMahon had no charge to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we come to paragraph 25, to which Deputy Mulcahy takes exception. He wanted to know what charge there was against the late Quartermaster-General there.  He knows what charge there was; he heard all the evidence; he knows that charges were brought <Col N="2510" /> against the Quartermaster-General's Department, not in relation to discipline in the Army, but in relation to its general conduct.  But that had absolutely nothing to do with us.  For a moment I was inclined to follow that line of inquiry, because I thought the charges against his Department might have affected the mutiny in some way or other, but I soon became satisfied they did nothing of the sort.  What we were appointed for was to investigate the cause that led up to, and created, the mutiny.  We were not told to investigate the whole conduct and administration of the Army for two years; that would be a task, not for six weeks, but rather for six months, and anyone who desired to do it properly and to give it proper attention would be obliged to resign his membership of the Dáil.  These charges, such as they were, were not very serious.  I say that at once.  I do not know any Army in which there are not grumblings against the Quartermaster-General's Department. I do not say whether there was any substance in them, but whether or not they had nothing to do with our inquiry; they were not relevant to our inquiry, and nothing relevant to our inquiry was brought against the Quartermaster-General's Department.  That is a plain statement of the facts, and no more.  Before I leave that point, may I say we intended these paragraphs 24, 25 and 26&mdash;at least I did&mdash;to acquit these officers of the charge of &ldquo;muddling, mismanagement or incompetence.&rdquo; And if General Mulcahy has taken exception to our wording, and if he is attacking the Committee on this ground and then follows it up by saying that the effect of the three paragraphs is a complete vindication of the officers, he cannot have it both ways.  I venture to think that on the whole we convey the meaning we intended to convey, although other individuals might wish to frame the sentences differently. I say on the whole these paragraphs are not unfair, and reflect the facts of the case perfectly.</P>
    <P>I come now to the last point that should be dealt with.  Deputy Mulcahy complained that none of the G.O.C.'s was summoned to give evidence.  If General Mulcahy, or any other officer, wished any of the G.O.C.'s to be summoned <Col N="2511" /> they had only to ask and it would have been done.  They did make application through their counsel in the case of one officer, and he was at once summoned.  Wherever any persons gave the slightest indication that we could get any information from any individual officer or officers of the Army we sent for them.  And dealing with Deputy McGrath's point that officers could not be expected to come in and give evidence, by far the greatest portion of the evidence came from officers serving, or ex-officers.  We sought evidence wherever we could find it bearing on the case.  And it was never suggested by General Mulcahy through his counsel to us that the G.O.C.'s were witnesses who could give valuable evidence, and without that suggestion I candidly admit I was reluctant to call them, as I was reluctant to call the present Chief-of-Staff, the present Quartermaster-General and the present Adjutant-General, because I am concerned with the welfare of the Army, and the discipline of the Army, and I do not believe any army can maintain discipline if it sees its higher officers called before civilian committees to be examined and cross-examined by members of those committees and by counsel. Unless it was absolutely necessary in the interests of justice to secure the attendance of these officers I was reluctant to see them called.  These are the points I think it desirable to be made now.</P>
    <P>When I was asked to go on this inquiry I did not think it would be pleasant work, and it has not been pleasant work.  I did not think we could please everybody, and I think we have not pleased anybody, and therefore I venture to ask the Dáil and the country to believe that this Report is neither a whitewashing nor flattering report, but is an honest presentation of the facts as they appear to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the attitude taken up by Deputy McGrath and Deputy Mulcahy.  I must say I cannot understand the attitude of the Executive Council at all in presenting this Report in this form, consisting of three or four pages, to the Dáil, including the decision of the Executive <Col N="2512" /> Council, that the evidence is not to be published.  The President tells us that the Executive Council had not at all considered the Report, and that, although they had not considered the Report, they apparently have considered the evidence, and the evidence is not to be published.  Both Deputy McGrath and Deputy General Mulcahy seemed to want the publication of the evidence, and I must say from my point of view, and I think it will be the point of view of Deputies generally in this House, who know very little of what brought about the Army crisis, and have learned very little since then, that the evidence must be put before the public. I cannot understand at all how we could be expected at any time to come here and discuss this Report without the evidence.  What do we find?  Deputy Mulcahy presents his point of view, and Deputy McGrath presents his point of view, and somebody else presents the point of view of the Executive Council, and the body of Deputies not having seen any of the evidence, not knowing anything whatever about the facts, will be asked to judge between the conflicting statements of the respective parties interested in this Report.  And what about the people of the Country?  Where will they stand in all this muddle? Deputy Mulcahy intends, he says, to introduce a Motion here which will amount, I believe, to a vote of censure upon the Executive Council.  How does Deputy Mulcahy think he is to get a fair decision or opinion from this House on the conduct of officers in the past in the Army, if we have to listen to what he has to say, and what others have to say without any opportunities of knowing what evidence was advanced by these respective parties before the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is how I see things.  I do not know how the matter may appear to other Deputies, but that is how it appears to me.  I made a statement when this matter was before the Dáil that the Executive Council was really in the dock.  The Executive Council were collectively responsible, as Deputy Johnson has said, and the Executive Council established this Committee to report to itself.  It has reported to itself. Is the Executive Council satisfied with <Col N="2513" /> this Report?  We do not know.  They have not considered it, we are told, but whether the Executive Council is satisfied or not this House cannot be satisfied with this Report unless the evidence is presented on which the Report is based, and by the Report I mean the full Report, and not half the Report.</P>
    <P>I must say I cannot imagine how the Deputies who sat on this Committee&mdash; knowing them individually&mdash;got their points of view expressed so concisely. I cannot understand that, I admit. They made an extraordinary effort, but I submit to the Dáil very seriously that it is absolutely useless for us to attempt at any period or on any occasion to discuss this Report unless the evidence on which it is based is Presented to us, and unless ample time is given to the Dáil for its consideration. If the Executive Council expects that we are to consider this Report without such evidence as that which was given before the Committee being in our hands, I say that the Army Inquiry will, after discussion in this House, be a greater muddle than ever, and that after wasted misspent days, the protest in the country will be so loud that the Executive Council, whether it likes it or not, will have to go back upon its apparent decision and publish the full evidence that was submitted to the Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points I would like to bring before the Dáil in connection with this Report. I am limiting myself, and do limit myself from the start, by stating that as a member of the Executive Council I intend to abide by the introductory Note prefacing this document, and consequently in any remarks I have to make here to-night I do not intend to draw upon any evidence that was given before me as a member of the Committee of Inquiry.  Certain questions have been asked and certain answers have been given.  I think I could answer the points put up by Deputy General Mulcahy, in general, by stating that if the Report be considered as a whole&mdash;what is stated in the Report considered as a whole, and no attempt made to read into it things that are not in the Report and no insistence on omissions from the Report which <Col N="2514" /> various Deputies may think should have been included&mdash;the Report will be much easier to understand.  Let me take one point.  Deputy General Mulcahy alludes to paragraphs 8 and 9, in which two sections found within the Army are bracketed and&mdash;Section 14 brackets two sections in the Army&mdash; desires to know if these two paragraphs, which specifically in the Report refer to the I.R.B. organisation, are to be taken as referring to the other organisation. Now that is unnecessary. Why should there be any attempt to go outside the plain words of a very plain, though a very highly condensed Report. There is no innuendo in the Report. Any findings that there are, are stated quite clearly and simply, and there is no necessity to get back to two paragraphs which refer to one organisation and bring them down and make them have reference to a second. A second question was asked on paragraph 14 as to &ldquo;the failure of both to appreciate their position as servants of the State.&rdquo;  That seems to have been linked up with the previous bracketing of paragraphs 8 and 9, which are supposed to be brought down and imported into paragraph 14.  Paragraph 14 is, on the face of it, a finding as far as Deputy General Mulcahy's question is concerned.  It is a finding that the I.R.B. did not appreciate their position as servants of the State.  Now there is a direct and a definite reference in paragraph 14 to both the I.R.A. and the I.R.B., and so much can be taken from it, but no importation of paragraphs 8 and 9 should be made with regard to paragraph 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three paragraphs&mdash;24, 25 and 26&mdash; have been much criticised.  Attention has been called to what has been described as the lack of symmetry.  I do not know what that means in this connection. Paragraphs 24 and 25 are highly symmetrical, I hold.  Paragraph 26 rather goes beyond anything stated in paragraphs 24 and 25, and the reason is obvious.  The three paragraphs, it must be remembered, deal with the matters set up under sub-head (c) of the division of the Terms of Reference made on page 5.  When Deputy Cooper says that he regards these three paragraphs as an acquittal of the three officers mentioned.  I agree with him, <Col N="2515" /> but I agree with a difference.  They are an acquittal in so far as any charges under the third head of the Terms of Reference, as divided on page 5, are concerned.  They are an acquittal as far as that paragraph goes, and only so far.  That again will be obvious on a careful reading of the report, because inasmuch as the three officers concerned were members of the Army Council, and are more generally referred to as Heads of the Army, certain other findings, not an acquittal, are made with regards to these three in other relevant paragraphs in the report. With regard to these three paragraphs, this is the wording of paragraph 24: &ldquo;No evidence was given before us to justify a charge of muddling, mismanagement or incompetence on the part of the late Chief-of-Staff in carrying out his duties.&rdquo;  Deputy General Mulcahy says that is grudging. I think he used the word &ldquo;mean&rdquo; in regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The adjective &ldquo;grudging&rdquo; was used with regard to paragraph 24, and he now says that the word mean is to be taken as applying to the second sentence in paragraph 25.  The suggestion was made that paragraph 24 should have read &ldquo;A charge of muddling, mismanagement, or incompetence cannot be sustained.&rdquo;  That is getting into the region of prophecy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the wording of this paragraph is the same as saying that the charge has not been sustained.  Can one go beyond that in dealing with evidence put before us on a specific matter?  specific charges were made, and we say that evidence has not been given to sustain these charges.  The charge has not been sustained.  If the paragraph could be put more clearly, I cannot see any other formula, but it expresses my views and Deputy Cooper's, and I am sure also Deputy Gorey's.  The word &ldquo;mean,&rdquo; then, has been applied to the second sentence <Col N="2516" /> in paragraph 25, which reads: &ldquo;No other charge relevant to our Inquiry was made against him.&rdquo;  Is it argued that we should have put in here a synopsis or a summary of the charges that did appear against the Quartermaster-General in relation to all his duties in his many positions from the time when he first entered the Army until his dismissal recently from it?</P>

      <P>Charges with regard to his Quartermastering did appear.  Under our terms of reference we were bound definitely by one paragraph in them: &ldquo;To report upon the facts and matters which have caused or led up to the late mutiny.&rdquo; The other sub-heads were merely supplementary and explanatory of the first main head in the terms of reference given to us.  &ldquo;No other charge relevant to our Inquiry was made against him (Quartermaster-General).&rdquo;  Were we to have gone into a long exposition of the charges that had been made or which were referred to in our Inquiry, the Report would really have made as great a bulk as the evidence.  The paragraph dealing with the Adjutant-General is out of keeping, as far as unity goes, with the paragraphs referring to the two other Generals.  That is because specific charges were made against the Adjutant-General having direct reference to what led up to the recent mutiny.  That is referred to in detail.  It was thought better to refer in detail to this Kenmare case, of which a great deal had been made, and of which I cannot believe Deputy Johnson was so innocent as not to know anything of the facts.</P>

      <P>I submit that these three paragraphs, which are so much criticised for lack of symmetry, have at least been explained now and that there is a definite acquittal known to everybody of these three officers.  The matters referred to in the third sub-division in the terms of reference is made under paragraph 5.  With regard to page 4, towards the bottom, where the statement is made that &ldquo;The Committee endeavoured to procure the attendance of all witnesses who seemed likely to give material assistance to them,&rdquo; Deputy General Mulcahy detailed certain witnesses called before the Committee, and asked, seeing that these men&mdash;apparently the argument runs&mdash;were summoned, why were not the General Officers Commanding summoned?  The answer to that has been given by Deputy Cooper. No request was made, as far as I remember, for their attendance.  It was certainly not pressed.  It was not made out to us that the case would be incomplete without their attendance, and there was not at any time any refusal to summon any witnesses whose presence was declared to be necessary for the purpose of the Inquiry.  And of the three officers to whom Deputy General Mulcahy referred in general and rather vague terms, not one was summoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to two of them, I am perfectly certain that their approach to the Committee was by a letter stating that they thought that they had evidence of certain facts to lay before the Committee which would be useful. The case of the third officer was a complicated case.  He appeared in two capacities.  He appeared in one capacity in the course of certain Army duty, and as such he was summoned in the ordinary course.  In the other capacity <Col N="2518" /> he again appeared, submitting, first of all, that he had certain facts and matters to put before us which would be useful to our inquiry, so that there was no attempt to keep out withnesses who were indicated to us as necessary by one side, and the calling of witnesses on the other side.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath referred to the group of officers for whom he had first stated that he was the spokesman and who afterwards did not appear, and we are now told two facts with regard to these.  He stated that he would give the names of people who could give facts useful to us.  I would like to know if he did submit names, and, if so, was there a single case in which a man alleged to be useful was not summoned? His answer, I suppose, is given in his second statement, that the guarantee of indemnity was not enough.  Numerous letters were sent to Deputy McGrath with regard to his attendance, and the attendance of the officers whom he represented.  The indemnity guaranteed was given to him in writing, and again I simply make this statement, that there was no objection taken, either in writing or verbally, before the Committee, that the guarantee was not sufficiently complete. If that objection had been made &mdash;if Deputy McGrath had made any allegation of the sort&mdash;an attempt might have been made to get the guarantee enlarged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A few other statements were made, but there is one to which I must make reference, the statement in Paragraph 18: &ldquo;The leaders of this organisation believed that they had been tricked by the late Minister for Defence, when, after entering into negotiations with <Col N="2519" /> them and giving them a written assurance&rdquo; (in the terms that followed) &ldquo;he held no further communications with them.&rdquo;  I think I understood Deputy General Mulcahy to question if that is a finding of the Committee, that they had in fact been tricked.  There is no such finding, but there is this: there is a statement that they believed they had been tricked, and there is certain evidence given there to show that their belief was not unreasonable.  There is a finding to that extent, and for that purpose that letter was given.  Any other questions I have asked may, I think, be referred to again when the various motions come before the Dáil.  There is just one other matter with reference to Deputy Johnson's criticism of the Report of the Committee.  He criticised it in two ways: first, that it was stated that it would take two weeks, and that it has now taken two months, and that mere statement, coming from a Deputy who objects to this Report as not containing all the matter on which people could form a correct view&mdash;that is supposed to be a correct statement of this time period set on the work of the Committee. When the two weeks period was put as an estimate on the work of the Committee were there any factors present in the President's mind which actually did not come into operation? Was it then a fact that it was considered not merely likely, but certain, that Deputy McGrath, and the officers represented by General Tobin, would come before the Committee of Inquiry? Is it fair to criticise the deliberations of the Committee for lasting two months because the President having in mind certain witnesses coming before them to state the case, for the prosecution, as Deputy Cooper put it, failed to come before the Committee?</P>

      <P>Well, I have not been able to assure myself that it was meant as a compliment.  We are also told that the Committee was to include two persons competent legally, and for that reason a better report was expected, and Deputy Johnson then made the remark that if a Dáil Committee could not produce a better report he would think little of the Dáil.  It has to be borne in mind that it was a Committee, the majority of the members of which were members of the Dáil, and it was a Committee on which the President invited the assistance of Deputy Johnson, an assistance and guidance which was present at the deliberations on the Report of the Broadcasting Committee.  Does Deputy Johnson think that that was a model report?</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 o'clock until 3 o'clock on Wednesday, June 18th.</P>

      <P>asked the President whether he is aware that a Bill at present under consideration by the British House of Commons proposed to increase the pensions of R.I.C. pensioners while making no increase in those of the D.M.P., and whether, in view of the fact that the two forces have hitherto been treated on the same footing, so far as pensions are concerned, he would be willing to make representations to the British Government as to the desirability of continuing this equality of treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As the cost of the increases contemplated by the Bill for the Amendment of Pensions (Increase) Act, 1920, at present before the British House of Commons falls entirely to be borne out of British funds, I cannot see my way to making representations of this kind suggested by the Deputy.</P>
