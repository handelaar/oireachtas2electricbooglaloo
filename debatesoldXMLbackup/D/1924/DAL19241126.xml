      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will lay on the Table of the Dáil a copy of the instructions issued to Pension Officers in connection with the work of determining claims to old age pensions, and assessing means of claimants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to these instructions being laid upon the Table of the Dáil.  The administration of the Old Age Pension Acts is mainly entrusted to the Revenue Commissioners, who issue instructions to their officers for the purpose of ensuring the just administration of the law.  These instructions are for Departmental use only, and are not published.  If such instructions were made public, their object would be defeated, because claimants would then know exactly how to frame their cases so as to prevent detection of fraud.  Moreover, if Departmental instructions were published as regards any particular section of administration, it would not be possible to resist demands for similar information relating to other sections, as, for example, income tax.  Under such conditions the work of many Government Departments could not be carried on.</P>

      <P>Schemes are already in operation, under which instruction is given to farmers in the cultivation of the crop, and to mill-owners in the scutching and subsequent treatment of the fibre.  The area under flax in the Saorstát last year showed a considerable increase on the figures of the previous year, and the estimated acreage for the current year shows that a still further increase has taken place, and that the present acreage is above the average acreage of the ten years preceding the European War.  The question as to how far further State action in the matter may be desirable is being carefully considered.</P>

      <P>This matter was investigated locally towards the end of last year, when it was ascertained that the extent of refuse deposited in the river could not be described as a nuisance.  It appeared that the practice of the local people could be prevented by the enforcement of the prohibition contained in the Shannon Navigation Bye-Laws, and that there was ample refuse accommodation about 250 yards away for the needs of the whole town.  In the circumstances steps were taken to bring the matter to the notice of the Gárda Síochána for any necessary action on their part.  I do not feel justified in recommending the expenditure of public funds to remedy the consequences of unlawful action on the part of the residents of the district. I am, however, having a further inspection made now, and I will give careful consideration to the report when it is received.</P>

    <P>The purport of this is to omit from the list of Bills which are to be made permanent the Motor Car Act, 1903, and in a subsequent amendment I propose to add it to the Second Schedule as a Bill to be continued for one year, and one year only.  We have been favoured by the Government with a very exhaustive summary of this Bill as a result of pressure applied on the Second Reading.  I have gone further than reading the summary.  I have read the Bill, and more than that, I have read the debate that occurred when it was passing through the House of Commons 21 years ago.  As a result of that study, I have come to the conclusion that we would be ill-advised to make it permanent.  This Bill, which is the fundamental Statute regulating all questions of motor transport, was passed through the House of Commons in August, 1903, and in August, the House of Commons reaches the state of exhaustion we reach in July.  It was passed in August, 1903, as the result of a week's debate, and it was passed through a House of Commons that had not the knowledge of motor cars that we have at the present time.  They knew neither of their potentialities nor of their disadvantages.  For instance, one gentleman who opposed the Bill referred to a driver, when he wished to increase his speed, pulling out his sparking plug.  I can hardly think that an effective manoeuvre to increase the speed of a car.  He pulls out his sparking plug, or whatever it is, to make a noise like a gatling gun.  I took special pains to see if any Irish pressure had been brought on the matter. I found two instances; one was where valuable horses were being frightened by motor cars in South Kildare. It was a shock to me to see the name Kilbride attached to that speech instead of Wolfe or Conlan.  Another was the complaint of an Irish gentleman of reckless driving of motor cars in the Phoenix Park.  The reckless driving is now a matter of more intimate concern to him, since he has his residence there and is our Governor-General. The discussion was a fairly lengthy and adequate one, though carried on to a late hour of the night. Is anyone going to contend that a Bill passed after a week's consideration 21 years ago should be made permanently binding now?  We would make a grave mistake to make it part of our permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1499" /> What are the provisions of the Act? One deals with the licensing of drivers. A great many people take exception to this section.  They think there should be some test before a man is licensed to drive a motor car.  It should not be possible for a blind man or an inebriate to get a licence.  The only thing that prevents you under this Act is that you may have held a licence and forfeited it.  Then, again, if you are convicted three times for exceeding the speed limit your licence may be suspended for a certain time.  That requires some consideration.  Some people think one conviction would be enough.  Others think three convictions on technical grounds are not sufficient, but all this would bear discussion.  Then again, there is a very controversial section, Section 9, by which a speed limit of 20 miles an hour is imposed.  Some people consider that speed limit excessive. Other people think it is too low, in view of the improvements in road-making and especially in motor cars since 1903, and think that a higher speed limit might be allowed.  Others, of whom I am one, think that a definite speed limit is not desirable, but that any conviction for driving to the danger of the public should carry with it, not the penalty of a fine, but imprisonment. Those are all questions which are worthy of discussion, and they will require to be discussed sooner or later. Section 13 is the most remarkable one. It extends the definition of a &ldquo;male servant&rdquo; to include a driver of a motor car, and is not in force in Saorstát Eireann.  We are actually making permanent laws that cannot be enforced here.  Could anything be more preposterous?  Let us renew this law if necessary, but let us recognise that if this Act is not obsolete that it is obsolescent. Day by day, year after year, it is growing out of touch with things as they exist.  Let us not place it on the Statute Book.  Let the Government come here year by year and ask permission to do it.  Those of us who believe that the introduction of a new Act dealing with new conditions is required shall then have an opportunity of urging our case on the Government and pressing them to meet us.  If this <Col N="1500" /> measure is made part of the permanent law of the land, I prophesy that a reform which is now almost overdue will not be dealt with for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Cooper has given any very good argument in favour of this amendment. This Bill was passed 23 years ago.  It has been continued in force, practically without amendment, since.  In the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act, 1922, in Great Britain, it was made permanent. It seemed to have stood the test of time pretty well.  The changes Deputy Cooper suggested are, most of them, changes about which there is a good deal of controversy.  There is practically nothing suggested that would meet with unanimous approval.  I do not think you are going to assist in getting amending laws passed by making this continue as a temporary Bill to be renewed from year to year.  It is obviously a Bill which the Oireachtas could not afford to let, through this Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act, go, if it came up for renewal next year or the year after, because the amount of motor traffic and the dangers involved to the public if your motor traffic is not regulated would make it impossible to do away with the only law that exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in dealing with it, the Oireachtas would have no real option but to allow it to go through with the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Act.  The Oireachtas is not free to throw this out of the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill, and it is for all practical purposes a permanent Act.  It is not proposed from the Government side to bring in any amending measure.  The Local Government Department are satisfied that the law as it stands is good enough, and that there is no immediate need for any amendment of the law. The attitude of the Government would be, if they were to put it into the other schedule, simply to bring it up year after year and let it be adopted for twelve months each time.  I do not think it is desirable to have what is really permanent legislation in the guise of temporary legislation.  If you have gone on for a period of years, and an Act has been found to be as satisfactory as any law is, certain people <Col N="1501" /> objecting and certain approving, then it is much preferable to make that Act permanent.  That is the custom which is being pursued to a considerable extent in Great Britain.  I suggest to the House that this particular law ought to be made permanent now. Another amendment Deputy Cooper is putting forward is rather different because in that case the Department concerned does propose at a comparatively near date to bring in amending legislation. In this case the Department concerned is not anxious for any great change, and it thinks that this law, which is in effect permanent, should be made really permanent by definite enactment.</P>

      <P>As this is the opportunity for expressing one's opinion with regard to this Act, I should like to say a word in support of Deputy Cooper's amendment, for the reason that I think the Act does want amending in several respects.  I think it is a crying shame that a man convicted of drunkenness when driving should not have his licence taken from him.  In the second place, everyone is breaking the law every day in technical matters. Some of the Ministers admitted to me that they drove 30 to 35 miles an hour on the open road.  That is no harm where there is not heavy traffic, but I think it is necessary that we should make much more stringent rules in regard to the city traffic.  I would make it much slower than is allowed at the present time, and I would allow more freedom than is allowed with regard to open traffic.  I think the most important thing of all is that to which allusion has been made by Deputy Cooper, and that is, that a man may be blind or deaf, and if he applied for a driver's licence he is able to get it.  I think it is not wise on the part of the Local Government Department not to make some attempt to remedy such a condition of things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Deputy, when he thinks that a change is necessary and when the Department concerned is not of the same opinion and consider that there is no urgency, not consider the question of introducing a Private Members' Bill to deal with <Col N="1502" /> the matter.  It is a sort of matter that can be discussed entirely on its merits with a free vote of the Dáil, and so far as any drafting difficulties are concerned, if the Dáil were in favour of the measure, assistance could be given. That would be a more satisfactory way of dealing with the question than by having a temporary Act brought up and a few words said upon it each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposed by Deputy Cooper, proposes to leave this Act to come up from year to year.  I think there is great merit in having a Bill of this sort brought up every year, if for no other reason than giving us an opportunity of criticising the Government.  I understand that this question of an Expiring Laws Continuance Bill has its chief merit in the fact that it gives a very wide latitude, and provides a very interesting performance from year to year, by giving the general members of the Dáil great scope for criticism.  Unfortunately, as regards supporting the amendment, I must say that the Minister for Finance gives rather weighty reasons why it should be made permanent, and I find that I have to agree with the Minister rather against my will. Obviously, the controller of motor traffic must have regulations.  This, apparently, is the basic law that we proceed to break every hour of the day and which we do break with impunity if the police are not knocking about.  By making it permanent we do not get any greater latitude than we have at present, nor, perhaps, will it give us any less latitude.  The sort of criticism in which one would indulge in connection with this Bill, when it comes up from year to year, is not very fruitful.  The Minister has said that any Deputy might bring in a Private Member's Bill. Much as we might criticise an Act and the administration of an Act, I think we would rather hesitate about tackling this problem in a Private Bill.  So far as I am concerned, I would not like to take the responsibility.  The whole question is bristling with controversy, and any one can see that any Bill one starts to formulate for submission to the Dáil, in the nature of a Private Bill, <Col N="1503" /> would not get very far.  The only way in which I can see that this original Act, which we are all agreed is out of date, could be amended is by taking a particular section at a time and trying to improve it, but to start a new Bill in an endeavour to put everything right that is wrong would be a very difficult problem.  I am afraid, if this question goes to a division, I will have to vote against the amendment, but on the other hand, of course one must agree with anything that has been said from these benches in support of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister joy of his supporters.  I would like to point out with regard to his suggestion of a Private Member's Bill, that I do not think it is a considered suggestion on the part of the Minister. How could any private Deputy bring in a Bill dealing with speed limits which would be defined much more closely than they are in this Act?  You could not do it without close consultation with the police, and no private member would be entitled to go to the Commissioner of the D.M.P. or to the Superintendents of the Gárda Síochána throughout the country and find out exactly where a particular speed limit was necessary.  That could only be done by the Government.  I know that the Local Government Department could not do it this year, and that is why I am not proposing to remove the Act altogether, but only to have it prolonged for another year.  This is an important question, which has to be dealt with sooner or later, and there is a considerable body of opinion in favour of my suggestion.  This does not affect those who use motor cars alone; it also affects the users of the roads, and, in fact, every person in the State.  The last Court of Appeal is not the Local Government Department, efficient Department though it is, but the Dáil itself.  We are the people to whom those who are aggrieved have a right to turn, whether in respect of the speed of motor cars, or of the necessity of developing motor transport, or of the lack of its sufficient use to help the farmers.  I regret that the Minister <Col N="1504" /> has given this reception to my amendment.  On Second Reading he stated that if there was any considerable body of opinion in favour of the amendments he would be inclined to accept them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the amendment on grounds which I think are similar to those put forward by Deputy Cooper, although I have only heard the debate from Deputy Sir James Craig's speech.  I think there is no doubt in the mind of anybody that the law relating to motor cars, which was enacted as a temporary Act, is not in perfect form.  I will put it in that way, and say that there are amendments required.  I think that that is generally accepted, and that the reason for keeping this Act amongst those which will expire at the end of a certain time is that there is a certain stimulus to the Government to look over the situation and bring in amending legislation.  If we are agreed that there should be some recasting of the law relating to motor cars, then the fact that this is on the Schedule in connection with expiring laws is a perpetual stimulus.  For that reason alone I am prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think from what the Minister said that he ought to accept the amendment.  It would, I think, be quite impossible for a private member to go into the necessary details in a Private Bill.  It might be quite true, as the Minister says, that in the first place responsibility lies with the private member to show that the measure is required, but I think that what the Minister suggests may be achieved by members bringing forward resolutions containing suggested amendments. In view of what the Minister says, I think that he ought to give time for private members to show their feelings on this question, and to allow this measure to be made temporary for another year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to push this particular Act through as a permanent measure, if there is a strong feeling against it.  I think, however, that that feeling is not very well <Col N="1505" /> reasoned.  I believe that there is no stimulus to the Government in having it kept as a temporary measure.  On the contrary, the Government says that it is not a very good Act but they will leave it so for the present, and I think you are rather postponing the question of reform than hastening it by making this a temporary measure.  In Great Britain, where there are three times as many motor cars in proportion to population as there are here, this legislation which was enforced for twenty-three years was made permanent a couple of years ago.  I do not think that there is any good reason behind the feeling manifested here, but, on the other hand, it is not a matter of sufficient consequence to push through against a body of expressed opposition. I am, therefore, prepared to accept Deputy Cooper's amendment.</P>

    <P>Here also I took some pains to follow the course of the debate in the British House of Commons when this Act became law.  I did so with a good deal of curiosity.  I do not know what other Deputies knew about wireless telegraphy in 1904, but I knew very little and it occurred to me that members of the British House of Commons might have been in the same position, and I found that they were.  This Bill was read on the 10th August, a date when everybody is tired and wants to get home after a long session.  An Irishman, but not an Irish member, Mr. Lough, of County Cavan, objected to the Bill being rushed through at such an hour.  I could not find out what the exact hour was, but the House sat until a quarter to two in the morning, and as this was one of the last measures to be considered, the hour must have been sometime after midnight.  It entered upon its Committee Stage on the 11th August, and eight amendments were accepted by the Government without any discussion, and that, again, was after midnight.  The final stage was on Friday, 12th August, and the House of Commons is traditionally impatient as to sitting after the 12th August on account of the grouse-shooting.  It sat until after 8 p.m. on Friday.  That was the consideration which this Bill received from the House of Commons. Is that a well-considered and maturely-thought-out measure?  When it reached the House of Lords, Lord Selborne said that it was a temporary Bill and would expire in two years.  Now, twenty years after the introduction of wireless telegraphy we know far more about it than we did at that time, as it has now come home to the ordinary man and, in fact, you can hear people speaking in America and, according to a newspaper this morning I read, that you can actually hear the American accent of the announcer.  Yet in spite of that development we are asked to make this a permanent measure.</P>
    <P>What are the reasons that were put forward for giving this control of wireless? We have some of them more or less quoted here in the memo of the Minister.  The first was that wireless is very important and must be controlled and regulated by the State.  It was <Col N="1507" /> put forward that you should not have a monopoly in wireless; no one firm should be allowed to acquire a monopoly. As a matter of fact, under the aegis of the State, a firm in England has acquired a monopoly.  If you are not in the Marconi Company, you have no real say in the wireless world.  The second reason put forward was the naval reason.  I hope the Minister, or the Minister of Fisheries, is not going to say that unless the State controls wireless, the operations of the Muirchu would be useless.  The third reason was that wireless was a great public service which the State ought to control.</P>
    <P>The powers given by this Act are the only powers that secure to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the regulation of wireless in the State, the only powers that enable him to charge £1 for a service which the British Government performs for 2/6.  I am not sure that the occasion may not arise&mdash;and I say it without any feeling against the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;when the whole of the power of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will have to be reviewed from the point of view that he is an External Minister, and it is very doubtful whether it is in conformity with the Constitution that any External Minister should, of his <Col N="1508" /> own volition, be enabled to put heavy charges on the State.  I can imagine another Minister raising the Postal rates and putting an enormous tax on the community of his own volition, without consulting the Dáil or even the Executive Council.  I am not quite sure whether he has to have the permission of the Minister for Finance.  In view of our very different Constitution we ought not to make permanent those powers of taxation which the Minister possesses under this Act.  We ought to take an opportunity of reviewing them, and by making this Act temporary we shall be able to do so.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 43, after the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; to insert the words: &ldquo;after consultation with the roads advisory committee appointed under the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 30 provides that the Minister may make certain regulations, and the object of my amendment is to provide that he would consult with the Roads Advisory Committee appointed under the Ministry of Transport Act before making those regulations.  Under a section of that Act which is still the law, I understand the Roads Committee is set up.  I think it would be advisable that the Minister, before making his regulations regarding roads, should consult with, and obtain the advice of, this body.  In a previous portion of the discussion the Minister rejected the <Col N="1511" /> idea of having a general advisory council attached to his department.  I trust his objection to receiving advice will not prevent him accepting this amendment and getting advice from a competent body before making regulations in regard to all the matters set out in Section 30.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy will achieve anything by inserting this amendment.  As a matter of course, in bringing in any legislation of this kind, or formulating any rules or regulations, I consult with the Roads Advisory Committee.  That is what they are there for.  As a matter of fact, this section was inserted on their advice; it is purely their own creation. The insertion of the Deputy's amendment will not help me in any way or help them.  The only possible consequence it might have in practice would be to make it hard to prove that I had obtained the advice of the Committee; it might lead to legal difficulties.  If I insisted on a sign being removed down the country, and was not able to prove conclusively that I had taken the advice of the Advisory Committee before so insisting, the owner of that sign might be able to defy me and would refuse to take it down, although it might be creating trouble in the neighbourhood. I do not think the Deputy should press the amendment, and I do not believe it will achieve anything.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER:</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1) the words&mdash;&ldquo;The Minister may also on the advice of the council of a county make regulations as to the size, weight, carrying capacity and speed of any vehicle travelling on any road in a county.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see in the Bill that such powers are being taken by the Minister or being given to a council in any county.  I think there is fairly general agreement that such powers ought to be vested in the council of any county, enabling them to declare that a certain road is not capable of carrying a vehicle of a certain size carrying a certain weight.  Beyond doubt, our roads <Col N="1512" /> were never constructed to carry the traffic now passing over them.  If we continue as we are going, in a very short space of time our roads will not be able to carry the traffic; that will apply at least in some counties and some particular districts.  I may go so far as to say that the roads will not be able to bear even lesser traffic, such as the ordinary traffic of the farming community.  Recently I had experience in a district in my own county of a lorry of considerable weight carrying over five tons of a load.  Possibly the lorry itself weighed from 1 to 2 tons. That passed over a particular road week after week, with the result that that road is now impassable, not alone for such a lorry as I have referred to, but for practically all other traffic.</P>
    <P>The law as it stands makes it almost impossible for a county council to get compensation for extraordinary damage done to roads by any individual who may use them to an extraordinary extent.  Unless authority is given to our councils to deal with such matters, and say when a road must not be used by any particular individual when it really means misuse, then beyond doubt our roads will be rendered impassable, not alone for extraordinary, but for ordinary traffic.  There is also to be taken into consideration the speed at which a vehicle travels.  The condition of our roads must necessarily be affected by the speed of a very heavy vehicle passing over them.  A council ought also to be in a position to say that a certain road must not be used by a lorry weighing 2 tons and carrying a 5-ton load, and councils should be able to regulate the speed at which a vehicle travels.  The Minister should agree to accept those further powers, and I believe that no powers will be of more importance than the ones I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, unnecessary for me to say I am opposed to this amendment.  It is moved by Deputy Baxter in continuation of a policy adopted by one section of the House, introducing into the Bill road regulations of a very drastic nature. I think the House, on the main amendment that was considered, has refused <Col N="1513" /> to adopt that policy.  Deputy Baxter's amendment suggests that a county council shall have power to do this, that, and the other in connection with roads.  That is the suggestion, because certain heavy vehicles use roads that are not capable of carrying those vehicles.</P>
      <P>If that were put forward as a general proposition, of course there is argument for it; but to bring it forward as giving authority to one county council to put it into operation, in spite of the fact that the county council adjoining is not doing any such thing, is another matter.  To relieve a county council of the necessity of providing a road, at all events suitable for carrying modern traffic, is quite a different subject.  Deputy Baxter, in this matter wants to put back the hands of the clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT:</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, the county councils and authorities have power to shut up a road against traffic. I know that over and over again I have seen notices posted up that no traffic exceeding a certain weight shall go over certain bridges.  But as far as I can see, the amendment goes a great deal further than that, and I would oppose as strongly as I can the introduction into the Bill of a principle of this sort, relieving local bodies, or relieving somebody, of the need for providing roads as a means of transport for the use of the community.  In saying that, I do not mean roads for the use of the user.  The user would not be there unless the demand was provided by the people in the neighbourhood over which the traffic is going; it would not be there if there was not a demand for it. The demand being there, I say that it should be provided for.  In saying that, as I said earlier, I do not controvert the fact that there is a big question to be <Col N="1514" /> settled in connection with the roads, but I do say that any of these restrictive measures are entirely out of place in connection with this particular Bill. One point that Deputy Baxter has brought out is that he wants to prohibit certain weights going over certain roads.  Now, it is clearly not merely a question of weight; it is quite clear to anybody who knows about the damage to roads that you can have two vehicles going over a road, one of them half the weight of the other, and the lighter one will do more damage.  I maintain that this amendment is more or less out of order, because it deals with a matter which has already been decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, to my mind, is one of very great importance, and I wish to impress its importance on the Minister for his consideration. I feel that Deputy Hewat has not asked the House to consider this question from the angle that Deputy Baxter had in his mind.  He seems to think that Deputy Baxter wished to put back the hands of the clock by leaving it to the county council to see in what manner the traffic of those heavy vehicles could be used with the least damage to the roads of the district. There are two or three very important points in connection with it.  I think the main idea in Deputy Baxter's mind is that there should be a control over these vehicles that there is not at present. On the one hand we are anxious that this traffic should not alone continue as it is, but should be increased. It is a very great necessity for the farmers that this traffic should continue. I know numbers of them at present who are sending their butter and their eggs direct to the ports on account of the heavy railway charges and on account of the delay when the railway company leaves them over for the night, and they possibly miss a boat.  This traffic is being used very largely for that purpose, and I am quite certain that Deputy Baxter had no intention of interfering with that traffic, nor do I believe that that is in the mind of any Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there must be a certain control. <Col N="1515" /> I believe that the Local Government Department could see to that control by having governors on all these heavy-weight vehicles.  The harm that they do to the roads&mdash;and they do very great harm&mdash;is on the return journey when they are empty, or have only a very light back load.  All roads are not equally well constructed.  The water-tables may be defective, and there is bound to be a certain amount of moisture which will deteriorate the roads. When a heavy-weight vehicle goes over a road slowly it does not do so much harm, but when a light lorry travels on a road at the pace of a motor car it turns a small hole into a pot-hole, and where the county councils have not the proper machinery for repairing these pot-holes, where they are simply repaired by dumping stones into them which are not properly put in by a special roller for that purpose, the stones are turned out by the next lorry that passes, and the hole is continually increased in size.  In other words, a good deal of time is being lost, and money belonging to the ratepayers expended on these roads simply because these particular vehicles are allowed to travel without governors at the rate of twenty or thirty miles an hour, which is far beyond the speed limit.</P>
    <P>There is practically no use in making a regulation fixing the speed at which these vehicles must travel.  There must be a governor on each of these lorries, and that will prevent them running at this extreme pace, which is absolutely ruinous for the roads, as I know.  I am aware also that the owners do not want these lorries to be run at this terrible speed, because the very fact that a lorry which is meant to go at ten or twelve miles an hour is driven at thirty means that it is simply being shaken asunder, and I do not believe any commercial man wants his heavy lorry run along at the speed of a motor car.  I think there will be a further Bill brought in dealing with this traffic, but at the same time I would approve of Deputy Baxter bringing forward this amendment, even if he only brings before the Minister for his consideration the fact that there must be control of that particular class of traffic.  As regards <Col N="1516" /> railway bridges, you cannot have loads of over a certain weight going across them, but there are other bridges that the railway companies have not control over, and the danger of heavy traffic over these is not supposed to be very great, from what I have heard from the county surveyors or otherwise. If there are dangerous bridges the county council should apply to the Minister to make special provisions with regard to them.  I hope that the Minister will take steps to see that this traffic is properly regulated, while at the same time in no way interfering with a mode of conveyance very necessary at present, especially when we consider the very high and exorbitant rates being charged by the railway companies.  I would therefore press the consideration of the amendment on the Minister, and I am certain that either at a later stage or in another Bill the Minister will be bound to take it into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that already power is vested in the county councils to regulate what they deem is excessive traffic.  They could fine or assess damages on any man who uses the roads excessively and damages them. In my county, a few years ago, a man bought a wood, and he had to pay £100 because he injured the road by drawing the timber over it.  I think the same should apply in the case of a man with a big lorry.  If he is using it constantly over a road the county council is empowered, without any further legislation, to make that man pay, or fine him, if you like.  He is bound to pay for the excessive traffic and for the excessive way he uses the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make on this question is this, that not alone should councils be entitled to deal with the question of weight and size, but they should be entitled to close certain roads to certain classes of traffic.  It is not when the damage is done and when the county council recovers damages that it should be done. During the time these small roads are rendered impassable to the people that have to use them, they get no compensation whatever; the county councils <Col N="1517" /> do, but the people who actually suffer the loss get none.  It is brought under our notice every day that when the main steam-rolled roads are brought down to a certain stage of deterioration by this heavy traffic and when they are impassable, the drivers of these heavy lorries go by another road.  They travel that road until it is also impassable and then they go in some other direction.  County councils ought to have power to close to certain traffic narrow roads which are of great utility to the people they serve and which are not meant to carry heavy traffic at all.  That part of the amendment that deals with the speed limit, I agree with Deputy Hewat, ought not to be made a county matter at all; it ought to be made a general matter. But when we come to the question of closing roads&mdash;the roads that ought to be closed and the other matters with regard to size, weight and carrying capacity&mdash;nobody has a better idea or is better able to deal with the question than the county councils, because they have local knowledge and they are in possession of all the facts.</P>
      <P>The question is at present under consideration by a Departmental Committee, I believe, but whatever the findings of that committee may be, I think the county councils should get the power of closing certain roads to traffic, and also the power to regulate what classes of lorries should go over certain roads.  There is no doubt at all about it that heavy traffic should not be allowed on roads that are not steam-rolled, and there ought to be a signpost at the entrance to these by-roads with notices that these roads are closed to heavy traffic.  Until that is done, there will be great hardship imposed on the country.</P>

      <P>I am afraid there is some misunderstanding with regard to this amendment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD:</NameTxt>
      <P>We should take what is before us, and not what Deputy Gorey is trying to read into it.  With regard to the power of closing a roadway&mdash; possibly I am getting a little out of order in discussing a matter that does not arise&mdash;I know at the moment that roads are closed to motor traffic, and they would not be closed except there was authority to close them.  I am sorry we did not get this interesting discussion before a vote was taken on that important question the other night about placing the roadways under a central authority, because I am sure from remarks made this afternoon that the proposal to set up an authority to deal with roadways will have two additional supporters in Deputy Gorey and Deputy D'Alton.  I was glad to hear Deputy Hewat trying to illustrate what would happen if the Minister was to give assent to the recommendations of the 26 different county councils in dealing with roadways in the Saorstát. I suppose we would have 26 different regulations governing the question of motor traffic if the Minister were to give any consideration to the views put forward by the different bodies.  I can quite understand if such an amendment as this were passed, that the farmer Deputies, when the question of taxation for maintenance of the roadways would arise, would say that instead of providing the large sums surveyors want for maintenance of roadways this year, and having that oppressive taxation, the best thing they could do would be to ask the Minister to close these roadways for traffic of such and such a size going over them, and in that way get out of liability for these roads.  While a good deal may be said from one point of view in connection with a policy of that character, let us look at it from a national point of view.  Is it a policy that ought to be supported?  Is it not a retrograde policy to adapt our traffic to the roadways, instead of adapting our roadways to the traffic?  We all recognise that traffic conditions have very seriously altered during the last few years, and are likely to alter considerably in the next few years.  Surely <Col N="1519" /> Deputies should not stick their heads in the sand and say: &ldquo;We will not have regard to these altered conditions.&rdquo; Is that their policy?  These Deputies wholeheartedly supported the Railways Bill recently passed, which imposes such burdens on the traffic carried by the railways that that traffic will have to find some other outlet. Now, when we are trying to find some other outlet, they come along and say that the county councils should have power to prevent this traffic going over the roads.  You might as well say at once that trade cannot be carried on in the Saorstát, for that is what their contention amounts to.  We should take a bigger and a longer view of this question, and I am satisfied that if the Ministry impressed on these local authorities the necessity for adapting the roads to suit modern traffic it would be to the interests of the Saorstát, instead of listening to recommendations from them as to how this traffic may be impeded and curtailed.</P>

      <P>I want, if I can, to clear Deputy Good's and Deputy Hewat's minds of the belief that either I or any of the Deputies on these Benches want to retard progress by the operation of such an amendment as this, or that we seek to prevent the development of trade and commerce by limiting the outlets for traffic.  I wish to tell Deputy Good that we supported the Railways Bill because we believed that it would relieve traffic burdens, and I suggest that measure has justified itself and that we were justified in passing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER:</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates will be less than before the Act was passed, and that is some consolation.  We do not seek to limit the traffic, or to put burdens on it.  We are not trying to put back the hands of the clock.  A pretence may be made of putting on the hands of the clock; you may put on the hands, leaving the machinery behind. <Col N="1520" /> You may for the time being permit certain roads to carry certain traffic, but you may render it impossible for these same roads to carry that traffic six months hence.  We sought before today to put the responsibility for the maintenance of the roads on the State, and we were defeated on that.  We are faced with the proposal of putting the obligation of maintaining the roads on the ratepayers to the county councils. If the counties feel that they cannot provide enough of money to keep up roads to a certain standard to carry all traffic it is only justice to the ratepayers of the county, and justice to the traffic, to limit the traffic passing over the roads.  We do not want, and we wish to be emphatic in this, to put restrictions on trade and commerce, but we honestly feel that in certain counties&mdash; it may not perhaps be true of many counties in the centre and South of Ire-land&mdash;and perhaps in some districts in every county, the roads are being used for carrying traffic that they were not constructed for, and because of that roads are rendered impassable for anybody, even the residents in the district. That is what we seek to get over.</P>
      <P>Someone has raised a question as to the compensation that may be obtained for extraordinary traffic.  It is almost impossible for a county to obtain damages for extraordinary traffic, because it would be necessary to go into court and prove that certain damage to roads was caused by certain traffic, but these roads are used by others, and because of that the county council would find it difficult to prove a case to get compensation for damage.  Some people contend that roads should be maintained at a high standard regardless of cost to the ratepayers, but we must cut our coat according to our cloth. We should not impose on ratepayers the responsibility of maintaining roads at a high standard for all traffic, regardless of their capacity to bear the burden.  The ratepayers and their representatives through the county councils have a right to determine what traffic should pass over the roads.  I have no fear the county council would close the roads to traffic unless there is good reason for it.</P>

      <P>I must take strong exception to the remarks made by Deputy Good.  He said we were going to extremes, that we were putting our heads in sand, that we did not see the advance of time, and that we should take a bigger and longer view.  Surely the county council should get power to deal with the traffic as it is, and all future traffic.  That does not mean that we are out to retard progress.  I maintain that these huge lorries which, to my knowledge, and to the knowledge of other Deputies, return from their journeys half empty, have done much injury to the roads at the cost of the ratepayers.  We know, and the large employers also know, the pace at which the lorries are driven by their men, thereby depriving these machines of years of utility.  Deputy Daly said that in County Cork they were able to recover for damages done to roads.  I am aware of a fact that a timber merchant carried away from a beauty spot thousands of tons of timber, and in the process damaged the roads.  Our county council instructed our solicitor to take action in the matter.  This timber <Col N="1522" /> merchant was responsible for the cutting up of the roads which had been steam-rolled at great cost only a few years before.  On being communicated with he told our solicitor that he would pay at a later date.  But after leaving the road in a condition that it would have to be steam-rolled again, when it ought to have lasted fourteen or fifteen years, he disappeared to England, and never paid one penny.</P>
      <P>If the county council had had sufficient authority to deal with that gentleman, and if the solicitor had been able to deal with him, surely he could not have used the roads to make money for himself at the expense of the people who maintain the roads.  I want the Dáil to understand clearly that in supporting this amendment of Deputy Baxter's and urging it on the Minister, I do so for the reason which I think is in Deputy Baxter's mind&mdash;we want to support any mode of conveyance or any form of traffic that is going to help the people of this country to place their produce or manufactured products on the market, whether that is motor traffic, canal traffic, railway traffic or any other form of traffic.  I certainly take very serious objection to Deputy Good when he suggests that the Farmers' Party, or an individual Deputy like myself, supporting this amendment, want in any way to interfere with the development of traffic. The development of traffic is in the interest of all of us.  What I want to bring to the attention of the Minister is the abuse that exists in certain areas because the county council have not sufficient control of the traffic.  I want, in common with the other Deputies, to make the roadways in Ireland suitable for any traffic that has occasion to use them.</P>

      <P>I think there is very little difference between Deputy Baxter and myself on this point.  As the law stands at present, I have very considerable powers with regard to controlling the speed and structure of heavy vehicles.  But the regulations are spread over different statutes and it is not easy to say exactly in what respects the law as it stands falls short of what Deputy Baxter has in mind. Of course, as Deputy Baxter realises, <Col N="1523" /> the county council has power to recover the cost of exceptional damage to the roads.  In practice, those powers are not sufficiently wide.  Of course, I have power to close a road, at the request of the county council, to any particular kind of traffic.  That power is given me in, I think, Section 7, sub-section 4 of the Roads Act, 1920.  This is really more a case for rules and regulations than for legislation.  If Deputy Baxter would consult with me about the matter, we might be able to hammer out something on the Report Stage that would get general agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee that sat to deal with reconstruction and development made certain recommendations. One of these recommendations, which was of the greatest importance, was scoffed at by the Minister for Finance.  There was another recommendation made, which has not been put into operation, though the Minister now tells us he has power.  The recommendation was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are strongly of opinion that further restriction with regard to heavy motor vehicles is essential. Heavy motor vehicles, up to 12 tons in weight, with insufficient bearing surface are allowed to travel at great speed upon our roads.  This type of vehicle is destructive of the present roads and will be destructive of any roads which, for many years, we can afford to construct.  In fact no roads are capable of standing such usage save concrete roads, which would cost from £8,000 to £10,000 per mile to construct.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That recommendation was made, having heard the opinions of expert engineers and surveyors upon the question. The Minister has power in this matter at present, but he has not been exercising that power.  If the result of this debate and the pressure used by Deputy Baxter, will mean that there will be some restriction placed upon the weight carried by vehicles of insufficient width of wheel upon certain roads, then great good will have been accomplished.  I think that is the important point.  The acceptance of <Col N="1524" /> an amendment of this character may not add anything to the Minister's powers.  But can we get some assurance from the Minister that he is going to exercise his present powers in this respect, even if he gets the powers that Deputy Baxter seeks to give him?</P>

      <P>The proposition is not to give powers to the county council but to give the Minister powers, on the advice of the county council, which he may exercise or not as he wishes. The Minister already has those powers and has not exercised them.  The adding of a new sub-section will not increase the Minister's powers, but I would like to get some assurance that the Minister will exercise his present powers in respect of the width of the wheels of these very heavy vehicles.  While it may be very desirable to keep roads up to or in advance of methods of transportation, it is rather asking too much, I think, that the country should make roads at an expense of from £8,000 to £10,000 per mile for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of a few firms.  If that new method of transportation were general, then there would be substance in Deputy Good's contention.  But I think we ought not to ask public authorities to go to this great expenditure for traffic which is exceptional.  I want to impress upon the Minister the necessity for using his present powers.  Then there may be no necessity for adding a new provision to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD:</NameTxt>
      <P>On this motion, might I say that I am afraid that the part of Hamlet has been left out of the section. Whether that is an oversight on the part of the Ministry or not, I do not know.  The Minister has power to control the materials that may be used in the maintenance and construction of roadways, but he has no power at all to control the method under which the materials are to be used.  Let me give an illustration.  The Minister may say that the materials to go into a certain road are to be of a particular class. He has no power to say how those materials are to be applied.  What is the result?  As we travel through some areas controlled by the county councils, we find pot-holes filled up with loose stones and covered with a little clay or sand.  A motor car comes along and spreads the whole thing to the four winds.  I quote that to show that there is no use in controlling the class of material unless you control the method by which that material is to be used. I suggest to the Minister that a new clause should be added immediately after (a) dealing with control of the method which may be used by a council in the maintenance and construction of roadways or of roadways of a particular class.  There is also the point that in some areas it is not possible to get what is known as proper bottoming for roadways, and consequently a different form of surface-construction is necessary.  It is necessary if the Minister is to control these roadways effectively&mdash;as we hope he will under this Bill&mdash;that some such clause as I have suggested should be inserted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE:</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice there would be great difficulty in giving effect to Deputy Good's amendment.  As he has more or less hinted in moving this amendment, conditions vary very much throughout the country.  In one county one class of material is available.  One method may be adopted in one county, and a different method in another.  Also a different kind of material is used.  To give effect to the amendment I would <Col N="1527" /> require a larger staff than I have at the present time.  I can only make general rules and regulations here in Dublin.  With regard to the trunk roads I have a considerable lever, inasmuch as I can withhold the grant in cases where we are supplying money out of the road fund if the road is not constructed according to what I consider the proper method.  To go further than that and insist that the Department should supervise in an intimate way the making of roads throughout the country would practically mean nationalisation, and would mean duplication of staff all through the country. County Surveyors have their own way of doing things, and may not agree with the methods of the surveyor who is sent down from Dublin.  There is no general agreement in the country with regard to the breaking of stones.  In some counties it is found easier to break stones by hand.  In other counties you have to use machinery for the purpose.  You would find yourself up against difficulties of this kind if the amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>On this point I would like to mention to the Minister that it is not a question of roadways but of general regulations with regard to the methods to be adopted in making those roadways, and furthermore those regulations have to be laid on the Table of the House, and remain there for twenty-one days before they become operative.  They require no staff to carry them out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as it stands in the Bill gives the Minister more power than I think is desirable, and the amendment seeks <Col N="1529" /> to limit that power.  Just a moment ago the Minister deprecated the idea of getting him in touch with the practical administration as to the methods.  He said it would be impossible to carry it into effect.  I agree with him.  He would want a staff that would not at all pay for the expense incurred.  In this case the Minister is asking absolute power to suspend or terminate the direct labour scheme, and in that way to upset all the arrangements come to by the county council.  It would be rather difficult for a county council, which has made arrangements to carry the direct labour scheme through for three years, to work in practice.  When the direct labour scheme is put into operation it comes before the Minister for sanction. If he sees any objection he can reject it. I do not see any idea in supplementing his power in that direction.  We have also heard a great deal of the desirability of people knowing how long they are to be employed, and if you find two Deputies with such different ideals as Deputy Good and Deputy Johnson agreeing that the workers should have an idea of how long employment is to last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That also gives him a certain leverage over the administration of the roads.  If he is suspicious of his county councils he had an opportunity when the direct labour schemes were submitted to him of seeing that they were practical and good schemes.  He is seeking now to put his Department in control in a bureaucratic fashion over what the Road Board would be a better constituted body for.  I hope the Minister will see his way to let the direct labour schemes operate for the original number of years.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands my intention.  It is not my intention to put the direct labour schemes in a worse position.  It is intended to put them in a much better position.  The rules and regulations which have grown up around the direct labour scheme were intended in the beginning to make this system unworkable, and in practice it nearly worked out that way.  At the present time direct labour schemes have no legal sanction whatever, and the first section of this Bill is intended to validate them. They are tied up with all kinds of redtape, and before a direct labour scheme is passed I have to sign a thick volume of rules and regulations under which the scheme is to be carried out.  Under this Bill I intend to break away from that old system, put it on a par with the contract system, and leave it to the discretion of the county council to decide what is best.  I intend to draft a new Procedure of Councils Order.  The old one was the one which tied up the direct labour schemes in this impossible way.  The only concession those in favour of the direct labour scheme have to make is to allow the duration of the scheme to be considered at this moment.  I am anxious that new councils should have an opportunity of deciding whether the direct labour or the contract system is the best.  If I had not introduced this system most of the direct labour schemes in the country might be scrapped.  In return for that, I think Deputies ought to allow county councils a free hand in the matter.  I will introduce a new Procedure of Councils Order which will be laid on the Table of the House and an opportunity will be afforded for its discussion. Under that the position of direct labour will be better than it is at the present time.</P>

      <P>If that is so there is much more in this section than the Minister intimated to the House, because not only does the sub-section give the Minister the power he requires to legalise schemes already in force, but it upsets the old order which establishes that the direct labour scheme shall continue for three years and gives the Minister power to terminate the scheme at any time he likes.</P>

      <P>I should like to commend the Minister for his recent remarks in connection with this clause. I have found that there is a tendency in this House to give the Minister rather more autocratic powers than I personally think is advisable.  The Minister says he is willing and anxious that the county councils, when they come into operation under the regulations of this Bill, shall examine and decide this question for themselves.  I think that is wise.  Otherwise it seems to me the great difficulty you will have in those bodies down the country is that they will not exercise the control they should have over their own affairs, and I think the prime need of the country at the moment is to get the people interested as far as possible in their own affairs.  On the question of those roads and on this question of direct labour, I would advocate that those powers shall have as little interference as possible with their operations so far as that is practicable.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it might be well for me, having interrupted Deputy Hewat, to explain as well as I can what the intention is.  There are direct labour schemes in operation which are, within the present law and Order in Council, continuable for three years. The sub-section says that every such scheme shall continue in force up to such date as the Minister shall appoint. So far as that goes it is all right because it may mean continuing beyond the present legal limit, but it may also conceivably say that the Minister shall have power to cut off at any time.  He may not intend to avail of that power, and he has assured us that he does not intend to avail of it, but the amendment simply asks that the House should agree that such a date to be appointed by the Minister shall not be earlier than the date originally fixed for the determination of the scheme.  That fits in with what Deputy Hewat argues, and, I think, also fits in with the Minister's intention, but the sub-section, as it stands, would leave the Minister for the time being, whoever he may be, in a position to cut through direct labour schemes which, perhaps, might be only half finished.</P>

I thought that Deputy Hewat's argument supported the view that there should not be this overturning of the actions of the county council when once approved.  I think I am right in saying that the amendment does, as a matter of fact, embody what the Minister tells us is his intention regarding the older schemes in operation in December, last <Col N="1533" /> year.

      <P>I am sure that Deputy Johnson would not object to the curtailment of a direct labour scheme provided there were some radical defects found in the working of it. The Minister in that case, unless he had this provision, could not take that power.  He is only taking power where he deems it necessary.  There are two <Col N="1534" /> radical defects pointed out by Inspector Quigley in respect of all direct labour schemes, and possibly the Minister may be guided by him.  He says that the county councils insist on a large permanent staff, and that huge mileages of bye-roads are attended by men on a day's wage.  It is possible that some other scheme may be evolved by which the present system may be bettered, and why should not the Minister have power to change it?</P>

      <P>I agree that no one wants the Minister to continue a scheme which is not doing the work it was intended to do, but that is a very different thing to the powers he takes under this section.  Deputy Good thinks that we should tell him what was at the back of our minds in this amendment. I must say that the Minister should explain each section fully and should give us some idea of what powers he takes and why he is trying to take these powers.  If the Minister would adopt an attitude of that kind the House would be in a better frame of mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the proposer of an amendment is the person who should explain it, and I thought I explained my attitude in regard to this. I tried to make myself clear about the matter.  At present the rules regulating direct labour schemes are extremely rigid, and I think that the idea of having schemes enforced for three years is a serious handicap to the direct labour system, and is one of the things which would weigh with the county council in deciding whether they would have such a scheme when they realise that it would be enforced for three years without any variation.  Very often county councils decide on a contract labour scheme, and when such a scheme is passed by sealed order it often happens that there are two or three roads which they would like to include in it, but they cannot do so once the scheme is adopted.  On the whole, it is much better that the county council should have a free hand in dealing with this matter.  A great number of schemes were put into operation when there was no legal sanction for them, and there are a great number of illegalities connected with them.  I am taking power <Col N="1535" /> to validate these schemes now, whereas, as a matter of strict law, many of them should be scrapped.  I am leaving this power to the county council.  Probably very few schemes will be scrapped, but there is a possibility that they will, and the county council should have that power.  The new procedure under the county council order will put direct labour schemes on a far sounder basis, but, along with that, the county council must get power to consider a direct labour system and a contract system at the same time.</P>

The intention is that such schemes shall continue in force up to a date which the Minister shall appoint. We are seeking to introduce in the amendment further words which mean that the schemes shall continue for the whole period originally intended.  The Minister's power to vary certain things is not altered.  The only thing that is altered is that the period shall not be less than the original period fixed.</P>
      <P>That is all we seek to embody in the section by this amendment.  The scheme which is at present in operation shall continue so until it works out the full course that was prepared for it by the surveyors and approved by the Minister.  The Minister tells us that it is his intention; at least I understand from the Minister that he does not intend to curtail those schemes.  There may be certain variations provided for in the scheme itself.  There may be powers within the scheme which the Minister has had and has exercised. We are not touching that by this amendment.  We want to intimate to the Minister that he should not have power to cut off these schemes before they are fulfilled.  I hope the Dáil will agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>Under the amendment put forward by my respected friends on the Labour Benches, it seems they want to hold hard and fast by any schemes in operation at present involving direct labour.  Seeing that December, 1923, is the date in the Bill, it must be prior to that, and if a scheme was in operation from an earlier period <Col N="1537" /> the very most it could have to run would be about two years.  There does not seem to me to be a tremendous difference of opinion over the whole matter. Under the principle brought in by the amendment the situation arises that the Labour representatives want to take away the Minister's power from interfering with these schemes, whether they are good or bad.  The Minister has pointed out that that may react in both ways; in other words, it cannot always be one side, and it may react to the detriment of the interests of the mover of the amendment, just as much as it may operate against the other side.  It seems to me we will have to give the Minister reasonable latitude.</P>

I may be prejudiced, but I feel that some of the unrepresentative councils we have had, both in the past and, perhaps, at the moment, showed in many respects complete disregard of <Col N="1538" /> the higher interests of the ratepayers. I know for a fact they have drafted schemes for direct labour which impose very serious burdens on the ratepayers for a period of three years, the greater part of which is unexpired.  If your councils are to effect anything, it is necessary that certain powers should be given, notwithstanding the claptrap about the sanctity of engagements. Over and above all, the weal of the common people must take its proper place.  I feel that this amendment should be rejected and the principle outlined in the Bill should be retained.</P>

      <P>This section is to give more direct power to police authorities for prosecuting in cases of motorists using their cars without licences.  At present a person cannot be prosecuted for using a motor car without a licence except a special resolution of the county council has been passed.  In practice the police usually provide the evidence, and in the ordinary course the prosecutions should go ahead without any difficulty.  But to obtain the resolution of the county council is slow, and involved in all kinds of difficulties and, as a matter of fact, often-times it is impossible to get prosecution under the circumstances.  The section also provides in cases where the police prosecute that the county council will not have power to mitigate the sentence of the court.  At present a number of these sentences are rendered useless as deterrents to people using cars without licences, because the local authority has power to reduce the fine <Col N="1541" /> inflicted by the court to a nominal sum. In some cases they have been reduced from £20 to 5/-, and it is considered that it is only proper that any discretion in this matter should rest with the court, and not with the county council.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat on this my dissent from the general practice of even allowing the court to mitigate a penalty which it has inflicted.  It is very much better that the court should do it than that the county council should have power to do it, but I think that the obligation should be to put the onus of fixing a definite penalty upon the court, without any reference to mitigation afterwards.</P>

      <P>The object of this section is to give the Minister power, where necessary, to construct or to maintain a road.  In order to give Deputies a clear idea of the working of the section it will be necessary to quote sections of preceding Acts.  Sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the Roads Act, 1920, lays down how the road fund is to be applied.  The sub-section is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be paid out of the road fund in every year ... and subject to the payment of the sums aforesaid and of any sums to be repaid to a local or police authority out of the road fund under any other provision of this Act, the moneys standing to the credit of the road fund shall be applied by the Minister to the purposes of Part II. of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909, as amended by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then Sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909, lays down the purposes for which advances may be <Col N="1542" /> made.  The following are the purposes:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister shall have power, with the approval of the Minister for Finance&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  To make to any highway authority advances in respect of the construction of new roads or the maintenance or improvement of existing roads, or to make such advances in conjunction with a highway authority to any company or persons.</P>
    <P>(b)  to construct and maintain any new road.</P>
    <P>The object to be achieved by this section, accordingly, is that by deleting the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; it gives me power to maintain and construct any road.  It is a very considerable change in the law.  As I mentioned when we were debating the nationalisation of roads, it practically gives power to limit the expenditure on nationalisation of roads. Accordingly, I do not think there would be any objection on the part of Deputies, seeing that there was a feeling in favour of going farther in the direction of nationalisation of roads.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the section stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 35.</P>
    <P>In this part of this Act,</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;local body&rdquo; means and includes every local authority except a committee of management of a district lunatic asylum;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;pensionable officer&rdquo; means any permanent officer who either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  devotes the whole of his time to the service of one or more local authorities, or</P>
    <P>(b)  is required by virtue of his office to be a registered medical practitioner, nurse, or midwife,</P>
    <P>and the said expression also includes any person who has served as an officer of one or more committees or joint committees appointed for the purposes of the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, for a continuous period of not less than ten years and the terms of whose appointment do not expressly preclude him from claiming or receiving a pension, and the expression <Col N="1543" />&ldquo;pensionable office&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;emoluments&rdquo; includes all fees, poundage, and other payments made to an officer as such for his own use, and also the money value of any apartments, rations or other allowances in kind appertaining to his office;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;yearly salary and emoluments&rdquo; means in relation to an officer who has served for not less than three years, the average amount of his salary and emoluments during the three years ending on the quarter day which immediately precedes the day on which he ceases to hold his office, and in relation to an officer who has served for less than three years, the average amount of his salary and emoluments during each completed year of his service.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To insert in line 23, after the word &lsquo;means&rsquo; the words &lsquo;a school attendance committee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to allow whole-time school attendance officials to have the same rights as regards superannuation as are extended to other officials under local committees. These men devote their whole time to this class of work, and I think the amendment should be accepted.  If they were in any of the other services under local bodies they would enjoy the privileges asked for.</P>

      <P>These officers are not officers of local authorities under the meaning of the Act, and this amendment would not bring them under it. Even if it did, I could not, in the present state of the rates, and in view of the fact that the ratepayers are so severely handicapped, undertake to add to their burdens.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.  Another point is that most of those officers are old people, and a great many of them would go out on pension if they came under the Act.  If there is any intention at a later date of bringing them under the Act it will be necessary to see that only young people should be employed in the position.  I think that might be a hardship rather than a help to some of the people concerned.</P>

      <P>I want to correct the mistake of the Minister when he said that these school attendance officers are old people.  I am acquainted with the majority of them, and none of them would be over 50 years of age.  In some cases, they have 25 years' experience as school attendance officers, and they are doing most useful work which lasts from 10 o'clock in the morning until 5 in the evening.  They have to visit the schools, and keep a note of the attendances and absences, and they have to visit the homes of the people, and go to the courts and prosecute. They are full-time officers.  There are only about 30 in the City of Dublin and in Cork.  If the case were put properly to the Minister, I am sure he would give consideration to this body of men. I do not see why these only should be penalised.  If they are not allowed, I will not say this concession, but their rights, it will mean that they will remain on until they are tottering into the grave.  They are a most deserving body of people, and worthy of every consideration.</P>

      <P>I think there is a principle involved in this which the Minister should recognise right away, and that is that the officers are employed and paid as whole-time officers.  In the city of Dublin, I understand, there are 22 such attendance officers who are recognised and paid as full-time officers, and who are actually in receipt of a Civil Service bonus.  I contend that if they are in receipt of a Civil Service bonus they are to all intents and purposes <Col N="1545" /> Civil Servants, and as such should be entitled to the conditions in the amendment.  Further, there is the important fact that they do not receive unemployment insurance benefit. If unemployed to-morrow they would receive nothing after their long period of service.  The main consideration is that they are actually full-time officers, and it would be a good thing for the State if there were many more full-time officers employed in this work.  I think the Minister should recognise the justice of the case put forward on behalf of these men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is a misunderstanding with regard to the school attendance staff.  There are what you call whole-time officers who are inspectors, but there are other officers in connection with school attendance who are not whole-time officers.  In Dublin, and elsewhere in the Saorstát, there are a number of what are called part-time officers.  In connection with school attendance, in the local authority of which I happen to be a member, the clerk is a school attendance officer.  He is paid a small salary for discharging the duties in connection with that office.  Nobody can allege that is a whole-time office. I am only taking that as an illustration. As I said, you have the inspectors who are whole-time officers.  Apart from that, it is not a matter that should come under this Bill at all.  School attendance is a matter that ought to, and I hope does, come under the Minister for Education.  We are dealing with the Department for Local Government and surely it is not the intention that the person who is within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education should have his pension fixed by the Minister for Local Government, rather than by the Department of Education. With all respect I am afraid that the thinking in connection with this matter is not very clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Good about whole-time officers, that is fully covered by the section already. No one will get the pension unless he devotes his whole time to the service of a local authority.  At any <Col N="1546" /> rate, the claim is not made on behalf of anybody but whole-time officers.  The number of such officers, as has been pointed out, is small; not more than 30 or 40 in the whole country would be affected.  Deputy Good makes a point that this is a matter that should not come under this Bill, but should rather be dealt with by the Minister for Education.  The question is, are they or are they not under the Minister for Education or the local committees? I hold the school attendance officers are under the local committees, and are officers of these bodies and not of the Minister for Education.  The Minister for Education has no control over these.</P>

In my opinion the claim is a strong one, and I can see no justifiable reason why the Minister should refuse the inclusion of these officers in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to call attention to the arguments used by Deputies about the sanctity of contracts.  The appointment of these officers was a contract between a particular individual and the nation.  There were no pensionable rights, and both parties knew what they were doing when the appointments were being made.  Now it is sought to go behind that contract made between the individual and the citizen on behalf of the people.  Sanctity of contract is <Col N="1547" /> all right in one particular direction, but not all right except in that direction. That is what I understand from some of the arguments used.  I am not dealing with the question of the rights or wrongs of the case, but the nation has as much right to insist on the sanctity of contracts as those who speak on behalf of organised bodies.</P>

      <P>I am much impressed by Deputy Mrs. Collins O'Driscoll's statement and the arguments of other Deputies, but I am in an exceedingly difficult position at the present stage in trying to codify the superannuation law.  Amendments have been put down to give pensionable rights to all kinds of officers, and the only ground I can take in getting this Bill through is to see that intolerable burdens are not put on the backs of ratepayers.  There is a good deal in what Deputy Gorey said about people accepting positions with their eyes open.  They knew at the time they were not to be pensionable officers, and they have no right, at a time when the ratepayers are harder hit than ever before, to have this additional charge put on their shoulders. We are fortunate in this country in being able to carry on at all with our high rates.  I was talking some time ago to a distinguished representative of the United States, who told me that in one of the richest States they had to close down the schools altogether.  Of course, out there the schools are under local authorities, and owing to want of funds as a result of the terrible agricultural depression, schools had to be closed.  That is in one of the richest countries in the world.  If a country of <Col N="1548" /> that kind finds it so hard to carry on as a result of financial conditions, I would like the Deputies to consider our position in this country, which is not so rich.  If we were to burden the rates to such an extent that the people would not be able to bear it they would refuse to pay, and accordingly, on principle, I must resist this amendment.</P>

      <P>A pensionable officer is a permanent officer who either devotes the whole of his time to one or more local authority, or is a registered medical practitioner, a nurse, or a midwife. In this case, you have officers of a local authority, though I do not know at the moment whether they are permanent officers or not.  However, that is not involved in the acceptance or rejection of this amendment.  The amendment is a little awkward in its phraseology, but it endeavours to secure that amongst the local bodies dealt with in this part of the Act, there shall be considered school attendance committees. It may be that school attendance committees, even without the insertion of this amendment, would be considered local bodies.  But the amendment makes sure that they shall be, though they probably are at present.  If these school attendance officers are not permanent officers within the meaning of the section&mdash;if they are not whole-time officers, and if they have not served a certain period and attained a certain age, or become incapable of discharging their duties by virtue of infirmity&mdash; they are not going to be pensioned.  If it is true, as is said&mdash;I have no reason to entertain any doubt about it&mdash;that it involves probably fifty or sixty people in the whole of the Saorstát&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question of the age of these people, and whether they are permanent employees of particular bodies, has been raised by the Minister and by other speakers.  I understand that in the City of Dublin there are twenty-two of these officers, who are engaged from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m. on every week-day, except Saturday, when they are engaged up to 1 p.m.  I think no Deputy, with the possible exception of Deputy Gorey, would dispute that men working these hours are whole-time employees.  I know that in the case of a person relieved from paying unemployment insurance, the general understanding is that the employers agree to pay full salary to the employed person for a certain period in case of sickness, or that they make some provision for him after a certain number of years' service.  One can understand how Deputy Gorey has objection to giving anything like reasonable or humane treatment to anybody engaged in the work of education.

The latter would not, in the ordinary course, be pensionable on this service. These people are engaged in a useful class of work, and it would be well if that class of work could be extended in the Saorstát.  In the city, these men are actually called upon to conduct prosecutions without legal assistance. There is no question that they are full-time employees.  It may be said that they entered into a contract, but it is <Col N="1550" /> well known that, where there is no pension scheme, that is taken into consideration by a public body when fixing the salary.  The Minister will merely be doing justice in accepting the amendment that Deputy Doyle has moved.</P>

Whether we pay out of the right-hand pocket as ratepayers, or out of the left-hand pocket as taxpayers, makes little difference; we have got to pay.

We are <Col N="1551" /> in Committee on a Bill to which it is desired to make an amendment which, it is urged, by adding a certain number of persons, will increase the burden of the ratepayers&mdash;not the taxpayers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that this is a permissive amendment, having as its object the bringing within the purview of &ldquo;local bodies&rdquo; of school attendance committees. The fact that it is going to make it possible for a local authority to pay <Col N="1552" /> a pension to an officer who is called upon to resign, or whose office is abolished, would deter the local authority from abolishing that office.  Conceivably the new Commissioners might abolish the office of school attendance officer.  The very fact that, if that were done, there might be a call for a pension, would deter the commissioners from taking that action, and would conserve a really necessary service to education.  I deny that acceptance of this amendment will entail a burden upon the ratepayers.  Possibly it may; possibly it may not.  It by no means provides that there shall be a burden placed upon the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>My intervention in this debate has been treated by Deputy Davin in the manner peculiar to Deputy Davin.  I want to draw the attention of the Dáil to the tendency among certain Deputies and certain elements of the community to urge that if a person is in receipt of public money he is entitled to superannuation, irrespective of his office or of the terms of his contract. What virtue is there in the person employed in a public capacity, as distinguished from the ordinary citizen?  If this principle is good with regard to every public servant, irrespective of the conditions of his employment, it is equally good so far as the ploughman, the farmer and everybody else is concerned.  Until we are prepared to accept such a position, I will oppose pensions to all persons whose contracts did not specifically state that they were to receive pensions. I do that on principle and for no other reason.  If an office carries with it a pension, the applicant knows it.  If it does not, he knows it likewise, and there is no injustice done.  If we are going to adopt any other attitude, I will certainly oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;After the word &lsquo;authorities&rsquo; in line 29, to insert the following words &lsquo;and to have no other occupation or source of earned income.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to try and make clear what is not at all clear at the moment.  The expression &ldquo;pensionable officer&rdquo; means any permanent officer who devotes the whole of his time to the service of one or more local authorities.  The phrase &ldquo;devotes the whole of his time&rdquo; is somewhat ambiguous. A whole-time officer in a technical school is one, I understand, who devotes 21 hours per week for practically eight months of the year to his occupation.  If the officer devotes that amount of time to his work he comes within the expression &ldquo;whole-time officer.&rdquo;  The Minister for Education will correct me if I am wrong.  What does that mean?  These technical schools in many cases are only open at night.  At least many of the classes are open then.  A teacher can easily get in the 21 hours required per week and follow any other occupation he likes in the day-time.  I know of a case, I do not suppose it is exceptional, where those teachers carry on in the day-time&mdash;some of them in lucrative occupations&mdash;and they devote their evening hours, 21 hours per week, to teaching at the technical schools.  If this clause is to be passed in its present form they become pensionable officers entitled to large pensions at the end of 10 years or more.  I think the House will agree that this is not exactly fair, and to endeavour to meet that difficulty I propose this amendment.  I put the word &ldquo;earned&rdquo; before income to make a distinction between what you might call private means and earned income, because I think the distinction is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the case which was used by Deputy Good to illustrate his argument is not <Col N="1555" /> a very good one, if I know anything about the facts.  I think he has in his mind a class of officers largely engaged in technical instruction in Dublin and the adjoining townships who are not whole-time officers in the proper sense of the word but who are part-time officers and who do not come within the section at all.  Regularly appointed technical instructors appointed by the Department are people who have to devote their whole time to the service of the Department and who are not allowed to engage in any other occupations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because it does more than what Deputy Good seeks to do.  A man may, for instance, put in a reasonable day's work&mdash;reasonable even in Deputy Good's opinion &mdash;and may devote some time in the evening to writing newspaper articles, but if it was found out that he did that, and was remunerated for it, he would be shut out by the amendment from receiving a pension.  A man might, for instance, grow roses in his summer afternoons, and might sell them, and from that source he might get a certain income, but the fact that he did that would debar him from a pension if the amendment were accepted.  I think the words, &ldquo;devotes the whole of his services to the local authority&rdquo; covers the position very well.  There should be no doubt about what is a whole-time officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Connell on this point.  I do not think that there is any difficulty, when a practical case is put up, of deciding whether a person is a whole-time officer or not.  If he is not devoting sufficient time to the performance of his duties, the authority employing him can call on him to give up any occupation or hobby which may be interfering with his work.  If I laid down a hard and fast rule it would rule out all sorts of people who have hobbies apart from their occupation with the local authority.  A man may grow roses or write newspaper articles, as Deputy <Col N="1556" /> O'Connell suggests, or he may be the secretary of a golf or tennis club, and get some remuneration for it.  A man may paint pictures; for instance, one of the most distinguished of our Irish artists, Chinnery, was also a civil servant, and founded a school of art of his own.  There are thousands of cases of men who engaged in hobbies during their leisure hours, and who spend their time much more profitably in that way than they would, for instance, in public-houses, and I do not think that it would be fair to interfere with this ordinary discretion.  Of course we might have a case of a man also being, for instance, an auctioneer, but there is no doubt that he is not a whole-time officer, and no local authority would attempt to have him placed in the category of a whole-time officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear that it is not desirable that cases should come up in the way which the Minister mentioned <Col N="1557" /> for his decision without any guide?  Surely there must be a rule saying that a man, such as in the case mentioned by Deputy Corish, is or is not a part-time officer.  It may be interpreted that he is a whole-time officer because he has a fixed appointment with duties attached to that office, but if he is permitted to do outside work apart from that occupation he is not dependent on that salary for his livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be a dangerous precedent for the Minister to make any statement here which might involve the loss of pension to certain public officials owing to the fact that they do work outside that for which they have been definitely appointed.  I know of cases where urban councils in small and poor towns are unable to keep a whole-time borough surveyor, and a salary in one instance of only £40 a year is given with the post of borough surveyor.  They were unable to get a surveyor to do these duties, and they appealed to the county council to allow the local assistant surveyor to act as borough surveyor.  The county council had no objection, and they appealed to the Local Government Department for sanction to allow the surveyor to act in that town and sanction was granted under the circumstances. I do not think that it would be fair, because that man had been allowed to do that work by the county council with the sanction of the Ministry, that his pension should be interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very difficult matter to try and lay down any fixed formula, but if the Deputies could give me a definition upon which I could go I would consider the matter.  I think Deputy Good must realise that his own remedy for this situation is rather too wide and would result in very severe hardships.  At present discretion is left more or less with the local authority, and if they decide that an officer is giving adequate service, that at any time they require his services he is there, and that he gives these services efficiently, that would count very much with us and, in fact, as a general rule we would not oppose it.  There is no hard and fast rule at present and it is very hard to get one.  If we did lay down a <Col N="1558" /> rule here, a court of law might put a different interpretation upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it might be difficult to get a good definition of &ldquo;whole-time officer,&rdquo; but I think that Deputy Good's amendment raises the question as to whether the Government intend to give such definition. It would not lead to any great hardship if this proposal put forward here were adopted.  As regards the expression &ldquo;devote the whole of his time,&rdquo; I do not suppose that any court of law would interpret that to mean twenty-four hours a day, but it might be so taken.  Supposing we put the weakest interpretation upon it, and say that it means the whole of his working time, would not that exclude from a pension an officer who undertook outside work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Thrift is anxious to rule out people in the position mentioned by Deputy O'Connell, men who in their leisure hours may be inclined to write a novel or short story, or paint pictures or grow roses, and if we were to accept this definition that would be the result.  This definition is taken out of the ordinary enactments and has been the subject of legal interpretation.  I expect that the judges put a different interpretation on the words in different sets of circumstances.  I think it would be very difficult to give a definition which would be sufficiently wide and yet sufficiently narrow to cover all cases coming up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in thinking that I do not wish to rule out such people as those mentioned, but my intention was to point out that the clause might rule them out in cases where it was intended that they should not be ruled out.  Perhaps the Minister would undertake to try and get a satisfactory definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is <Col N="1559" /> something to be said for Deputy Good's point of view, but I do not think that his amendment is satisfactory.  There are, for instance, such cases as public officials working for local authorities who work also for the Government and who are, for example, in the position of paid gate-keepers at G.A.A. sports and people protest against this because they are whole-time officers.  I dare say that Deputy Good is standing up for those people who protest against gate-keepers at Croke Park already paid salaries out of Government funds, but, whether that is so or not, there is something to be said in favour of making a pensionable officer one who is devoting his working time to the public service and who should not undertake any other regular occupation for pay.</P>
      <P>I do not think the amendment that Deputy Good puts down is going to secure that without securing a great deal more beyond what he pleads for. I think some other form, which would include regular occupation for pay, might cover the intention of the Deputy and the intentions of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD:</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite recognised, when I tried to frame words to meet the difficulty in the first instance, that it would require wiser heads than mine; but I would be satisfied if the Minister undertakes to look into the question between this and the Report Stage and see what can be done.  I am satisfied, and I think the Dáil would be satisfied, that we should in some way define the word &ldquo;whole-time.&rdquo;  It is a most ambiguous term at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like giving any undertaking that I feel in advance will not bear fruit.  We have had this question of whole-time coming before us practically every day in administrative matters, and it is continually cropping up in the course of our business. The judges put their own legal interpretation on the word; there are legal precedents to cover all kinds of cases, and I am afraid we could not hit upon any definition that would exactly fit this situation.  However, we will give the matter consideration in the meantime, and if any happy inspiration <Col N="1560" /> strikes us we may be able to bring something forward here; but I am not optimistic.</P>

      <P>I do not know if Deputy Doyle is prepared to stand up for Deputy Daly's amendment.  If he is, I will give way to him.  As it is, I find myself differing from rather than supporting all the suggestions made by Deputy Daly.  A compounder of medicine ought to be dealt with separately, because it is a most important office to my mind.  I am sorry I do not know what an engineer means.  A Deputy told me a minute ago that an engineer inspects houses.  Some people who put up electrical wires around a house call themselves engineers.  I know very little about rate collectors, rent collectors, and assistant surveyors. I know a little about dentists, and I ask the Dáil not to include that class of gentleman under this heading. There are two important dental associations in Ireland&mdash;the Incorporated Dental Society and the Irish Dental Association&mdash;and neither of them knows a single thing about this matter being put down here.  Possibly Deputies have thought there might have been some canvassing, and that those associations were responsible for having dentists included.  I may mention that the associations know nothing whatever about it.  I could not do anything to encourage people to be non-industrious. I can foresee a lot of young men, if this were adopted, getting qualified, and getting £200 or £300 a year as Government dentists.  All their industry would go to the wind; the golf clubs would get more members, and pensions would be staring those young men in the face.  If the Dáil desires to include dentists, that may be done, but I will <Col N="1562" /> vote against it.  If a dentist is any good he will be able to make provision for his own pension, and he will not be looking forward to a pension such as is suggested after several years of service.</P>

      <P>This amendment was put down for the purpose of making sure that this class will be looked after.  Up to the present matrons, nurses, and attendants in county infirmaries have been entitled to superannuation.  Under an old Act, 28 or 30 years out of date, those people were entitled to superannuation. Any persons who occupied those positions in the county infirmaries during the last 27 years are not entitled to superannuation.  Matrons, nurses and attendants have just as much responsibility as similar officials in county hospitals.  It would be well if the Minister includes them.  Under Section 48 the Minister may say that these are included, and there is something said about such persons in that section, but I want to make sure that they are referred to in Section 35, where all the other pensionable officers are mentioned.  I am sure the Minister will not find any difficulty in acceding to the terms of the amendment.  Every Deputy will realise that a person with 20 or 30 years service in a county infirmary is entitled to consideration.  If, under the new system, the county hospital is sufficient to cater for all patients and the infirmary is not required, it would be unfair to dismiss the officials without compensating them for the number of years they have served.  As far as the question of running chances of getting diseases and complaints, they run the same chance as any other person under the Board of Health.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to delete lines 32 to 39 inclusive.  This is rather an extraordinary clause, and I will read it:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;and the said expression also includes any person who has served as an officer of one or more committees <Col N="1565" /> or joint committees appointed for the purposes of the Agricultural and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, for a continuous period of not less than ten years and the terms of whose appointment do not expressly preclude him from claiming or receiving a pension, and the expression &lsquo;pensionable office&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to bring in as a pensionable officer an officer who was not pensionable at the time of his appointment, and that is only one of the features in connection with this proposal. Pensions under this Bill are to be approved by the Minister for Local Government.  All teachers in connection with technical education are appointed by the Minister for Education, the terms of their appointment are made by the Minister for Education, their salaries are fixed by the Minister for Education, and they carry on their work with the approval of the Minister for Education.  But when it comes to the question of pensioning, under this proposal they leave the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education and come under the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very extraordinary proposal; it is about the only proposal of that character that I know of in the Bill.  The reason, I take it, that this is put forward is that these officials want to have their appointments looked upon as appointments of the local authority. As a matter of fact, these officials are not appointed by the local authority at all; they are appointed by a board on which the local authority has representation only.  The minutes of that board do not go before the local authority; that board is in no way subject to the local authority, and the appointment is made without the sanction of the local authority.  Yet when it comes to the question of pensioning, it is attempted to bring in these officials who are not appointed by the local authority.</P>
    <P>It may be argued on behalf of these officials that their salaries, if not paid by the local authorities, are contributed to by them.  Well, the local authority under the Technical Instruction <Col N="1566" /> Act, contributes a penny, and in some cases twopence, for purposes of technical instruction.  That is all the local authority has to do with technical instruction.  That money is administered by a joint committee.  I suppose that penny, or twopence, would possibly form ten per cent. of the expense of carrying on technical education in a particular area, so that if you were to take it on that argument the local authority would not contribute even ten per cent. of the salaries of these particular officials.  Yet it is sought to make the local authorities responsible for the pensions of those particular teachers.</P>
    <P>I was greatly struck by what the Minister said a moment ago regarding some of the States in America, that they actually found that the pensioning of a number of these officials amounted to such a sum that they had to abandon the work of education.  If these officials are to become pensioners, the present sources of income will not be sufficient to pay the pensions, not to talk of doing any educational work at all, so that the illustration that the Minister gives is a very apt one.  Furthermore, if it should be decided that these officials should be pensionable officers I do not see why the technical teacher should be put on any different footing from the ordinary national school teacher. There should be no distinction. Why should a technical teacher be brought in under local government for the purpose of a pension, and another teacher who has, possibly, longer and better service, be brought in under another scheme altogether?  I think that no matter from what point of view you take this proposal it is an exceedingly unwise one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.  When these committees were appointed at the commencement by the British Government, there were no pensions in connection with them; they were, more or less, committees of the county council. They appointed a certain number of members, and the Government of the day appointed a certain number to complete the committee.  The money in the same way was raised partly by the <Col N="1567" /> county council and partly by a grant from the Government, but there were no pensions for a considerable time. But that was altered.  The British Government, in the year 1919, I think&mdash; I am not quite certain of the date&mdash; brought them under the Pensions Act, and they have every right to have pensions. I was chairman of one committee, and vice-chairman of another, and I knew intimately up to four years ago, as far as my own county was concerned, the way they worked.  There are no officers, in my opinion, who deserve better of the country than these people, who are striving to make the youth of the country take up, after they have left school and in their free hours, work that would be useful to them all through their lives.  In most cases, these men give their whole time to the work.  It is only right and just that they should not be left out, and I am very glad to see that the Minister proposes to confirm what the British Government did a few years ago.  The officers themselves are not quite easy in their minds about their position.  They are pensionable officers, but they are not satisfied.  Perhaps the Minister will say whether they are wrong or right, that they ought to come under the gratuity provision in the case of those who served less than ten years, and if they are entitled to that allowance that they, being also brought under the Pensions Act, should get the same chance as any others.  I hope that the Minister will not accept the amendment because I think it will be generally agreed that those officers have done good service.  In most cases they are extremely high-class, well educated and efficient men and women, and I hope that their case will be most wholeheartedly considered, and that nothing will be done to take away from them what they have every right to, to be considered as pensionable officers in every sense of the word.</P>

But it apears that when it comes to paying for that in the way it ought to be paid for, it is another question so far as Deputy Good is concerned. He made great play with the point that the body that appoints the instructors is not the local authority. As a matter of fact, this body is appointed by the local authority, so that there is not much in that point.  The technical instructors are officers of this committee and appointed by it.  True, they must have the qualifications laid down by the Department.  They must be sanctioned by the Department, but they are selected, appointed and paid by the local authority.  This agricultural and technical committee, or joint committee, or whatever it may be, is a sub-committee in the same position as a sub-committee of the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is asking for too much.  If this part of the section is deleted it would prevent technical officers appointed a number of years ago, and whose appointments have been sanctioned by the Department, from receiving any superannuation. As to the question of the local authorities paying the technical instructors, I think that does not arise, as the Department pays half the expense in that respect incurred in each county, and I think the Department would also bear half the cost of the superannuation, so that I think the point made by Deputy Wilson fails. Deputy White says we will have too many persons superannuated.  I quite agree that there are too many people superannuated, but the unfortunate thing is that owing to different actions by the local authorities and the Government some of those people have been obliged to leave their occupations, and surely they cannot be allowed to starve. They must get something.  Their parents went to a great deal of trouble and expense in educating them to qualify for their positions.  They may have served their country well in their different occupations for a number of years, and surely Deputy Good does not want to deprive these people of the bread of life?  Any person who has acted as a technical instructor for ten years, doing hard work and travelling in all conditions of weather, should be entitled to something if he is compelled to forfeit his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe Deputy O'Connell's argument is a sound one.  If we want a prosperous country we will have to look after technical education, and we must <Col N="1570" /> depend on the technical instructors for the technical education of our young men and women.  Those people have given valuable services, and if they come to the time when they must resign, be it through ill-health or compulsion, I think they are entitled to some consideration.</P>

The carrying out of these duties involves travelling long distances in many cases and often under very unfavourable conditions.  I am sure that the Dáil will disagree almost unanimously with the Deputy's amendment.  We are looking forward to an improvement in agricultural methods, and if we are going to treat unfairly the people on whom we will have to depend to bring about this improvement I do not think that we are very likely to attract the right class of instructors in the different branches of technical education.</P>

      <P>A point was briefly touched upon by Deputy Lyons which I think must meet the main objection raised by Deputy Good with regard to this particular clause, and I think it was touched on by Deputy Wilson also, that is the question as to who will bear the cost of the pensions. If the present system to which Deputy Good referred continues, namely that a very large proportion of the grants, something like three-fourths, are paid from headquarters, it will mean that the proportion of the pension paid locally will be small.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan):</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that there is no dispute that agricultural instructors are included in the class which is entitled to pension.  I suppose that is generally admitted.  There was some doubt about it, as the Bill was originally drafted, because when these instructors were first appointed it was not quite certain how long the schemes would continue.  The appointments were, therefore, made from year to year by each county committee.  The schemes, however, have continued, and obviously will continue for a long time. Notwithstanding that, in a great many counties&mdash;in fact, I think, in the majority of counties&mdash;agricultural instructors are appointed from year to year. Though they are really permanent officials, their appointments are renewed each year.  That is done although they are as permanent as the schemes themselves.  The reason for that is contained in the history of the case.  When the Act was passed, nobody was quite sure how long these county committees of agriculture and technical instruction would last.  It was really an experiment and, for that reason, no permanent appointments were made at the beginning.  Now, experience has shown, beyond yea or nay, that these schemes are likely to last in their present form, or in some substitute form, permanently.  I may use the word &ldquo;permanently&rdquo; for the purpose of this discussion.  In some counties, I understand, these instructors are not appointed at all.  They just carry on, and the whole position is somewhat unsatisfactory from their point of view, and is especially unsatisfactory from the point of view of the county committee instructor, who is considering whether he has a right to a pension under this Bill.  It was for that reason that the next amendment was put down &mdash;&ldquo;to insert in line 36, page 19, after the word &lsquo;years,&rsquo; the words &lsquo;notwithstanding that such appointment was or is renewable periodically.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I had not the advantage of hearing the beginning of this debate, I am <Col N="1573" /> not quite sure whether it was generally agreed that officers of county committees should get pensions, whoever paid them.  I take it that that is the attitude of the Farmers' Party.  I have heard some Deputies, at all events, say that these are officers who are entitled to pensions if any officers of county committees are entitled to them.  I think that is established beyond yea or nay. If once the principle that officials of local authorities are entitled to pensions is admitted, certainly there is no reason on earth against excluding agricultural instructors of county committees.  But there are very good reasons for including them.  They are doing very good work and they are doing it under very onerous conditions.  They go about the country on push-bicycles doing extremely good work, and they are men who have spent two or three years at the College of Science and have very high technical qualifications.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be easy to find men with the same technical qualifications, doing the same work, who are paid so badly and whose conditions of work are so undesirable.  It was from that point of view that I had hoped at a later date to get the principle adopted that the proper secretary of a county committee is a promoted instructor. That would open up some avenue for these people.  If it is admitted that any class of public official is entitled to a pension, then these officials are.  The only question is: who should pay them?  Technically, the present position is that they are officers of the county committees.  It is true that, speaking roughly, the salary of every one out of two comes from the central authority.  But they are officers of the county committees.  I think you have to admit that a grant, such as this, given to a county committee and the money paid as salary to one instructor out of two from the central authority, is a grant-in-aid which, by arrangement between the county committee and the central authority, can be spent as the county committee wishes.  That is really the historical position.  Whatever moneys come from the Department are really grants-in-aid of the work of the county committees to supplement the rates.  That <Col N="1574" /> being so, it is not really so obvious as it would appear to be that the central authority should take liability for the pension.  These officials are officers of the county committee, even though the salary of one out of two, approximately, is paid by the Department.  The central authority, which makes the grant&mdash;and I say this, having regard to Deputy White's remark&mdash;has not a Fortunatus' purse.  It does not get the money on the street.  It gets the money out of taxation and it gives a certain amount each year to the county committees. That money goes towards schemes and the salary of an instructor, and that arrangement can be altered by agreement between the county committee and the Department. Why, in view of all these circumstances, is it said that it is obviously the right thing that the central authority should bear the pension?  When, as a matter of fact, you decide that the officers in question are entitled to a pension, I want to be shown why, having regard to the manner in which the county committees are financed, the central authority should find the pension.  It is already finding a grant-in-aid. If this was one of the hundred items of wasteful expenditure in connection with local authorities there would be something to be said for Deputy White's point of view.  But it is not.  Deputy White himself admits that this pension should be paid, whoever pays it.  No irrelevant remarks about there being more pensioners than ratepayers alters the fact that Deputy White is enthusiastically supporting this pension at the moment&mdash;</P>

I doubt very much if the farmer would pay less&mdash;this is an agricultural question, and one that interests farmers particularly&mdash;by paying for this pension out of taxation than they would by paying out of rates.  I think it is probable they would pay just as much of it by way of taxation.  There is no use taking up the attitude that if you put the pension on the taxes, farmers will pay none of it.  That is not the situation.  I would ask Deputies to consider the question from this point of view; this pension should be paid.  I am quite clear about that.  I would like to hear any Farmer Deputy who would get up and say that it should not be paid, however he may speak about the number of ratepayers being less than the number of pensioners.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good's point&mdash;the only point of any moment which, I think, has been made&mdash;is that these pensions may be charged upon the rates, but that if he were sure they <Col N="1576" /> would be charged upon the fund administered by the county committee, he would consider it quite satisfactory. I suggest that there is no provision in the Bill which leads one to think that the ordinary county rate would bear any pension to these people.  A &ldquo;local body&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;every local authority except the committee of management of a district lunatic asylum...&rdquo; A county committee will surely be regarded as a &ldquo;local authority.&rdquo; Perhaps here we have a reason why we should include in this earlier definition of &ldquo;local body&rdquo; a county committee of agriculture and technical instruction, so as to ensure that a county committee will be regarded as a &ldquo;local body.&rdquo;  If it is so defined, it will be a &ldquo;local body&rdquo; which may, with the consent of the Minister, grant a pension to one of these officers under the usual conditions. In that case, the pension would come out of the fund that that committee administers&mdash;wherever that fund may come from.  If the county committee is to be defined as a &ldquo;local body&rdquo; under this part of the Bill, it will be a local body which will have power, with the consent of the Minister, to grant a pension to these officers.  If it has the power to grant a pension it will be obviously out of the fund that that local body&mdash;the county committee&mdash;administers that the pension will come.  On that point, I would like to ask the Minister if he will insert on the next stage some words in defining &ldquo;local body&rdquo; to include county committees of agriculture and technical instruction.  In such an event, there would be ample safeguards as regards Deputy Good's point.</P>

      <P>This amendment of Deputy Good's is based on the principle that the Minister for Education should have control of the technical schools as part of his educational authority.  It does not seem to me that going into this is forming a precedent.  In this case the Local Government Department are trying to provide for people that are not directly under their control.  That raises what I think is a very large question as to the whole system of pensions. It would be an unpopular thing in this <Col N="1577" /> House as constituted&mdash;following the expressions coming from its various parts &mdash;in any way to question the sanctity of the arrangements at present in operation as regards pensions.  I am not going to take it on my shoulders to do any such thing or to question the efficiency of the officers in the various Departments, but I do contend that when Deputies come down to this House, and emphasise the terrible hardships the Government officials go through as an argument in favour of special pension arrangements, they go a little too far.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, Government officials, as a whole, do their work thoroughly and well.  On the other hand, to select them and to put them on a pedestal as doing specially hard work compared with the work carried on by the man making his living in other directions, is to be disputed.  In this clause there is a provision that pensions shall be for a service of not less than ten years. That, in my judgment, is going too far. A man who wants to be pensioned at the end of ten years' service has either come into your service after giving the best part of his life to another job, or is leaving it at a time when his capacity is unimpaired, and very often he is in a position to earn more when he comes out from the job.  I am not questioning the right of the man to do it, but you see very often men retired from the public service enjoying a pension and a bigger income than they ever had out of their work.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point Deputy Hewat is making about the ten years' service, those particular officers are put in a worse position than the ordinary officer under the Act in respect of whom no such provision applies at all.  The object is to prevent those officers getting gratuities.  An officer with less than ten years' service is, under certain conditions, eligible for a gratuity.  We consider it would be a great hardship on the local authority if any one of those officers left his employment under conditions that would enable him to get a gratuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE:</NameTxt>
      <P>They are employed temporarily from year to year in those positions, and under conditions that make them whole-time permanent officers.  In many cases they are appointed automatically from year to year.  There are cases where the county councils cannot continue those schemes and they have to dispense with the service of those officers.  If those officers were in a position to claim a gratuity, it would be a great hardship on the local authority which was not in a position to pay their salaries. Accordingly, we have insisted that those officers shall not become pensionable until they have ten years' service.</P>
      <P>There is no precedent in this section. On the face of it it seems unsound that the local authority should contribute the whole pension, considering that they only pay 30 or 40 per cent. of the salary.  After all, there is no great reason why their pensions should be paid out of taxation rather than out of the local fund.  It will be the same individuals who will bear the brunt of the taxation in any case.  They are very efficient officers and are people who are most intimately interested in the local authorities.  It is to their interest to see that those officers give useful service. Under Section 8 of the Act of 1918, they are provided for as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) This section shall apply to a whole-time officer of a committee of a local authority or of a joint committee of several local authorities in like manner as if he were an officer of the local authority or authorities holding a pensionable office, and in the case of an officer of a joint committee the amount of the superannuation allowance or gratuity shall be payable by the local authorities in such proportions as may be agreed upon, or in default of agreement, as may be determined by the Local Government Board: Provided that, in the application of this section to an officer of a committee or joint committee appointed for the purposes of the Agricultural and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, the sanction of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for <Col N="1580" /> Ireland shall be substituted for the sanction of the Local Government Board.</P>
    <P>That is a proviso already in existence. We are not accordingly breaking away from precedent in making those officers pensionable by the local authorities.  We are insisting on their being whole-time officers, and we are not allowing them to come under the gratuity portion of the Bill.  I think the local authorities come very well out of the bargain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that it is a satisfactory answer.  There is a considerable amount of doubt about the 1919 Act, and that is the reason of this clause.  Nobody has a higher view of those teachers than I have.  There is no class of teachers in educational work that I have a higher regard for than those engaged in technical education. From anything I have to say I do not wish anyone to take me in any way as saying anything else of those people. They are all excellent men who do very good work.  My difficulty is that those men are under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>They are engaged in educational work.  Why take one small section of teachers engaged in the work of the education of the State, and say, &ldquo;You should be pensioned under the Ministry of Local Government?  When it comes to the question of pensions, I have nothing to do with you, I refer you to him.&rdquo;  That is the position, and I say it is a most extraordinary position.  I doubt if there is such an extraordinary position anywhere.  I do not object if those men are entitled to getting a pension, but I do object to that pension being put on the local authorities for those people.  If it is decided that those men are entitled to pensions under the Act, why make a difference between them and any other teachers?  The duties they discharge are under the Minister for Education, and yet, when it comes to a question of pension, he refers them to the Minister for Local Government. The Minister for Local Government may say that is only the position under this Bill, but the clause is a little bit wider than that.  The clause says if there is any dispute between the local authority and this particular teacher, the dispute is to be referred to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is to be the Solomon who is to settle the amount of pension of the teacher.  That appeared to me from <Col N="1582" /> the start to be a most ridiculous position, and I think it is the duty of the Dáil to put that matter right.  I do not want, in striking out this clause, to deprive these teachers of anything to which they are entitled.  But I say that this is not the place nor the way to do it, and, for heaven's sake, when we are doing these things, let us try to do them in a proper manner.</P>

There was a question on the Order Paper to-day about one of these teachers who has given fifty years' service, and who has no right to pension or gratuity. We have been urging that there are something like 800 or a 1,000 such teachers under the Ministry for Education, year in and year out, and that these should be provided with a pension scheme.  That, however, has not been done and the Minister tells us that we have no legislation to do it, and now we have Deputy Good's suggestion regarding these technical teachers, and even the youngest of them will be pensionable before that occurs.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying to-day that what Deputy Good suggests would only be taking the rights away from these men and exposing them to risks to which they should not be exposed.</P>

The Minister referred to the farmers in regard to local rates and taxation, and led up to the fact that it comes to the same thing whether the farmers pay by means of local rates or taxation.

      <P>I understood the Minister's statement to mean that it did not matter to the farmer whether the pensions were paid or not, as, eventually, he would have to pay them.  We agree that the incidence of local rating is unfair to the farmer, and we maintain that he pays an undue portion of the local rates and that he would have to pay an undue portion of this superannuation. We maintain that the twenty-acre farmer pays as much as the shopkeeper who makes £1,000 a year.  Our view about pensions is this: We do not blindly aim at cutting down pensions indiscriminately, but we say that they should be equitable and fair. We aim at cutting down pensions, but not cutting them down indiscriminately. We do not want a person entitled to a pension having his pension cut and leaving one to a man who is not entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have amendments down later on which will have the effect of cutting down the general pension list.  We all agree that no class is more deserving of pensions than the agricultural <Col N="1584" /> officers, and I think the technical officers may be included with them. They are travelling through the country all the year round, and they become old men while they are still young, owing to the hardships which they have to face.  I would be very slow in taking any action which would deprive officers of pensions to which they are entitled, but I cannot see why the Minister makes exceptions with regard to gratuities if they go out before ten years.  Why make exceptions in this case?</P>
    <P>We are told that they are temporary officers, but they are just as temporary after fifteen as after seven years, and although they are nominally appointed as temporary, they are really maintained as permanent officers.  No distinction of this kind should be made. We ought to find out once and for all whether they are temporary or permanent officers.  If they are only nominally temporary they should be made permanent and put upon an equal footing with the others.  I urge upon the Minister the necessity of clarifying the circumstances surrounding this question. If the salaries had been paid largely out of departmental funds the pensions should be similarly paid out of such funds.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy who has just spoken that clarification is needed in this matter.  I could not gather, and I would like to know whether it is so, that the effect of Deputy Good's amendment will be to make a proportion of the pension charge payable out of the Central Taxation Fund.  It does not seem to me that that is contained in the terms of the amendment, and, if it is not, how far is all the discussion of that aspect of the case relevant at all, or where is it leading us?  The fact that a certain Ministry contributes to the assistance of education as a Department of public administration in a certain locality is put forward as a reason for a thing which the amendment does not provide, so far as I can see, namely, for charging a portion of the pension on the Central Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the only assistance which <Col N="1585" /> the local rates receive from the Central Exchequer.  Out of the General Taxation Fund other assistance is also provided, and the chief assistance is providing that the salaries of all officers of local bodies are partly paid, and if that is so, according to the arguments we have heard here, a portion of the pensions of all local officers should be paid out of the Central Taxation Fund.  The fact that the Ministry of Education has a certain disciplinary control does not alter the case.  The Ministry for Local Government has also a certain disciplinary control.</P>

      <P>I gave notice to-day that I would raise this evening the question of the administration of the Army Pensions Act, with special reference to the desirability of setting up <Col N="1587" /> some appeal board, some independent medical referee, to whom appeals could be made from the decisions of medical boards.  I do not think it is doubted or denied in any quarter that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction with the administration of this Army Pensions Act of 1923, which was passed by the last Dáil.  I would like to make it clear that I am referring to the Act of 1923 dealing with wound pensions, and not to the Act that we passed three months ago dealing with pensions for men with pre-Truce and National Army service. We have all received complaints in regard to this matter.  I should not be surprised if even our junior member has received certain complaints in the course of his election campaign.  I am not going to bring forward a great multitude of cases.  I prefer bringing forward one good verified case rather than bring forward a good many insufficiently verified cases.  Some time ago a man wrote to me who had a certain claim upon me because, in another country, he had served under my command. He was in receipt of a pension which he considered inadequate.  He was due for his final Board in October. Before going up I had him examined by a very eminent surgeon, a past President of the Royal College of Surgeons. The only reason that I do not quote his name is because he refused to let me pay him a fee for the examination, and he insisted on doing it for nothing. Here is his certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have examined John Donnelly, who was wounded while in the National Army, on December 6th, 1922. Donnelly is at present in a crippled condition, and there is no difficulty in estimating the severity of his wounds. It appears that he was escorting mails from Fermoy to Cork, when the car in which he was driving was ambushed. A bullet struck him in the upper and front portion of the right thigh, shattering the bone.  Immediately following the attack the car gave a swerve, and after Donnelly was wounded he was hurled from the car, breaking his right wrist.  He lay on the ground from about 12.30 until 4, when he was picked up and brought to the Mercy Hospital, Cork.  He was unconscious at <Col N="1588" /> this time, and has no recollection of the few days following.  He remained in hospital in Cork until March 6th, 1923, a period of about three months. He was then transferred to St. Bricin's Hospital, in which institution he remained for a year, with an interval of two months at the Convalescent Home. Marlborough Hall.  He was discharged from the Army in March last.  On May 7th he was readmitted to St. Bricin's where he remained a patient until August 26th of the present year. In addition to his wounds, Donnelly has been operated on several times in an endeavour to palliate his condition. His right leg is three inches shorter than his left, the knee is quite stiff and the muscles hopelessly wasted.  The fractured bone above his wrist joint is not in good position.  The lower fragment is rotated, so that it is impossible for Donnelly to supinate his arm.  There is a deviation of the hand towards the side of the thumb, and the lower end of the ulna projects to a corresponding amount.  With the right leg in the condition I have described, and the right arm practically disabled, there is. I fear, no hope of Donnelly obtaining employment or being efficient in any branch of labouring work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked specially for a dispassionate opinion that I could stand over.  I do not think anybody can dispute that this man suffered very seriously.  He spent practically 18 months in hospital, had been operated on several times, and is not, according to expert evidence, capable of taking up any branch of labouring work.  He took that opinion and laid it before his medical board.  The medical board found he had a 50 per cent. disability, and that he was entitled to a pension of 21/- per week.  It is almost impossible for the man, even though, fortunately, he is single, to live on 21/- a week in Dublin; yet, that is all that this board gave him.  Naturally, he has a sense of grievance.  I suggest that sense of grievance would be lessened if, in the Amending Bill that is to be brought in, men of that sort would be given a chance of appealing to an independent referee not in the service of the Government.  I believe independent doctors have been associated with those medical boards recently. <Col N="1589" /> That is not generally known, and if it is not it ought to be more widely known.  That in itself would not satisfy a man suffering, as this man does suffer, from a certain grievance. He is unfit to earn anything, and he is only entitled to a 50 per cent. disability pension.  If the State were in a position to offer him, and all those disabled men, special employment, it would be another matter.  I do not know whether this man would be fit to do clerical work.  I believe he did act as an orderly room clerk in the National Army for a time.  I do not know whether there are any vacancies for clerks who have been in the service of the country.  In Italy all the attendants in museums, picture galleries, and places of that kind are men who were maimed in the service of their country.  Something should be done for those men who are disabled in our country, either in the direction of finding them State employment suited to their disabilities, or in the direction of giving them more sympathetic treatment under the Pensions Act.  I have to anticipate what the Minister will say in reply to me.  He may lay the blame, not on the boards, but on the Act.  He would be justified in doing so.  The Schedule of the Act has been drawn so closely that it would be almost impossible for injustice not to arise.  I am taking this opportunity to draw attention to this matter while there is an Amending Act on the stocks which the Minister for Justice told us on Friday was going to be introduced within ten days or so.  We gather from the Minister for Defence that the matter was not yet fully considered, and that he was not going to commit himself. While that Act is still in a nebulous form, I want to put the claim as strongly forward as I can that the Schedule should not be so rigid, that there should be an appeal to an independent referee and also that any alteration or reform should be retrospective.</P>
    <P>It is not probable that we shall have large numbers of men injured within the next two years&mdash;I hope to Heaven not.  We want to provide for the men who have been injured while saving the State two years ago.  I am sorry to bring this matter before the new Minister for Defence at such an early stage <Col N="1590" /> of his Ministerial career, but the matter is urgent.  While realising that he has had the courage to take up a task full of difficulties and, I am afraid, loaded with debts, I nevertheless congratulate myself upon having a fresh mind to appeal to, a mind that will view the problem from a new angle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE:</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputy Cooper's suggestion.  I will satisfy myself also with giving only one case.  I am not speaking in the interests of any particular man, though I know many persons who have grievances at the present moment and who have reason to complain about the treatment meted out to them by the pensions authorities. The case I have in mind is one that occurred about two years ago. Some two or three men of the National Army got into a street brawl, and one of them was shot dead.  The verdict at the inquest was that the man was shot dead by some person or persons unknown, enemies of the State.  That man left a widow and children.  He was wearing the uniform of the National Army, was shot dead in the streets of Dublin, and we must assume he was shot dead by enemies of the State; otherwise, actual warfare. The Pensions Authorities intimated to the widow that she was not entitled to any pension whatsoever, because her husband met his death as the result of a street brawl.  The shooting took place 18 months ago in Capel Street. There was a big report in the newspapers about these men having a game of rings in some licensed house in the vicinity of the North Wall and that they were followed on the way home. I tried to bring the case before the Pensions Authorities on more than one occasion, but because of the strictness of the Act referred to by Deputy Cooper, they told the poor widow that she was entitled to nothing.  The latest application from this poor woman is one for poor law relief.  I hope the new Minister will review that case.  I am not exaggerating the circumstances.  The newspapers contained particulars of the case, and I sent cuttings to the Defence Department.  On review I trust something will be done for the widow and children of this man who served his country well.  Do not leave her in <Col N="1591" /> the position that she will have to apply for relief.  Her husband, let it be remembered, wore the uniform of the National Army.  It was because of that, appearently, the man was attacked in the street in troubled times.  I will take another opportunity of putting the full facts before the Minister, and I trust he will have the case reconsidered with a view to assisting the widow and children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. MURPHY:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also interested in this question from perhaps a slightly different angle from that mentioned by Deputy Cooper.  I have not in my mind any particular grievances against the medical board, but I would like to draw the Minister's attention to another matter in connection with the administration of the Army Pensions Act.  I have pretty reliable information, from cases that have come under my own notice, that the reports made on claims of this kind in connection with the means of claimants are very variable. I have one case in mind, the case of a man who lives in my constituency in my own town, a man who has been associated with the National movement for 30 or 40 years.  When I was a child, and when many people older than I, were children, he was connected with the movement that eventually led up to the Treaty.  This man has been an invalid for a number of years.  His son was killed in the Kilmichael ambush in 1920, and as a result of that man's activities, and as a result of the time he has given and the sacrifices he has made for the movement, his business as a working cooper in that town has been absolutely ruined, and he is to-day in fact in practically a penniless state, except for contributions that are made to him by one member of his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that a report was made in that case that he was not at all dependent on his son who was killed.  I am fully satisfied that the report was wrong from beginning to end.  On the strength of that report the case was turned down.  The facts in connection with the report in that case apply to a number of other cases, I think that the Minister ought to satisfy himself that the information he <Col N="1592" /> gets in connection with claims of this kind from the Gárda Síochána, and, I think, from military sources too, is correct, and that until the Minister is perfectly satisfied that the claim is not reasonable, it ought not to be turned down.  I think that the facilities for reviewing claims ought to be extended, and that more intelligent consideration should be given to cases of that kind. I have also in mind very deserving cases of people who are poor and where very small awards are made, and I join with other Deputies in appealing to the Minister to look into cases of that kind in a more sympathetic way in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. P. Hughes) Peter Hughes">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. P. Hughes):</NameTxt>
      <P>The last two Deputies who have spoken have mentioned cases that do not come within the terms of the notice that Deputy Bryan Cooper has handed in.  My position in the matter is that I have to administer the law as I find it, and I am going to do that as sympathetically as the law will allow.  Certain representations were made to my predecessor in matters of this kind, and he was good enough to have independent medical references appointed upon the Board.  What happens, as my information goes, is this, that when a man is sent down from the Army Board to this Wound Pensions Board he is examined, and on that Board for the past three months there are four of the foremost surgeons in Dublin, whose names I propose to give to the House, and the Board never sits without one of these gentlemen acting on it.  Their names are as follows:&mdash;Mr. Maunsell, President of the Royal College of Surgeons; Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Barniville, and Mr. Keegan.  The Board never sits without one or other of these, and these are absolutely independent men as far as that Board is concerned.  Their functions are to see that justice is done between the person who is appealing and the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say that people have not had sympathetic consideration from this Board, but I can go further and say that any of these surgeons have the option of bringing the actual person before him and examining <Col N="1593" /> him personally, and that was done no later than yesterday; an applicant has been brought up and examined personally by the surgeon, and if anybody will say that any of the gentlemen I have mentioned are not independent surgeons in the City of Dublin, I think he would be going a little too far.  The medical report is forwarded from the Director of Medical Services in all cases as far as these wound pensions are concerned, and as far as I can know from the short time that I have been in this office and from the information I can get, every case is considered on its merits, and considered in the most sympathetic fashion so that <Col N="1594" /> I do not think that, with the exception, perhaps, of that which Deputy Cooper has made, the cases mentioned come within the terms of the question raised by the Deputy.  If the Deputy wants me to make any announcement that would anticipate legislation that may be coming forward, I cannot give him any satisfaction on that point.  All I can say on the matter is that if any genuine case is brought to my notice, I will have it examined and I will do my best to see that justice is done according to the law, as it stands at present.</P>
