      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether two patrol boats are at present in a dockyard in Dublin undergoing repair; whether competitive estimates were obtained for the docking and repairs, before the work was put in hands, and whether he will also state the outlay to date and the probable outlay that will be required.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Repairs to two patrol boats found to be necessary as a result of Lloyd's survey have just been completed. Estimates were first obtained for the docking and the other work, but I regret that the principle of competition was not duly observed in the matter.  The outlay will be approximately £900.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know whether or not that on this job certain ex-British soldiers under the British Army scheme of technical education are being employed at a wage <Col N="1890" /> probably of not more than 10s. a week?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be no adequate reason why competitive tenders were not obtained.  Estimates were obtained from one firm at Ringsend, and from Haulbowline.  Estimates for docking were given by a firm at £36 for two boats.  At Haulbowline the estimate was £50, and 11s. per week for keeping the dock dry.  The estimates for repairs given by the firm in question was £793 10s for one boat, and £115 10s. for another boat.  In the case of Haulbowline no total estimate was given.  It was stated that the work would be charged for at cost price.</P>

      <P>I find that there is no good case for the opening of a Sub-Post Office at Castlejordan, which is distant only one and a half miles from an existing office.  The estimated amount of Money Order business likely to arise would not be nearly sufficient to justify the extension of the Money Order business to Castlejordan, while the capital cost and annual charges which <Col N="1893" /> the establishment of a Telephone Call Office would involve are out of all proportion to the estimated receipts.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to ask the permission of the House at this stage to make a statement on a matter of public importance.</P>
      <P>On Thursday last, the 6th instant, at 10 p.m., there was handed to me a document signed by Major-General Liam Tobin and Colonel Charles Dalton, which I propose to read to the House.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Dublin, 6th March, 1924.</P>
      <P>To President Liam Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>Sir,&mdash;</P>
      <P>On behalf of the I.R.A. Organisation we have been instructed to present the following Ultimatum to the Government of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>Briefly, our position is this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The I.R.A. only accepted the <Col N="1895" /> Treaty as a means of achieving its objects, namely, to secure and maintain a Republican form of Government in this country.</P>
    <P>After many months of discussion with your Government it is our considered opinion that your Government has not those objects in view, and that their policy is not reconcilable with the Irish people's acceptance of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, our interpretation of the Treaty was that expressed by the late Commander-in-Chief, General Michael Collins, when he stated: &ldquo;I have taken an oath of allegiance to the Irish Republic and that oath I will keep, Treaty or no Treaty.&rdquo;  We claim Michael Collins as our leader, and again remind you that even after the Treaty was signed, that drastic action was taken against enemies of the unity and complete independence of our country.  Both in oath and honour bound, it is our duty to continue his policy, and therefore present this Ultimatum to which we require a reply by 12 noon, 10th March, 1924.</P>
    <P>We demand a conference with representatives of your Government to discuss our interpretation of the Treaty on the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The removal of the Army Council.</P>
    <P>(b)  The immediate suspension of Army demobilisation and re-organisation.</P>
    <P>In the event of your Government rejecting these proposals we will take such action that will make clear to the Irish people that we are not renegades or traitors to the ideals that induced them to accept the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Our Organisation fully realises the seriousness of the action that we may be compelled to take, but we can no longer be party to the treachery that threatens to destroy the aspirations of the Nation.</P>
    <P>LIAM TOBIN, Major-General, President of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>C.F. DALTON, Col., Secretary to Executive Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> Having heard the text of the document Deputies will have no difficulty in agreeing that it constitutes a challenge which no Government could ignore without violating the trust conferred on it.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss any political point connected with the document. I consider that in the circumstances, such a discussion would be indefensible, and I may say that this Government has never discussed questions of politics with Army Officers.</P>
    <P>The necessary administrative and disciplinary steps will be taken to deal with this conspiracy.  Orders have been issued for the arrest of the signatories to the document; the personnel of the Headquarters Staff has been strengthened by the appointment of General Eoin O'Duffy to be General Officer Commanding the Defence Forces.  Measures have already been taken throughout the country to deal with any situation which may arise, and nothing will be left undone to secure that the discipline of the Army will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Government relies fully on the Army as well as on the whole body of citizens to support it in whatever action may be necessary to maintain the democratic authority of the people.  The attempt, such as it is, is not against a particular Government; it is a challenge to the democratic foundations of the State, to the very basis of Parliamentary representation and of responsible Government.  As such, it is the concern of every Deputy, of every party and of every citizen.</P>

But I want it definitely understood that my resignation is not as a result of the action taken on receipt of this document.  With the <Col N="1897" /> document I am not in agreement.  As a member of the Executive Council, which is the Government of the country, I could not possibly be in agreement with it.  But I have my own views regarding the document, and I have agreed with the President, or, at least, he has agreed, to name a date which I hope will be to-morrow, on which we can discuss this whole question. I would ask the Press, if it is possible, to refrain from comment on that document, and I ask the people of the country to refrain from forming opinions on the document until I have given the facts to the Dáil, and until I have given the facts to the people of the country leading up to this.

      <P>I feel, taken in this way, that this document, or, at least, the statement by the President of which I have a copy, will not satisfy the requirements of the case, and will not satisfy the public in its demand for more information than is contained therein.  I am sorry the President has contented himself with simply reiterating what I believe every Deputy of the Dáil is ready to affirm and re-affirm&mdash; that is, that we cannot in the slightest degree accept the proposition that any member or members, high or low, of the armed forces of the State shall be allowed to dictate or attempt to influence as soldiers the political policy of the country.  There are ample means at the hand of every man, ex-officer or, shall I say, ex-soldier, to influence public policy.  Once a man has entered again into the ranks of private citizenship he is entitled to use every method provided for under the Constitution to bring his point of view to bear upon the public mind.  While there may be a majority, and a vast majority, of people who would agree with the ideals suggested as being held by some of these men, the way to arrive at, and achieve that purpose, is by other means entirely than the means outlined in the letter which was transmitted to the President.  The Dáil must <Col N="1898" /> insist on every possible occasion that the Army is to be subordinate, and I am sorry that we shall be left at least for another 24 hours before we are informed as to the real matter that is hinted at and touched upon in this statement of the President.</P>
      <P>I say I am sorry that we have not got further information, and I am afraid the lack of it will rather damage the cause of constitutional Government, but we shall be content, though I am very doubtful whether it would be possible in the circumstances, to give adequate consideration to the ordinary business of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that this is such an urgent matter that it is questionable if it ought to be left over until to-morrow.  Coming up here from the country and not knowing exactly what the position is, we are hearing all sorts of rumours,; it seems to me that there ought to be a contradiction of these rumours or they ought to be affirmed.  It looks to me that this matter ought to be taken up by the Dáil sometime this evening.  I do not wish to press that point of view, but I am expressing the feelings of the people in the country when I say that every possible light should be thrown on this matter at once.  Between all the parties in the country and because of the action of the military forces, the people in the country have suffered a terrific lot during the last three or four years.  The ordinary citizens are wondering where they stand to-day between the armed forces, and want to know from the Executive Council and from the administration what the real position is.  We also want to hear from the other side what the position is as <Col N="1899" /> regards these officers in the Army and ex-officers.  What do they really want, or what is the cause of their dissatisfaction? What do they want to do, or what is it they want to do with the country?</P>

The longer this matter is left in a state of mystery the wilder the rumours will be that will get about, and the more disquiet will be caused in the public mind, and great harm will be done to the State.  The only reason that I can see for a postponement is that Deputy McGrath wishes for more time to prepare his statements, and one would not desire to do anything unfair to him, because he ought to have every opportunity of making his case.  Unless that is the case, I do urge the President to allow the discussion to go on to-day.  I believe that serious public harm will be done if it is postponed.</P>

      <P>The position in the country to-day is as has been stated in the official reports that have been given to the Press, with the exception of the incidents that have taken place in Roscommon, <Col N="1900" /> Gormanstown, Baldonnel and Templemore.  In Gormanstown, Roscommon and Baldonnel certain officers have absconded, taking with them small quantities of stores.  Last night and yesterday evening an incident occurred in Cashel where an officer left his post and took away eight rifles, the men, however, standing firm.  An incident occurred in Gorey, where an officer attempted to take away some rifles belonging to the garrison there.  His men interfered with him, and secured the property connected with the post there. The officer and some of his sergeants absconded.</P>
      <P>A small number of resignations have taken place throughout the country, particularly here in Dublin&mdash;approximately, about 20.  There is a certain atmosphere of threat, that a large number of officers throughout the Army are preparing to resign if the threat contained in the letter to the Government is not carried out; that they are prepared to set themselves up in arms in defiance against the Government is another threat.  There is only one part of the country in which I am not quite convinced as to the absolute control of military forces loyal to the Government. There is only one part of the country in which there are possibly any ramifications of any danger, and that is in the County Cork.  The Second in Command in Cork, who has some connection with this conspiracy, has resigned. I may possibly be in a position before the Dáil adjourns this evening to give a detailed statement on the position, but beyond what has been reported up to the present, there have been no incidents of irregularity, and I am absolutely certain of our control of the forces over the whole country with the possibility&mdash;and it is only a possibility, because this matter has been a secret matter&mdash;that there may be some defections, whether from the point of view of resignations or from the point of view of seizing some military posts that are in the Cork area.</P>

I think at a critical stage such as this is, the most critical with which we have been faced since we came here, that if necessary we could sit up all night or wait until the President and his Government on the one hand and Deputy McGrath on the other are prepared to come here to the Dáil and give us such a statement as will enable Deputies to take part in a proper way in a discussion of this very serious matter.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Committee now to vote the balance of this Supplementary Estimate.  The Estimate is quite simple.  The nett amount asked for is £194,370, and I should explain that this amount with a little more has already been granted by the Dáil.  This supplementary estimate now is merely a book-keeping matter, and is due to the fact that certain Acts amalgamated the Congested Districts Board with the Land Commission, and have placed the cost of the services of the Congested Districts Board on the Land Commission estimates.  The gross estimate was £279,965, made up as follows:&mdash; £195,268 is for the former Congested Districts Board service, and is in respect of the period from August up to date, or rather up to the 31st March, August being the date on which the Land Commission Act passed, and on which the Congested Districts Board was amalgamated with the Land Commission. £81,167 consists of moneys that used to be paid on the Ireland Development Grant Vote.  That is now also under Section 16 of the Land Act of 1923, transferred to the Land Commission Vote, and £3,530 is the supplementary estimate required by the Land Commission in view of the additional work.  There is, however, a saving on several sub-heads of the Land Commission Vote of £40,000, so that in the result I am not asking now for more than was already granted by the Dáil for the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board.  In fact, the nett result will be a saving on both of £66,547.  As I explained, £81,867 is the amount formally voted on the Ireland Development Grant Vote.  There would be a saving from the Congested Districts Board Grant of £179,750, that is, a total saving of £260,917.  As against that, I am asking for a supplementary estimate of £194,370, leaving a nett saving of £66,547.  That, as I say, is really a book-keeping estimate, and is for the purpose of placing the Congested Districts Board on the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a very lucid explanation, but he has not explained the estimate which is upon the paper.  He did not explain the total vote or estimate of the Congested Districts Board for 1923-24, nor did he explain why these details, salaries, wages, and allowances did not appear in the normal annual estimate. The point I want to make now is that in the past the Congested Districts Board was a very much cheaper service all round per head than the Land Commission.  This invaluable return <Col N="1905" /> of the Minister for Finance of the staffs in Government Departments shows that in 1914 the Land Commission cost £211 for each man serving, while the Congested Districts Board only cost £101 per head&mdash;less than half.  In 1922 the Land Commission cost £374 per head, but the Congested Districts Board only cost £200&mdash;again nearly half.  Now, I hope the result of amalgamating the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission is not going to lead to a general increase in the Vote.  The present figure shows that they are approximately betwixt and between the figures of the Land Commission and the old Congested Districts Board&mdash;that is, £278.  I hope that in dealing with the salaries of these transferred officials the Minister will not elevate the officials of the Congested Districts Board to the level of those of the Land Commission scale, but that he will keep them on a lower basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say, the Congested Districts Board is merged in the Land Commission.  I want to draw attention to the fact that some time ago the practical reclamation work which was done by the Congested Districts Board over a large area in the West was dropped, in a great many places, and I would like to point out to the Minister that there is a very great necessity indeed to get ahead with this work as soon as it is possible to do so.  Owing to the partial failure of the potato crop over a great area of the West, great hardship exists there, and if it were possible to re-start this work which was done by the Congested Districts Board in the past, it would be a great benefit to the people concerned.  Of course, it would be doing work in the way of the reclamation of land and of road-making and all that kind of thing, which is quite necessary to be done, and it would prove of great benefit to the lands <Col N="1906" /> affected.  I trust that the Minister will look into this matter at once, and that as soon as possible he will get this work going again.  There is another matter which, I take it, arises on this Vote. and it is in connection with the putting into operation of the provisions of the Land Act of 1923.  During the past two or three years there was a great agitation in many districts, especially in the West, regarding land that should have been bought up and divided.  The people were told to wait patiently for the Land Act, and they waited patiently, comparatively speaking, for the Land Act, but the provisions of the Land Act are not being put into operation as far as we can see, in any case.  At least, it seems that provision is working very slightly, and the consequent result is that people are becoming more and more impatient, and more and more anxious as to when these lands will be divided up.  This feeling is always most evident in the spring-time, as the Minister himself knows.  It would ease the minds, considerably, of these poor people who have been looking forward anxiously to a division of these lands if the Minister were in a position to make a statement as to his immediate intentions.  Another thing is happening, and it is that people are coming in and buying up land, that is private people coming in and buying up some of these untenanted tracts of land over the heads of the uneconomic holders in the district who are expected to get them. This is causing very great anxiety also amongst these small uneconomic holders. It would ease the situation considerably if the Minister was in a position to make a statement as to the Government's intentions on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate was adjourned on the last occasion chiefly to the fact that the Minister was absent owing to illness, and it was thought desirable that a vote should not be taken until the Minister was in a position to come to the Dáil, and as I understood then, to make some general statement with regard to the operations of the Land Act.  The Minister himself must be aware, as no doubt every Deputy is, from the communications he receives in connection with <Col N="1907" /> the operation of the Act, that there is a good deal of suspicion and a certain amount of panic in the country with regard to what is being done, or what has been done.  I understand&mdash;perhaps I am wrong in saying it&mdash;that the progress has been much greater than the Minister anticipated when he made his last statement to the Dáil.  However, I think it is due to the Dáil, before it votes away a large sum of money, that we ought to hear from the Minister a full statement in connection with the operation of the Act.  Another matter I want to draw attention to is the question of the position of officials of the old Congested Districts Board, now under the Land Commission.  I understood from the Minister for Finance on the last occasion that it was not the fault of his department.  The Minister for Finance, if I understood him rightly, said that it was due more to the Minister for Agriculture not being satisfied or not having come to some decision with regard to the personnel, or with regard to those who were to receive the benefit of whatever recommendations were agreed upon.  I would like the Minister for Agriculture to give the Dáil some information as to what is the position on that particular matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to ask the Minister for Agriculture to make a statement on certain matters in regard to the Land Act of 1923.  As far as my knowledge of the Act and of its working is concerned, I am of opinion that in general it is giving satisfaction, that it will perform a very useful service, and that it will do what was promised, that is the eventual wiping out of landlordism in Ireland.  But there are some points in connection with the Act that are not giving satisfaction.  I would refer the Minister particularly to the matter of compounded arrears of rent.  At the time the Bill was going through the Dáil I understand Deputies on the Farmers' Benches laid emphasis on the matter of compounded arrears, and pointed out to the Minister that he would find it an extremely difficult matter to collect the amount of <Col N="1908" /> arrears.  I find in going up and down the country that there is a great grievance in this regard, and I think the Minister will find that it will be well-nigh impossible for the Land Commission to collect in cash the balance of the arrears.  The reason for this should be obvious to him.  He knows quite well the condition of agriculture in Ireland at present.  He has frequently stated that he is aware of these conditions, and a great number of the farmers are not in a position to pay this balance of compound arrears of rent. As the Act stands the Appointed Day cannot be fixed, or the land cannot be vested in these tenants, till the balance of the compounded arrears is paid.  I understand by far the greater number of tenants have paid one year's arrears. That means in some cases there are two years' arrears still due, of which they are liable for one and a half years' arrears in cash, and simultaneously with this they are liable for their usual payment in lieu of rent.  In the conditions which exist, and taking into account the time through which agriculture has passed, I can assure the Minister that it will be a physical or a financial impossibility for the greater number of these tenants to pay the balance of the compounded arrears, and, therefore, he will find that the Appointed Day will have to be pushed back to an unreasonable date.  I would suggest to him that there might be some method of getting over this, and that by the introduction of a simple amending Bill he might, by means of adding to the purchase money the amount of the arrears, make it more acceptable to the tenants, and therefore complete the sales in a shorter time.  Of course, on behalf of the tenants, I would be still better pleased if he could see his way to wipe out the balance of the arrears, but considering that the question of the arrears is already involved in the Act, and that certain obligations have been incurred, I do not suppose it is reasonable to ask him to do so.  But I do think it is reasonable to ask him to add the balance of the compounded arrears to the capital sum, and by increasing the annuity by a small amount make it possible to complete the sale of the land within a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> There is another matter to which I would like to call the Minister's attention, and which, I am aware, has frequently been called to his attention in the past two or three months.  That is the decision of certain tenants, or certain holders of land who hold on long leases or on fee farm grants.  I believe that there is a great deal of displeasure as to the working of the Act in this regard, and that a great many of these tenants who, to all intents and purposes, are ordinary agricultural tenants, have been excluded from the provisions of the Act, have been obliged to pay the full arrears of rent, and cannot purchase their land in the ordinary course.  I am aware that a great many of these occupiers of land are nothing more than ordinary agricultural tenants, and they should not be segregated or put into a different class from those who hold as judicial and non-judicial tenants.  I think it would be quite possible in an amending Act to introduce a clause which would define the holders of land under such a title so as to place them in a position whereby they can purchase their land under the ordinary provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>In regard to the division of land and the giving of land to uneconomic holders and evicted tenants, a good deal or dissatisfaction is expressed in regard to certain things that are happening. It is well known that there is an organisation, that is, the political organisation of the present Government, the members of which are making use of this part of the Land Act to increase the membership of that organisation.  I have had many tenants coming to me to say that they have been approached and told that if they came forward and joined the Cumann na nGaedheal they would have first claim on any land to be divided.  I say that that is very unfair to the other political parties and particularly to the Farmers' Party.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one question, and that is, if he would, in his answers to the questions that have already been put, and in dealing with this Vote, explain exactly what amount of money was taken over from the Congested Districts Board to the United Land Commission, the old Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board, and the use that is being made of that money; whether it is still being allocated to these districts that sometime were under the administration of the Congested Districts Board, or whether the moneys are being pooled and equitably distributable throughout the entire territory of the country under the administration of the new Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>The MINISTER for AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer Deputy Figgis's question first.  The funds, as apart from grants, of the Congested Districts Board have been paid to the Land Commission to be dealt with by the Land Commission under the authority and in accordance with regulations to be made by the Ministry of Finance, as set out, I believe, in Section 9 of the Land Commission Act, 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. FIGGIS Mr. FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was rather whether in those regulations any effort would be made to keep these funds for districts that used to be under the old Congested Districts Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the question is one of getting adequate funds for the purposes of the Acts, and for these districts.  I am not going to fight with the Ministry of Finance.  I am not going to ask them to put on deposit receipt the funds of the Congested Districts Board, and earmark them for me so long as I get all the funds I want.  I do not think that <Col N="1911" /> would be business.  Deputy Cooper asks why this Vote was not taken last March, and why we inserted merely the total Vote in the Land Commission Estimates.  The Bill amalgamating the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission was introduced only last August, and I had not in my mind a scheme formulated in detail.  I was not in a position at that date, and I obviously would not have been in a position, to include in the Estimates a vote for the new Congested Districts Board until I had the scheme thought out in all its details.  I was not in that position last March, and it was not actually until August that the Land Commission Act, which amalgamated the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board, was introduced. With regard to the salaries, I feel inclined to leave the matter between Deputy Cooper and Deputy Davin. They cancel out on that question.  However, the answer to the question which Deputy Cooper asked is as follows:&mdash; A considerable percentage of the clerks of the Congested Districts Board were clerks who passed a special examination, not quite the Civil Service Examination, and they did not get the same salary.  That is all it comes to, but as to the effect of amalgamating the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board I have no doubt that, without prejudicing the question as to the amount of money that should be spent on the reclamation and division of land, and all that, that the administration of the joint body will be far less expensive than the administration separately had been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Connell that it is essential to keep the reclamation work of the Congested Districts Board going on.  The Board did give a lot of relief in congested districts by constantly providing work, and I agree that it is not in times like this we should start to cut away that source of employment.  The Ministry of Finance have agreed that an additional grant of £19,000&mdash;for, I would point out, only this month, as the financial year ends this month&mdash;shall be made available to the Land Commission immediately the Land Commission is in a position to start the work.  They are actually <Col N="1912" /> starting work in Connemara, Mayo and Donegal, where they propose to spend this money.  We can argue the question of further moneys on next year's Estimates, which will be introduced immediately.  I daresay I have permission to deal with some questions not perhaps quite relevant to the Estimates, that have been raised and discussed with regard to the operation of the Land Act.  Deputies should remember that the Act was passed last August and was, so to speak, handed to the Land Commission to administer in September.  The Land Commission were under the necessity of setting up what amounted to a land agent's office for every tenant left unpurchased in Ireland.  They had to settle the exact rent of at least 100,000 tenants and they had to do so by correspondence. Anybody who knows anything about landlords and tenants will have some idea of the magnitude of that task.  The procedure they adopted was quite simple.  They wrote to every landlord in Ireland left unpurchased and they said, &ldquo;Return a list of all your tenants and their rents, and say whether they are judicial or non-judicial, and if judicial say whether they are first, second or third.&rdquo;  The landlords, of course, did what the tenants would do in the same circumstances. They wrote in, with a few honourable exceptions, and they returned the old rents.  I assume most Deputies are aware that at least 50 per cent. of the tenants in Ireland hold their tenancies under rents which do not appear exactly on the face of the receipts.  The commonest form of receipt would be &ldquo;Received from So-and-so the sum of £20,&rdquo; and then in the corner of the receipt, &ldquo;Abatement 5s.,&rdquo; or £5, or whatever it might be.  Deputies will remember that point was raised when the Land Act was going through, and the decision which was come to and embodied in the Act that where an abatement amounted to an agreement for a new rent that a 25 per cent. reduction would be made not from the old rent, but from the abated rent.  Needless to say, all the landlords returned practically the full rents.  We expected that would occur. We then sent out a Receiving Order to tenants asking for one year's compounded <Col N="1913" /> arrears of rent, knowing that the tenant would pay the rent or ignore the letter, or write back and say, &ldquo;That is not my real rent at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That happened in at least 40 per cent. of the cases, and at least 40 per cent. of these cases we had to settle in correspondence between the landlord and tenant as to what the real rent was.  In a great many cases it was impossible to tell that without listing a case before the Judicial Commissioner. That work, now practically done, was so vast that the Land Commissioners, and practically every member of the Land Commission Staff, have been working on overtime since the Act passed, and most of the senior officers of the Land Commission have been working up to six or seven o'clock in the evening, but, as I have said, that work is practically now done.  In addition the Land Commission had to deal with five or six million pounds worth of pending sales.  They are being dealt with by the Land Commission far more expeditiously than they were dealt with before the Land Act of 1923 was passed.  That is shown by taking the value of the sales last year and years before and comparing them with this year's.  In addition they had to take over all the estates of the Congested Districts Board.  They had to discuss the relevant questions with the law society, to prepare all the regulations, and get them out.  Practically all that work has been done.  Undoubtedly, personally I am under an obligation to the Land Commission for the expeditious way they have done that work. I could not be better served than I have been by the officers of the Land Commission in this, and I cannot see any Department doing better.  Any Deputy who has an idea of the difficulties of settling the one hundred thousand tenants and their landlords by correspondence unless he is a little more innocent than the heathen Chinee, will realise that it is a tremendous task to accomplish in five months.  The Land Commission are now getting the necessary extra staff and will be enabled to get on with the real work, that is to say, the acquisition and division of land and do it practically three times as quickly as they have been doing it <Col N="1914" /> during the last four months.  Already 100 estates have been listed.  Under the regulations which have been published, two months is the time within which anybody may object to the acquisition of an estate.  We have to wait two months before actually vesting these estates.  We are not buying untenanted land except where voluntarily offered.  The position the Land Commission will adopt is, we propose to deal with tenancies first, first things first.  We have already give 25 per cent. reduction and we think it right to give a 35 per cent. reduction to existing tenants as soon as possible, but we will not be in a position to buy untenanted land on any scale until we have dealt with tenants in so far as to give them their 35 per cent. reduction. Anybody who considers the question for a moment will see that it is right.</P>
    <P>There is no occasion to be going ahead with untenanted land before the hundred thousand tenants have got the 35 per cent. reduction.  We will endeavour to deal first with tenanted lands in order to give them that reduction. It will be six or seven months before we can begin to buy untenanted land on any large scale.  It will then be dealt with on a large scale.  We passed the Land Act of 1923 for the purpose of relieving congestion.  The powers under the other Acts were not adequate for that purpose, because you generally had congestion where you had not land.  We took power to take any land for the relief of congestion.  We will have to make a sort of survey of untenanted land all over the country, and we cannot begin to deal with landless men, or give them land until we are satisfied that we are keeping enough land for the congests, who have the first claim.  We did not pass the Act to perpetuate congestion.  Deputy O'Connell said that in spring a young man's fancy turns to thoughts of land. and he asked me what my intentions were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he is satisfied that my intentions are honourable. Now, with regard to that question, which I answered about fifty thousand times, vendors selling their lands, <Col N="1915" /> tenants and other well-meaning people seem to be under the impression that we should rush about the country and wherever anyone was selling land the Land Commission should go down and buy it.  If a clause were put into the Act, to effect that, nobody could sell land without the permission of the Land Commission.  That would be simply serving notice on any vendor whether he be a farmer, a fee farm grantee, a landlord, or any other representative of any class of the community, saying that the Land Commission might come in and take that land, and that he was not to sell it.  What would be the effect of that?  We all know that the Land Commission price is not the market price.  If such a clause, preventing vendors from selling land, was inserted in any Bill it would mean that land would fall in value either a half or three-quarters, certainly by a very considerable amount straight away, and the difficulty of the ordinary farmer getting advances from the banks would be increased ten-fold.  No one suggested when the Land Bill was going through that we should insert a simple clause preventing anybody from selling his land.  It would have the gravest possible effect.</P>
      <P>I do not understand how anybody who knows anything of the agricultural position would advocate it, especially in view of the fact that there is absolutely no occasion for it.  We have still power to acquire land compulsorily even though it is owned by &ldquo;B&rdquo; and not by &ldquo;A,&rdquo; and it makes no difference to say if we want a tract of land that it was sold and purchased a month ago.  We have such powers and can exercise them if necessary. With regard to fee-farm grants, I think we have all heard that song before.  The first thing I would advise fee-farm grantees to do is to say as little as possible, because we have power to acquire their land compulsorily for the relief of congestion, and if they have the misfortune to live in congested districts their lands vest automatically in the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>And there are some landlords actually congests in the sense mentioned by Deputy Heffernan.  I often ask people what is the difference between a landlord and a tenant?  Is it that one may eat his dinner at 7 o'clock and the other in the middle of the day? In legislation we cannot go into the colour of a man's hair.  We legislate with reference to land tenures.  People cannot have it both ways.  We cannot get up in the Dáil and advocate what are not exactly conservative amendments to Land Bills and then after wards people wake up in a terrible state of agony and realise that they are landlords for the purpose of the Act. I do not care how small a grantee is. If he is a fee-farm grantee his land will vest automatically in the congested districts, but we might give it back to him if he keeps quiet.  I realise that there are a number of fee-farm grantees whom Deputy Heffernan would describe as farmers, but we have met the equities of the case.  We have enabled these fee-farm grantees to go before the Judicial Commissioner and have their rents redeemed, and we are prepared to give them advances for the redemption of rents.  If we enable them to purchase we would be in the extraordinary position that half of the people whom Deputy Heffernan classes as landlords would be purchasing under the Act.  Half of the landlords own lands under fee-farm grants. They have just one grievance, namely, that they do not get the benefits of the arrears clauses.  A number of fee-farm grantees hold land at 5s., 6s., and upwards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I dare say, and when certain landlords went to see the Duke of Leinster and asked for a certain amount of land they preferred to get it in fee-simple, but he preferred to give it in fee farm rent and he gave it to them just for the honour and glory of being a landlord.  Fee farm grantees are making a lot of pother about this matter.  It is open to every single one of them, where we do not want land, to go in and redeem their rents and they will get advances.  That meets all the equities of their case.  I have been asked the question as to why the C.D.B. re-organisation has not gone through already.  The answer is simple.  I have been approached by all sorts and conditions of people for the last two months in connection with the re-organisation scheme of the C.D.B.  What I should have told T.D's and others was that it is wrong for Civil Servants to approach T.D's on matters of that sort.  I told them, however, that I was willing to hear any further representations which the C.D.B. clerks wished to make, before I took the final step of publishing the scheme of re-organisation which they know of.  It may be due to a misunderstanding, but I waited three weeks to hear from them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know that two were sent in, one on Friday and one on Saturday, but in view of this debate I deferred replying to them.  That is the reason.  Before I got those applications, I conveyed word to the C.D.B. clerks through the Secretary of the Land Commission, that I was ready to see them.  Then I got applications to see them following the interviews with T.D's. and other people.  It would have saved me a considerable amount of worry if I got this scheme through and published it.  I propose, after this debate, to see the C.D.B. clerks during the week.  I have got one document from them assuming that the delay was <Col N="1918" /> because I was going into the scheme, and also expressing the hope that something good would come out of it.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>

I deferred seeing them in order to hear what was to be said on this question here.  They do lose something &mdash;very little&mdash;by the delay in reorganisation. Deputies, however, will have to remember that when the C.D.B. clerks enter their new grades, they will get all arrears as from the date of amalgamation, and the only thing they lose by the delay is whatever is lost by getting all their arrears at once, instead of gradually over periods as from July last.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Having possession without lawful authority, of any article of clothing, equipment or accoutrement or any arms or ammunition belonging or issued to any member of the military or police forces of Saorstát Eireann, and putting on or assuming without authority the uniform or any part of the uniform of any branch of the military or police forces of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking up the Police Acts I find in <Col N="1921" /> the Constabulary Act of 1919, Section 8:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If any person not being a member of the Police Forces wears, without permission of the Chief Commissioner, the uniform of the Dublin Metropolitan Police Force or any dress having the appearance of or bearing any of the distinctive marks of such uniform he shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds: Provided that this Section shall not prevent persons from wearing any uniform or dress in the course of a play, music hall or circus performance.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Civic Guard Act, 1923, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If any person, not being a member of the Gárda Síochána, shall have in his possession any article of clothing or equipment belonging to a member of the Gárda Síochána and shall not be able satisfactorily to account for his possession thereof, or shall, without the permission of the Commissioner, put on or wear the uniform of any rank or member or any colourable imitation of such uniform, or shall, for the purpose of doing or procuring to be done any act which such person would not by law be entitled to do or procure to be done by his own authority assume the name, designation, or description of any rank or of any member of the Gárda Síochána, such person shall on summary conviction be liable in addition to any other punishment to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds for every such offence or to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any period not exceeding six months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much for the police forces.  I consider that the fine of £10, which is the statutory penalty at present in connection with the Metropolitan Police, is inadequate in the circumstances.  The Section of the Civic Guard Act would seem to be sufficient.  In the Defence Forces Act, which is at present law, I could find nothing covering this point. Yet, in the existing circumstances of the State, the offence of masquerading as an officer of the police or military forces is a serious offence that the <Col N="1922" /> Government ought to take sufficient powers to deal with and to punish adequately. I put it to Deputies that, having regard to the omission from the Defence Forces Act, and the rather small penalty for assuming the uniform of the D.M.P., that these two paragraphs of the Schedule should be allowed to stand in this temporary Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question, I intend to oppose the Bill on the grounds on which I have opposed it right through, that it is not necessary to introduce a new temporary Bill empowering the authorities and the courts to inflict certain punishments for offences which are offences at any time, and, more particularly, in regard to the kind of punishment that is authorised by the Bill.  I asked the Minister if he had not been able to give consideration, or, having given consideration, if he had not been able to meet the points of criticism in reference to one or two matters which were made during the Committee Stage.  For instance, I think I am right in saying that he promised consideration of the apportionment or the evaluation of the imprisonment in terms of cash as contained in Section 1. It was treated with a little lightness, but really embodies a very considerable principle, inasmuch as the effect of it may be to give the man who has money an opportunity to buy off imprisonment at a cheaper rate than a man who had no money, and the differentiation in the evaluation of imprisonment that is contained in Sub-Section (2) as compared with Sub-Section (3) (a) and (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out before, the additional sentence which may be imposed upon a person convicted by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction may be a fine of fifty pounds.  If the person cannot pay or will not pay that fine within one month he may be imprisoned for a further period, without hard labour, of six months.  If he happens to be a man able to find fifty pounds easily, or whose friends are able to provide him with fifty pounds, then he will buy off the six months' imprisonment.  If he is a poor man and cannot find fifty pounds, then he suffers six months' imprisonment. I take it from that, that the Minister values six months' imprisonment, without hard labour, as <Col N="1923" /> being worth fifty pounds to the man who can find fifty pounds.  But, then, in the next paragraph we have the additional punishment of a fine of one hundred pounds which, if it is not paid, would involve a further sentence of twelve months' penal servitude.  So that in this case again the man that has the hundred pounds or can find the hundred pounds can buy off the twelve months' penal servitude.  If he cannot find one hundred pounds and has no rich friends he is liable to suffer a further imprisonment of twelve months' penal servitude.  Again, I take it that the Minister's mind is that one hundred pounds in this case is equal to twelve months' penal servitude. But the following paragraph says £100 is equal to six months without hard labour, except on the principle, as was suggested on the last occasion, that you get off more easily by taking a quantity.  I cannot understand the method of evaluation.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Davin is not here to follow up the argument that was raised by him regarding the offence of having possession, without lawful authority, of arms, or ammunition, or clothing belonging to or issued to any member of the military forces or police forces.  The Minister has pointed out that there are certain penalties involved in the ordinary law respecting the police, but that there are no penalties involved in the ordinary law respecting military.  Take the case that Deputy Davin instanced, of soldiers to whom arms and accoutrements were issued which had not to be given up on demobilisation.  Are these people to be considered in unlawful possession of arms or accountrements, or is it suggested that it is their business to sell them so as to get rid of them?  If it is a fact, as we have been informed, and I think the information is likely to be correct, that soldiers are not required to account, on demobilisation, for all the arms that have been distributed to them, then we are to take it that they are expected to retain them, or if not to sell or dispose of them somehow?</P>
    <P>It leaves the position of the demobilised soldiers a very difficult, and, perhaps, a very dangerous one.  If he is, so far as army laws and orders are <Col N="1924" /> concerned, entitled to retain possession of arms which have been handed to him, or clothing which has been left with him, and if we are asked to pass special laws making it a penalty that he should retain these arms or accoutrements, I say that we are not doing fairly by the ex-soldier, and certainly not legislating in accordance with the requirements.  It is either that, or the administration of the army is not satisfactory; we are not retaining proper control of the arms which we have voted money for.  As we are not discussing the conduct of the army, we have a right to assume that the army is carrying out its obligations satisfactorily, and that in doing so, it has been justified and authorised by the Executive Council to allow soldiers to retain arms on demobilisation.  I ask, are we entitled to pass special laws making it a penalty that they should retain possession of these arms?  Until we are satisfied that the retaining of arms is made an offence under the army, surely we ought not to be asked to pass special laws which would affect them as civilians, while allowing a law to operate which does not affect them as soldiers.</P>
    <P>The further consideration which makes me object to the passing of this Bill is, of course, the special punishments which are provided in Section 1, which I have already argued against. I have said everything that I think it is necessary to say on that.  I cannot add anything, except that I object to it, not out of consideration in the slightest degree for the prisoner, but because I think it is retrogressive legislation, and will not achieve the end sought for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Johnson, the fines, and the amount in relation to terms of imprisonment, and so on, I think my comment on the last occasion on which the Deputy raised that was, that I was prepared to consider any suggestion.  I have received no suggestion, but I am still prepared to consider any that reaches me before the Bill becomes law.  As to these offences in the Schedule, I said that I could not find in the Defence Forces Act anything dealing with the wearing of military uniform. <Col N="1925" /> The question of arms is a different matter.  When the Firearms Bill becomes law, the position of any civilian carrying arms without a police permit will be covered by that Bill.  The Minister for Defence is not here, but as far as I am aware, soldiers or officers being demobilised are required to give up all weapons which come their way as members of the military forces.  I think it would be idle on my part, and I think the Deputy scarcely expects, that I should resume any argument in connection with the special penalties for special offences that this Bill provides, or go again into the question of whether a changing, a new, and a <Col N="1926" /> special situation does not require special legislation standing out from the ordinary code current in the country.  I think that has been discussed threadbare on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage.  I ask the Dáil to receive this Bill for final consideration.</P>

    <Title>COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. - ENFORCEMENT OF LAW (OCCASIONAL POWERS) BILL, 1924.&mdash;SECOND STAGE.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the First Reading of this Bill I undertook, in response to a request by Deputy Johnson, to endeavour to ascertain what proportion of the outstanding decrees, or what proportion of the amount represented by the outstanding decrees, represented private debts, as distinct from public debts; that is, debts of the State or some other public authority.  Now, I have arrived at an analysis which the Deputy will understand is only an approximation. I should say, however, that the figures are substantially accurate. There are, roughly, 7,000 decrees outstanding, representing £170,000. Of these, 2,000 of the decrees would be for public debts, 746 of them representing rates due, the amount involved being £5,410.  The total amount represented by these 2,000 decrees would be £17,000.  In connection with private <Col N="1927" /> debts, there are 5,100 decrees outstanding, representing approximately £150,000.</P>
      <P>A point worth mentioning, perhaps, is that there is no decree in the hands of any under-sheriff, so far as I can ascertain at the moment, in respect of income tax.  The income tax officials have their own powers, and seem to be content to confine themselves to those powers.  The Deputy also asked me if I would make inquiries as to the number of sales outside the jurisdiction during the period in which the Act of last year was in force.  Out of the thousands of decrees executed, there were not more than 50 such sales in the six months, or less than 2 per county.  In about 20 counties there were no such sales at all.  These are figures for sales outside the bailiwick of the sheriff executing the decrees.  When the Deputy asked for numbers of sales outside the jurisdiction, I was not clear whether he meant the jurisdiction of the individual sheriff making the seizure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>If the former was meant&mdash;that is, outside the area of jurisdiction of the individual sheriff&mdash; I have stated there were 50 sales in six months, or less than two per county. As regards sales outside the Saorstát, I have not the precise figures, but I am safe in saying that ten would be an outside estimate.  I may add that the fact that the power was not availed of to a greater extent is not to be taken as an indication that the power is not required.  The under-sheriffs themselves are emphatic on this point, and they have assured me that people who would not otherwise pay, paid promptly, precisely in order to avoid the actual use of the power in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill somewhat similar to the Bill at present under consideration was introduced last year, and, speaking to that Bill, I said that whatever odium, having its roots in the past, attached to the position of bailiff, he was a useful public functionary and that his ceasing to function was the first sign of a crumbling civilisation.  Apparently, on the strength of this, Deputy <Col N="1928" /> Davin, in the late General Election, did me the honour of writing me up in his election literature as the bailiff's pal. He referred to me in my new rôle of the bailiff's pal.  He quoted the remark I made that this officer was a useful public functionary.  I want to repeat that remark with emphasis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat, with emphasis, that the ceasing of the bailiff to function is the first sign of a crumbling civilisation.  The execution of court decrees is the ultimate act of Government.  It is the vindication of the legal right of the individual citizen as against his neighbour.  We have to vest it with the law, and the machinery of law is the modern substitute for the stone axe.  If law and the machinery of law break down, then we are back to the stone axe or some other suitable instrument by which one man can enforce his right, real or imaginary, against his neighbour.  You have to get used to the idea that the mere negative destructive attitude of regarding courts and public officials of one kind or another, whether they be policemen or under-sheriffs or anything else, is not going to make for ordered progress here and is not going to make for decency of life here.  If in any coming election, whether a general election or a bye-election, Deputy Davin or any other Deputy wishes to make use of these remarks of mine, he is very much at liberty to do so.  The Bill that is introduced now is a temporary measure to be enforced for one year only.  Its object is to secure that better enforcement of court judgments by strengthening the machinery for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain arrears in the hands of some under-sheriffs, particularly in Tirconaill, Kilkenny, Cork, Galway, Tipperary, Kerry and Wexford, where the amounts of outstanding decrees&mdash;that is, the amount of arrears&mdash; is entirely excessive and abnormal, and require very stringent measures for their reduction.  Within the last few months there has been a certain improvement, but nothing very striking, and it is hoped that the enactments of this Bill will mark a definite turning point.  The Bill provides for an increase <Col N="1929" /> in the number of Sheriffs by means of temporary additional appointments in the larger areas, such as Galway and Cork; an increase in the number of men, and an improvement in the quality of bailiffs, by authorising the under-sheriff to take on additional bailiffs to whom the State will pay small salaries in addition to fees; the removal of certain limitations and checks, which the ordinary law places on the operations of the under-sheriff, but the effect of what at present is to make it difficult or impossible for the under-sheriff to do his work; inquiry at the District Courts into the means of judgment debtors who have no seizable chattels, but who are believed to have assets or sources of income which an under-sheriff cannot seize.  I put to Deputies the position of a gentleman living in the Shelbourne Hotel without any furniture and with an income, perhaps, of £1,000 from war loans.  He owes money to his tailor.  The tailor secures the decree, and Deputies can let their minds play on the dilemma of the under-sheriff in whose hands that decree is placed for execution&mdash;that is, dilemma under the existing law.</P>
    <P>The Bill further provides for a speedier inquiry into the merits of claims made by third parties, that is, a debtor's wife, parents, or children, to goods seized on the debtor's premises by the under-sheriff.  It is commonly known that goods which the under-sheriff wishes to seize are claimed by third parties.  Now, these five heads, which I have stated, may be taken as a fair summary of the 29 Sections of the Bill.  A similar Bill was introduced last year, but was limited to six months. It was successful in operation, and what is particularly gratifying is, that the under-sheriffs report that the mere fact that the additional powers were in existence was usually sufficient to induce judgment debtors to pay, without it becoming necessary actually to use these powers against them.  It is one of the strongest arguments for the present Bill that no single instance of abuse or hardship was brought to my notice during the currency of the last Act, in spite of the dismal prophesies of its opponents.  This earlier Act has been copied, almost word for word, in Part 1 of the present Bill, out Part 1 <Col N="1930" /> of the present Bill contains also some new provisions.</P>
    <P>Before examining the Bill Section by Section, it is perhaps advisable to remind Deputies that the powers of the Under-Sheriff, as they existed hitherto, were devised rather to protect helpless and unfortunate debtors against overzealous under-sheriffs than to facilitate the under-sheriff, that is, the existing law grew up in, and was devised to meet the conditions of a country where the law and its officers were powerful and where the solvent but defiant debtor was a rare phenomenon.  He is not a rare phenomenon in this country at present.  Conditions in this country, though improving, are still far removed from ordinary commercial life.  The judgment debtor particularly in the country parts, has learned to imagine that he is stronger and more astute than the under-sheriff; he delays, he threatens resistance, he removes his chattels, he arranges for fraudulent third party claims and up to the present he has done all this with a certain amount of success.  The under-sheriff who has to face this unscrupulous and determined resistance, is hedged round by so many rules and regulations that he frequently feels that the contest is hopeless and that all he need do is to make an appearance of trying to enforce the judgment without really making a struggle, a state of mind quite fatal to the proper conduct of his business.</P>
    <P>To give an idea of the restrictions under which the under-sheriff labours, it will be only necessary to quote the following rules and to imagine their effect as applied to-day to a seizure in districts where even the Gárda Síochána stations are in danger of armed raids and where the debtor's premises are situated perhaps fifteen miles from a town or a railway station and are approachable only by rough mountain roads.  The under-sheriff must effect seizure by daylight.  He must remain in possession three days before selling. He must not take the goods out of the county in order to sell them.  He must advertise the sale as a sheriff's sale. He cannot seize money or notes in execution of County Court decrees; there may be ten times the amount of the <Col N="1931" /> debt, in hard cash, in the house; it cannot be touched.  He cannot go into a house unless he is peaceably admitted; if he is recognised and the door is slammed in his face he is helpless.  He will not be allowed fees for more than two bailiffs however many he may find it necessary in fact to employ.  If the debtor's wife or son claims everything on the premises as against the creditor, it is so difficult, in actual practice, to disprove the claim that generally no attempt is made to disprove it.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that these rules give an unscrupulous debtor at the present time too great an advantage even over an energetic and determined under-sheriff. I would like to state quite definitely that, in my opinion, there is nothing in this Bill which causes an unnecessary hardship to any honest man, and I am fortified in that conviction by the fact, which I have already stated, that during the six months of last year, when the Enforcement of Law Act was in operation, no single case of hardship was brought to my notice.  If Deputies will remember, there were very dismal forecasts here as to what the effects of that Bill would be upon the people through the country.  If I am wrong, and if there was hardship, I would like to hear of it.  If any Deputy can quote any definite concrete case of abuse or hardship occasioned by the operations of the Enforcement of Law Act last year, I want to hear of it, so that we may in this Bill here, which we are considering, guard adequately against any danger of a recurrence.  I want Deputies to take the view that in present circumstances here, and in present conditions here, it is absolutely necessary for our credit, both our internal credit and our international credit, that people should understand that the writ of the Courts is going to run in every square mile of our territory and that there is not going to be any addition to the necessary uncertainties and the necessary delays of the law, no uncertainty whatever as to the decree of the Court, once given, being executed.  The solvent but defiant debtor must be brought to understand that this campaign against the under-sheriff is not going to be in the future, as it has been <Col N="1932" /> in the past, rather a pleasant game with the dice heavily loaded against the public official.</P>
    <P>Going through the Bill, if Deputies will follow the Sections, I would like to comment briefly on each Section.  The effect of Section 1 is to confer on the Minister for Home Affairs the power of appointing under-sheriffs.  I am not aware that there is any objection to this, or any better alternative.  It also gets rid of the old statutory form of declaration which is medieval, unsuitable and unnecessary in present circumstances. In reading Section 2, Deputies should remember that under the existing law the under-sheriff must rely entirely on his regularly-appointed bailiffs.  This Section overrides the present law, and practically amounts to this: that under-sheriffs may engage men as additional bailiffs as and when they find it necessary.  Sub-Section (3) of Section 2 authorises the Government to help the under-sheriff to get bailiffs by paying weekly wages so as to attract a decent, reliable type of man.  In some counties it is almost impossible to secure reliable bailiffs at present, because the only pay is by fee, and the fees are too uncertain to attract anyone except the poorest type.  Sub-Section (4) refers to men employed specially&mdash; that is, not employed by the week or by the month, but simply on the spot for casual work, such as driving cattle to the nearest pound or the nearest railway station.  Sections 3, 4 and 5 are repetitions of sections in the previous Bill, and require no particular comment or explanation.  Section 6 enables an under-sheriff to seize money or securities for money in execution of county court decrees.  It is, under the existing law, within the power of an under-sheriff to seize money in execution of High Court decrees, and the effect of this Section is to extend that power to decrees of the County Court.  Section 7 abolishes the rule compelling the under-sheriff to remain in possession for three days before selling.  Under present conditions it would be difficult, and in some places even dangerous, to enforce this rule.  Now, speaking on the Bill of last year with reference to this three day delay, I said:</P>
    <P>Any delay there was in the past <Col N="1933" /> was a right of the creditor rather than a right of the debtor, or was inserted for the advantage of the creditor rather than for that of the debtor, but it did not in the past work out just in that way.</P>
    <P>In many places the three days' interval simply gave to the debtor and his friends an opportunity for organising to ensure that there would not be many hardy bidders for the goods in question, and generally it proved to be an opportunity for defeating the ends of the law rather than being of any advantage to the creditor.  It is considered now that that interval should be almost abolished and it should be left to the discretion of the under-sheriff to sell at any time that he considers most favourable, and to sell in such a way as to ensure the best price for the seized articles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 8 empowers the under-sheriff to sell outside the county, or, to be more accurate, outside his bailiwick, and to recover the additional cost of doing so. This matter was debated very fully when the corresponding section of the expired Act was before the Dáil, and it was pointed out by me and others that apart from questions of intimidation, a better market value could frequently be found outside the bailiwick.  I would like to give some illustrations of that. Furniture, for instance, seized in Howth could be best sold in a city of Dublin auction room, which is in a different administrative county and a different bailiwick, and the natural market place for North County Dublin cattle is the cattle market in the City of Dublin. Probably the City of Derry would be the best market for many places in Co. Tirconaill.  The town of Athlone is the natural market town for many districts not in the same county.  In general, and quite apart from the local boycott, county borders have no necessary connection with natural markets and this particular provision would be a useful one even in the most normal times.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the validity of purchase from an under-sheriff.  The object of this Section is to protect the buyer of seized goods.  Without some such assurance purchasers would run undue risks.  If you propose to relieve <Col N="1934" /> the under-sheriff from his present obligations of the local auction, the three days' notice, and the sale, properly branded as an under-sheriff's sale, then you must insert some such provision as is contained in this Section.  You must give the purchaser of the seized articles a title valid against all the warrants in the world.  If you say to an under-sheriff: &ldquo;You may seize A.B.'s cattle or stock, train them to Dublin, and sell them there in open market, without any indication that your sale is a sheriff's sale,&rdquo; then you must protect the purchaser by giving him an absolute title to the goods he buys.  It is the only alternative to the present course of the local sale, the three days' notice, and the notice to everyone that it is a sheriff's sale.  Section 10 is a necessary section, and is really consequential.  If you give an under-sheriff the power of sending goods to a distance for sale, then you must insert a provision to ensure that the interruption of his actual physical custody of the goods will not break the seizure, so to speak.  The Section is inserted by way of caution to cover periods when the seized goods or cattle are not actually in the custody of the under-sheriff&mdash;for instance, cattle sent by train for sale at a distance.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is self-explanatory.  It is designed to put a stop to the simple device of keeping a look-out for the under-sheriff and shutting the door in his face.  The under-sheriff is normally liable to be sued by the creditor if he seizes too little, and by the debtor if he seizes too much, and the result is to embarass him unduly in the performance of his duties.  Section 12, therefore, relieves the under-sheriff from the possibility of action by either the creditor or the debtor&mdash;by the creditor for seizing too little, and by the debtor for seizing too much, provided there is no fraud, malice, or gross negligence.  The presence of one or more of these elements would need to be proved before an action would properly lie.  Section 13 is an important and an entirely new Section.  It may be paraphrased thus: &ldquo;If the under-sheriff seizes goods in the debtor's house, but other members of the family claim these goods, the under-sheriff may ignore such claims if he thinks fit.  If the claim is well founded, <Col N="1935" /> the injured party has a right of recovery against the debtor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a Section that I anticipate will give rise to a certain amount of comment and criticism, and in anticipation of that criticism I would like to state the situation from the official administrative point of view.  The Section is an attempt to put an end to fraudulent claims by the debtor's wife and family. It is an everyday experience of under-sheriffs to have the only valuable piece of furniture, for instance a piano or a side-board, claimed by the wife of the debtor.  Everybody knows that the claim is false, or, even if true, that the creditor has a better moral claim, but under the existing law it simply does not pay the creditor, or the under-sheriff, to contest the wife's claim, and a return of <i>nulla bona</i> is made.  No doubt this is a Section which should not be enacted without full consideration, but it is considered to be necessary under all the circumstances, and I submit the following arguments in its favour. The present system has become notoriously ineffective.  It is calculated to bring the law into contempt and it is an incentive to perjury.  The under-sheriff will not be bound to ignore a third party claim; he has complete discretion and he will ignore the claim only when he feels that the circumstances justify him doing so.  An under-sheriff is usually a lawyer; he has therefore the necessary legal training. He is unprejudiced as between the parties, and this is not the first time that he has been entrusted with quasi-judicial work.  The third party is given a right of recovery against the debtor.</P>

      <P>Against the debtor. The members of the debtor's family may generally be presumed to have benefitted by money or goods, and that is a point I would wish to stress.  It may also be well to say that a rate collector, in a seizure for rates, could at all times seize any chattels on the rated premises, to whomsoever the chattels belonged, and what usually happens, and what may be anticipated as likely to happen under this Section, is that the judgment debtor who would not pay the <Col N="1936" /> original creditor as long as he could avoid doing so, usually pays the third party readily enough, if the third party claim is good, because the relations between the debtor and the third party are usually such as to make it prudent for the debtor not to allow the third party to suffer.</P>
      <P>Section 14 aims at recouping the exchequer for the additional expenses incurred under this Act (that is for additional under-sheriffs and bailiffs).  Section 15 appoints all fees to be charged by or to be paid under-sheriff and others.  This Section vests in the Minister for Home Affairs the power of varying the existing scale of sheriffs' and bailiffs' fees.  Some of these fees require revision in order to cover present-day costs.  That brings us to the second portion of the Bill, dealing with assistant under-sheriffs.  This portion of the Bill authorises the employment of temporary assistant under-sheriffs. It is felt that such a step may be found necessary in such counties as Tir Chonaill, Galway, Cork, and Tipperary, where you have at one and the same time a very extensive area and a large number of outstanding decrees.  Before making these appointments an interval will be allowed to see whether the existing under-sheriffs, with the help of the additional powers contained in this Bill, will be in a position to clear up their arrears, or to make such substantial inroads in them that the progress is considered sufficiently good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III. deals with the examination of debtors.  The effect of this part of the Bill is to extend to the District Court the existing system of examining a debtor as to his means, and punishing him for fraud or wilful disobedience. The present law on the subject is largely ineffective because of the trouble, delay, and expenses involved in bringing small debt cases before the County Court or the High Court.  By bringing the debtor before the neighbouring district court it is hoped to make much more effective, and certainly much cheaper, this very valuable part of the machinery for bringing defaulting debtors to account.  Examination as to means is aimed mainly at debtors who have no furniture or cattle, but who have incomes or investments, or <Col N="1937" /> moneys in bank; people, for instance, who live in hotels or lodgings.</P>
    <P>It may be well to emphasise the fact that a debtor is not to be imprisoned for mere non-payment, but only for refusal to pay.  I am anticipating a certain amount of pathetic eloquence in reference to this Section, and I am doing my utmost to forestall that by making it clear to Deputies that whatever this portion of the Bill provides for it does not provide for imprisonment for debt.  It provides for imprisonment for contumacy, imprisonment for contempt of court, imprisonment for wilful disobedience of a court order, but certainly not imprisonment for debt.  This Bill does not render any debtor liable to imprisonment who is not already liable under the existing law.  That fact also, if properly grasped, might prove a barrier against sentimentalism.  The Bill merely extends the power of ordering imprisonment to a cheaper and more accessible tribunal.  It is not a new power.  It is an extension to other courts of powers that already exist, so that the only real change is that it will be cheaper in future to put a dishonest debtor where he ought to be&mdash;in jail.</P>
    <P>Coming to Part IV., if Deputies will look at Section 26 they will see there that the District Justice is empowered to decide the ownership of property in &ldquo;third party claims&rdquo; up to the value of £25.  If this Section is read in conjunction with Section 13, it will be seen that the Bill, if enacted as it stands, greatly expedites the settlement of &ldquo;third party claims,&rdquo; thus removing one of the most serious flaws in the present system.  I may say that the Bill was drafted and prepared after a good deal of consultation and correspondence with under-sheriffs as to what their real difficulties were, as to what their experience of the working of the previous Act was, and there was nothing to show on the other side&mdash;there was no correspondence, no interviews with T.D's., or others, to show that under the Act of last year there was any undeserved hardship on a single judgment debtor.  I circulated to Deputies, I think, certainly I read them here, returns showing the decrees outstanding in the various counties and the amount <Col N="1938" /> of money represented by those decrees, and I gave to-day a rough analysis of the situation, showing that you had £170,000 outstanding in decrees, and 7,000 decrees in the hands of under-sheriffs. I was not sure on the last occasion what point Deputy Johnson proposed to make out of the comparison of public and private debts.  But the decrees in respect of private debts are 5,100 as against 2,000 decrees in respect of public debts.  The amount of money outstanding in private debts is £150,000 against £17,000 on debts of a public nature.</P>
    <P>There will be no real progress, no credit, no commercial atmosphere until the situation represented by these figures is dealt with, and dealt with thoroughly.  People will not lend or take risks of any kind unless it is made abundantly clear to them that machinery to recover, well oiled, thoroughly overhauled, and brought into line with the requirements of existing conditions, is at their disposal.  I suggested on the last occasion, and I would like to repeat now, that if the situation were really faced and properly understood, the last people to oppose a Bill of this nature ought to be the Deputies who sit opposite.  It is recognised, and it is the common case, that there is economic depression in the country; it is a common case that there is unemployment to an extent which constitutes a social menace, and which constitutes a menace even to the State fabric.  That economic depression will not pass, and that unemployment will not be drained up until the people who have the money to put into productive enterprises of one kind or another can be made to feel that there is security for them, and unless people who have money to lend, people who are in a position to give credit of one kind or another, can be made to feel that in the last resort the law and its machinery is there for their assistance.  Now, the Government could not say to people in commercial life that the situation represented by those figures here meant that the law and the machinery of the law were available in good condition for the recovery of lawful debts.  The figures speak for themselves, and the story the figures tell is that the machinery of the law badly <Col N="1939" /> needs overhauling, oiling and repairing, and badly needs to be brought in line with the actual conditions throughout the country.  That is what the Bill does.  Like other Bills which it has been my duty to introduce and stand over, it has a hard ring.  The machinery which a Minister for Home Affairs must answer for here will always have a hard ring&mdash;the police forces, the prison service, and the execution of court decrees.  All that cannot be done to slow music.  It is government, and the sanction of every law in the last resort is the State forces.  I want here clearly, logically, and moderately to be put any real objection there is to this Bill.  Is it that people should not pay their lawful debts?  Should the creditor be allowed to go bankrupt rather than the debtor, and creditors have gone bankrupt in the absence of the means of recovering what amount are due to them.</P>
    <P>If it is admitted that lawful debts should be paid, and that Court Decrees should be carried out; if it is a common case that we ought not to send down the judge in his pomp to send much time and thought in the hearing of cases, and finally to say that such and such a thing be done; if it is a common case that we ought not to put a judge in the position of giving a decree and then have that order put in the wastepaper basket after he is gone, then this Bill is necessary.  The existing law bearing on the position of under-sheriffs is inadequate to meet the present existing conditions of the country. The system of the local pound which can so easily be broken open, and the local auction after 3 days' notice, which can be so easily upset or boycotted, all this brings us back to the piping times of peace before the European war.  It was very good in 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910 and 1911.  It is not sufficient now, and the figures I have given to Deputies give proof of that.  I ask for clear thinking in whatever criticism this Bill is to be subjected to, and absence of sentimentalism.  I do not want people to go back to the battering ram and the crowbar brigade, and generally to the age when there was not a native parliament functioning in the country to pass its Land Act after a fair review of its <Col N="1940" /> merits.  Take the situation now.  Let any Deputy about to criticise the Bill, put himself in the position of a judgment creditor who has obtained his decree from the Courts 18 months ago, and who has not got the justice which the hearing of his case entitled him to, and let him say what are the provisions of this Bill which are harsh, which are in excess of the requirements, and which are tyrannical.  That is the kind of criticism the Bill should get, not the kind of criticism which the Bill of last year got.  I want to say in that connection that Bills, temporary Bills, introduced last year met with unmeasured hysterical criticism, which their successors this year did not meet with.  We are getting on, and we are glad to see it.</P>

      <P>Dublin.&mdash;Situation normal.  There have been 19 resignations, two absconsions, and incidents at Gormanstown, Baldonnel and Gorey.  There is the utmost loyalty on the part of officers and men.</P>
      <P>Curragh.&mdash;Situation quite normal. There have been no resignations and no absconsions.  The only incident is the escape of a prisoner from one of the detention camps.  The utmost loyalty.</P>
      <P>Waterford.&mdash;Situation quite normal. Two resignations; 8 absconsions of officers, and 25 men deserted with arms from Clonmel.  There have been incidents at Cashel, Templemore, and Clonmel. Some additional resignations were tendered under circumstances of which I am not aware, but they were withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Kerry.&mdash;Situation normal, no resignations, no absconsions, no incidents.  A number of officers who were understood to have some sympathy with whatever is behind the letter of the two officers read to-day, have come forward and dissociated themselves from those officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> Cork.&mdash;The situation is quite normal. The Second in Command is the only resignation.  He has resigned here in Dublin.  There have been no absconsions, and no incidents.  A movement has been worked among the officers. The officers in &ldquo;Micheál&rdquo; Barracks and in other places have been approached individually by somebody during Saturday night and Sunday morning, and have been asked to sign a document tendering to Major-General Tobin their resignation.  The following is the document:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, So-and-so, do hereby request that you tender to President Cosgrave on my behalf my resignation from the Free State Army as a formal protest against the action of the Army Executive Council in their continued and studied neglect of the best interests of the country as evidenced by their action in continual demobilising of officers who have endeavoured to place our country on the road to complete freedom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A number of officers in Cork did sign that document, but when it became understood that there was not a general signing of it, and that the majority of officers did not sign, those who had signed made arrangements to have their papers destroyed.  The original G.O.C. of the Command has been brought to Dublin and the Second in Command resigned in Dublin.  The new officer in command has inspected the Command and reported everything normal.  A certain wire was sent from Cork on yesterday, the 10th, by a person there:&mdash;&ldquo;All here resigning; are you ready?&rdquo;  That was sent to Kerry, where the situation is perfectly normal, and where there has been a repudiation of the document.  In Cork a large number of persons who signed documents of resignation have endeavoured to have them returned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" /> In connection with the Baldonnel incident, the O.C. of the Aerodrome yesterday tendered his resignation on the 'phone.  He was told that his resignation would not be accepted in that way, and he said that if that was so he would have to be regarded as a deserter.  The Second in Command, who was absent irregularly yesterday from the camp, has been placed under arrest, but he has stated his absolute loyalty to the State. The total number of officers who have resigned, and whose resignations have been sent in, is not to be understood as meaning sympathy with the document read to-day.  A number of officers were resigning in the ordinary way, and some of them have offered to withdraw their resignation until any crisis there is is over.  The number of officers who resigned up to the present is 45.  These figures include absconsions.  So far as ranks go, the O.C. at Baldonnel was a Major-General, the Second in Command in Cork was a Colonel.  Five Commandants have resigned, and 27 Captains. The remainder were Lieutenants.</P>
    <P>The whole officer personnel has been examined, and the total number of officers who might be in sympathy, not with the action taken by these officers in sending that letter, but with whatever is at the back of that letter, is 90 odd.  A number of officers that we thought it well to place on that list of suspicion have in the meantime come to the officers at General Headquarters and told them, in case they were suspected because of their association with some of those people, that they were absolutely loyal to their commissions. So that from the point of view of national safety and security, the military position in the country is quite sound, and the incidents that have taken place have been incidents of absconsion rather than of any definite attempt to take military action of any kind.</P>
