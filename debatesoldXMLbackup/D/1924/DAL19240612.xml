      <P>asked the President if the Executive Council has considered the genuine grievances under which tenants in towns labour, and if it is proposed to introduce a measure to remove these grievances, and when.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully in sympathy with the redressing of the grievances of tenants in towns, but, as I stated yesterday, I find it utterly impossible to cope with the amount of business on hands.  I should like to have an opportunity of discussing this matter with other Ministers with a view to considering how best the interests of town tenants require protection. The Rent Restrictions Act and the Town Tenants Act may reasonably be construed as providing against the major difficulties of town tenants pending a more favourable opportunity for considering the matter.</P>

When his claim was made it took some time to ascertain all the circumstances of the case, but payment was not refused.  The claim has now been settled by the issue of a cheque.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the affirmative.  Even before the occupation of the Museum by the Oireachtas special precautions were taken for preventing or extinguishing fires in this building.  It contains a quantity of apparatus such as extincteurs, hand-pumps and buckets for dealing with a fire in its earlier stages.  There are <Col N="2209" /> also hoses and hydrants for fighting a fire which has gained some hold; and the most important precaution of all is that a fireman, accompanied, by a policeman, is stationed at the Museum during the night, and makes rounds at regular intervals.  The Museum is, of course, also connected with the Fire Brigade Station by telephone.</P>
      <P>Since the occupation by the Oireachtas and the conversion of the Museum Annexe into a restaurant and kitchen &mdash;which events add to the fire risk&mdash; additional precautions have been taken. A day fireman has been added to the night fireman, so that there is now always one on the premises.  The fire-fighting apparatus is at the present time being added to, and certain additional structural alterations are being made, such as the erection of partitions and fire-resisting doors at suitable points.</P>

      <P>John Magan, of Derrinturn, Carbury, Co. Kildare, claimed Unemployment Benefit at Edenderry on the 22nd February, 1924, and his claim was disallowed because he had no contributions to his credit.  There was some unavoidable delay in coming to a decision on the <Col N="2210" /> claim, because of the fact that the applicant had spelled his name variously. When applying for an Unemployment Book in August, 1923, he had signed himself &ldquo;Magan,&rdquo; and this is the name by which he was registered in the Unemployment Fund.  In his claim for benefit he signed himself &ldquo;McGann,&rdquo; and, in addition, there was a difference in the age stated on both occasions.  When he lodged his claim Magan was unable to produce his Unemployment Book, alleging that it was in the possession of the County Council.  When the local officer of this Department applied to the County Council for it he was informed that Magan's name could not be traced in the records of the Council and that the Council had not possession of his book.  Magan himself produced his book on the 23rd May.  It appears that he had been employed by the County Council in 1923, but contributions were not paid for him.  The local officer of this Department did not prevent the representative of the Co. Council from stamping the book, but owing to the nature of Magan's employment it was very doubtful whether contributions were payable at all in respect of the employment in question, and that aspect of the case is still under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Unemployment Insurance Bill, 1924, which is necessitated by the fact of the high rate of unemployment at present existing in this country, and secondly by the large number of those unemployed who have exhausted all their contributions, on which they could draw benefits, accrued under previous Acts.  A few figures with regard to the actual state of unemployment benefit are necessary. The latest returns to hand show that from 18th October, 1923, to the <Col N="2216" /> 5th May of this year, 78,685 persons lodged claims for unemployment benefit, these claims having been allowed. Approximately 34,000 had exhausted all right to benefit to which they were entitled on the 12th April of this year; 37,000 had their rights to benefit completely exhausted by the 3rd May.  An estimate has been made with regard to the future and that estimate is that approximately 56,000 will have exhausted all benefits to which they might be entitled by the 1st July, and 73,000 would have exhausted all benefit at the end of August.  By the 15th October, 1924, there would be no benefit unexhausted. One deduction arises from some of these figures.  If you take an applicant for benefit who had been allowed the maximum number of days, that is to say, 156 days, the earliest date by which he could have exhausted his benefit in the second benefit year was the 17th April of this year.  I have already stated that 34,000, approximately, had exhausted by the 12th April, all the benefit to which they were entitled. It is clear from those figures that that number have no further credit on the Unemployment Insurance Fund; 34,000 are definitely without further right to benefit from the fund.  The balance of 44,685 remain for consideration, and the estimate is that about 19,000 have sufficient contributions to entitle them to the full term of 26 weeks, and some benefit to spare, which would fall into and be available in the next benefit year.  Consequently only 19,000 have any hope of benefit in the next insurance year on the statutory basis established by the Act of 1923. That was the position which had to be faced: 78,000 people who had lodged claims which had been allowed, and only 19,000 without any great reduction in the ranks of unemployed, have any right to benefit in the next benefit year.  The rest would have benefit completely exhausted and would be left without any resources, as far as the Unemployment Insurance Fund was concerned.  That, of course, led immediately to the conclusion that some further provision for the relief of unemployment by way of unemployment benefit was necessary.  The only question then to be decided was the manner in which this provision <Col N="2217" /> should be made.  There was the question of either covenanted benefit or uncovenanted benefit.  Uncovenanted benefit is very difficult to check, is much more wasteful even than the covenanted type, and is a severer drain on public funds.  The expenditure necessary in connection with the supervision of the covenanted benefit has to be made in any event; the offices are there and the officials are being paid, and it was thought better, on a full consideration of all the circumstances, that the covenanted benefit system, the insurance system, should be adhered to in preference to the uncovenanted type of benefit.  That means that this Bill is founded on that basis, the old insurance principle, with a small difference.  The unemployment insurance goes on the principle that there is some proportion between contributions paid and benefit to be received, and that is adhered to with this difference, that benefit is to be paid out in advance of contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the word &ldquo;dole&rdquo; will be frequently mentioned this afternoon, and I would enter a protest against its use.  It can only be considered a dole on one assumption, and that is that the money is never to be repaid to the Fund.  That is not the intention that we have at the moment. The intention is that the employer, the employee, and the State shall repay in any year in which unemployment will be only normal&mdash;it has to be recognised that there is such a thing as normal unemployment in a country&mdash;the advances made by the Central Fund to the Insurance Fund. On that basis there is no justification whatever for applying the term &ldquo;dole&rdquo; to what is proposed in this Bill.  It is based definitely on the old principle of some proportion, some relevance, between benefit to be enjoyed and contributions paid.  Taking into consideration the number of those who have exhausted the right to benefit, on the present basis it is clear that the normal procedure of one day's benefit for every contribution is not desirable and would not meet the case in the present circumstances.  The main proposition in the Bill is that any contributions paid for a person in an insurable occupation since the 8th <Col N="2218" /> November, 1920, are to be revived, and benefit will follow on the revival of those contributions.  That may not be quite clear from the terms of the Bill itself, which seems to limit the revival of contributions to the second benefit year, but this Bill has to be taken in conjunction with the Act of 1923, and that, in Clause 3, stated &ldquo;for the purpose of determining the amount of benefit to which a person is entitled no account shall be taken of any benefit which may have been received by such person between the 7th day of November, 1920, and the commencement of the first benefit year.&rdquo;  That provision is carried into the present Bill and the effect, consequently, is that any contributions paid for a person in an insurable occupation since the 8th day of November, 1920, are revived, and the ordinary benefit follows thereon.</P>
    <P>That is the first and the main proposition in the Bill, and the position of the person at present unemployed who was at any time in an insurable occupation and had stamps paid for him is this, to put it in another way: The machinery for the proper method of counting what benefit has been received is roughly this: stamps are put on, representing contribution to the fund.  When benefit is paid the stamps are cancelled.  The effect of this Bill will be that stamps cancelled since the 8th December, 1920, will be revived.  These cancelled stamps appear as if they were new stamps and entitle a person to benefit.  The second main point in the Bill is with regard to persons enlisted in the National Military Forces.  The proposition with regard to them is, that for a period of service which terminated on or before the 29th of June, 1924, in the case of a person who, before the date of enlistment, had had paid for him, under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, either 20 contributions at any time, or 10 contributions since the 8th November, 1920, there shall be paid to the credit of the Unemployment Fund by the Minister for Defence not less than 24 contributions for every insurance year, or portion of an insurance year, covered by the military service of such person. The contributions so paid are then <Col N="2219" /> credited to such person.  That seems to go back even further than the 8th November, 1920, because it speaks of 20 contributions at any time, or 10 since the 8th November, 1920.  That is explained by this fact, that the Act of 1920 re-adjusted the basis on which unemployment insurance was given, and included for unemployment insurance purposes many more people than were included in any previous Act.  Those who were included in any previous Act and who had not exhausted the right to benefit had their contributions brought forward by the 1920 Act, and the 1920 Act is taken as the basis of all succeeding Acts, because it brought forward the contribution question and increased the number of those who might draw benefit under the terms of it.</P>
    <P>The rest of the Bill is pretty well all machinery.  It grafts itself on to the 1923 Act, takes away the second benefit year set up by that, establishes in place of it a new second benefit year, and third, fourth and fifth special benefit years, and then sets out a period over which all further benefit years shall be counted.  The period dealt with in this special benefit year section is from the 29th June of this year to the 16th of October next year, and that period of about 66 weeks is divided into three benefit periods of 17 weeks, 21 weeks, and about 29 weeks. It is a matter of machinery, and the clause which follows the setting up all of these special years, limiting the maximum benefit payable in any benefit year, has to be taken in conjunction with this clause.  Ten weeks is the maximum period over which benefit is payable in the 17 weeks period; 16 weeks is the maximum period over which benefit is payable in the 21 weeks period; the maximum is 15 weeks in the third period, and the maximum is 26 weeks in any normal benefit year. With regard to those who are likely to be benefited under the present proposals, and for how long they are to receive benefit under them, this may be of interest: I previously said that 78,685 people had been allowed benefit in the second benefit year.  I have now to add on a number of 4,143 who, prior to the 17th May of this year, had been <Col N="2220" /> disallowed benefit because they had not 12 contributions to their credit.  That proviso with regard to 12 contributions to credit is repealed in this Bill, and will not hold for the special benefit periods; that is, we are dealing now with a number of unemployed, about 82,000.  Under the proposals of this Bill 25,000 persons will be entitled to 6 weeks benefit, or less.  I have to make a rough division here in order to give totals&mdash;it is quite arbitrary, but it divides them into a period of benefits which may be looked forward to under the present proposals.  Twenty-five thousand would be entitled to 6 weeks benefit or less; 20,000 would be entitled to between 6 and 13 weeks benefit; about 16,000 will profit to the extent of 13 to 19 weeks, and 21,700 will have between 19 and 26, the maximum number of weeks benefit.</P>
    <P>The only other item which I wish to make any comment on at the moment is this: With regard to the total cost of unemployment benefit from the period, 30th June, 1924, to the 25th March, 1925, it is estimated in that period at about £600,000, but if no new Act were introduced, the total cost of unemployment for that period would be about £400,000.  This Bill, therefore, puts on the unemployment fund, or at the moment on the Central Fund, an additional charge of something not less than £200,000.  This is an estimate, and I say something not less than £200,000 because the estimate is put somewhat higher.  £200,000 is the minimum charge on the Central Fund to be afterwards repaid from the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That is all that is contained in the Unemployment Insurance Bill of 1924.  One other thing I would like to say.  I had intended to go into matters in some detail, but there will be other opportunities for dealing with the things I had desired to discuss. <Col N="2221" /> This is not the sole contribution of the Government to the unemployment question.  This is not a solution, it is an immediate reaction to the present high rate of unemployment in the country. It is not meant to be anything more than an alleviation of the very evident distress.  It is not in substitution for any scheme which may be brought forward of a good type to relieve unemployment by providing work or by stimulating industry.  Those are the two divisions of approach to the unemployment problem that I make. There are certain temporary relief schemes.  These I think can be discussed, and undoubtedly will be discussed on my own estimates, and that will be more or less the proper place to discuss them.  With regard to the general stimulus of industry, next week there will be introduced something in the nature of a Trade Facilities Bill, and on that the question of the better approach to the unemployment problem by way of stimulating industry can be raised.  I simply mention these matters in order to point out that this is not to be taken as the sole contribution of the Government to the solution of this very big question.  It is the immediate reaction to it, and is not to be taken at all as even the best view of what is the right thing to be done in the circumstances.  It is a thing done because the distress is there, and it is obvious it has to be immediately attended to.  This seems to be the best way of immediate attention.  Relief schemes take a certain amount of time. They are expensive and extravagant. It may be said they are not so extravagant as giving money which is entirely unproductive.  That is so, but the question brooks no delay and consequently some attack had to be made on this question.  The less immediate attack will be made afterwards on the question of estimates and on the Trade Facilities Bill.</P>

      <P>At the outset I want to congratulate the Minister on going a little further than his predecessor so far as unemployment insurance is concerned. When the 1923 Act was introduced here the Deputies on these Benches foretold that it would not do very much to relieve unemployment. I think time has proved they were correct, because for the past twelve months not alone have people been in a very bad way through unemployment, but they have been subjected to a great <Col N="2223" /> deal of annoyance by reason of the fact that the recent Act was subject to many different interpretations.  The local managers of exchanges were not able, to any great extent, to tell people whether they were in benefit or not. People had to keep in constant touch with the Labour Exchanges week after week, and in the end they were told they were not entitled to benefit.  I submit that if the machinery of the Act and the different sections of it had been less complicated, people would have known their positions at the beginning and managers would have known then whether claimants were entitled to benefit or not.  So far as I can see, in this Bill the machinery has been simplified and whilst I congratulate the Minister, as I did at the beginning, on going a step further than his predecessor, I say that in my opinion he and the Government ought to go a little further.  For instance, sub-section 2 of section 1 of the Bill sets out the period in which benefit begins.  It begins on the 30th June, 1924, and terminates on the 29th October, 1924&mdash;ten weeks out of seventeen weeks.  To my mind, that is not sufficient to deal with the present situation, because you have huge numbers of unemployed who have not had benefit for a considerable time and I think there ought to be a greater proportion than ten weeks out of seventeen paid at the beginning at any rate. The tendency is for the number of weeks to increase in each benefit year. I think if the Government and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are in earnest in dealing with the unemployment question, they should put this the other way&mdash;that is that the greater number of weeks should be at the beginning, in the first benefit year.  I think that is a reasonable proposition and it will be generally agreed that ten weeks out of seventeen weeks, with so many men without unemployment benefit for such a considerable time, is rather a low proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have just asked the Minister a question as to whether a person who has had no contribution at all from November, 1920, is entitled to draw benefit under this Act, and he has definitely said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I think that is where a great mistake has been made by the <Col N="2224" /> Minister.  He and everybody in this House, I think, will agree that it was in the year 1920 the great slump came and this, if persisted in, will disqualify men who had been insured continuously under the original Act of 1911. There are men who had been continuously employed in iron works and in the building trades for eight years, and they will be disqualified now under this Bill.  Those men are decent men who are very anxious for employment, but who cannot get employment.  Employment cannot be found for them.  I think the Minister ought to recognise that, and to bring in an amendment, or introduce some new section into the Bill to enable him to deal with persons of that kind.</P>
    <P>There is another class of workers who are entirely forgotten so far as this Bill is concerned.  I know what I am going to advocate now will not be taken very well by the Farmers' Party. I refer to the case of the agricultural labourer.  There are numbers of agricultural labourers unemployed at the present time, through no fault of their own.  No provision is being made for them from any source, and I do think that if the agricultural community is not able to bear the same expense that the industrial population is called upon to bear in support of their unemployed, at least some modified scale of contribution should be brought about, and some modified system of benefit should be introduced into this Bill to enable unemployment in agricultural areas to be dealt with.  Unemployment is every bit as serious in the agricultural areas as it is in the industrial centres.  Something should certainly be done to relieve the large number of agricultural workers who are at present unemployed. I do not want to suggest anything which would put an additional burden upon the agricultural community, but I think that it is a very serious matter to a community when a large proportion of that community are unemployed and on the verge of starvation.</P>
    <P>There is a section of the Bill which deals with ex-members of the National Army.  I am very glad that something has been done in this connection, because in the last Bill which was passed <Col N="2225" /> here, National soldiers were not dealt with as they were entitled to be dealt with.  Many points might have been stretched in their favour.  After all, they did important work&mdash;work which they were called upon to do by the State at a very dangerous time&mdash;and they were entitled to better treatment by the State that called upon them to do that work.  There are other men whom I think this Bill does not cover &mdash;civilians who were employed in the different barracks during the period of the trouble last year and the year before. These people did not get their cards stamped by the Army authorities during the period they served in civilian positions in the Army.</P>
    <P>I am wondering if the Minister intends to do anything for these people. I have in mind the cases of men who were employed as civilians in different barracks through the country and who, when they applied to have their cards stamped, were told they were not entitled to have them stamped.  As a result, after leaving the Army, they were disqualified from receiving benefit.  As such small numbers are involved, and as the amount of money required is so small, I think the Minister should, on a subsequent stage, do something for these people.  Many amendments could be suggested to the Bill, and it is the intention of Deputies on these benches to do something in that respect. I would again stress the necessity of bringing into benefit some of those who had been insured continuously from 1912 to 1920 when the slump came.  These men are entitled to special consideration and I know that some of them have been continuously looking for work.  Men do not want the unemployment benefit if work could be provided for them.  It is work not unemployment benefit that is wanted, and when you find men looking for work, and unable to get it since 1920.  I think some consideration should be given to their cases by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill, as I think it will go a good way towards relieving much of the hardship now caused by unemployment. There are one or two minor points that <Col N="2226" /> I would like to have cleared up.  Up to the present it has been the practice that not only were agricultural labourers not entitled to the unemployment benefit but any worker who happened to live in an agricultural district was disqualified, because of that fact.  The fact that a man, even a tradesman, lived in what was termed by the officer an agricultural area disqualified him from benefit.  I would also like to ask the Minister's consideration for another class, carters.  These are men of the labouring class, who own horses and carts, and as a rule are employed by the county councils.  They did not come in under previous Unemployment Acts. When they are thrown out of work they are very hard hit.  In addition to having their wives and families to support they have to try and feed their horses.  The number of these men throughout the country is very large. I think the Minister should consider the question of bringing them in under the terms of this Bill by allowing them to contribute when they are working, so that they will be entitled to benefit when they are unemployed.  I think the Minister is to be commended for bringing in this Bill.</P>

      <P>There is one section of this Bill that I wish to speak about in particular, and that concerns ex-service men of the National Army. Prior to the Truce hundreds of men were arrested and interned.  The majority of these were too young to be in constant employment. On their release they joined the National Army and after eighteen months or two years' service they were demobilised.  They are not entitled to any unemployment benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not been entitled up to now.  I can send you a list of 50 cases where the men were refused unemployment benefit at the Labour Exchanges because they had no stamps on their cards, prior to joining the National Army.  It is all very well to congratulate the Minister and the Government on introducing this Bill, but I hope the compliment will be returned by agreeing to the suggestions <Col N="2227" /> that were made by Deputies Corish and Morrissey.  It is nearly time something was done for the large number of men who are now unemployed and who are not entitled to any unemployment benefit. It has been suggested here that this is a dole.  To my mind, it is not a dole at all, as the majority of those entitled to benefit, as well as their employers&mdash;in addition to what the State gives&mdash;contributed towards unemployment benefit.  Such contributions are far greater than the amount that is paid out to the individual worker by the Labour Exchange.  I want to ask the Minister to do something for the agricultural workers.  In every county where there are 700 or 800 agricultural workers you have 200 or 300 unemployed. That may not be the fault of the farmers, as they may not be able to find markets for their produce, but the fact remains that the agricultural workers, whose labour is of as much advantage to the State as that of any other workers, are suffering.  I think they should be treated on the same footing as other workers and allowed to come in under the Unemployment Act on paying contributions.  In addition a contribution will be paid by the employer and a grant given by the State. If that was done these people when unemployed will not have to be looking for home help.  When the expenditure on home help increases in the different counties, the Minister for Local Government and Health comes along and dissolves the Home Help Board. If those who have to seek home help could get employment, or could get benefit from the Labour Exchange, it would not be necessary for the Minister for Local Government and Health to do such an unpopular thing as to dissolve these boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister for a definite reply as far as the case of ex-service men is concerned.  I know of hundreds of cases where men, who had been in the Army for two years, but who had no stamps on their cards, were not entitled to, and would not get out-of-work benefit.  Of course, I am pleased to see that the Minister is taking into account all the disqualifications <Col N="2228" /> in connection with stamps with a view to granting to the unemployed these benefits.  Another thing I wish to complain about is the way in which these benefits are given.  Now, taking all classes of workers, whether artisans or labourers, who come under the head of this unemployment, they have to call six or eight weeks to the Labour Exchange and sign week after week, and some of them probably have to walk as far as 6 or 8 miles for the purpose of signing, and at the end of that time they are told that they do not come under the Unemployment Insurance Act, or that they have not sufficient stamps on their cards, or else they are told to go home and that the manager of the Exchange will communicate to them in writing.  This is the way this business has been managed.  I do not know what it was meant for at first, whether Mr. Lloyd George, when he introduced it for Great Britain, meant it for the purpose of relieving distress or for the purpose of making big jobs to provide certain people with positions under the Act.  But if this is really an Act to relieve the unemployed, I do not see why people should be expected to call 6 or 8 times week after week to the Labour Exchange and sign there and be told in the end that they had nothing to get. I had a case in my mind that I mentioned here in the debate on the adjournment, the case of an Athlone ex-service man.  He had served two years and forty-eight days in the Army. He had not been in employment prior to joining the Army, but he had been 12 months in prison.  While in the Army he got married and he was blessed with two children.  When he was demobilised from the Army he called several times at the Labour Exchange, with the result that he never received one penny from the Labour Exchange because he had not been employed prior to joining the Army. Now, the Minister states in section 4, sub-section (3) that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section applies to every person enlisted in the military forces of Saorstát Eireann for a period of service which terminates on or before the 29th day of June, 1924, who in respect of employment before the date of enlistment has had paid for him under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, <Col N="2229" /> either twenty contributions at any time or ten contributions since the 8th day of November, 1920.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, now, that does not cover the points that I wanted to raise.  Men who have been arrested from 1917 have not been employed.  Men who were too young, and who joined the National Army at sixteen or seventeen years of age had no stamps on their cards; they had no contributions; and those classes of people would not be entitled to any benefits under this Act. I am sorry that the Minister for Defence is not here.  He probably might be able to give an explanation as to why men serving in the Army only get one stamp per month instead of one stamp per week on their cards.  It is the duty of every employer to see that everyone of his employees pays a certain contribution, even if he only works one hour in the week.  In one particular case I know of a man who worked for one hour, and out of what he was to receive for his work 1s. 10d. was stopped under the Unemployment benefit, and he received 2d. for working an hour.</P>

      <P>He may be from your point of view, but from my point of view he desired to work.  Now I do not see why the Government cannot have a contribution given in the case of men in the Army each week.  Then when these men are demobilised, even if they have not been working before they join the Army, they will be entitled to ten or twelve or sixteen weeks, according as the case may be. I should like to know further whether it is the intention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to increase the grant to married men.  You have a large number of married men who are willing and able to work, and cannot find employment, and I think it would be necessary to give some little increase to the married men.  At the present time a married man gets 2d. per day for each child, that is one shilling a week, which would not be sufficient to buy milk for even one child. This amount should be increased; and I certainly hope that the Minister will take this matter into account.  I can <Col N="2230" /> furnish him with the names of fifteen men who have been serving in the National Army, and who are entitled, or should have been entitled, to receive their out-of-work benefits, but who are not receiving them.  I congratulate the Minister, and I appreciate his attempt to deal with the problem of unemployment. I think every member of the Government is as much interested as any other Deputy in this question of unemployment.  We must find work for the unemployed.  I have been accused of saying that I do not agree with a man going to the Labour Exchange and holding his hand out for alms.  I do not agree with it.  The workers do not want it; the workers want work; they want something to show for the money they receive; but under this particular Act the workers own the money they are receiving.  The State may be giving a little contribution, the Minister mentions £200,000. £200,000 amongst 80,000 men will not buy a great lot.  But we welcome every small mercy.  We must find some way out of our present difficulties.  It is up to every employer in Ireland to try to find employment for one extra man and if they do the workers of Ireland will not want to trouble the Government for very long.</P>

      <P>I rise to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  I look upon it as a genuine attempt to meet the distress due to unemployment. But in congratulating him I should like to point out to him that he has made no provision for those young fellows of 15, 16 and 17 years of age who have grown up since the year 1920, who have not been at that time working in an insured trade and are now left without any benefit. Well, looking at these young men as they are in the country to-day without any employment, I think it is the duty of the State to come forward with schemes of public utility to enable those young men to be trained so as to become useful citizens.  We have had put before us small schemes of arterial drainage.  I have put some of those up to the Ministry of Local Government and they have been turned down.  The President on one or two occasions said that those schemes would be carefully <Col N="2231" /> considered.  Well, if that is the way they have been carefully considered there is no use in our putting them up to the Government at all, or in speaking about them.  I think that in dealing with the problem of unemployment as the Minister is doing, he is not getting at the root of the matter.  What we want is work, and I do not think that it is at all impossible if the Government intend to relieve unemployment as it ought to be relieved&mdash;I do not believe it is impossible to do so. I, therefore, look to the Government to give us something else than unemployment benefit.</P>

      <P>We believe that this Bill will, as the other Deputies in this Party have said, do something to relieve the position that exists in the country at the present time.  As has also been said, we should very much prefer that work of a constructive nature should be undertaken instead of this Bill.  But as the Minister has pointed out the difficulties that exist in that respect at the present time, we think that this Bill will do a certain amount of good towards relieving a position that is becoming worse every day in the country.  I was very glad that the Minister made clear a point that was not very clear to me up to then as to some of the disqualifications that were removed by this Bill.  On reading the Bill it was not very clear to me at any rate that the disqualification by which you received only one day's benefit for each stamp was removed. I think that the fact that it has been removed is one of the best aspects of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some defects that Deputy Corish has pointed out, and probably the one that will be dwelt on most will be that in connection with the gaps in the unemployment benefit.  As he pointed out, out of a possible seventeen weeks the first period of ten weeks benefit is too little.  I suggest that the Minister should favourably consider an amendment to improve the position in that respect when the Bill goes into Committee.  I was glad to notice also that the present deplorable position of a good many ex-National Army men has been improved.  As Deputy Lyons <Col N="2232" /> has mentioned that matter, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the grievances of a number of ex-National Army men which have not been removed so far.  I understand that in the case of a number of men who were attached to the Railway Protection Corps and who were demobilised when their services were no longer required, they have not yet received benefit.  I think they are in a worse position than any other ex-members of the National Army, because I understand that their ordinary contribution was deducted weekly.  The point has not been made clear whether they are entitled to benefit.  Some claims have been paid but in Cork a consider able number of claims are outstanding. It may not be the fault of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and it may be a matter for the Minister for Defence, and if the Minister could do anything to clear up that position it would mean a great deal to such men.  I met one of these men in Cork this week and I know that he had neither clothes nor food and he was signing at the local Labour Exchange for the last five or six months.  His position was desperate and if this matter is within the province of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, such cases as these should be cleared up.  As I say, we believe that this Bill will go a good way to improve things, but in welcoming it I am more concerned with the hope which the Minister held out that this will be followed by schemes of reconstruction in the future.  The Minister has given us hope that the Government are inclined to look on this matter in a more favourable light than that which we were led to expect from some of their actions.  On the whole I think the Minister has made a serious attempt to improve the position and I trust that the works and the schemes which he foreshadowed will materalise within a short time and further improve the position.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to explain a little more clearly to me, and perhaps also, to other Deputies, what he estimates the total cost to the exchequer of this Bill will be.  I understood him to say <Col N="2233" /> that on the assumption that the present conditions will continue, his estimate is £600,000, but £400,000 of that is allowed on the estimates submitted, and therefore an additional £200,000 will be necessary.  I can find in the estimates before us under the heading &ldquo;Unemployed Insurance&rdquo; for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce a sum of £200,000 but I do not see a sum of £400,000.  Perhaps I misunderstood him, but I should be glad if he made that point clear.  I listened attentively to his concluding remarks and welcomed the admission on his part that he recognised the extravagant nature of this proposal for dealing with the present difficulty, and that really nothing but the urgency of the matter drove him to this method.  I trust that he is giving his earnest attention to the introduction of schemes which will be of a productive kind.  They may be expensive, but at least there will be some result to show of a lasting character which we cannot expect from measures of this nature which may be necessary but which are really unsatisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that we here on these Benches can understand the position of the Labour Party in congratulating the Minister on the introduction of this measure.  It is going to cost the State £200,000, and I think it is regrettable that the Ministry did not some time ago recognise that unemployment was the very urgent problem that we all know it to be, and that they did not have the vision to put some better scheme before the country than the present one.  The unemployment dole is very unsatisfactory and very demoralising, and the sooner the situation can be met by some other method the better for the country as a whole.  £200,000 would do something if expended on a scheme of reconstruction.  That is going to be spent under the present Bill, and when it is spent the country will have got nothing for it.  It would have been much better policy for the Ministry and the country that they should have conceived a scheme and put it before this Dáil that would have given us something for the money that is to be spent.  What we feel is that this <Col N="2234" /> problem has not been handled the way it ought to have been, because really to have the State called on to pay £200,000 for the relief of unemployment, and that all that will be got in return is to have these men continuing to walk around when plenty of work is to be done in the country, is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the situation, and it is regrettable that the Ministry did not recognise this long ago.  We know that the situation to-day demands that something must be done immediately, but the pity is that that fact was not recognised six months ago, or earlier, when, perhaps, another and more suitable scheme would now be in operation, relieving unemployment, and, at the same time, be of much more benefit to the State than what is being proposed at the moment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish and Deputy Colohan are two members of this Dáil with whom I frequently have the happiness of perfect agreement.  I rejoice on the present occasion to find no reason for disagreeing with them except one, and that, perhaps, arises from their over-zeal in the cause of the unemployed.  It is only natural to regard members of the Labour Party as specialists in all that concerns unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are in constant and close touch with those who are most affected by this scourge of lack of employment, and consequently when I find all from those benches speaking in eulogy of the Bill, I am satisfied, if I had not been already satisfied, that it is an excellent and commendable measure.  I have further reason to believe that it is an excellent measure for the particular purpose that it is intended to meet in the opposition of Deputy Baxter.  One can always know <i>a priori</i> that Deputy Baxter and certain of his colleagues will object to the expenditure of public money for any purpose other than the relief of agricultural rates or for the cheaper purchase of land or for some other advantage for one section only of the community for which all the others, in their conception, were made to exist.  The phrase was used to-day &ldquo;the better way.&rdquo;  It suggests to me, with regard to dealing <Col N="2235" /> with unemployment, that I might formulate three ways and call them the better way, the good way, and the present way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Better would hardly be in any sense a superlative for bad.  Deputy Professor Thrift will see my purpose in this classification in a moment.  The better way for the relief of unemployment is undoubtedly to make employment, just as the only effective cure for insomnia is sleep.  The only effective cure for unemployment is employment.  Now, the Minister has already mentioned that to stimulate industry and to promote trade and a greater exchange of goods, the production of them at a cheaper rate would be an excellent method for providing relief.  But that obviously depends upon a variety of conditions that cannot be created or even controlled by Acts of Parliament, even by Acts emanating from the worthy Minister from which this proceeds.  You require low taxation to begin with.  So long as taxation is high, so long there will be in proportion&mdash;not in exact proportion, of course &mdash;a depression of trade.  And the only way to recover the normal conditions under which we shall lower taxation is not the feasible way for the Minister to-day.  Another way, and the way usually resorted to, is that of providing relief works, and that is what Deputy Baxter evidently wants to have this money expended for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, as the Minister says, periods of normal unemployment.  In every country and at every time there were periods of unemployment.  It is due to the fact that at certain seasons of the year the Egyptians had nothing to do, that they built the pyramids and these various attractions that bring people with a surplus of money on long tours to the East.  The great defence for these uneconomic works is that they provide employment in these slacker periods, and that they produce results which otherwise it would not pay the State or people to undertake if there were a better type of productive work to engage labour at the moment.  Now, I come to the third method, by the consideration <Col N="2236" /> that the second method requires time.  Although this is an emergency procedure it requires time to elaborate plans, because otherwise you would have confusion and expense and the waste that Deputy Baxter deprecates. Meanwhile, what is happening the people in the city who have no employment so far?  Are they to die or are they to be left to die?</P>
    <P>Deputy Baxter used an extraordinary phrase&mdash;that the money spent to keep those citizens alive who have a claim upon us would be money wasted and money thrown away.  Does he consider that the preservation of human life, that the discharge of a duty to humanity, that to give heart and to give encouragement to those who labour in the State, that if things go contrary with them in the future they will not be left to perish by a stony and callous-hearted State&mdash;does he mean that that money is thrown away? It is not productive in the ordinary conventional sense of the word, but it is productive and constructive in the better sense.  After all that we have learned in recent years, or rather, after what some have tried to teach us in recent years&mdash;to look upon human life as of very little value&mdash;some of us are old-fashioned enough to look upon the value of a human being as being higher than cattle or higher than farm produce.</P>

      <P>I quite accept that valuation of me given by Deputy Gorey.  From the very first day in which I had the happiness of sitting alongside him in the last Dáil I learned his private opinion of me at various times and in various ways through the subterranean channels which it is his constant habit to employ for the expression of his feelings.  We, at any rate, on these benches do not regard human life as of such little value.  In any case, it is not the schoolmasters who are perishing, but men whom we regard as good citizens, men who have done good work and are anxious to do it again, because I quite agree with Deputy Corish and Deputy Colohan that what the workmen really wish for and <Col N="2237" /> what they would be better satisfied with, is work.  But the work is not forthcoming at the moment.  Work, even of that uneconomic kind for national purposes will require time, and consequently this S.O.S. signal has gone out, and it must be attended to, and that, I think, is the defence of a Bill of this sort.  It is meant to meet an urgent necessity of the moment, and it is frankly only a palliative.  Deputy Cooper has introduced the habit into the Dáil of illuminating passages of his speeches with autobiographical details. If I may follow the example set, I recall that I was seasick for 36 hours. The ship's surgeon recommended me brandy, not, as he was careful to add, that it would cure me, but it would keep me from collapse.  Now, that is exactly the purpose of this Bill.  It is to save from collapse the social organism. That is, at once, its excuse and its glory.  It is a measure that frankly recognises the rights of the citizens in these deplorable conditions, or in these unhappy circumstances, to call on the State which has benefited by their labours.  It is a recognition of the very same principle as is recognised in the Old Age Pensions Act, a recognition of closer unity and solidarity, and I would commend that view of the matter to Deputy Baxter.</P>

      <P>That is the part I am coming to.  The Deputy made an allusion to the fact that because one of the farmers' representatives objected to this particular means of relieving unemployment that <i>a priori</i> the money was wasted.  That was his argument.  Is it not a fact that this particular fund was overdrawn to the extent of one million last year?  It was £750,000 in debt at that particular time, and is it not a fact that we are now in the fifth or sixth month of the year?  What I say is that <Col N="2238" /> something should have been done during the last six months to formulate a scheme which would have given some relief.  The Government should not be continuing to hand out doles.  This is a foreign production that came from England.  It had its inception in the brains of a certain British statesman, who brought it in as a war measure. Why should we, seven or eight years after, continue this system, which is absolutely against progress and is the cause of a lot of the unemployment that we have?  We have the cases of men who refuse to work because they can get the dole.  Let us be fair and straight about this.  I do not object to the utilisation of State funds for the purpose of providing men with work. No man objects to that, but what we do object to is sinking the funds of the State in a constant river of expense towards an object which is only a palliative. The money could be as well spent in giving us results which would be of lasting benefit.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to take any part in this debate, but I have been struck here, as I am usually struck, by listening to the cheap wit of the Professor&mdash;a class of wit that he always treats this House to at the expense of the people who represent the agricultural community of the country.  We know that Deputy Magennis is a wonderful twister of words.  He can twist them any way, and he always has instances to give us, and here, I think, he referred to the Pyramids and something else.  Now, I wonder would the Professor&mdash;judge and all as he is of many things&mdash;call drainage and reclamation of land, and some other things in this country crying out for attention &mdash;would he call these something after the fashion of the work of Pyramids? This question of unemployment, and the questions we are facing to-day, are questions that have not sprung up at the moment.  Unemployment was a question that was pressing for attention six months ago, twelve months ago, and two years ago.  It is a question that any sensible Government would have tried to make provision for, even though that Government had in its Party gentlemen like Professor Magennis.</P>

      <P>I do not think this matter has been treated in the right way.  I think that provision at the right time should have been made, and not now.  You are practically driven to make provision now.  You are forced to do it.  There have been meetings, deputations, marches about the city, and I do not think the Government deserve very much credit now for doing what they are doing.  I do not believe&mdash;and I do not think any sensible man in the Labour Party or outside it believes&mdash;that this method is going to breed a healthy citizenship Deputy Professor Magennis may object to that, but that is the view I hold.  I do not think that this kind of thing breeds work, nor a desire to work, and the desire to work is everything.  It breeds an unhealthy state, and brings about an unhealthy position, and it is almost impossible to get away from that unhealthy and undesirable position. This is not a matter on which the Deputy should direct his sneers towards us.  We make our remarks in perfect good faith, and I did not think that anything is added by those cheap sneers of the Deputy, to which we are accustomed.  What we want here is a genuine desire to work, and by work we will breed that desire; and by payment for work&mdash;not payment for idleness by doles&mdash;not to have men standing round corners, wearing their clothes against bridges and walls. This thing is wrong; it is bad statesmanship; it is bad citizenship, and it is a thing we object to for the reasons I have stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it necessary to make a few remarks in this debate on account of the remarks made by some of the Deputies who preceded me.  I feel we have not approached this Bill <Col N="2240" /> in the proper spirit.  When the Minister placed it before us he made it absolutely clear to the intelligence of every Deputy in the House that he introduced the Bill simply as a matter of necessity.  He made that absolutely clear to us, and also foreshadowed possible legislation and an indication of measures to meet for the present the unemployment that prevails in the country.  If we keep that point of view before our minds, we would not perhaps work ourselves into a state of vexation, let us say, as a mild word, over the expediture of public money for this particular purpose.  I sincerely believe, with Deputy Magennis, that money in existing circumstances that has to be spent on feeding little children and feeding families of men out of employment, through no fault of their own, is money, not alone well spent, but wisely spent.  And it is money that the nation is simply called upon to expend if it is to have regard to its own credit and its own honour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know cases of men who have been in employment for fourteen or fifteen years up to a period of three years ago, until the business they were employed in fell through.  These men never lost a day's work through their own fault in their lives.  I knew some of these men to be total abstainers and to have spent twenty years of their lives between two employers, and I know these men to be hungry because of the unfortunate circumstances of their being unable to get employment.  The children of these men are hungry, and many Deputies know there are such other cases in every part of the country at the present moment.  This legislation is not going to be permanent; it is merely temporary, until this country can find its feet, until the farmers are in the position&mdash;which they are not at the present time&mdash;to give more employment. The time must come, and will come, when there will be more employment for the agricultural labourer. I think that if the mild measures of Protection which the Minister for Finance introduced in the Budget, and others that he foreshadowed, had been accepted in the proper spirit, they would have helped a good deal to case things in the future.  There are industries in this country that can be kept <Col N="2241" /> going, and must be kept going.  There was one thing referred to by Deputy Gorey with which I am in entire agreement, and that is that men should be paid for work&mdash;an honest day's pay for an honest day's work.  I congratulate the Minister on having introduced this measure at the present time in the interests of the unemployed section of the community.  I think it is absolutely necessary&mdash;but I hope it is only temporary&mdash;and I hope the reason for it will have departed before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with my colleagues on these benches in an expression of gratitude for the small mercies that are contained in the Bill, I have some amount of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Baxter.  If there had been prevision a year ago this Bill would not have been necessary.  If the money on which £200,000 would pay interest and sinking fund had been advanced for constructive work, this Bill would not have been necessary.  The problem, I am afraid is not going to be met by this Bill alone, and the Minister recognises that.  The problem of unemployment insurance is not going to be met by the Bill alone.  The Minister has said quite clearly and honestly that the Bill is mainly concerned with insurance and it intends to carry on the provisions of the last Bill, retaining the principle of insurance and not uncovenanted benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome as a better principle the principle of insurance against unemployment as against uncovenanted benefit.  We pointed out the necessity of the insurance scheme so that there should be some general revival, and any persons who were likely at any time to be unemployed should be compulsorily brought into the insurance scheme.  What has happened?  As pointed out by one or two Deputies, you are maintaining the insurance character of the scheme and you are leaving out very considerable numbers of people who are just as human, and who, therefore, without food will go hungry, as the people who are insured. The pain of unemployment is just as great upon the person not insured as upon the person insured.  I do not know <Col N="2242" /> what the numbers may be, but there are considerable numbers who have come into manhood since 1920 and who have not had insurable occupation since then.  They are at present unemployed and they continue to be unemployed and are not to be brought into insurance and therefore will not get benefit.</P>
    <P>While I would prefer a general insurance scheme, I fear this Bill is going to maintain or continue the hardship that the social system imposes upon those who are unemployed and not insured. As Deputy Lyons has emphasised, you have a considerable number of people who went through the Army. As I understand it, unless they were in an insurable occupation before 1920, they will not come under this scheme. We know that many of them were very young men before that time and they were in anything but an insurable occupation. No insurance would accept them because of the danger of their occupation.  They will not receive a benefit and they are just the type that will make danger for the country.</P>
    <P>I say that is a defect, and it would have been better to abandon, if necessary, the principle of insurance in the meantime, so that these people could be brought into a scheme of benefit imposing upon them the liability of permanent insurance, and out of that be able to get repayment for the amount advanced.  I would like Deputies to think that this Bill, to the extent that it is contributory, is an advance on the credit of the persons being insured.  It is an advance in belief that their power to labour will be employed and will be productive in future, and therefore it is no different from an advance by a bank to a firm that has potential productive capacity.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has emphasised the unwisdom, and untruth if you like, of the charge made in reference to this scheme.  The epithet &ldquo;dole&rdquo; was used.  It is no more dole than the Governor-General's allowance; it is no more dole than any benefit or any insurance or any penssion.  It is the payment in advance of work to be done. It is our duty to shorten the period of those advances to see that the payments for no work shall cease, and that work can be provided, during which period there will be no need for any <Col N="2243" /> further payment of insurance benefit, and when, as a matter of fact, the repayment will begin.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what the President said yesterday, I am going to put to Deputies and to the Ministry the problem that faces me.  I want to ask what are the prospects for next year or the year after?  We have seen records of the export and import trade.  We know that excessive imports will have to be paid for by exports, inasmuch as we do not know that we are doing any service which will be equivalent to export of goods and might be called exportation. I want to know what is being done to enable this country to be in a position to repay for present excessive imports in one or two years' time.  Are we seeing any increase in wealth production in the country?  Is any preparation being made for that general increase in productivity?</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister for Lands and Agriculture were present; he might tell us what his latest returns are regarding the increase or decrease of tillage and the prices for those things which are being produced. Even though there may be no increase in production, are we going to rely upon an increase in prices in the British market?  We may be able if we get that increase in prices, to meet the excess of imports but we have to bear in mind that that market is going to be supplied from all over the world, and that the hope of the British people is to reduce prices there.  Unless we see a very considerable increase in actual wealth production of exportable commodities, we are not going to see an improvement in one or two years' time, but a worsening of the present position.</P>
    <P>Now, this may be dubbed as pessimistic. It may be charged against me that I am doing what the President deprecated yesterday.  But I would like to have some statement of an authoritative kind of what are the prospects in the way of increasing wealth production so that we may look forward to this state of unemployment steadily decreasing.  When Deputies decry this kind of a measure I think they ought to ask themselves why such a measure <Col N="2244" /> as this is necessary?  Why was it invented, as I think Deputy Wilson suggested, by a British statesman?  I would suggest to Deputy Wilson and others that the general system of production and exchange which is in vogue, and is supported by him and most of the Deputies in the Dáil, inevitably results in unemployment.  It has been recognised owing to the development of moral conscience that there must be some ameliorative schemes propounded to meet the evils which are inherent in the system of industry and commerce, and which, unless we ameliorate them, will inevitably mean utter degradation and chaos.</P>
    <P>Now we have an attempt at ameliorating an evil which is the inevitable result of the system of industry and commerce of which most Deputies approve. If you are going, not only to maintain the evil system, but to remove the amelioration what do you expect the country to come to?  You are going to have everything that is bad and nothing that is good.  I say that so far as this scheme improves the position of those who have been insured we welcome it, but it ought to be extended so as to include those people who have not yet been insured.  We have no right to leave out in the darkness those who were not fortunate enough or lucky enough or wise enough to have been in insurable occupations and lucky enough to have employment in these occupations.  It would be well, if there is anything to be said for this principle of insurance&mdash;and most of the Deputies outside the Farmers' benches approve of it&mdash;to extend it to those who have not been insured hitherto, and not to allow it to be said that we are going to leave this section of the community outside the door while others are getting some crumbs inside. I would like to see this scheme amended in several directions.  I would like to see the gap closed up to a very great degree, if not wholly.  Indeed I would like to see it wholly closed.  But I would like to see a much smaller gap than is proposed in the Bill.  I think, too, it would be an improvement on the Bill and on the general scheme&mdash;and it is required by the facts of the case&mdash;that the dispute disqualification ought not to continue.  People who are accidentally <Col N="2245" /> and by no act of their own brought into unemployment because of disputes ought not to be debarred from benefits under this scheme.  There is no use, I suppose, pressing upon the Minister that the rates of benefit should be increased, but there should have been provided in the Bill some scheme for a training course, especially for the younger insured persons, while drawing the benefit.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I would hope it would be possible to deal with, if not by an amendment to the law, by general administrative reform, and that is an improvement of the system of appeals to the Courts of Referees. The appeal system to the courts has been proved, I think, unsatisfactory. The administration is faulty in that respect.  It does not give any satisfaction, and I would hope that if it is not possible to deal with that administratively it will be done by legislation. I do not know whether it will be possible to amend the Bill in that direction, and if it is not, I hope the Minister will consider seriously the taking of other steps to bring the Appeals Court and the Court of Referees into harmony with what the requirements of the cases are.  I would again draw attention to the necessity for amending the Bill to allow of those who were in the Army, and others outside the Army that did not come into insurance prior to the 1920 period&mdash;even if they were following an insured occupation, or if they were not in benefit at that time&mdash;being brought into this scheme.  Young soldiers, or young men going into the Army, many of them following the example of their higher officers, and, shall I say, thoughtlessly getting married, find themselves now uninsured and with no prospect of insurance even under this Bill.  Their position is a very serious one, and I would appeal to the Minister to take the cases of all those young men into account and try to bring them within the scope of the Bill in some way or other.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson used one expression which has rather stuck in my mind.  He said that if there had been prevision there would have been no necessity for the introduction <Col N="2246" /> of this Bill, and I cannot pretend not to understand that by that the Deputy meant that the Government&mdash;the Executive Council&mdash;should have foreseen an acute stage of unemployment at about this time.  I would like him, however, to apply the sentiment in a broader way, and to recognise that the circumstances with which the Bill deals are simply an exemplification of the fact that a country, any more than an individual, cannot have its cake and eat it; that we, or a large section of us, have gone about deliberately to create unemployment, and unemployment in a very acute way.  The Deputy, I think would scarcely deny that the biggest factor in creating and maintaining unemployment which faces us is the lack of security, the lack of ordinary confidence amongst the people that would enable them to put their money into any productive enterprise.  He says that it is our duty to shorten the period over which it will be necessary to expend money in the manner provided by the Bill.  I agree; I would have agreed with that sentiment any time those two years back, that it is our duty to bring about conditions where the normal play of individual enterprise would be sufficient to drain up unemployment.  But where you have insecurity, where you have all the factors making for insecurity, you will have unemployment, and you will have it despite any legislation that the Dáil and the Seanad may pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies say that the remedy should not be the dole, as it is called; it should not be in the manner of the Bill; it should be by large public works; the State should go in for great public enterprises and drain up the unemployment so that we would be able to see results for our money.  That was more or less the line taken by Deputy Baxter and other members of the Farmers' Party.  They did not go&mdash;of course, it was not necessary for them to go&mdash;to the point of saying in what manner the money should be secured for these purposes, whether by increased taxation or by borrowing.  If they had been specific, if they had come down to earth and suggested a course they might possibly have come up against obstacles.  If they had suggested increased taxation there would have been a negative cry from many quarters of <Col N="2247" /> the Dáil.  If they had said borrowing, they might perhaps have had to go a step further and say whether the borrowing was to be at home or abroad, and answer such crude questions as to what the rate of interest would be. When you come to borrowing you come down to a question of credit, a question of security, and this or any other country's credit is and will always be the honesty, the good sense, and the industry of its inhabitants.  If we go out to the markets of the world to borrow for the great public works, the great reproductive enterprises which Deputy Baxter vaguely indicated were desirable, the prospective lender abroad, with his few hundred or few thousand pounds, which he wishes to invest, will ask himself certain questions about this country: What kind of people are they? What is the situation there at the moment? Is the writ of the Government running freely in every square mile of its territory?  A country's credit is the honesty, the industry, and the good sense of its people.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Baxter or any other Deputy ever considered for a moment what the effect on this country's credit would be if we were able to announce that all the lethal weapons in the country were in the custody of the Government of the country; or what the effect on the country's credit would be and, through that, on unemployment, if we were able to say that there was no party in the State questioning or showing any sign of questioning, the ordinary principles that apply elsewhere, namely, that National policy is decided by the people in their collective wisdom, or folly.  It is because the answer to these questions which the prospective lender would put to himself are not as favourable as they might be that the question of borrowing for reproductive enterprises, or for any other kind of enterprises, is not as easy as it might be.  We cannot eat our cake and have it, and whether we eat our cake in riot, and wantonness, and destruction, in militaristic intrigues, or in any other way, then we will not have that credit and that security which alone will really and permanently cure unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>While one sympathises <Col N="2248" /> very largely with the views expressed by the Minister for Justice we could understand those views better if we were dealing for the first time with unemployment as arising out of the recent troubles.  While I agree with the Minister and with other Deputies that the recent troubles have aggravated the situation, they cannot be looked upon as its cause.  The Minister has said a good deal about the responsibilities of the people in the matter of security for loans, in the matter of the good name of the country, but I think that the Government of the country also has a good deal of responsibility in that connection, and I would like the Government to bear that responsibility in mind when they are introducing measures in the Dáil which, to some extent, affect the credit of the country.  Some of us who are commercial representatives have been laying stress upon these points, and we would like the Ministry also to consider them and say if in some of these measures, instead of, as some of us have alleged, injuring the credit of the country, something might not be done rather in the other direction, of inspiring confidence in the country by wise statesmanship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the interesting discussion that has taken place I was pleased to see that Deputies, like Deputy Johnson, did not altogether look upon the proposals very favourably.  No doubt it occurred to his mind that we should devote ourselves a little more to the cause of these troubles and somewhat less to the effect of them.  He went so far in that direction as to state that if more foresight had been used some years ago, we possibly would not have been face to face with the situation that now exists as regards unemployment. In that view I am not in agreement with him, as I will try to point out in a moment or two, but in developing the argument he asked the Minister to give some information of what was the possibility in the future of finding employment for some of the unemployed.  He asked what are the prospects of better trade and the likelihood of an increase in the wealth production of the country.  I was very glad to see the Deputy's mind turning in that direction.  He also wanted to know what were the probabilities of increasing <Col N="2249" /> our export trade in order that it might help to pay for the imports. He then went on to abuse our system of industry and commerce, I suppose on the basis, though he did not tell us so, that it is responsible to some extent for the present state of our export trade.  I would like to see the Deputy developing that particular point and showing us how it is responsible, but while he decried the system&mdash;and it is not the only occasion on which he has done so&mdash;he did not give us any idea of what he would put in its place.  Possibly that particular line of argument might be a little out of order in the present discussion.  He pertinently asked what are the chances of an improvement in our export trade.  That is a matter one would like to see a little more attention devoted to.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, in the leading line of our export trade, which is agricultural products, we have to meet in the market of England, which absorbs such a considerable portion of our exports, competitors from all parts of Europe, and from countries outside Europe, and I think it would be nothing new to the Deputy if I mention that in order to meet that competition successfully it is essential we should have low costs of production for our manufacturers and for our products.  I do not know that we have had much assistance from the Deputy, or from those who sit with him, in achieving that object, or that we have had any assistance at all from them towards lowering the cost of production, either by way of lowering wages or by increased production.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is not satisfied with the way I am dealing with these particular subjects it is open to him at any time to add anything I omitted.  There is an aspect of the question, when we come to consider unemployment from the point of view of cause and effect, which has not been touched upon and which I think ought to have been.  The Minister in his opening statement was rather inclined to look upon unemployment as he finds it at the moment as abnormal, and the situation as a temporary one not likely to recur in the future.  I am sorry to say that I cannot agree with him in that view.  We have, and I am sorry to say that it is not confined to this country, by reason of want of inquiry and other causes, allowed to grow up amongst us too many unskilled and too few skilled workers.  If I were to give you figures in connection with some of our industries, as to the reduction in the number of skilled workmen, extending over a period of twenty-five years, they would, I am satisfied, alarm every Deputy.  One of the serious causes of the present situation is that we are creating year by year far more unskilled labour than there is employment for, even in the best of times. Taking trade at its best, I am quite satisfied that it could not absorb the large amount of unskilled labour to be found in this country at the present time.  If we are to succeed with this problem, we must go further into it and dig more deeply than any Deputy has forecasted in the remarks made on this subject to-day.  It appears to me that our industrial system should be subjected to a thorough investigation. <Col N="2251" /> We are in this position to-day that while we find thousands&mdash;almost hundreds of thousands&mdash;of unskilled labourers unemployed, we have the skilled trades&mdash;even though they are in a depressed state&mdash;unable to supply the workmen required by those trades. There is something nationally wrong where you have in one department a large surplus of labour, for which there is no employment, and for which it is impossible, I am satisfied, to find employment, while in another department &mdash;even while trade is depressed&mdash;you have a scarcity of workmen.  That is a condition of things that should not exist, and it is to that particular aspect of this question that I invite the Ministry to devote more attention.  How that should be done will be a matter for the Ministry.  It is a matter that should have the serious consideration of the Government.  Whether that inquiry should be made by means of a commission&mdash;I think that that would be the most advisable way&mdash;or some other way, the sooner something is done in that direction, the sooner will something practical be done towards reducing unemployment.</P>

      <P>Owing to the manner in which the last two Deputies have spoken, I find it very difficult to believe that they are endeavouring to create a spirit of confidence.  In reply to some remarks made from the benches occupied by Deputy Good and by Deputy Hewat, the President, yesterday, stated that this country was bound to prosper and go forward.  I suggest to the Minister for Justice, in particular, that if this country is to prosper and go forward, as I believe it is bound to do, we must look forward and not backward.  What has happened in this country, arising out of our internal squabbles, has happened, and unfortunately cannot be undone.  If we look around the world to-day and picture the situation of nearly every country during the last five or ten years, we find that each one has had its own share of trouble.  Every country, large and small, has passed through a revolution, whether a social revolution, a political revolution or a bloody revolution. Those charged with the responsibility of guiding the people through <Col N="2252" /> troubled times&mdash;for instance, the French and other European Governments&mdash;when conducting war&mdash;did everything possible to bring the country out of the war, and they had the foresight at the same time, to make preparations for the coming of peace. That is what the Government of this country has not done.  They conducted a war&mdash;although I think it is only a mockery to call it a war: it was a more or less armed scramble&mdash;but they failed to look forward to the time when peace would come, and to make preparations for absorbing, on demobilisation, the people who had became soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When replying to a discussion on this subject some time ago, the President asked how was it possible to borrow when the National Loan then stood at 93?  I wonder if many Deputies have asked themselves what is the cause of the National Loan going down to 93? It may be&mdash;and to a certain extent is&mdash; due to the failure, or partial failure, of the Government to govern or to give an example of good government.  By that I mean that the Government was not, at a certain period, able to control its own forces.  I think that had a certain effect on the loan.  I have been told that the banks, or banking concerns, have had a share in seeing that the National Loan was brought down to the lowest possible figure.  I am informed on very reliable authority&mdash;in fact, by people who are suffering as a result of pressure from the banks&mdash; that some hostile action has been taken apparently after full and due consideration, by the banks, to inflict punishment on the people of this country who have dealings with banks&mdash;in a way they would not have done if the British Government was still here. There is another reason.  I have been told by people who know more about dealings on the Stock Exchange than I do, that it has had a certain effect on the National Loan.  In the ordinary course of events, people who are patriotic enough to put their savings into the National Loan, should be credited with doing so for the purpose of helping the country.  I believe, unfortunately, that amounts in connection with the National Loan have been dealt with and handed out and doled out by <Col N="2253" /> speculators.  When they throw that money on to the Exchange it brings down the National Loan.  For instance, if a prominent investor, like Deputy Good, took £5,000 or £10,000 worth of National Loan, or if a prominent member of the Government Party took £20,000 worth of National Loan, and then threw it on the Stock Exchange, the immediate result would be that it would show a lack of confidence by people associated with the Government and in that way it would have a very bad effect on the price at which the National Loan stood in the market.</P>
    <P>I have been associated with other Deputies in urging on the Government on various occasions the desirability of going ahead with the drainage of the Barrow.  I joined a deputation composed of Senators, Farmers, and Deputies on the Government Benches. We met representatives of the Ministries of Lands and Agriculture, Local Government and Public Health, Finance, and Industry and Commerce, on the 3rd of March, when an offer was made, on behalf of the tax-payers of the affected areas, to accept half the financial liability involved in carrying out that work.  Everyone, I hope, is convinced, as a result of the discussions on this particular scheme, that have taken place within the last 50 or 100 years, that it is a desirable scheme on which the people could be usefully employed, and that there would be a certain return to the State for the money expended.  We were told by the Ministries concerned, or the Executive Council&mdash;I am not sure which, as it is very hard to distinguish who is responsible&mdash;that the matter would be considered, and that the deputation would receive a reply within a month.  We have waited, but there is no reply.  We are told that the Minister for Finance is the strong man when it comes to considering what money should be expended on improvements of that kind.  I contend that it is not the Minister for Finance, but that the Executive Council are responsible for the failure to go ahead with this very desirable scheme.  What do we find in regard to the Barrow scheme?  We find that Messrs. Siemens', the German firm, have been <Col N="2254" /> invited to come across to Ireland and go down to the Barrow area.</P>

      <P>They have been on an excursion in that particular area.  It may be unofficial, but they certainly have gone down there on an excursion, and to make a report to somebody&mdash;to whom I do not know.  I want the Government to ask themselves is it better that they should spend £20,000, through the medium of this Dáil, in giving out State funds to people without getting any return, rather than to spend a couple of hundred thousand pounds on the Barrow area&mdash;a scheme which if the money were found by the Government, would supply work for every unemployed person in the five or six counties surrounding the affected area.  I say it is not the Minister for Finance is responsible, but that the Executive Council as a body must share the responsibility for not having the vision to deal with this matter, or for not giving time and consideration to these schemes before now.  I am sorry the Minister for Justice was out when I spoke first.  I am sorry he made the speech in the strain he did. One or two other Deputies or Ministers &mdash;I do not know which&mdash;made speeches in the same strain.  I believe at the present moment a speech of that kind, coming from a member of the Ministry, does more harm than good.  We are not, after all, as bad as we think we are.  We are bad enough.</P>

That has been done.  It cannot be undone.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow the Deputy to expatiate on that subject on another occasion.  I am in possession now.  I repeat that Deputy Davin's way of creating confidence is to talk nonsense.  That would be all right if it were confined to Deputy Davin but unfortunately a good many other people in this country hold exactly the same view and believe that the way to create confidence is to close your eyes to facts and continue talking nonsense. Somebody has said that a man would rather die than think.  There is a lot of truth in that.  The one thing we are afraid of in this country is to be honest with ourselves and face facts. The minute anybody brings unpleasant facts under our notice we get up and talk platitudes and nonsense about being forgetful of the past and looking forward to the future.  We are not to exercise the intelligence that Providence has given us and endeavour to draw lessons from the past in order to guide our actions in the future.  I agree with the Minister for Justice that the main cause&mdash;and every Deputy in the House should face the position honestly&mdash;of unproductiveness and of unemployment at the present moment is that there is no security. The oftener we state the truth the better. There will be no productiveness and no employment, and not only no productiveness and no employment, but nothing worth while socially, politically or economically until there is security&mdash;security for the ordinary citizen in this country just as exists in every other civilised country.  That is the fact.  You have got to face it.  You have got to remember when you are thinking of details such as unemployment&mdash;a most important detail I admit &mdash;when you are thinking about details <Col N="2256" /> like the unproductiveness of agriculture and the unproductiveness of the few industries we have in this country that underlying all productivity are the ordinary guarantees and safeguards that are found necessary in every civilised country.  We have got to establish them beyond yea and nay, we have got to establish them beyond challenge, before we can have any productivity or anything else worth while in the country.  That is the cold fact.  The oftener it is repeated the better.  No amount of platitude and no amount of futile optimism will alter that fact.  Deputy Johnson asked a question which is very relevant to the question under discussion; what are the prospects of agriculture for next year?  That is a question I have been asking myself for a long time.  It is, I suppose, my business to consider that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will understand my question better if I repeat it in this way: can he tell us not merely what are the prospects of agriculture next year but what is the present position regarding tillage in this country?  Is it increasing or decreasing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking of last year, tillage is decreasing.  Likewise, the numbers of live stock are decreasing. The production of wealth by the farmer is decreasing all round.  That is the position.  We can diagnose the cause, whatever about the remedies.  We cannot get the remedies unless we agree on the diagnosis.  That is an extremely important question and it is extremely serious that I should have to answer it in the way I have just answered it.  There is decreased production all round agriculturally.  That is the truth and we might as well face it. It is a really serious state of affairs, when you realise that the only industry we have worth talking about at the present moment in this country is agriculture. I wish the Dáil, which at times displays a tendency to treat agricultural matters as rather a good joke, would realise that.  Speaking comparatively, agriculture is the only industry worth talking about in the country and agricultural productivity is decreasing all round.  That is not a matter of <Col N="2257" /> doubt.  There is no occasion for a debate over that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are there. The facts are there.  They have often been put at the disposal of Deputies in the House.  Here, again, we come back to the point of view which Deputy Davin would like to get away from. When every party in this House agrees as to the diagnosis we will have got a long way towards solving it, because in this country the reason we do not solve problems is because we are afraid to face them.  I have stated the problem. It is there.  I have stated the reasons and the causes.  The cause is this: that the farmer is not producing at a profit.</P>
      <P>That is the position.  I should not say the farmer&mdash;neither the farmer nor the farm labourer is getting a fair chance in this country.  That is perfectly plain.  Another class in the country&mdash;the dealers, the people who make a profit by handling the goods, and their workmen, are getting too much as compared with what the producer&mdash;that is, the farmer and his labourer&mdash;are getting.  There is no doubt whatever that the producer, that is to say, the farmer and his labourer, are not getting their fair share of the wealth, and that the persons who are handling that wealth, namely, the business-man and his labourer, are getting too much of it.  I quoted figures which were published the other day, which showed that beyond yea or nay.  I will not quote them again.  I will not weary the Dáil again.  I do not think that any Deputy in this Dáil can deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the remedy?  The difficulty that I am in is this: that the only class in this country at the present time unorganised for business purposes in their own interest are the farming class; and the Government are really powerless unless they are dealing with an organised interest.  In the year 1924 the world has progressed beyond dealing with individuals.  You cannot do it.  The farmers of the country will have to organise themselves, and then the Government will co-operate with them.  We have taken the necessary <Col N="2258" /> steps; we are ready.  I am not thinking of politics for the moment.  I am thinking of something that is a great deal more important, and that is business. Let me give one instance which will illustrate what I am thinking about.  It is the story of a quantity of milk that left Kildare some time ago, and was distributed in Dublin.  It was 80 gallons.  It was put on rail at £3, that is 9d. per gallon; the much-abused Railway Company charged 1d. per gallon, that is 6s. 8d.  I verified all these figures.  That milk was distributed in Dublin at £10, that is to say, 2s. 6d. a gallon.  That is to say 9d. a gallon was paid to the producer, and it was sold at 1s. 9d. more.  Now, I do not blame the milk ring in Dublin.  I blame the farmers of Kildare.  This is a hard world, and we have to look after ourselves. And if the farmers for any reason refuse to organise themselves, cooperatively or otherwise, I do not see how we can do anything for them. This is only one example.  Take any other item that they produce and market, and the same thing applies to it&mdash;the very same.  There is a Trade Facilities Bill coming before the Dáil which will enable the Government, I hope, to co-operate with people who are worth co-operating with, and to put up a reasonable proposition in the way of giving them credits and helping them in other directions.  Let the farmers get alive and get busy.  Let them see if they have a scheme to put forward. We will help them.  But we cannot help people who will not help themselves. The farmers should take charge of this country, and the sooner the better.  They are entitled to take charge of this country.</P>

      <P>I should not say the farmers.  This is a democratic country. The farmers are 75 per cent. of the population.  The population of this country is 3,000,000; the farmers and the labourers are together, 2,000,000; and they should see that they get in the country what is due to them.  But they will not get it unless they organise themselves.  If they organise themselves the Government can co-operate <Col N="2259" /> with them.  If they do not, we cannot help them.  The productivity of the next year depends upon whether the producer looks after himself, looks after his business.  We can do nothing unless he does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I said.  I merely gave one example.  It can be extended over the whole field. When the Trade Facilities Bill is introduced the farmers will be in a position to co-operate with the Government. We shall have to co-operate with somebody, and unless somebody comes forward we can do nothing.  I need not go into the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Bill or the Butter Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Dáil that we are discussing the second stage of the Unemployment Insurance Bill, and I might perhaps be permitted to run through a few of the points raised by way of criticism, before coming to some of the more general details.  Deputy Corish raised a point with regard to the Exchanges, and alleged a certain amount of inefficiency on the part of certain men to discharge the work assigned to them. He rather attributed that to the intricacy of the Acts they have to administer and he pleaded that this Bill should have been simplified and might even still be simplified.  As regards all that, I have simply to apologise.  There is no other way out of the situation. When you attempt to modify for temporary convenience, permanent legislation it has to be done by legislation by reference to the permanent Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Acts so far have been intricate and this Bill does not simplify them to any great extent but it is inevitable in the circumstances that there has to be legislation by reference.  If definite cases of mishandling of work are given to me then the Department will inquire into them and see if the defects can be removed.  Deputy Corish also seemed to be in a difficulty with regard to people who are entitled to benefit under this Bill and I may have misled him by stressing the date, the 8th of November, 1920.  I said that all <Col N="2260" /> contributions to a man's credit prior to the 8th November, 1920, are going to be revived.  Now that is the farthest back date I get to, but, of course, though we start from there we do not end there.  The contributions on a man's card since the 8th November, 1920, of course count and will of course be revived.  If I understood Deputy Corish aright he seemed to complain that people who had never had any stamps to their credit are not getting benefit under this Bill.  If that is his complaint I cannot answer it.  I simply say that those are the facts, that we do not seek to give benefit to people who were not at any time since 1920 in an insurable occupation. This is an Unemployment Insurance Bill limited to persons in insurable occupations and we do not deal with people outside that class.  He referred to civilians employed in barracks and alleged hardships as far as they were concerned.  Now if there were civilians employed in barracks who previous to that employment had been in an insurable occupation then stamps should have been affixed by the military authorities; and if there is any hardship arising from negligence in that respect or from inadvertence to that fact, there is still a remedy.  The second speaker, Deputy Morrissey, joined with Deputy Corish in complaining that the agricultural labourer was not included in this Bill and some other classes of persons were also spoken of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the disqualification of workers, not necessarily agricultural workers, but workers disqualified because they lived in an agricultural district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to that all I can say is that there is no special disqualification of people on the ground that they live in an agricultural district.  But if that remark is intended to convey that certain people are deemed to be agricultural labourers because they have not been in an insurable occupation then I fail to get the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I intended to make was that people although they had stamps to their <Col N="2261" /> credit and were entitled to unemployment insurance, when it was discovered that they were living in agricultural districts they were disqualified.  There were several cases of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I may make a general statement on that.  Deputy Johnson raised a point after I made a preliminary statement and I was asked what was the insurable population in the country and I gave certain figures. I said that the figures were vague and I am not prepared even yet to give the figures but possibly this general statement will suit his purpose.  The people who are entitled under this Bill will be all insurable persons who become unemployed. That is to say, all persons in insurable occupation, and if there are people about whom Deputy Morrissey spoke who should receive benefit having paid their contribution the benefit will go to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

      <P>Any person who came into an insurable occupation, say in 1921, would have stamps to his credit.  These stamps may have been cancelled, but they will now be revived. Deputy Lyons raised certain points which I do not intend to deal with at this stage, as they are all Committee points which can be met by means of amendment.  He did raise the question of the Army men but I think he showed in the course of his speech that he had not adverted fully to section 4 of the Bill.  That section indicates that contributions are to be paid by the Minister for Defence to the credit of such people as are insurable so as to ensure that these people have to their credit twenty-four contributions in respect of each insurance year during which or in part of which the person is serving.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter.  If a person has stamps, the stamps will be revived.  Now, with regard to internees whose plight is described by Deputy Lyons&mdash;they may cover a variety of persons.  If they were people who had been in insurable occupations, and had stamps to their credit, the stamps are going to be revived, but if not they do not come under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that that it was not really the fault of the applicant that he had not stamps.  He was too young to have them when arrested, and when demobilised from the Army he was old enough to work, but there was no work for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You might as well point out that it was not the fault of another type of person that he became an agricultural labourer, and that he was deprived of the benefit of the Bill.  I can only repeat that people with stamps to their credit on the 8th November, 1920, and in any period since, are going to have a revival of benefit, a revival of stamps, and consequently they will draw their <Col N="2263" /> contributions and benefits.  Deputy Murphy, I think, alluded to the gaps in the system.  There are gaps, and these are necessary if the limited amount of money at the disposal of the fund is to be spread over the people whom it is intended to benefit.  The gaps are necessary in the system, but an arrangement has been made that the longest period of benefit comes into the winter months.  That is the only thing we could do.  There have to be gaps on account of the absence of sufficient money to allow benefit to run continuously over the period.  Deputy Thrift has raised the point with regard to the money voted.  I said that the scheme under the Bill would cost £600,000, but that if no new Bill were introduced the drain on the State funds under the previous Act would be £400,000.  Consequently I estimated the additional cost of this Bill at about £200,000.  Deputy Thrift said that the Vote only shows an amount of £200,000. That is correct.  That £200,000 represents the State amount of the contribution which is roughly one-third; it is less than one-third, but the £200,000 would cover the State contribution to the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Bill then cost the country £400,000 more than the amount allotted in the current estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear on the estimate position.  I have not considered that.  The expenditure under the present Bill is £200,000. The cost to the Exchequer by way of advance is going to be £600,000.  The State contribution to that which is now brought forward is about £200,000. The extra money to be spent under this Bill beyond what would have been spent under the Act of 1923, is £200,000.  Deputy Baxter spoke, and was joined by certain Farmer Deputies in his plea, that the urgency of this problem had not been recognised a little ahead and that with a certain amount of vision the problem could be met and solved.  I cannot agree with that.  The urgency of the situation is certainly adverted to now, and I am not at all sure that in twelve months time this question of unemployment is <Col N="2264" /> going to be solved.  I do not think that any recognition of the urgency or any amount of vision is going to get people into occupations where there is not enough work at the moment to go round.  Everything will be done to stimulate industry and to try to provide work but even taking this plan and dealing with this matter as an urgent one I have no complete confidence that next year there will not be further drawings on the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  The question of demoralisation was raised first by Deputy Baxter.  It is interesting to turn to Item No. 7 on the Order Paper for to-day which is: &ldquo;Local Government (Rates on Agricultural Land) Bill, 1924, Second Stage.&rdquo;  Relief for farmers!  Demoralisation!  The Farmers party will no doubt throw out Item No. 7. when it comes to be voted upon.</P>
      <P>It is the same type of demoralisation that accrues from that relief as will accrue from paying ahead to unemployed benefit in lieu of contribution which will afterwards be collected from them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter said, what I expected to hear from a great many people, that if the £200,000 was spent by way of a relief scheme the money would be well and wisely expended and there would be some return and some employment given.  Let us make a comparison between money expended on relief schemes and money called for under this Bill.  That £200,000, if expended on relief works, would employ 10,000 men for a period not beyond seven weeks.  This money is going to keep alive, at any rate, to put it no further 82,000 men and for a period much longer than the seven weeks' employment that might be given by the application of this £200,000 to public utility schemes.  Deputy <Col N="2265" /> D'Alton stressed the point I wished to have stressed here very definitely, that this is only one side of the picture.  There is another approach to this problem, but this is an immediate approach.  Deputy D'Alton spoke of measures to be introduced shortly in the hope of providing employment. &ldquo;Measures&rdquo; is going beyond what I said.  I mentioned one Bill on which we rely considerably, that is the Trades Facility Bill, or Loans Guarantee Bill, whichever it may be called.  There are other matters ahead that do not require legislation which we rely upon for stimulation of industry, but as a measure the Trades Facility Act is to be introduced and I stress that as the other approach to the question of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin has exhorted us to look forward and not backwards, and if I may follow him a little away from the Bill into the political matters he raised, I wonder does he insist that this glance in retrospect is not of some value as teaching us how to attack problems in the future.  I think, while it would be wise to forgive, it would be folly to forget recent happenings, and not to learn a lesson from the past. Deputy Davin described what happened recently as an armed scramble. I follow that logically in this way.  In an armed scramble the combatants are merely rioters, and should not get political treatment.  Political treatment should not be asked for them.  I wonder does Deputy Davin repent of anything he said previously on the treatment of these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I see Deputy Davin put it to me that what he has said would show repentance, and I leave it at that.  He raised another question often spoken of here.  Peace must have been seen on the horizon, and the problem of absorbing the unemployed should be considered.  The use of these phrases seems to suggest that a majority of those who went into the Army in the last year and a half were taken from employment; that is notoriously not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no employment at all for <Col N="2266" /> a great many who went into the Army. What happened was that a great many people previously unemployed went into the Army, and were returned to their previous state of unemployment when demobilised, so that it was not that so much work was lost by men going into the Army, but that they have reverted to their old position of unemployment; and it is to be taken into consideration when tackling the whole problem that for years past there has not been sufficient work in this country for those able and willing to work.</P>
    <P>The Barrow scheme has been raised by Deputy Davin and some others, and apparently I should have made application to the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence to prevent any Germans from being sent to the banks of the Barrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

      <P>The Germans have gone to the Barrow on an excursion. They have been seen there and the deduction is that I am responsible for getting the Germans to come forward and investigate the Barrow with a view to taking up the drainage works there.  The German spy mania was never very widespread in this country from 1914 to 1918, and I do not see why we should start such a mania here now.  I dislike very much to hear this Barrow scheme, which is a very ill-omened scheme, mentioned.  I came in contact with it departmentally about two months ago, and when reading information on it I found that the scheme when first mooted, was stopped by the outbreak of war.  The war was the Napoleonic war.  It was then revived and had approached the point where it looked as if something was going to be done.  Then the 1914 war broke out, and now that we are actually nearing again an approach to the Barrow scheme, getting within distance of having plans prepared to deal with that scheme, it seems to me a very ominous thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson dealt with the question in a very serious way.  His first remark was that if the £200,000 had been spent by way of guarantee of interest and sinking fund on some stimulus <Col N="2267" /> to industry, the money would have been properly spent and spent in a way that would be calculated to give considerable employment.  I cannot deal with what might have been done in the past, but I draw a certain amount of comfort from Deputy Johnson's remarks because they seem to me to imply that he will welcome the Loans Guarantee Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the Deputy's friendliness on this matter.  The Bill is to be introduced next week, and it is a thing on which I definitely build for the future.  We will have an Advisory Committee set up to consider all the schemes that may come along.  If these schemes are passed as suitable, then there is provision made for guaranteeing interest.  There are certain conditions attached to that. That, at any rate, is a better retort to this Bill than saying that £200,000 might have been spent on relief work of an extravagant type and of a more or less unproductive character.  That Bill is going to be introduced, and on that Bill I rely considerably.  A further criticism of Deputy Johnson's was that the Bill was not an Insurance Bill of the general type, and that it did not change the social structure.  It does not attempt to do that.  The whole organisation of society may have to be changed.  That may be necessary, and it may be inevitable, but I cannot undertake to express an opinion on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this Bill, I say it is hardly fair to criticise schemes for not reaching to a standard which they never set out to achieve.  This scheme never set out to change the social structure. It is a temporary measure limited in type and in application, and has no bearing whatsoever on the general framework of society.  Deputy Johnson also had his doubts that schemes of different types might have been tackled, and tackled with some benefit to the unemployed previous to this.  I found myself for two months in the position of being asked to make bricks without even being given the straw.  If I may use a metaphor used in another place, I am given silk hats <Col N="2268" /> and I am asked to produce rabbits from them.  Schemes, some foolish and some well thought out, and some very ragged have been put before me.  To get back to the metaphor, I have had in the last two months a succession of glittering tall hats and some very dingy bowlers put before me, and I am asked to act the part of a conjurer and produce rabbits. That is not the way to tackle this question.  The way that I propose to tackle it is with the Loans Guarantee Bill or the Trades Facilities Bill. Under this Bill we will have an Advisory Committee set up; we can have schemes examined outside the Department altogether and we can then see what can be done.  I am personally not so confident that I can solely shoulder responsibility for all the work that is entailed.  I feel that I will be constrained to turn down schemes that are put before me without giving any good reason and to refuse any help that may be given to me in the way of schemes or in the way of making an investigation of industry in the way Deputy Good spoke of.  These schemes are, however, for the future. I want to stress again that this is a very small attempt to tackle a very difficult problem.  There is an urgent problem here and now.  There are certain people who are on the verge of shipwreck.  This is the only seaworthy type of life-boat that I can send out to their assistance.  It does not do me or them any good for people at this moment to insist that I should either have kept the storm away, or should have kept the boat from drifting near the rocks.  That is not practical politics at the moment.  The point is that there are certain people to be relieved.  This Bill is an immediate approach to the relief of these people, and I trust that any money advanced under this scheme will not impede the advance of further money for reproductive schemes.  This is not in substitution of anything more useful than what it is in itself.</P>

      <P>I moved the adjournment last evening and was then speaking in reply to Deputy Johnson's amendment.  I had said pretty nearly all I wished to say on the matter, and I have had no particular inspiration over night.  I was not accepting the amendment, the effect of which would be to leave absolutely to the discretion of members of the forces whether or not they should join political or secret societies.  We think that political activities on the part of members of a State organisation, whose special duty it is to enforce and uphold the law equally and impartially amongst all citizens, is objectionable. With regard to secret societies, the gist and substance of my objection is that State employees should enter into societies or combinations having commitments unknown to the people at large and commitments which, for all the people at large may know to the contrary, cut definitely across their line of duty and their line of allegiance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The declaration embodied in the Bill may be open to objection.  I think it is one that should convey clearly to the mind of any recruit what he is expected to avoid and what he is expected, in honour to his employers, namely the people, collectively, to keep away from.  Entering a force of that kind, to an extent he is expected to give up some fraction of that complete liberty of action which attaches to the ordinary rank and file citizen of the country.  In view of the special nature of his duties, and the necessity for <Col N="2270" /> absolute impartiality between citizen and citizen in the discharge of those duties, he is expected to avoid active participation in politics, and to completely avoid membership of any secret organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in general agreement with the Minister when he states that he is not prepared to agree to leave it to the discretion of the individual who happens to be in the police force, whether or not he should join a political society or a secret organisation. I am not prepared, however to go so far as the Minister when he states that he would not agree to this proposal in the case of any State servants.  I do draw a distinction between the civil servant and the person who may be employed by the State in the capacity of a policeman, or who may be in the Army.  We have heard it proclaimed from the house-tops in the recent past, that the Army and the police are the servants of the people. I believe they cannot be that so long as they are allowed to join a secret organisation or a political society that has, undoubtedly, the object of dictating to the representatives of the people, who are responsible to the people, what their ideas should be and what their attitude should be on matters of public policy.</P>
      <P>We have had many experiences during the British regime and in our own time that should compel us now to insist upon this is regard to the police and the military forces.  It was the case during the British regime, although it may not be admitted, that the officers of the R.I.C. and of the British Army were associated with political societies and perhaps with secret societies.  I agree it is very hard to define what a secret society is. Some people say that societies which might be regarded by myself, for instance, as secret, are merely benevolent and charitable institutions.  I say that if Army officers who serve, or are supposed to serve, a Government, are allowed to join a political society or secret organisation, it is bad for the Government and the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We remember the case of the Curragh mutiny.  In my opinion, the <Col N="2271" /> mutiny was the outcome of the existence of political and secret societies that were open to officers of the British Army at the time.  We remember the case of D.I. Nixon in Belfast, where he came into conflict with the Northern Government, because he was allowed to go into a political or secret society and make speeches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am citing the case in order to show why it is so essential that these things should not be tolerated.  Let us come to our own position.  We all know of the things that happened here recently.  It is unnecessary for me to go into them. They are things which, in my opinion, were due to the fact that policemen, and military officers particularly, were allowed to join political societies. These are lessons why we should endeavour to prevent such happenings in the future.  If there is one thing more than another that I can see eye to eye upon with the Minister, it is his genuine desire to maintain discipline in the forces over which he has control. I believe he is quite justified in insisting upon this as a condition of service, and I hope that, not alone will he have it in the Bill, but that he will take every precaution to put it into operation, even if it means the dismissal of people who may ignore it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and Deputy Davin have sadly misconceived the intention of this amendment.  This is not to encourage, or assent to the members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police being members of a political or secret society.  It is that that object will not be achieved by inserting this phrase in the declaration.  Put it in your Bill.  You have not got it in your Bill.  You make it a declaration applicable to policemen and soldiers.  We have had in the newspapers during the last two or three days copies of an oath, of a new declaration, to be taken by persons who have been appointed to office in the State and who above all should be prevented from being members of secret societies of any kind, and who are much more liable to be <Col N="2272" /> members of secret societies than others. They have not been asked to include phrases like this in their oath or declaration. You have not asked your new judges to state that they do not or will not belong to a secret or political society.  Surely they, of all people, ought be prevented, if they can be prevented from joining any such secret society.  But you refrain from asking them to make a declaration of this kind, probably because you know it is useless.  Do you know what the practice has been?  If one could think that one-twentieth part of the rumours or stories that are going about had any foundation whatever, and I do not believe they have, one would think that it was more than ever necessary to impose such an obligation upon such persons. I say that the putting into this Bill a general declaration is unnecessary and will not achieve the object sought for.  It is simply a reflection in what might be a general, formal, solemn declaration of a present political fear.  It is a reflex of something evanescent and political, affecting the moment, and to put that in a declaration of this kind seems to me to be lowering the value, whatever, value there may be in it, of the declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bringing a political atmosphere into the question.  It is assuming that you cannot achieve the end of faithful service and of true service and obedience without asking a formal declaration against a particular kind of undesirable practice.  Now, there are many other undesirable practices that are expected to be refrained from by members of the police force.  There are such things as drinking in a public house on duty, and many other things that one need not elaborate, or enumerate. You do not ask that to be put into a declaration.  You make general regulations for the conduct of your Force and you expect the members to abide by them and to have a general sense of discipline and <i>esprit de corps.</i>  I say that is the way to prevent the kind of conduct that you want in this amendment to avoid.  You are singling out this kind of public servant because of the fear that things might happen which are undesirable. You are trying to compel recruits, or <Col N="2273" /> pressing your officers, to tack on to a general declaration, this kind of statement that they do not and will not belong to a political or secret society.  I said yesterday that membership of a secret society is in fact an offence, a legal offence.  I suppose it is a long time since that law was enforced, but I suggest that there is more in my objection than the Minister would give credit for when I state the fact that organisations, though not obviously and clearly political, may become gradually, perhaps by deliberation or perhaps by growth, political or secret. What you will do to, shall I say, the more acutely conscientious people is to create in their minds doubts and hesitations as to whether the particular organisation they belong to is one thing or the other.  That will not be good for the general bearing and conduct of the policeman.  I think that a declaration in these general terms ought to suffice and would be far more effective than the taking of what is an obvious momentary and temporary political fear into account to the extent that you do, and that by this means you are lowering the value of the declaration.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the declaration is good, that secret societies are bad, and as the late Minister for Defence said, they served their purpose and were useful for a time.  At the moment I think secret organisations are very bad, but I do not know why the D.M.P. have been singled out and why a declaration is required from a candidate for the D.M.P. that he will not belong to a secret society.  Does the Minister intend to extend that to any other branch of the public service?  I would like to have a list of societies which are considered by the Government to be secret societies, and I would like to know how many of them are included in this declaration that the D.M.P. have to sign. There are secret societies and other secret societies.  There are societies of which everybody knows and which are not intended to be included in that declaration, I think, and I should like to know how many secret societies, or so-called secret societies, this declaration will apply to.  Is it the intention also to extend that declaration to other <Col N="2274" /> branches, whether in the case of people joining them or those who are already there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure as to what the Deputy means.  This declaration is similar to the declaration taken by the Gárda Síochána under the Act which at present regulates them; a somewhat similar declaration is taken by the District Justices and I now propose to extend it to members of the Metropolitan Police.  The declaration is drafted to include all political societies and all or any secret societies.  The last two and a half lines read: &ldquo;I will not while I hold the said office join, belong or subscribe to any political society whatsoever or to any secret society whatsoever.&rdquo;  With regard to what Deputy Johnson has said, there is, I think, a difference of view that is not likely to be met or bridged by further discussion.  He thinks it is of no value to get this declaration, or promise, from a recruit; that there is no value in it at all; that it is not right; that it is unwise.  We, on the other hand, attach such importance to the condition that we think it is something that we are entitled to ask from any and every person joining the force, and every person at present a member of the force; that he will not take an active partisan part in politics, and that he will not enter into commitments unknown to the people at large which might possibly affect the impartial discharge of his duties as a member of the force; which might cut across his duties and cut across his allegiance.  It is not a new condition; it is not something devised <i>ad hoc</i> or in any panic. It is a condition which has attached to police forces in the past, and&mdash;to put it simply at its lowest&mdash;which we see no sufficient reason for departing from, and&mdash;putting it on the positive side&mdash; which we see plenty of reason for adhering to.</P>

I believe that it should be applied to all persons, such as judges, police and military, who are charged with the administration of the law.  They should be free from all these political and other influences which would prejudice them in coming to a fair decision or in carrying out their duties in executing the law.

      <P>First of all, I had better disclaim, very emphatically, the suggestion of the Deputy that I am in control of the judiciary.  I am not in that fortunate position.  If there are future appointments to be made we will consider the Deputy's suggestion that a declaration of this kind should be exacted from judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Executive Council as a whole did not consider it necessary to exact any such declaration, and I am not inclined to think that they would consider it necessary in the future, but the judges are now appointed and they are in a position of aloofness from and independence of the Executive. Deputy McGarry talked about the inherited staff.  We are dealing now with the Dublin Metropolitan Police, and if this Bill becomes law every member of that organisation will take this declaration, and every member of the Gárda Síochána will take <Col N="2276" /> the declaration embodied in the Gárda Síochána Bill.  Further than that I am not prepared to go.  We are dealing with what are known as the disciplined forces of the State, and one is entitled to expect from them compliance with conditions which are not applied to, and which might be called over-exacting, and tending to tyranny if expected from the ordinary Civil Servants, but every member of the two police organisations will take the declaration from the highest officer to the most junior constable.</P>

      <P>On the expectation that the previous amendment would be lost, I have put down this amendment, with the object of making it as clear as it is possible to make it, what is meant by the term &ldquo;secret society.&rdquo; I have argued that it may be held by every individual to have a different meaning, and in such a case it is well to have a definition, and this proposed <Col N="2277" /> addition to the schedule is a definition extracted from the present law.  It is a law which goes back to 1823 but under which, as late as 1891, certain prosecutions have taken place.  Any person becoming a member of any such society as is defined here is deemed to be a member of an unlawful combination and confederacy, and liable to be fined £20 or imprisonment for three months, one half of the penalty to go to the informer.  I do not know when or whether there is likely to be any further prosecutions under this Act, but the definition seems to be fairly comprehensive, and would indicate what is meant by the declarant when he says that he will not be a member of a secret society.  If the Minister can suggest any better and more comprehensive definition that would meet his purpose better I am quite sure that the Dáil would be glad to consider it.  In the absence of any other definition, I submit this definition as one which meets the case.  Presumably the Dáil thinks that there ought to be an imposition on a member of the D.M.P. that he should not be a member of a secret society, and presumably also the Dáil has some idea of what is meant by that term.  But you may have one idea, and I may have another, and that variation may apply to the members of the force who may have a difference of view as to what is meant by the declaration they are taking.  This amendment is an attempt to make clear what is meant.  I therefore move it. Perhaps the Minister would rather I read it?</P>

      <P>I have read it several times.  When I read it first my feelings were that if it were passed and added to the declaration as it stands, it might be a useful test of the wind of the new recruit if he were made to recite it without drawing breath.  I think that it is unnecessary and unwise to attempt to set out in the declaration a definition of what is a secret society.  First of all, I think and hope that the average member of the D.M.P. would have intelligence enough to know whether and when he was a member of a secret society.  If he had not I would consider him unsuitable for the force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If we, for a moment, and only for a moment, take the Deputy's amendment seriously, he seems to consider that the essential thing is that one member of a society shall know who the other members are, but that it is not at all necessary that the people at large who are, after all, the employers of the members of this force, should know who any of them are.  There are some societies, I believe, or assume, of which every member knows every other member, but they are none the less secret societies, in the sense that their existence, their membership, their objects and proceedings are not known to the general public, and there are solemn undertakings of secrecy and confidence with regard to their proceedings.  Therefore, I am not inclined to agree with this amendment, although the Deputy points out it is taken from an Act of 1823.  I am not inclined to agree that this definition, if we were to take it seriously, and consider it is an addition to the declaration of the Bill, is exhaustive or meets the case.  We have travelled a long way since 1823.  We may be supposed to be wiser than the legislators of that time, but I think the important factor is not so much that one member of the society should know the other members, but that the public should know them all and should know what their objects are.  Any society which has a condition of absolute confidence and secrecy with regard to its doings and programme would fulfil my conception, at any rate, of a secret society.  I consider it unwise to add this attempt at a definition to the declaration.  As I say, the ordinary recruit, or ordinary member of the force, taking this declaration will know perfectly well what he is in honour and duty precluded from by reason of that fact.  I would have a very poor opinion of the intelligence of a member who would need the assistance of this or any other attempt at definition to inform him when he strayed into a secret society.  I am satisfied with the declaration as it stands, both as to the necessity for it <Col N="2279" /> and as to the sufficiency of it.  I think it will meet the case.  I think that seven or eight or nine men out of ten taking that declaration will keep it, or if a man has a conscientious objection to taking it, he will not take it.  It is, at least, some kind of check and some kind of guarantee&mdash;the only one you can devise&mdash;that members of the disciplined organisations of the State will not go behind the backs of the people and intrigue and conspire, in one way or other, in a manner foreign to, if not in conflict with, their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister's attempt at explanation of what is meant and what will be understood by nine men out of ten is sufficient justification for an attempt at a definition.  I ask if the Minister's definition is going to be the definition, let it be understood.  The point is that this is an attempt to guard against something.  The public does not know&mdash;not even the officials in the Department of Justice&mdash;the members of a dozen innocent, ordinary law-abiding societies that one might name at the moment.  Take the Foresters' organisation or any of the co-operative societies. Except they are registered&mdash; and even notwithstanding registration &mdash;the public has no right to get hold of the names of the members.  That particular test that the Minister applies is not covered.  Then, as to this question of confidence, any group of men may enter into confidential relations about some very innocent matter&mdash;not necessarily a combination against the State or against discipline or anything else like that.  Is that to be barred? The Minister's own explanation of his position justifies the necessity for either a definition or an abandonment of this whole idea.  Let us face the issue without any hesitation.  What is intended, no doubt, is to prevent members being inveigled, after joining the society, into an organisation which is disruptive.  If there is any propaganda with the object of inducing such persons to join a society, do you think that that propaganda is going to be diminished or subdued or guarded against by that sort of declaration?  If a declaration is to be of any use at all, it will have to be a declaration with a <Col N="2280" /> definition.  I suggest that, though this proposed definition does not use the word &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; or &ldquo;oath&rdquo; or anything of the kind, it meets the case better than any other definition that has yet been submitted to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It would impose an excessive burthen upon a considerable number of exporters, and that the method of estimating, while it might not seem heavy per dozen eggs, will not be dealt with in that light by exporters. It will be rather dealt with as one of the ordinary charges and expenses of the trade, and will be excessive. As an instance, I take one trader who may export about one hundred cases per week.  It will mean a charge, above his ordinary outgoings, of £1 per week.  The position of that trader is comparatively small.  I do not know what basis there is for this charge, but I think it well to raise the matter now, and hear from the Minister some particulars regarding the possible expenses, and the backs that ought to bear them.</P>

The total cost of this scheme, including the amount at present spent on the egg services, will be something like £19,000.  A considerable amount of that is being spent now, so that when the £6,000 or £7,000 that will be received as a result of this, is taken into account, the extra charge on the <Col N="2282" /> State will be a very small one.  I do not think it is felt by the Minister for Lands and Agriculture that this charge is one that will be unduly burthensome or one which will militate against the success of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The only fee is 1d. per thirty dozen.  Probably the most illuminating way of examining the question would be to take an average case.  There are eight hundred exporters in the country.  The total trade is about £4,000,000.  That is a rather rough and ready calculation, but it will give a picture of the situation.  The average will be about £5,000 per trader, and on that turnover the cost would be between £8 and £10.  I think if the figure £10 errs at all, it errs on the big side.  The fee is 1d. on every £2.  It is hard to take an average case, as you do not get average cases in real life.  But, taking a man whose turnover is £5,000 yearly, it is not too much to ask him to pay between £8 and £10. The fee is small, and I have consulted six or seven trade organisations, and they have not made any trouble.  I venture this particular prediction, that the fee is not more than one-third per cent. of the profits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2283" /> When you look at the Third Interim Report of the Commission on Agriculture and see that it is dated the 22nd of May, 1923&mdash;more than twelve months ago&mdash;and that the Report advised that such a Bill as this should be introduced, one begins to wonder why we should wait until the 1st of August, 1925, for this Bill to become operative.</P>
    <P>Now that is more than two years from the date on which this Report was furnished to the Ministry of Agriculture. On the Second Reading I regretted that this Bill was not introduced earlier.  But certainly, if the Bill is to stand over and not become law until the 1st August, 1925, and when we see in addition that two months after that is to be given for compliance with the regulations contained in the Bill, we begin to wonder how long it will be before the effects of this measure will become operative at all.  The real purpose of the Bill is to raise the standard of our produce and to win us back a good name for our produce.  Now, that will not come to us on the 1st day of August, 1925, or in two months after August, 1925.  It will only come to us when we shall have put our produce on the market for a certain period consistently up to a certain standard.  That is the only way that we shall be able to win back our good name.  It seems to me that it is too long to wait until the end of 1925.  We are half way through 1924 now.  I know the Minister will argue that the trade is so badly organised that it would be unfair and unjust to the trade&mdash;perhaps he will say that it should be impossible for the trade to be ready by January or March to meet the situation that the law would have created.  I suggest to the Minister that if you gave these people five years they would wait for four years and ten months, and I suggest that they would be just as well prepared by the 1st January, 1925, to meet the situation that will be created by what will then be an Act, as they would be by the 1st day of August.  When you take into account that this Report was furnished in May, 1923, and that you wait almost three years before this Bill becomes law, and when you consider the other reports of the Agricultural Commission, you do not know <Col N="2284" /> when you shall see them put into operation. I hope the Minister will agree with me that it is right that this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  The section says that the Act shall come into operation on such day not later than the 1st day of August, 1925, as the Minister shall by order appoint.  I have no doubt that it would do something to meet Deputy Baxter if the Minister could give us an assurance that though the Bill says the 1st August, 1925, he really means to appoint some date very much earlier than that.  One would like to see the Bill actually operating in time to take advantage of next spring traffic in eggs, but if, as the Deputy has suggested, the operation of the Bill is to be postponed until after the next spring trade, it practically will be of very little value until 1926.  Now, the trade has had a fairly considerable warning.  They were very well aware more than one year ago of what was reported by the Agricultural Commission, and they have known what was in the minds of people in the Northern-portion of this country.  The matter of the grading and licensing and exporting of eggs has been in the air for at least a year, and the trade has had quite sufficient warnings, and I have not had the slightest doubt that they have been preparing for the operation of some scheme of checking and licensing and grading.  And on that account I think it would be a pity to let it go forth that the date will be postponed as late as the 1st August.  I should like a very much earlier date to be put in, although I can see possible reasons for objection to the 1st of January, inasmuch as we are in June now, and if we say not later than the 1st January it may not give sufficient time. But if the Minister would agree to an earlier date than August, to a date, say, between January and August, and if he would give an assurance that it is the intention of his Ministry to make an order notifying a date which will be in time for next spring export trade that will probably satisfy Deputy Baxter and meet the requirements of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with both the <Col N="2285" /> Deputies as to the necessity of bringing this Bill into practical effect at the earliest possible date, and it will be the aim of the Department to bring this Bill into effect on the earliest date possible, having regard to the state of the trade and having regard to the fact that the trade must get a fair time to comply with the necessary conditions. I would point out that what is really important is to have the Bill in operation by August.  It is not so important to have it in operation for the first four months of the year.  There is a big supply of eggs at that time, that is a reason why the eggs are fresh and they are sold immediately.  Later on in the months of August, September, October, November and December prices are fluctuating, and it is when you have a small supply of eggs that all the weaknesses in the trade begin to show themselves.  So that the fact is, if you were to pick out a date the important date before which the Bill must be in operation is the autumn.</P>
      <P>Now, this Bill may be a year too late, may be two, three, four or five years too late.  But that does not alter the point.  There is no use in saying that if the trade got five years they would not begin to prepare for four years and ten months.  The question is: Is the period of two months sufficient, the two months which Deputy Baxter says they would be preparing?  The fact is that I am advised by the experts in this matter, and by everybody else whom I had consulted, that it will take very nearly the time that we propose with the best will in the world to enable the trade to adapt themselves to the rather stringent regulations and exacting requirements of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the North they know a great deal about the egg trade.  The egg trade is very important to the North and a year is the term in the Northern Bill, but they extended it to a year and a half.  That period was believed necessary.  I could not promise that the trade would be in a position in a shorter time than I have mentioned to comply with the requirements of this Bill, or that it would be fair to ask them.  That is the position <Col N="2286" /> I am in, that is the advice I have got, and that is what I believe, having regard to my investigations into the question and to my consultation not only with my officials, but with the trade itself.  In fact the trade want a longer period, but that is the period we have inserted.  This Bill will come into operation from the day it is passed in reality.  If I am right in saying that it will take the trade all the time to prepare, it will be our duty to see that they are preparing, that they are putting in the proper equipment, and taking the steps to give the necessary instruction.  It will be our duty to help them to train the people who pack their eggs and to show them how to grade. All that will day by day improve the quality of the Irish eggs in the English market.  This Bill will be in operation from the day it passes; and strictly speaking, it is not correct to say that its effects will not be felt until October, 1925.  It will be in operation from the day it passes.  I would suggest to the Deputies that they would not press me to insert the amendment of Deputy Baxter.  We have here, as Deputy Johnson has pointed out, &ldquo;not later than the first day of August, 1925.&rdquo;  All I can say is that in view of the advice I have got, I could not shorten that period.  I repeat that it will be the aim of the Department of Agriculture to see that the trade will set about preparing for the operation of this Bill immediately, and as quickly as possible, and that if the sequence of events shows that the Bill can be brought into operation at an earlier date, it is open to us to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that in my view the argument which the Minister has used regarding next year's trade re-inforces my view that the important consideration should be to take advantage of next spring.  We all know as a matter of fact that it is not in spring time that eggs are risky, but if you start off during that period of three months, when nothing but fresh eggs are going across the <Col N="2287" /> water and when people are inclined to send them as quickly as possible for fear of falling prices, that is the time to get a reputation, and if you can associate in the mind of the trade in England that eggs coming from Ireland graded and with certain brands on the packet are fresh, as they will be at that time, they will know that the grading and packing are a sort of guarantee of future freshness.  There will then be no fear that in June, July, August or September they will be coming on to stale eggs.  You will have made a reputation and given the confidence that is required during the time that fresh eggs are going forward. I suggest that that is the time to get the provisions of the Bill into practical working.  I remind the Minister that it is very largely in his own hands as to whether the trade is going to be obliged to bring into operation methods that are beyond their capacity within the time.  He will be issuing regulations.  These regulations may be less stringent as, say, from the 1st January, to the 1st August.  They may become more stringent after the date that is required, but if you get the Act operating in the earlier part of the year you will reap the advantage in the later part of the year, and not wait for another six months.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal in what Deputy Johnson says.  I am glad that he knows something about the life of a hen, but in the early spring there is very little necessity for this.  About March and April, however, circumstances happen in the life of a hen that will rather lead to stale and unpalatable eggs.  I think if the Minister made the time earlier than August, say, May, that would be a time when this class of undesirable commodity comes on the market, and that would be a step in the right direction. It is scarcely needed before that, but it is very much needed afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of view I had in mind in this amendment is, I must say, that the weightier portion of the trade would have passed over before this Bill would be law.  I feel that that would be regrettable.  I feel <Col N="2288" /> that if we send out an article that will be up to a certain standard at a time when we are putting heavy quantities of that article on the market, it will do much to establish our reputation, because it will be consumed in thousands and thousands of households.  And later on, when the supply is much less, it will take a longer time for the article to reach as many consumers.  It will consequently take these people longer to find out the class of article we are sending out.  That is why I think we should get at this matter as early as possible in the season.  I admit that there are difficulties in this question.  It is true that the regulations may be framed in such a way as to make it possible that the standard would be certainly improved before the 1st August.  I recognise that there is some force in the Minister's statement that although the Bill is not really law and operating as such, the fact that preparations are being made, will in itself be raising the standard, but what I would like to get is to have the standard raised all over the country in the earlier part of the season.  The Minister does not seem to hold out hope that he could do that earlier than August. I very much regret that.</P>

      <P>I wonder who the experts are whom the Minister has consulted, and whether they can be depended upon absolutely in regard to this matter.  I am in sympathy with what Deputy Baxter says, because I think that the earlier the date upon which we can get this into operation, the better it will be for all concerned. I believe that the technical difficulties which are to be faced would be overcome in time to get the Bill working at an earlier date than the 1st August.  In actual practice the fixing of this date of the 1st of August will mean that this grading of eggs will not be effective until early in 1926.  The amount of graded eggs shipped after the 1st of August will not be very great, and before the Bill takes real practical effect we will have to wait for two years. Possibly, the Minister could take steps to get these people stirred up, as it seems a long time to give until August, 1925, to teach them how to pack and grade their eggs and get the necessary buildings erected.</P>

      <P>The Deputy ought to know, because the people really affected are the producers, the wholesalers, the exporters and the retailers, and if the Farmers' Party, as a whole, thinks that this drastic Bill, with its drastic regulations, affecting every aspect of the trade, necessitating the putting in of new equipment, new plant, and the adoption of different methods of packing and grading, can be put into operation in six months, I am surprised after the information I have got from people who are in touch with the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I can say is, the whole question is whether the month of August, that is to say, practically a year from now, is necessary or not.  May is suggested, but there is no use suggesting a month in a casual way.  It may be after investigation that Deputies have satisfied themselves that this Bill could be put into operation in May, but I ask them not to be just guessing at the month. Remember this Bill is regulating a very big trade, and trade is the easiest thing in the world to upset by regulation. We might be very anxious to improve the egg trade, but we would not be improving it by rushing in at short notice with an ill-considered Bill and ill-considered regulations and not remembering the result of possible reactions on a very delicate organism, namely, this trade of £5,000,000 a year. The Dáil will be here, I hope, next August, and during the intervening period.  It is open to us, if we are ready, to put the Bill into operation by January; we have the power.  There are a great many ways of raising the question and finding out what progress had been made.  Deputy Johnson and Deputy Baxter and Deputy Heffernan, when we are discussing the regulations, will be in a position to know whether it is possible to bring the Bill into operation this month or next month, and they can see to it that there will be no unnecessary delay.  On the other hand, if you put in the 1st May or 1st of January into the Bill, then it means another Bill if you are to alter the date.  This was discussed at great length in another place, and I am not depending entirely on officials in this matter.  I have consulted the big producer, and the merchant, and every <Col N="2290" /> possible person.  Most of them would like a lot of time.  Some say two years. I have come to the conclusion that with the hardest possible work it will not be possible to bring the Bill into operation before August next year.  That is my belief.  I ask Deputies who have not given sufficient reason for thinking otherwise not to force us at this stage to commit ourselves to a definite month.  The Department of Agriculture and others will have to co-operate to teach people to pack eggs, as well as teaching them not to keep bad straw.  All that will improve the trade.  I know a big quantity of eggs goes out in the spring months, but in the spring months there is nothing to complain about in regard to our eggs in England.  There is no such complaint as there is in the autumn months.  During the spring we will be preparing our regulations, and exporters will be preparing their equipment, and all will be ready to be put into operation, and, more important still, they will be in the position to get the regulations, and they will be in a position by then to mark their packages and their eggs, and to see that the eggs are of the quality they should be, having regard to their grade at the other side.  It would be a disastrous thing, for instance, to grade your eggs and to export them as selected, and then to find that the eggs, when they reached England, were not up to the mark.  You could do a lot more harm by rushing the Bill and the regulations than by leaving the Bill alone.  If the Bill is successful it must be thought out very carefully and put into operation very carefully.</P>

      <P>It is clear in the Bill <Col N="2294" /> that the regulations will include the marking of the packages.  I take it what is in the Deputy's mind is not so much the marking of the eggs&mdash;that is why we put in the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo;&mdash; but the point is whether it should be mandatory that the eggs produced in the country should be marked if sold. If the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; come out the regulation might include a regulation stating that every egg sold in the country must be marked.  I do not think there is any necessity for that, and I do think it would be almost impossible to administer any such regulation.  Look at what it means.  We have not attempted to regulate all the trade, because I do not think any egg Bill ever introduced intended to do that.  We think we are going a pretty fair way in regulating the export trade.  This particular amendment would mean that we would have to regulate the marking of eggs in the case of the producer, retailer, wholesaler, exporter&mdash;anybody that sold an egg.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for export.  Of course that amounts to the same thing. When a producer sells an egg he does not know whether it is going to be exported ultimately or not.  If Deputy Baxter's intentions are to be put into operation every egg that is sold for export must be marked.  The words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; were put in to safeguard ourselves against the necessity of marking every egg, and really to express our own intentions.  We do not intend to mark every egg, but we have the power to mark every egg in certain circumstances under that phrase &ldquo;if any.&rdquo; We do not want to make that mandatory, and that is what Deputy Baxter is at, and that is also the point made in some of the subsequent amendments that have been put down.  Denmark has been quoted.  I am almost certain that there is no legislation in Denmark entitling a State Department to make a regulation for the marking of every egg.  I do know, however, that societies of egg producers in Denmark compel their members to mark their eggs.  That regulation, I understand, has practically fallen away entirely, and now only about one-ninth of the total export trade from Denmark <Col N="2295" /> consists of marked eggs.  There is another reason against this.  Recent experience shows that as few marks as possible should be put on the eggs. First of all, if the producer is to mark them he is one seller; then if the retailer has to mark them, he is another seller.  The exporter then has to clean off the previous marks and to mark them again.  Nothing disimproves the quality of eggs so much as cleaning them by wrong methods.  The tendency in recent years is against any marking of eggs or anything that would necessitate re-cleaning them.  I do not see any necessity for making it compulsory that each egg should be marked.  We have the option to do so if necessary, but I think it would be a very dangerous thing to make the marking compulsory or to enforce by regulation the marking of eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister when he says that to administer this would be a very great difficulty.  In my opinion there would be no greater difficulty experienced in marking the eggs than there will be in determining whether they are fresh or properly graded.  My intention is that the inspection made at the exporter's premises shall be for the purpose of seeing that the eggs are marked.  I would not dream of suggesting that the eggs should first be marked at the farmer's place and again by the dealer who purchases them, and a third time by the exporters.  If such a scheme as that were to be put forward I recognise that it would be impossible to administer it.  In my opinion, if it is made mandatory to have the eggs marked when inspected at the exporter's premises that will be sufficient. There will be no need whatever for two or three markings.  The exporter will not take the eggs unless they are marked.  That will be a form of compulsion that I think will prove very effective.  Already some farmers are marking the eggs.  The Minister referred to the custom in Denmark.  My idea is that if there is one mark put on at the farmer's house there will be no necessity for any further marking. I would be absolutely opposed to marking the eggs two or three times, but I think the first seller should <Col N="2296" /> mark the egg.  That will be an identification mark, and when that identification mark is put upon it it will be quite easy to trace back the egg, in case of complaints, to the first seller. If a mandatory regulation is made on this matter the exporters will not take eggs unless they are properly marked. As to what they may be doing in Denmark at the moment, I am not in a position to speak on that, but what I do know is that the trade has been brought to such a standard of perfection in that country that I am sure they can dispense with marking the eggs there altogether.  The farmers in that country have been trained and educated on the lines that they must organise their produce for export purposes. They know that a certain standard must be reached if they are to hold their place in the market and because of the long training and education they have received in this matter they know that it is up to them to maintain that standard.  Of course, they take every step that is necessary to maintain their present high position in the market, and hence there is no necessity for them to have a system of compulsory marking.  It is different with us, and I think it is absolutely necessary that we should have a system of compulsory marking so that we may establish in the world markets a reputation such as the farmers of Denmark have already attained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The great thing to provide against in this Act is evasion of the regulations.  In my opinion, if the egg is not stamped at the source there will be nothing but evasion.  You cannot hold the exporter responsible.  He can shift the responsibility, but if there is an identification mark on the egg you can get back to the source from which it came originally.  If our people get the chance to indulge in these little evasions they may take advantage of it. It is human nature that they would do so.  I think that the Minister should adopt Deputy Baxter's suggestion, and insist on having the eggs marked at the source.  That will do away with all evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want again to support Deputy Baxter in his view in this matter.  I am afraid the Minister seems <Col N="2297" /> to assume that there is going to be a continuation of the method whereby the shopkeeper or the grader going around collecting a few eggs here and there will then transfer them to the wholesaler and nobody will be able to recognise where the eggs came from, and only the wholesaler will be held responsible. I believe it is desirable that the responsibility for identification should go right back to the farmer who sold the egg originally.  I do not understand what the Minister means when he suggests that there would be a marking and then a removal of the marks.  I had hoped, on the contrary, that the original mark would remain until the consumer bought the egg.</P>
      <P>I think that there is in this, as there has been in another question&mdash;the butter question&mdash;a difference of opinion as to whether we are aiming at satisfying the consumer's demand for good quality eggs, or in the other case butter, or, whether we are simply trying to satisfy the trade in England with the quality.  There is something to be said for both.  It may be said that if you can satisfy the trade in England that the quality is good that is all you need aim at.  I am inclined to think that it is still better to try to satisfy not merely the traders but the consumers, and to make them realise that when they are getting Irish eggs they are really getting good quality. It may be with the keen competition between Irish and Danish eggs, supposing the two qualities are more or less even, that the trader will not mind whether he mixes up Irish eggs with Danish eggs.  He will say that they are all fresh eggs.  It is only because the Danish eggs have got a character, or maybe it is that the Irish eggs have got a character that appeals to the trader or shopkeeper in England that he announces them as Irish or Danish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they become equal in quality, then there will be no need to mark them with the country of origin.  I would like to have it come about that every Irish egg in England would be known to be Irish by the consumer, and that the quality would be such that the demand will be for Irish eggs even above Danish eggs, and that it will be to the advantage of the consumer and shopkeeper to announce them as Irish eggs. <Col N="2298" /> I think that can be done much better by imposing upon the original seller the obligation of identifying the eggs with a particular farm.  As to the intermediaries, I would leave that matter entirely to the exporter.  If there be intermediaries, let the exporter look after that.  The exporter may be able by his organisation and arrangement to have some kind of register of the original sellers, and that register would easily identify the original egg producer.  I think that that is almost of more importance than the registration of the exporter.  If you can throw the responsibility upon the farmer's wife of producing and selling clean eggs which will be identified, or which will not be allowed to go out of the country, and as a consequence will make a much lower price in the markets, that is the way to arrive at the end we seek to reach, and which will establish a character for those eggs in the English market.</P>

      <P>If the county is too large divide it up into smaller areas. Supposing there are 20,000 people in the county who are producing eggs, then I suggest you divide the county into smaller areas and you will find that it is as easy to trace an egg as to <Col N="2299" /> trace a motor car to-day.  If you have half a million people stamping eggs it is quite an easy matter.  If you have to get the eggs stamped by the big exporter he would want to have a large staff to do it.  If there is a difficulty at the source of origin surely there is a huge difficulty if you throw it on the exporter.  Any woman on a farm could quite easily stamp her eggs every morning and evening.  You have the people at all the egg stations in the country stamping them and they are people in the same station and of the same intelligence as the ordinary farmer's or labourer's wife.  It is quite as easy to do it in the case of these as it is to do it in the case of people who keep egg stations and, at any rate, by doing it in this way you will guarantee compliance with the law, and a standard and sound article.  Otherwise you cannot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to learn from Deputy Gorey that the point of view of the farmer is changing.  The farmers used not welcome inspectors nor officials from the Department of Agriculture in the past.  They used to be most unpopular.</P>
      <P>Farmers, as I knew them, used to be sarcastic at the expense of the inspectors. If four hundred thousand or perhaps five hundred thousand egg-producers have to mark their eggs, and if we have to see to it that they do so, they will get very used to Government inspectors and officials.  What we should aim at is to make Irish eggs synonymous with fresh eggs in the mind of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a difficulty.  It is not so in connection with butter, because a woman buys a pound of butter and she sees by the mark outside that it is Irish creamery butter. She knows what she is getting and that Irish butter is good for her.  As regards eggs, there is a difference, because in the shop she buys fresh eggs and unless they are marked there is nothing to indicate their place of origin.  If we improve the standard of eggs, it will be a great advertisement for Irish eggs if we can show the English consumer and the consumers in other markets that the term &ldquo;fresh egg&rdquo; and the term &ldquo;Irish egg&rdquo; means the same thing.  The purpose <Col N="2300" /> of the amendment is to make every producer stamp his or her own eggs.  I will refer you to the section.  If we take out the words &ldquo;if any,&rdquo; how does that affect the Deputy's purpose?  The section only deals with exporters, as Deputy Johnson has pointed out.  Merely taking out the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; would not make us any better.</P>

      <P>They are not.  Later on there is an amendment to the only section which deals with the trade as a whole.  That is Section 18, and the amendment which I am going to suggest is one that I will now read for you.  The amendment I suggest is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To add to the Section 3 new subsections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With a view to preventing the sale, exchange or barter, and the offering or exposing for sale, exchange or barter of eggs which are externally dirty or are unfit for human consumption, the Minister may by order make regulations in regard to all or any of the following matters, that is to say&mdash;(a) the packages and packing materials used for packing eggs, (b) the method and manner in all or any respects of protecting eggs from wet, damp, dirt or contamination of any sort while stored and in course of packing or transport, and (c) the marking for identification purposes of eggs or the packages containing eggs.</P>
      <P>(3) Any person who contravenes in any respect any regulation made under this section shall be guilty of an offence against this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof in the case of a first offence to a fine not exceeding ten pounds, and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, or at the discretion of the court imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and imprisonment.</P>
      <P>(4) Regulations made under this section shall not apply to any circumstances in respect of which the Minister is authorised by any other section of this Act to make regulations in regard to similar subject matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2301" /> Section 18, as you will observe, includes everybody.  It is the only section of the Bill that deals with people who are not producers and with people who are not exporters.  If you are to make any further regulations with regard to people who are not exporters, those regulations should be made in connection with this section. The amendment I have read gives us power to make regulations in respect to the marking of eggs by people other than the exporter.  That gives us all that Deputy Baxter wants, unless he wants a mandatory provision in the Bill compelling all producers to mark their eggs.  Why should that provision be forced in at this stage?  In the course of discussion afterwards it may be found that if we were to add anything in order to effect Deputy Johnson's purpose&mdash;identifying Irish eggs on the English market&mdash;it might be better and easier and simpler to deal with 800 exporters instead of 400,000 producers.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should close the door at this moment and plump definitely for making the producer mark the egg.  We have power to make such a regulation if we think it necessary under the amendment I have read. Why should it be made mandatory now, and why should it not be left open to us to consider other alternatives for the marking of eggs at other stages? It would be an extraordinary thing in a Bill like this, a drastic Bill which gives wide powers of regulation over the trade.  The mandatory provisions in it should be as few as possible.  It is a realisation of the danger and difficulty and delicacy of the subject, that makes it essential, when bringing in a Bill to regulate an important trade like this that there should be power afterwards to make additional regulations after full consideration of each specific point, and after obtaining the views of interests concerned and of everybody who has information to give on the subject.  In view of the complications and intricacies of the trade, you could not possibly anticipate every point, every possibility and every reaction of any regulation which you might now make.  It is unsound, in my opinion, to make any provision of the sort suggested mandatory, and to take at this stage one decision as against <Col N="2302" /> the three or four decisions that we might take in changing circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am not yet convinced that the Minister is making a good case against this amendment. It deals with the export of eggs, and he is proposing to license exporters.  I do not know how many exporters there will be.</P>

      <P>They probably will be reduced after a little while to 80. The effect of this Bill will probably be closer organisation.  I think we ought to legislate with a view to assisting these exporters, to tighten up the organisation as between the producer and the market in England.  The operation of this mandatory section would not necessitate that every farmer or egg producer should mark his or her eggs.  If they did not want to sell to an exporter for a market across the water then they need not mark the eggs under this section, and the later amendment that the Minister suggests might then be inoperative.  When we are trying to produce an article, and to establish a character for it in the English market, we want to induce the exporters to manage their business with a view to that, and we can assist them in doing it by obliging them to buy only from those producers who want to sell in the English markets, and they will know that the best prices are given for exportable eggs, and these will be the eggs with an identification mark.  By that means you will induce the producer to conform generally with the scheme outlined in the Bill, and to play up to the high standard that is required to get the highest prices.  In that way you will.  I think, be making it mandatory, and prevent the odd man or odd woman from trying to take an advantage by slipping in a few bad eggs, in the hope that they will not be detected, and you will assist exporters in doing their work efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will want to have as few tests, and as few throw-outs, as, possible. When they come to grading, packing, and testing, they do not want to see any number thrown out, if possible.  If we can assist them by making it an obligation on the original seller, we are <Col N="2303" /> simplifying the final testing very, very much indeed, and we are ensuring the success of the scheme, as from the producers' end.  We all know the story of the Scottish minister whose congregation proposed to give him a present on the occasion of his silver wedding, or something of that kind.  They decided that they would give him a little keg of whiskey, each of them to bring their little portion.  They each brought their bottle of whiskey, and poured it into the keg, and they then made their present.  They were all asked to drink the health of the minister, and lo and behold, it was all pure water they drank.  Every person thought he was taking advantage of the remainder. I want to prevent that sort of thing, and we know, as a matter of fact, that it is not unusual in this country for the seller of eggs in the beginning to put in a few that are not good.  How are you going to test them, how are you going to check that if they have to pass through two or three hands?  Unless the original buyer is to make the test, and be equally bound with the rest, you are not going to succeed.  The original buyer may try to get a few bad eggs through but if you can contrive a means of identifying the original seller with a particular egg, I think you are accomplishing much more than the general provisions of the Bill without that provision will enable you to accomplish. I hope, whether this is accepted or not, that it will be the urgent purpose of the Ministry to impose obligations of the kind that have been indicated by Deputy Baxter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how it would help, but I ask the Minister to remember that a good many societies are already forming and functioning, disposing of eggs that carry the brand of the society with the identification mark of each supplier.  That system is already in operation voluntarily, and the sooner that that is helped by a provision in the Bill the better, and the sooner you will have an article that you can really stand over.  There would be no evasion or possibility of evasion if you had that system.  You would be simply shutting all gates and you would arrive in a short time at the <Col N="2304" /> ideal position.  I see the time when cooperative and dairy societies will also handle these, and the sooner the egg producers are driven into these societies the better.  It is a point that deserves a good deal of consideration between this and the next stage of the Bill.  In view of what the voluntary societies are doing, I think the Minister should see how he can help in that direction.</P>

      <P>From my point of view the remainder of the Bill is not of so much importance as the deletion of these two words.  I feel as strongly from my point of view as the Minister feels on his.  Deputy Egan agrees that it would be a good thing to do if it were possible to do it, without any great trouble or difficulty.  Within the past few weeks I have had experience of a small organisation of farmers who have themselves voluntarily decided to do this.  They are a district, and they are given a letter, &ldquo;C.&rdquo;  Each of the suppliers gets a number, and the eggs are stamped voluntarily with their own identification stamp.  I have known suppliers to send in eggs, perhaps by accident, that were not up to the standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us imagine a big trader taking in a large quantity of eggs in a rush of business.  He may not be in a position at a certain period in the day to test the eggs as they are given in.  He will be in a position to count them; that may be just as much as he can conveniently do.  But if the suppliers have not some identification marks he must test them before they are taken in order to determine whether they are up to the standard or not.  If there is an identification mark he has only to weigh them and pay the supplier.  If they are not up to the standard he knows who the supplier is; he has the supplier registered.  Let us come to the exporter.  In introducing the Bill the Minister pointed out that because exported eggs would have to be tested and graded it would raise the standard of the article in the home market.  That is exactly what I want, and I want all <Col N="2305" /> the eggs that will come to the exporter, whether they are to be exported or sold in the home market, to be up to a certain standard, and that it shall be against the law for the exporter to have on his premises any eggs that are not properly marked.  Would the Minister suggest that it would be possible at any time for the exporter to do all this marking and stamping?  Would he even suggest that the small trader would do it?  It may be, and I have no doubt that many farmers will object to doing this.  I recognise that fact, but what I see in it is this: if there is to be marking or stamping of eggs, and if the farmers do not do it, the other people must.  If so, they will be absolutely certain to make the farmers pay them for the labour that it will entail.  It would be a much cheaper and better system to have it done at home, and it would be much more effective if it were mandatory that no exporter should have on his premises any eggs that are not marked, and you may be sure that the exporter will not take them from the small trader unless they are marked, and the small trader again will not take them from the seller unless they are marked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it is the same thing.  Of course, any producer selling his eggs across the counter will know whether they are for export or not.  It amounts to the same thing, that he will have to mark any eggs that he is selling, unless he is selling them to a neighbour.  The aim of the amendment is that all the eggs which he sells must be marked.  Whether that is right or wrong this is not the place to insert such an amendment.  Deputies need not get alarmed; there are 18 sections in the Bill.  We will have to discuss all the other sections.  We will come to the sections dealing with the sale of eggs in general.  But here is the section which professedly sets out to deal with the export trade, and we are endeavouring <Col N="2306" /> to insert an amendment which indirectly will get at the producer. That is really not the way to draft legislation.  This section and this particular portion of the Bill deals with the exporters, and it is a nice point in law in my opinion, whether the taking out of the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; would make any real difference.  But there is no occasion for us to argue in an indirect way like this.  Deputy Baxter's and Deputy Johnson's idea is to take out the words &ldquo;if any.&rdquo;  Then there must be a mark on every egg in every exporter's premises and therefore they must insist on getting marked eggs from all producers.  That is really the suggestion. Now, that is getting at it indirectly, and if it is to be made mandatory at all the proper place to put in the necessary amendment is section 18, which deals not only with the exporters but with anybody who sells eggs.  If that point were agreed on I could reserve my thunder until we came to section 18.  I suggest that this is unsound.  Certain sections have been drafted carefully with a view to the exporter, and with a view to the liabilities of the exporter, and to try to get into this section regulations which on the face of them would seem to apply to an exporter but which are merely an indirect way of forcing the producer to do a certain thing, is certainly not the right way to go about the business, especially in view of the fact that we have another section dealing not only with exporters but with people who sell eggs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the question need be discussed on the merits, or whether this is the right place to do it or not.  If we can agree that it ought to be done, then the question as to how it can be done is one for consideration at a later stage.  Will the Minister agree to make it obligatory that persons selling eggs which may be exported, or which are to be exported, shall be identifiable?  I do not know whether the practice is the same in every egg market as it is in the North of Ireland markets, but if the Minister ever had the pleasure of being in Ballinahinch, Armagh, or Portadown, on a market day in March, he would see how impossible it is for the exporter to deal with eggs in the manner required in this Bill, unless there is some identification.  As a matter of fact, the practice in these markets, whatever it might be in other places, is that you will have people buying eggs for home consumption, and people buying eggs for export.  If such a provision as this was in operation, and the producers wanted to go to a buyer who is going to export eggs, that exporter would insist on all these eggs being marked. If they were for home consumption, of course, there would not be any obligation, unless it was found in practice that it was better to have identifiable eggs, than otherwise.  I believe it will be found, very soon after the operation of such a provision as this, that every purchaser of eggs for home consumption, or for export, will require to have identifiable eggs.  I agree with Deputy Baxter&mdash;I am not going to argue whether this is the right way to do it or not&mdash;that provision should be made in the Bill that eggs purchased by an exporter should have an identification mark.  I would like the Dáil to support <Col N="2308" /> Deputy Baxter in this motion.  I think the Minister ought to be gratified, and I think the trade ought to be gratified, and to go out of their way to meet the farmers, after hearing that the farmers' representatives in the Dáil are pressing for a provision of this kind.  I would have thought that the Minister would have jumped at the offer, and been very glad to embody this provision in the Bill.  Certainly the exporters ought to welcome it, as it is meeting their case, and assisting them to establish a trade that will save them unnecessary expense.  That expense will be avoided if this provision is adopted.  I think the Minister will make a serious mistake if he does not assist in meeting the purpose Deputy Baxter has in view.  To repel the farmers' representatives, when they are pleading with him to make regulations regarding the quality of their production, is a stroke of bad policy.  I say he ought to clinch the bargain, and use it to the full.  I think the Farmers' Party are well advised in pressing this matter, and I hope the Minister will not lose the opportunity of embodying in the Bill, either in this form or in some other form, what will probably be the most valuable provision in regard to these new regulations respecting the trade in eggs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that this is the right time to make the change.  If this amendment is agreed to, it will have the effect of making it mandatory on the exporter to see that the eggs are branded.  The Minister said a moment ago that farmers would not approve of having inspectors constantly visiting their farms.  If the Minister makes it mandatory on the sellers of eggs to have those eggs branded, it will, in my opinion, make it unnecessary to have inspection of the farmsteads.  The intention of this amendment was to make it mandatory on the exporter to see that the eggs are branded and if the Minister accepts that, the exporter will take good care that the people who supply the eggs to him will comply with the obligation.  The Minister will then only have to look to the exporter, and will not have to worry about the egg producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> I would like to say that I thoroughly concur with what Deputy Johnson says, and I think the Minister should be delighted that the farmers are advancing more than he is in this direction. I might tell the Minister that this is not a policy on our part which will be popular down the country.  But we think it is the right thing that we should take a foremost part in securing that our produce reaches the London market in first-class condition, and that it should be first-grade.  We think we are doing the right thing in forcing that view on the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not hear Deputy Wilson answer.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that perhaps the better way to approach this is to consider not whether this amendment effects the intention, but whether we can agree as to the particular change that Deputy Baxter wishes to make.  The issue is absolutely knit.  He wants to make it mandatory, in fact, on every producer to mark his eggs.  He has his own way of doing it, and we can discuss that afterwards.  I agree that this Bill, when introduced, was in need of improvement in regard to Section 18. Deputy Baxter himself raised that point on Second Reading.  He stated that there was need for some further provisions in the Bill which would safeguard the exporter.  I agree as to that, and I agree that it would be a pity if this Bill left the Dáil without giving powers to the Ministry over, not only the exporter, but the producer.  What I am not prepared to do is to take out one particular power like that in the Bill and make it mandatory.  Remember, there is very little difference between us.  Deputy Baxter and Deputy Johnson want to make it mandatory on us to compel, by regulation, every producer in the country to mark his eggs. We have in this Bill taken power to do that if necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fully empowered to do that.  The only difference <Col N="2310" /> between us, therefore, is that Deputy Baxter and Deputy Johnson would leave us no discretion.  They would force us to commit ourselves immediately to the policy that every egg produced&mdash;I make no exceptions, because it would amount to that in fact and in practice&mdash;should be marked.  I have, I think, stated the position between us fairly.  If we are agreed that that is the issue, I do think, on consideration, that Deputies should not insist on making that provision mandatory. Now, how long will this Bill be in operation?  It may be 10 or 15 or 20 years.  The conditions of trade change rapidly.  Of course we could bring in a Bill to cover every point, but the reason we are leaving ourselves the power to make regulations is because we do not want to be under the necessity of bringing in a Bill in regard to every change in the trade.  It is agreed that the power to make regulations should be wide and general. But here you are, at this stage, committing yourselves definitely to making a certain regulation regardless of the fact that time&mdash;and a very short time &mdash;may put that regulation out of date. I do not think that Deputies should take up the position that this question is not arguable, because I contend, even if it is arguable, that eggs or certain classes of eggs should not be marked, then you should not make it mandatory. It is certainly arguable.  We cannot afford just to brush aside what happened in Denmark.  In Denmark they started by marking all the eggs. Now they do not do so.  That is a difficulty you cannot close your eyes to, notwithstanding Deputy Johnson's eagerness to make a fresh egg and an Irish egg synonymous terms.  It does not at all improve the appearance of an egg to have it marked.  That is the cause of the change in the Danish trade.  Why did the people of Denmark&mdash;and they know their business&mdash; drop the marking?  There must have been a good reason.  They may have been wrong.  Experience may prove them to have been wrong, but we should not assume now absolutely that they are wrong and legislate on the assumption that the question is not even arguable. There is another important point: a mark on an egg, especially a mark <Col N="2311" /> that identifies it with the country of production, should be a mark really to show first grade and first grade only. It is the same as butter.  It is not a good thing to identify second grade or third grade stuff with a particular country.  The mark should be a mark of excellence.  It should be a mark of premium produce and it should be a mark that should only go on premium produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is undoubtedly an aspect that has to be taken into consideration. Further, you will have preserved eggs. There will have to be stale eggs&mdash;eggs that are not exactly fresh.  Why force the producer to mark these eggs? Russia, which has an immense trade in eggs, exports eggs which are not fresh, because she is far away&mdash;eggs which are perfectly good for custard and things of that sort.  Why should we mark every egg?  If they are to be marked at all, mark only the premium quality.  You must leave the regulations elastic.  We can decide afterwards <Col N="2312" /> whether it is good business to mark eggs, and, secondly, if it is considered necessary to mark eggs, we can decide what class of eggs is to be marked.  But to make it mandatory at this stage that all classes of eggs are to be marked would be absurd, in view of the fact that eggs that are not quite fresh, third-grade eggs, will have to be exported.  I have gone as far as I am convinced I ought to go.  The Bill gives us power to make the necessary regulations, and what I object to is making these things mandatory in every changing circumstance.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Commissioners of Public Works that tenders for the rebuilding of Union Quay Barracks, Cork, are about to be called for, and the work will commence in a few weeks.  The requirements and plans in regard to the restoration of the Bridewell have to be worked out, and the work of rebuilding these premises will not be commenced for five or six months.  It is expected to have the Union Quay Barracks finished early in 1925, and the Bridewell later in the same year.</P>
