      <P>asked the President if he is aware that many unemployed men with large families are under &ldquo;Notice to Quit&rdquo; their homes owing to non-payment of rent; if he is aware that the vast majority of the unemployed in the City of Dublin have ceased to draw Unemployment Insurance benefits, and whether, in view of their continued unemployment, he will take steps to introduce a temporary protective measure that will prevent their eviction from their homes.</P>

      <P>I have made enquiries and I am not in a position to confirm or refute the Deputy's statement that there are many unemployed men with large families under notice to quit owing to non-payment of rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The United National Friendly Insurance Collecting Society is an English body, and no action can be taken by any authority here to safeguard the interests of policy <Col N="2891" /> holders of An Saorstát, but such interests will, of course, be looked after on the same footing as other interests by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies in England.  An award for the winding up of the affairs of this Society was made in September last under the English Industrial Assurance Act, 1923.  Saorstát policy holders should accordingly communicate direct with the Industrial Assurance Commissioner at 17 North Audley Street, W.1., as the proceedings for winding-up have not, as far as I am aware, been yet completed.</P>

On 21st November the Council were informed that the proposals had been approved, but no application for an advance from the grant has yet been received.</P>

Higgins, ex-Captain, National Army, has not received arrears of pay due to him from March 31st, 1923, to March 7th, 1924, although he made repeated applications to the Pay Department concerned, and had his claims duly certified by his superior officer; if he is aware that Mr. Higgins did not receive even a reply to his applications; if he is aware that though he was acting as an officer during the period mentioned he only received £1 4s. 6d. per week, instead of a flat rate of £4 10s. 0d., as was shown on the Army list against his name; if he will state why he was demobilised at private soldier's rate, when officers, exactly on the same lines as he, were paid according to their rank, and if he will give instructions that the arrears of pay due to Mr. Higgins will be paid to him?</P>

      <P>A claim in respect of arrears of pay has been received from ex-Captain Higgins in respect of the period mentioned.  His claim was duly acknowledged, and he was informed that it was under investigation.  Considerable difficulty arose in the case due to the fact that prior to the period in question he had been serving as an officer under an assumed name, and owing to misunderstandings he was paid at a private's rate of pay, and demobilised accordingly.  The circumstances of the case have now been cleared up, and arrears of pay at the rate appertaining to his rank are being paid forthwith.</P>

Meath, in respect of service rendered as Company Police Officer in 1921 and 1922; whether certificates of service have been forwarded to the Paymaster-General from the late O/C 4th Meath Brigade, late O/C 2nd Battalion, 4th Meath Brigade, and other officers, all of whom are at present holding Commissions in the National Army, and whether payment will be expedited in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not appear to have received a claim direct from Mr. Marmion, but one on his behalf and the certificates referred to, were received from the Deputy.  The position in the case is that company police gave their services voluntarily, and were not entitled to pay in that capacity at the period in question.  I regret that it is not practicable to make an exception to that rule in Mr. Marmion's case.</P>

      <P>I propose to ask the Dáil to refer back to the Committee for further consideration this Report, so far as Paragraph 4 (3) is concerned; that is the sub-section which gives the final recommendation of the Committee.  Without arguing on the <Col N="2900" /> general question, I am quite sure that the Dáil will feel that that recommendation, at least, should not be accepted until every possible alternative has been considered.  I think that stage has not yet been arrived at.  There has been a good deal of general talk about this amongst the Deputies for the past ten days, and I think, without arguing the matter at full length, there is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case for further consideration of the proposal to erect temporary buildings in Leinster Lawn.  I would like to say, in the first place, that I do not blame the Committee in the least for not having considered that proposal further.  I am informed they were told that the Board of Works had expressed the view that that was not a practicable proposal.</P>
      <P>But I think that view, if expressed, was expressed without very full consideration of what the proposal really involved.  The plan of the place was available, and it showed that the ground floor space is available to a really remarkable extent compared with the ground floor space available in Leinster House, its buildings and the place where the Seanad meets.  I understand from the Minister of Finance that he is quite ready to submit again a proposal to the Board of Works to erect temporary buildings &mdash;and by temporary buildings I mean buildings that would last for an appreciable number of years&mdash;for their fuller consideration.  I understand from inquiry into the matter that there is really no technical difficulty in the erection of the building at comparatively reasonable cost, which would provide accommodation on a much larger scale than anything we can expect from the proposals recommended by the Joint Committee. I do not wish to speak at length at this stage, because I am inclined to think there may be general agreement to refer this matter back to the Committee.  If the Minister for Finance is prepared to give the assurance I indicated, the Committee would be probably ready to have the matter referred back to them, and therefore I make that suggestion, and move an amendment to that effect.</P>

      <P>I may say that the Seanad has adopted this Report.  Certain terms of reference were given to a Joint Committee.  The Joint Committee reported to both Houses, and one House has adopted that Report.  I am not clear as to whether an amendment passed here could compel the Joint Committee to meet to reconsider a particular decision and make a further report to both Houses, and as to what would be the procedure in the other House if a report was presented which would be tantamount to the rescinding of a decision already arrived at in the other House.  That is merely a statement of a problem, of course.</P>

      <P>I suggest that this question of temporary housing of the Oireachtas is being regarded altogether from the foreigner's outlook.  The capital of a country ought to be, as the capital of nearly every other country of the world is, in the centre of the country.  Dublin is really a foreign <Col N="2902" /> town.  The streets, as you pass along, speak of the foreigner and of the foreigner's power.  The capital of this country should be removed from the atmosphere of Dublin City.  The Dublin people are courteous and very nice, but the seat of the Government of this country should be far removed from the atmosphere of Dublin and from the centre of foreign power, and from its foreign mode and method of thought. We have heard a lot in this assembly of the reincarnation of the Gael and of the Gaelic State.  The front bench talked about the reincarnation of the Gaelic State; we are going to start from the beginning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Every night when I go home I have to put cotton wool around my shins in the same way that you would bandage a horse in preparation for a hurdle race.  I do not think that this theatre is a fit place for an assembly of this kind.  As I understand it, the suggestion of going to Leinster Lawn is a practical proposition.  We could have plenty of room there and accommodation for Committee meetings, and refreshment rooms, and splendid accommodation for seating the public to hear our discussions.  So long as it is a practical proposition that will make for more comfortable surroundings, I think the matter ought to be considered.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer Deputy McBride to Article 13 of the Constitution: &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall sit in or near the City of Dublin... as from time to time it <Col N="2903" /> may determine.&rdquo;  But I really rose for the purpose of stating the point of view of the Committee.  I know it is very dangerous to enter into conflict with Deputy Thrift, involving a penalty sometimes of 15 years and 15 strokes of the lash, but on this occasion I am forced to do so, although he said he did not blame the Committee actually, but only by implication for having made an improper suggestion.  Other people even suggested that we were ignorant of the Ten Commandments.  The fact that Deputy Professor Magennis was on the Committee is sufficient answer to that.  But Deputy Thrift's suggestion ought to have been laid before the Committee.  That was not done.  He ought to have known that the Committee were appointed by the Dáil, that they were given a time limit in which to report, and if the Deputy had detailed suggestions to make he ought to have come before the Committee in the first instance.  Secondly, as a matter of fact, owing to a suggestion from Deputy Good, I did ask the Minister for Finance when he came to the Committee if a temporary building of this kind was feasible, and he said he did not think so on a large scale. Now, if he is prepared to give the matter further consideration I have no objection to that.  There is no ideal solution of this difficulty.  There is not anywhere near Dublin a Parliament House waiting for us to come in suited in every respect.  We have got to make the best of a bad job, and our recommendation was in that spirit.  There was no other solution.  Possibly the solution suggested by Deputy Thrift is a better one, but there is one factor left out.  It may be more convenient and cost less, but there is the factor of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How long will it take to put up a building of this kind?  It is to be a building of the exhibition character, such a kind of building as is being erected at Wembley, but that has taken six months to erect, and it is not finished yet.  Time is very much the essence of the problem.  I feel we ought to get the Seanad out of the Museum as soon as we can.  I am thinking seriously of the number of visitors that will be coming to Dublin very soon.  I can never remember whether it is three hundred thousand or three <Col N="2904" /> hundred million that want to see the Museum, and it is a pity to prevent them doing so.  It is the best we have to show, with its Cross of Cong and Ardagh Chalices, and so on.  By neglecting to show these things we will be doing our civilisation a great injustice and unless we go into a temporary building within six or eight months I feel we will be doing Ireland a great injury.  I suggest that we request the Seanad to consent to reappoint this Committee.  It is unfortunate that the Seanad is now adjourned, because, as I have said, time is one of the essences of the problem.  That undoubtedly will make for a certain difficulty, but if we request them they will probably agree to reappoint this Committee.  Speaking for myself&mdash;some of my colleagues are not here&mdash;I should be only too glad if we can find a way out of the difficulty on the lines Deputy Thrift has suggested.</P>

      <P>In supporting Deputy Thrift's amendment, I would like to suggest that it be an instruction to the Committee to see if there is not available in the immediate neighbourhood a private house that would meet the requirements of the Oireachtas, or, conversely, of the Royal Dublin Society. I understand such a house might be, under certain circumstances, available, and that with certain alterations it might be made suitable either for the temporary housing of the Oireachtas or of the Royal Dublin Society.  I understand that this house is owned by a family which has rendered great service to Dublin, and which, perhaps, if approached in the proper way might be willing to enter into negotiations for the temporary leasing of it, either to the Oireachtas or the Royal Dublin Society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the members of the Committee, I may say that we spent some little time in trying to find a solution of this difficult problem. While I have no particular objection to the matter being referred back to the Committee, I cannot see that the suggestion made by Deputy Thrift is going to serve any useful purpose, for the reason that the Committee took most <Col N="2905" /> of these points into their consideration before sending in the report which is now before the Dáil.  I do not think that to refer back the Report to the Committee simply for the purpose of finding whether the Committee will recommend the erection of a temporary building in Leinster Lawn, in the shape perhaps of a tent or something like that in order to house the Oireachtas for the next couple of years until a permanent building is found, is a feasible proposition.  I think that what is underlying this whole question of referring back the report to the Committee, is the fact that the Royal Dublin Society think that if they leave Leinster House that they will be lost and lost for ever, and that they will never recover.  I do not hold that view, but that argument has been put up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Royal Dublin Society does not live by Leinster House.  They live by Ireland, and while they say that they have lost a considerable number of their members during the last year or two, while we have been here in possession of part of this building, it must be remembered that these members came to them within the last two or three years.  I remember the time when the Royal Dublin Society was looked upon as a shoneen institution to which the ordinary man in the street would not get admittance.  They have changed their minds of late, and I am glad to note that they have done so, and have become a democratic institution, and the ordinary man in the street who can afford a subscription of £2 2s. a year, can now become a member of the Society.  I hold that no matter where the Royal Dublin Society goes the name which the Society has in the country at the present time, will go with it, and that Leinster House is not the be-all and the end-all of the Royal Dublin Society.  The Society, I believe, could get accommodation suitable for its requirements much easier than we can get accommodation suitable for our requirements in any other part of the City of Dublin, and for that reason I believe that Leinster House is the only convenient place in the city where the Oireachtas can be housed, until we find a suitable permanent building.  If the report is referred back and reconsidered, <Col N="2906" /> I do not see what we can do. If we have to put up a temporary building in Leinster Lawn, that is going to cost a considerable sum of money, while at the same time Leinster House, I am given to understand, is kept up by the Board of Works out of Government grants.  I understand it is being kept up even at present out of Government funds.  I do not see that we are going to do the Royal Dublin Society a bit of harm by taking these premises over for a few years until we can get a permanent home, and I am certain that we will hand them back in as good repair as they were in when we took them from the Society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. EGAN Mr. EGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in favour of the amendment of Deputy Thrift.  If it is a question of having to spend money on an outside place to provide accommodation for the Royal Dublin Society, why not do so?  It seems to me to be a much more sensible suggestion that we should stay here and give the Royal Dublin Society reasonable compensation to enable them to provide themselves with the accommodation which they require.  Everyone knows perfectly well that nine-tenths of the activities of the Royal Dublin Society are centred in Ballsbridge, and that the other one-tenth of their activities is centred here.  Furthermore, I do not care for the idea of disfiguring Leinster Lawn with a temporary building. What, I ask, are you going to do with it afterwards.  It seems to me that to put up a temporary building in Leinster Lawn would be a waste of money, and consequently I am supporting the view expressed by Deputy Hughes, that we should stay here until such time as we are in a position to put up a building which will fulfil all our requirements.</P>

      <P>I have no particular objection to the sending back of this Report for further consideration if any Deputy thinks that further consideration is going to be of any value.  I hope and urge that the Committee will give due consideration to Deputy Sir James Craig's complaint.  Reference has been made to a possible six months.  If we are to be here for a further six months, I hope the Committee will bear in mind the necessity of having some <Col N="2907" /> reconstruction of this Chamber, even for these six months.  Consider the position.  Here you have Deputies of the build of Deputy Sir James Craig, Deputy Good, Deputy Gorey, Deputy Bryan Cooper, Deputy Wolfe, Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Bulfin.  Now, consider their shins.  One has often wondered what was the real explanation of so many vacant seats.  Now we have it.  Give us good seating and then there will be no excuse for bad attendance.  I hope if this matter is to be referred back that, whatever the decision, there will not be any further delay in re-seating this Chamber.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that in this Report the Royal Hospital is dismissed very shortly.  &ldquo;The Joint Committee cannot recommend the selection of the Royal Hospital owing to the existing difficulties of access by the business and professional life of the city.&rdquo; I will admit that they supplement that objection further on, but while concentrating upon the actual cost in respect of one particular site, there is no reference to the possible cost in connection with other sites.  Now, we came in here either in good faith or in bad faith, and I suggest that it has very much the appearance of having come in here under false pretences.  In the fifth page of the report there is a document signed by the President, the Honorary Secretary and the Director of the Royal Dublin Society.  It states that when the late General Collins, after inspecting the House, expressed the desire to hold the first Provisional Government assembly in the Lecture Theatre, he generously acknowledged the offer that was made and expressed the hope to the Society that the inconvenience would not exceed eight months.  We are here nearly two years, and I submit that unquestionably it needs some explanation to the Society as to why there has been a breach of faith, if there has been a breach of faith.  And if it be for no other reason than the question of convenience to the professional and business life of the community, I submit that there should be more explanation of that: there should be more proof of it.  If one travels in foreign countries and visits a city like Paris, one will see <Col N="2908" /> splendid avenues.  Comparing them with this mile and a half in this city, about which the complaint of inconvenience has been made, one wonders whether we have got a true conception of what is the capital of a country or not.  I think one avenue in Paris is about three miles long.  A great city, and great minds could only have conceived a city of that sort, and we say that to go from the centre of the city to Kilmainham is an inconvenience to the business and professional life of the city.  I submit that the case has yet to be made in proof of that statement.  It may be that Kilmainham would be less convenient for those who wish to come here, but is it a fact?  The majority of Deputies come in from the country at the Kingsbridge, and the Royal Hospital, if it were the site, would not be a grave inconvenience to them.</P>
      <P>The question, then, arises as to the suitability of the institution we are in at the moment.  Is it suitable?  Are the committee rooms for the various parties rooms in which a party can hold a meeting of any length without grave inconvenience and perhaps grave consequences to persons sitting in these rooms, and are they really fitting rooms for an assembly such as this?  And while we might possibly say that it is time to take the Seanad out of the Antique Furniture Room of the Museum, we ourselves are in a theatre.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if we do really take into consideration the claims that have been made in connection with housing in the City of Dublin, I submit that College Green must wait. After the case that is made by the <Col N="2909" /> Medical Officer of Health of the City of Dublin, and by the representatives of the municipality, I submit that we ought to wait.  Even if we spent £70,000 upon making the Royal Hospital habitable for a while, time would be given to see how best to get a national institution which would meet with public approval.  I am not at all so satisfied that there is that extraordinary sympathy for the Bank of Ireland premises, the old House of Parliament, as people say.  We were told that there was a great improvement during the period of that Parliament; that there was a great society here during that time.  I would like to know how far the brilliance of that society was responsible for its selling its birthright.</P>
      <P>I do not approve at all of building on Leinster Lawn.  I think it would destroy the beauty of Merrion Square and of this building.  I do not believe you would put up a building there which you could point out with any degree of pride or satisfaction to a visitor as the place where the Parliament of the nation meets.  I am prepared to allow it to go to the Committee, but I would not vote for it, no matter what recommendation is put up for it if it be put up.  I know that it is unpopular to urge the claims of the Royal Hospital.  It was by a process of exclusion that we came to it.  In that mood and for that purpose we recommended it.  We know it is not ideal; we know that one cannot get a Parliament House at a moment's notice, and we know, furthermore, that even if one were to admit the claim for the case made for the old House of Parliament it would take years to make it suitable, if we were to start now, and we know, furthermore, that we have not the money for an extravagant experiment of this kind.</P>

Not only did the President go to Kilmainham, but he went to College Green, which, by the Terms of Reference of the Committee, was almost excluded from the Committee's recommendation, in so far as the Committee was to consider temporary accommodation. As I understand Deputy Thrift's amendment, he desires to refer back to the Committee Section 4, Paragraph 3, of the Committee's report in order that the Committee may consider whether a temporary building could be erected in Leinster Lawn; or does he want other alternatives to be considered too?</P>

      <P>With reference to Kilmainham I may say that when I was appointed on the Committee I had absolutely no bias against it; I was, if anything, biassed in its favour.  The paragraph in the Report is not quite what I personally would desire.  Owing to illness I was absent from the last meeting of the Committee when the Report was debated, and I think that I should have put in some other reasons besides those that are given.  I make the President a present of one point.  I timed myself from Westland Row direct to the Royal Hospital by tram and on foot, and it took me just over twenty minutes, which was not excessive.  As I say, I went there, if anything, prejudiced in favour of the Royal Hospital because it is available and reasonably accessible: but when I looked at the premises I came to the conclusion that they were wholly unsuitable for the purpose.  To begin with, take the hall. There is a hall there that would seat at least four Dáils; it is at least three times the size of this.  I inquired from the officials of the Board of Works, who had prepared most informative plans, as to the acoustics.  The acoustics, they said, are very bad, everything echoes, but we would make it rather better by hanging army blankets around the walls.  Is it a tenable proposition that the Dáil should sit in a hall surrounded by army blankets? We should begin by buying those early Irish tapestries, which are now being discussed in the Press.</P>

    <P>Then as to the Seanad, I thought the chapel in which it was proposed to accommodate the Seanad was eminently suitable to that body.  It was dignified and gloomy.  But all the members of the Seanad on the Joint Committee <Col N="2912" /> objected very much, and I am sorry to say that the ground of their objection was that they would be next door to the Dáil with only one wall between them, and that the disorderly proceedings would disturb them.  It seems there are two halls in which the Assembly could be accommodated; one is much larger than would be required for the Dáil, and its acoustics are bad; but the other one I personally think suitable for the Seanad, but it did not commend itself to any member of the Seanad on the Committee. What remains?  There remains a whole nest of little rooms about the size of an undergraduate's room in a college, or an officer's quarters in barracks, and any larger rooms that are required will have to be made by throwing down the partitions, and throwing these different rooms together.  The President said that the Committee rooms here are not suitable for the purpose of long sittings.  I believe the Party meetings are held in the Committee rooms; probably the President knows more about the long sittings than I do.  I am certain that the acoustics and everything else in the Committee rooms which it was proposed to make in the Royal Hospital would be far less suitable, because there would be probably three rooms thrown one into another. There is only one decent sized room in the whole place, which it was intended should be used as a library, but with book-shelves in it, it would probably not accommodate more than ten Deputies who wished to read at the same time.  What is intended for the refreshment room is a whole range of rooms, with about six partitions, which would have to come down, and I think the result would be that by the time the food would have been carried from one end of the room to another it would be cold. There would be room for only two rows of tables.  There are rooms of normal size that would be perfectly suitable for clerks' offices, and so on, but barring that, there is not a single room, even if adapted by the ingenuity of the Board of Works, which seemed to me suitable to accommodate a Parliament.  Whether we spend £50,000 or £70,000, we should have on our hands a building that is suitable for a Parliament House, and nothing else.  The alternative which the Committee put forward has, at least, <Col N="2913" /> this merit, that whatever money is spent the State will have this house, which they ought to have, and I think they have a right to have.  This place could be used as a lecture theatre, in conjunction with the Museum, and nearly all modern Museums have a lecture theatre, in which lectures are given and slides shown on matters of interest.</P>
    <P>It has grown up with time, but I think it is incongruous that in the middle of the National Library, the National Gallery, and the National Museum, there should be a building which is private property.  I do not want to prejudge the issue&mdash;I am not myself a member of the Royal Dublin Society&mdash; but at least three or four members of the Committee were members of the Society, and were certainly not actuated by any hostility to it in any way. We should have something for our money.  The Royal Hospital could be made an excellent residential hall for a University or something of that kind, without spending much money on it. Mind, you would have to spend a great deal there; there is no electric light there, and you would have to put in electric light, and you would have to put in heating.  It would be a very large proposition, indeed.  It would be a very serious proposition, and I believe we could get better value for the money by following the Report.  One other thing I want to say.  This was a very representative Committee, representatives of all shades of view.  There are quite a number of points on which Senator Jameson differs from Senator O'Farrell; Deputy Nagle and Deputy Gorey are not always in agreement with one another, and both of them sometimes disagree with Deputy Hughes and me.  This Committee was representative of all parties and classes.  Its Report was unanimous, and, therefore, I do not think that the Dáil ought to put it aside lightly.</P>

      <P>When the first Committee, of which I happened to be a member, was set up to inquire into the question of the temporary housing of the Oireachtas, the Deputies were asked, and anybody else who was interested was asked, to submit to the Committee the names of any places other than this.  A number of suggestions <Col N="2914" /> were sent in, and I think every alternative suggestion, with the exception of the one now named by Deputy Professor Thrift, was considered even by the first Committee.  I am in agreement with everything Deputy Bryan Cooper has said in reference to Kilmainham, and for the reasons that he has given.  I think, as well as that, that the approaches to the Royal Hospital, with the exception of the one on the Kilmainham Jail side, are anything but desirable and could not be looked upon as suitable approaches even to a temporary House of Parliament. Apparently there are two sections in the Dáil on this question.  One with Kilmainham all the time in their minds, whether it be as a temporary or permanent home I find it very difficult to determine.  I believe those who speak here in support of it are actuated by a desire in the first place to get out of this place, for the reasons the President has advanced to-day, but the real object in some of their minds is to make Kilmainham the permanent home for the Oireachtas.  I am anything but sentimental in matters of this kind, but I believe you will never have a concentration of opinion upon the activities of this new Parliament until you get the College Green House.  I suggest to President Cosgrave that it was not the fault of the walls or structure of that House that led to the selling in College Green House of the birthright of the nation.  It was the fault and failing of the people in the House, and not the fault of the building itself.  It may, perhaps, be considered a hardship by members of the Royal Dublin Society to be kept out of the use of this theatre for such a long time, but I think Deputy Egan has hit the point very fairly when he said that reasonable compensation should be given to the Royal Dublin Society to enable them to find a place that will be equally suitable for them, and to leave us this place, temporarily, at any rate.  The only thing I can see in Deputy Professor Thrift's amendment is that this matter should be referred back to the Committee for the purpose of inquiring whether temporary premises may be set up in Leinster Lawn.  There is no other issue to go before the Committee, because all other alternatives have been considered.</P>

      <P>I think the Dáil should hesitate in approving of Kilmainham even as a temporary site for the Oireachtas when it involves the expenditure of £70,000.  Deputy Davin has pointed out the inconvenience of the locality.  All who know the avenues of approach there will clearly understand that they are not boulevards in the sense that the President refers to. The location is very undesirable.  One suggestion made in its favour as regards location was that Kingsbridge was the terminus at which the greater percentage of Deputies from the country arrived, and that it would be convenient for them.  But a Deputy has to go to his hotel and at the adjournments it will be found that Kilmainham is an inconvenient locality, apart from the other disadvantages.  I am not going to labour the disadvantages of structure, as I have not had an opportunity of inspecting the building.  The statement of Deputy Cooper is sufficient evidence to show that after a large expenditure of public money you will have a very disappointing result. In view of that statement, I think Deputies should hesitate to approve of the selection of Kilmainham, either as a temporary or permanent home for the Oireachtas.  I therefore am in favour of the suggestion of Deputy Thrift.  If effect be given to it, it will probably lead to the suggestion of other buildings or sites.  Deputy Woulfe has referred to one.  He gives the assurance that the accommodation to be provided in the building that he has in his mind will be ample for the purpose of both Houses, and the location is an excellent one.  Furthermore, he believes that it will be quite possible, in fact very likely, that the owner of the premises will be willing to accommodate us, temporarily, at any rate.  I suggest that if the Committee are going to consider the question of sites, they should at the same time consider the question of bringing a permanent building into being.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the site suggested by Deputy Thrift is an admirable one.  Immediately opposite. <Col N="2916" /> I think, you have the site for a permanent home for the Oireachtas in Merrion Square.  The sooner we address ourselves to the question of providing a permanent building the better, because it will limit to a considerable extent the expenditure that would be incurred in the provision of a temporary building.  The President has referred to the fact that when this building was originally taken over the assumption was that we would be in occupation for no more than eight months.  We have considerably exceeded our welcome.  I think it is unfair to the R.D.S. that we should trespass further on the liberal accommodation that they have afforded us.  There is no good in making the suggestion that you can compensate a society of that kind by providing temporary accommodation for them or by monetary remuneration.  Societies of that kind are associated with certain locations, and like business houses, when they depart from the area in which their business has been created, failure usually follows.  I think it is unfair, taking into account the circumstances in which temporary accommodation was provided for us by the R.D.S., that we should trespass further on them.  I, therefore, am in agreement with the proposal of Deputy Thrift that this matter be again referred to the Committee to see if a better suggestion than that contained in their Report is not possible.</P>

      <P>I did not argue the question from the point of view of the advantages of the building suggested. I confined myself to one point in my opening statement, and I propose to continue that.  I wanted the Dáil to be in the position of saying, if it became ultimately necessary to take over these buildings, that that course was not adopted until every possible avenue of escape from it had been explored.  I do not believe that these buildings are suitable for our purpose.  They are entirely inadequate.  They are uncomfortable in their present form, and they do not give us nearly enough space.  I do believe that it is possible to erect either on Leinster Lawn or Merrion Square, or possibly somewhere else, a building which will enable us to <Col N="2917" /> carry on our work for ten or fifteen years at a comparatively small cost, and which will look ornamental and be a real credit to us.  Therefore, contenting myself with the mere statement of that belief, I suggest that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case from general considerations for asking the Committee to consider fully a proposal which they had not already <Col N="2918" /> fully considered.  From the speeches which have been made, I think there is a readiness on the part of the Dáil to ask the Committee to reconsider the matter, and I content myself with leaving it at that.</P>

    <P>In doing so, perhaps I had better give some explanations of the history and meaning of this Treaty.  It will be remembered that somewhere about 1919 the Constitution of the United States was amended, in what was known as the 18th Article, to prohibit the manufacture of alcoholic liquor in the United States and the transportation through import into, or export from the United States, of alcoholic liquor.  That amendment of the Constitution was made law by an Act known as the Volsted Act.  From that time on there was a great deal of international difficulty. On the one hand there was a large remunerative, highly immoral business carried on of importing liquor into the United States.  The United States authorities found it necessary to wage a sort of war on that traffic.  On the one hand they found it highly important that they should be able to extend their powers of search and seizure outside what is known as the three-mile limit.  On the other hand, when these cases came into court, the United States Courts declared that under the Volsted Act it was illegal for any ship in United States territorial waters to have alcoholic liquor on board.  By way of finding a <i>modus vivendi</i> between various nations, this Treaty comes along.  Under this Treaty the United States authorities have power to search vessels, and if necessary, seize their contents within an area which can extend beyond the three-mile limit.  That is an area represented by one hour's journey by the ship that would bring the liquor to the land.  That is done because it was the habit of the liquor traffickers, commonly known as &ldquo;boot-leggers,&rdquo; to have a ship to take the liquor from <Col N="2919" /> another country and to stop outside the area of the United States territorial waters.  Boats would then go from the shore, generally fast motor boats, take the liquor from the ship and transport it to the land.  Under the old system a ship, by staying outside the territorial waters, claimed to be exempt from any action by the United States authorities. This Treaty will allow the authorities to search and make seizures within an area represented by one hour's travelling. At the same time, foreign vessels will be allowed to have liquor on board, which is part of ships stores, or stores which they may be transporting, not to the United States, but to some other country, merely making a United States port a port of call.  They will be allowed to have such liquor on board under seal.  The Treaty became necessary as that could not be done by a non-Treaty agreement.  It was felt, in view of the finding of the United States courts, that the matter might again come into court, where it might be ruled that, as the law stood, no ship had a right to have liquor on board in United States territorial waters.  The Treaty, presumably, when ratified by the United States Legislature, will have the effect of having a more binding, more powerful and more judicial effect than the Volsted Act.  This Treaty has been signed in Washington.</P>
    <P>I notice that a Deputy proposes to move an amendment recommending that the Dáil &ldquo;withholds approval of the ratification of the said Treaty pending consideration of the full text of same.&rdquo;  When I saw that first I did not quite understand what the point of it was, but yesterday in the Seanad, when moving this Resolution, I was told that a story was being spread abroad that we were actually attempting to conceal part of the Treaty.  I may as well inform the Dáil that the whole Treaty is on the Orders of the Day and that the Dáil is committed to nothing it has not got before it.  The whole Treaty is there as it is submitted to us, and as we agreed to its signature. In view of the misrepresentation which I am told has taken place, I will read what is known as the Preamble. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2920" /> His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India;</P>
    <P>And the President of the United States of America;</P>
    <P>Being desirous of avoiding any difficulties which might arise between them in connection with the laws in force in the United States on the subject of alcoholic beverages;</P>
    <P>Have decided to conclude a convention for that purpose;</P>
    <P>And have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries;</P>
    <P>His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India;</P>
    <P>The Right Honourable Sir Auckland Campbell Geddes, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., his Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States of America;</P>
    <P>The President of the United States of America;</P>
    <P>Charles Evans Hughes, Secretary of State of the United States.</P>
    <P>I understood from my informant that exception was taken to the title attributed to the Crown, &ldquo;King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;  I may as well explain that that is the title still held by the Crown.  In order to change it, it would be necessary to have an Act of Parliament in the British Parliament.  I have called the attention of the British authorities to the fact that this title is no longer descriptive of fact.  One might say that it is like the title borne by His Brittanic Majesty up to about the time of the Union of the Irish and English Parliament, namely, &ldquo;King of France.&rdquo; It was a description without relation to fact.  I have not pressed nor urged the British Government to take immediate steps for rectification pending the settlement of the boundary question here.  I recommend that the Dáil approve of this Resolution.  I may say that the Executive Council were consulted with regard to what action was to be taken as to whether or not this Treaty should be agreed to.  Actually we recommend that it should be agreed to because we were necessarily sympathetic to the Government of the United States.  During the <Col N="2921" /> last two years we were very seriously affected by the illegal traffic of bringing arms into this country for the purpose of waging war upon the people.  During that time, if we had rather more shipping power than we possessed it would have been a very great convenience to us if we had wider powers of search and seizure.  As a Government, we recognise that every Government must take every means in its power, and that no one outside has a right to try to interfere with that Government in enforcing the laws of that country.  The law of America is prohibition, and the American Government is bound to use all the means in its power to enforce that law.  We feel that it is our duty to meet them in every possible way, and in no way to attempt to put any hindrance or difficulty in their way in enforcing the laws in their own country.</P>

      <P>In the Third Paragraph to delete all words after the words &ldquo;Dáil Eireann&rdquo; to the end of the paragraph, and to substitute therefor the words, &ldquo;withholds approval of the ratification of the said Treaty pending consideration of the full text of same.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to waste the time of the Dáil by talking, but very grave matters are raised in this Treaty and also, possibly, very controversial matters.  It is absolutely impossible for us to discuss these matters until we have the full text of the Treaty before us, and it is in order that the Dáil would have an opportunity <Col N="2922" /> of considering these questions that I move this amendment.  I hope that I will give sufficient reasons to the Dáil why it should insist on having the full text before it.  We have seen in the Press, and it has been stated by the Minister, that a similar motion was passed by the Seanad yesterday.  The Minister then read out, as he has read out to-day, a portion of the Treaty which is not on the Order Paper.  He read out a very important portion of the Treaty in which, on two occasions, it uses the term &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and he stated, I understand from the Press report, in the Seanad, that that was not an essential portion of the Treaty.  He stated here to-day that the whole Treaty was on the Order Paper.  The point that the preamble of a treaty is not an essential portion of a treaty, or that a treaty without a preamble is a treaty at all, is contrary to the opinion of all authorities on international law, and also, I think, contrary to commonsense.</P>
    <P>I will, with the indulgence of the Dáil, read a short paragraph on the matter in the work of Oppenheim, which is standard work in the English language on international law.  In volume 1, page 666, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following order in making treaty is usually observed.  A first part, the so-called preamble, comprises the names of the heads of the contracting States, of their duly authorised representatives, and the motives for the conclusion of the treaty.  A second part consists of the primary stipulations in numbered articles.  A third part consists of miscellaneous stipulations concerning the duration of the treaty, its ratification, the accession of third Powers, and the like.  The last part comprises the signatures of the representatives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we have on the Order Paper certain articles of agreement and certain stipulations with regard to ratification and duration, but we have not got the first part of the Treaty, that is to say, the preamble, and we have not the last paragraph, that is, the signatures of the plenipotentiaries.  It is, as I said, practically the unanimous opinion of all authorities on international <Col N="2923" /> law that these various parts of treaties are equally essential.  I have read a quotation from Oppenheim.  Bassett Moore, in his digest on international law, which was prepared under the auspices of the American Government, in Volume 5 uses practically identical language.  Nys, in his book on international law, states that each part of the Treaty is essential.  Practically the same words are used by Pradier-Fodéré, and Jellinek, and other authorities.  A treaty is an international legal document, and this Treaty is a legal document, and it is particularly so in this case.  It is not only an international legal document, but it is about to become a municipal legal document as well.  I will deal later with this question as it affects the Constitution of the United States, and the position which this Treaty will occupy in the municipal law of the United States. I think it is very scant courtesy to the Dáil in this resolution to approve of the ratification of the whole Treaty without the Dáil having seen the entire text of it.  I maintain that it is an unconstitutional procedure, that the Dáil should be asked to approve of a certain legal document without having the legal document before us.</P>
    <P>We find in the preamble to this motion it is stated &ldquo;Whereas, etc., Articles of Agreement for a Treaty respecting regulations of the liquor traffic outside the territorial waters of the United States of America,&rdquo; and it is stated that we have the tenor appearing in the Schedule.  Why the word &ldquo;tenor&rdquo; is used in that connection I do not know.  Surely it would be an obvious thing for the Minister to put down the text of the Treaty and not its tenor.  This is in striking contradiction to another motion which the Minister has down for Tuesday&mdash;a motion for ratifying a Convention with regard to agricultural labour.  In that we find that the terms of it are set out in the schedule hereto.  We find in that motion the word &ldquo;terms&rdquo; used, while in this motion the word &ldquo;tenor&rdquo; is used.  It is a curious distinction in phraseology.  Why is the same procedure not adopted in these two cases?  These are matters which, I think, the Dáil has a right to <Col N="2924" /> know.  Possibly the Minister is of the opinion that the Dáil is so fragile in its health that the shock of putting down the preamble to this Treaty on the Order Paper would cause grievous harm to the members of the Dáil.  The Seanad was asked yesterday to pass an identical motion, and I maintain that the Seanad was not treated fairly in that matter.</P>

      <P>No; it is not for us.  I would only point out that even the members of the Seanad who supported this motion stated that they presumed that the text of the Treaty was as stated on the Order Paper, that there was nothing hidden, and that they relied on the Minister putting them right on the matter.  He put them right only to the same extent as he put us right here. The Minister read out something about the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. What exactly is this United Kingdom, and what are its functions? He has tried to make light of the matter by pretending that it is only a question of the title of the King.  I am afraid that that is not the case.  A Treaty in international law is not between persons or sovereigns, but between States.  This Treaty has been, I understand, passed by the Senate of the United States, and in the Constitution of the United States it is provided that once a treaty has been passed by the Senate it becomes <i>ipso facto</i> part of the municipal law of the United States.  I understand that this particular Treaty is being inscribed in the municipal law of the United States as a Treaty between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that is the term which is used in the inscription of this Treaty in the Municipal Laws of the United States.  I understand when this Treaty comes to be ratified or registered in the League of Nations, that likewise it will be described as a Treaty between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States of America. Treaties have been ratified during 1923 at the League of Nations&mdash;I have seen the official publications&mdash;and also, I believe, in 1924 between &ldquo;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and <Col N="2925" /> Ireland,&rdquo; and some other country.  It is now two years and four months since a Treaty was signed in London of which the First Article states that Ireland shall be styled and be known as the Irish Free State.  We are now asked in this Dáil to approve of a Treaty without having the full text before us, and the parts which are left out, as the Minister has read out to the Dáil, refer to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  I do not see how we can discuss the grave matter which this Treaty raises unless we are in possession of the full text.  There is a further section of the Treaty which has not yet been communicated to the Dáil, and that is the final section, the Signatures. One would think that was an essential portion of the Treaty.  The Minister has not mentioned that.  He stated that Sir Auckland Geddes had signed this Treaty.  We will have to discuss when we get the text of the Treaty whether Sir Auckland Geddes was authorised by this State to sign this Treaty on our behalf. We cannot discuss these things until we have the text of the Treaty.  In to-day's Press a message from Melbourne states that in the Commonwealth House of Representatives yesterday a motion proposed by Mr. Bruce in favour of printing the Lausanne Treaty so as to enable ratification of peace with Turkey was carried without dissent.</P>
    <P>This Treaty with Turkey is contained in a large volume which has maps.  It cost me 8/-.  The Prime Minister of Australia has sufficient regard for the House of Representatives to have this Treaty published and printed in Australia for the information of the House before they decided to ratify it.  Yet the Minister has not had the courtesy even to add these few extra lines which are essential for this House in order that it may discuss this Treaty properly.  I do not wish to enter into all the questions raised by the Treaty at this point, but I do say it will be very ill advised to agree to a legal document that is not only legal internationally but will be part of the laws of another country.  I think the Dáil would be ill advised to agree to this document without having the full text before it.  I raise this point not in any spirit of hostility to <Col N="2926" /> the British Government nor in any spirit of disrespect to any high personage, but some members seem to be under the impression that our relations with Great Britain are something very terrible and dangerous, and that they should not be mentioned in public.  That is the contrary of the truth.  Our relations with Great Britain should be, and, I hope, are on the most friendly terms, and it is only right that the Dáil should have an opportunity of discussing our constitutional relations with Great Britain on an important matter such as the first Treaty the Government has asked the Dáil to approve of.  At a later stage, when we get the full text of the Treaty, we will be in a position to discuss the constitutional matters raised.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment.  I do not think the House is fairly treated by the Minister for External Affairs when he leaves out the preamble.  It is like playing the confidence trick on the House.  It is not the first Treaty or agreement made by the Minister about which we know nothing at all.  Notices have appeared within the last two years in the Press of commercial treaties, but the House was not informed of them.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words in support of the amendment. The question of the seas and the general question of the territorial waters should interest us in Ireland very much because they affected our position in relation to England for hundreds of years.  I think it is generally accepted that the question of England's rights or the assertion of her rights to control the seas around Ireland or the East Coast was one of the greatest obstacles we had to contend with in fighting for the measure of freedom which we have won.  Coming to this question of the Treaty, I say at the outset that I am against any such methods such as those resorted to by the Minister for External Affairs in asking the Dáil to vote for or to support the motion in favour of a Treaty or a convention, a very small part of which is only <Col N="2927" /> made public, and a few articles of which we are only furnished with on paper.  It is a serious matter, because the whole question of popular representation is involved.</P>

Now, to begin with, I object to the mention of the King as one of the contracting parties to this document.  I object to the title, which one of the contracting parties claims, as head of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  The Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland gave us a status which, I believe, ended for all time the title United Kingdom, or should have done so.  Two years or more have elapsed since that Treaty was signed, and this title should be wiped out by legislation or otherwise. Now, coming to the subject of the Treaty itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The main question, in my opinion, is whether the Dáil&mdash;this popular assembly&mdash;should commit itself to a document which may mean leaving permanently on the Statute books, or <Col N="2928" /> the records, of other nations, the title of the &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;  It is a very serious question, and it is a subject which the Dáil should give very serious attention to before committing themselves in any way, by voting for it, or otherwise.</P>
      <P>If this is a Treaty between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, as they call it, and the United States we, as a State claiming independence of that unit, should not bother our heads about it, because it does not settle the business one way or the other.

      <P>To his mind it may appear to be meticulously critical that we should insist that these things which the Treaty of December, 1921, rendered obsolete should not again appear in the laws affecting this State.

      <P>I am sorry if I have transgressed.  I quite see I was wrong. But the Minister uttered in the Dáil practically a repetition of it, and therefore I think I can refer to it.  If this title of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland is obsolete, if it is a thing that was dismissed or eliminated by the Treaty of 1921, between this country and Great Britain, why does it reappear here, and why are we asked to accept it as a definition of our part in the family of nations?</P>
      <P>Why has that particular portion of the Treaty been omitted&mdash;that particular portion which gives rise to controversy, and which describes us as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland?  It cannot have been for the purpose of economy in printing. It cannot have been that those who were preparing the Orders of the Day forgot to insert it.  It must have been that the Minister considered that this particular portion would be resented by the Dáil and the country, and that therefore it was well to leave that out; nobody would then fall to what was being done; this thing would be smuggled through and the country would be unaware of what it was being committed to.</P>
      <P>Now, I say if that is a true interpretation of what has been done, it was a deliberate attempt to hoodwink this Assembly, and unless there can be a better explanation of this particular omission than has already been given, then it nearly becomes the duty of someone in this Assembly to move that the Minister responsible for that omission is no longer worthy of the confidence of the Assembly.  I beg to move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>In any case, this Treaty, so far as it has been disclosed, has no reference to Irish life.  I do not want to discuss it; but there is nothing disclosed in the Treaty as given to us which indicates that there is any Saorstát interest affected.  The Minister tells us that he did not press this question on the British authorities pending the decision of the Boundary Commission. I want to know what, in God's name, has the decision of the Boundary Commission got to do with this question? Is the Boundary Commission going to decide whether or not the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland still survives?  I think the Boundary Commission will have its work set out to deal with the things that will really be pertinent to its inquiries without going into that question, which now only concerns antiquarians and the Minister for External Affairs.  I say we not only want the production of the full text, but we ought to have the despatches between the Minister for External Affairs of the Saorstát and the responsible Minister in Great Britain. Let us know what has led up to this. Let us know what is the meaning of producing a mutilated document, and asking <Col N="2931" /> us to endorse the full meaning and implications of the whole document. Let us have the full story now that we have such an epidemic of inquiries into things that are done in secrecy.  Let us have this little ray of illumination in the full glare of the sunlight that is going to be thrown on all dark places. Deputy McCarthy spoke of other Treaties. What are they?  Where are they? With whom?  I think it is fortunate that this particular Treaty has appeared in the way it has, because it has given us reason to think seriously of how our relations with other States are being dealt with.  Now, I saw in the British Parliament the other day an announcement that all Treaties were going to be laid on the Table of that Assembly.  If they are finished with secret diplomacy over there, while there is no reason really why we should take precedent from them, still let us not start with that old game of secret diplomacy in this new-born State.  If there is nothing to conceal, then let us have everything produced.  If there is something to conceal, then let those responsible for it bear the weight of that responsibility; but we shall not allow this State to be deprived of its legitimate status by any hole-and-corner methods or by any flippant, airy but inadequate explanations by any Minister.  We have now come to the time of plain speaking. I hope it will continue.  For my part, I intend to speak fairly straight and bluntly to any Minister in the Dáil when the necessity arises.</P>

      <P>There has been a suggestion all through this debate that an attempt has been made to conceal things.  In the speech of the last speaker also there was the suggestion made that they wanted the secret despatches that were written about this matter.  I understood from the remarks, however, that it was suggested that there were despatches between the British Government and this Government suggesting the omission of the preamble.  I may as well say, as far as this is concerned, the only despatches that occurred on the negotiations were not between this Government and the British Government. They were between the Attorney-General and myself.  I submitted the Treaty as we got it to the Attorney-General for drafting. The draft is as he drafted it, and as it is now before the Dáil.  There has been a lot of correspondence about this Treaty, and the terms of the Treaty are set out in the Order Paper.  Those are the terms of the Treaty as we got them, and as we agreed to them.  We put them before the Dáil exactly as we got them. In the setting out of the Treaty, as Deputy Esmonde said, there is usually a preamble.  The Treaty of the 6th December, 1921, changed the existing state of affairs, but it did not change a certain British Act, the Royal Titles Act; it changed the meaning that can be attributed to that Act in fact, not the words of that Act.  It did not really change them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official title of the Crown is, as I read out there, &ldquo;King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo; The official title was before the Act of Union of 1800&mdash;King of the United Kingdom.  It is a matter for the English people to decide whether they will continue the title of King of the United <Col N="2933" /> Kingdom, and if they propose that the term King of the United Kingdom remain, it is a matter of the definition that applies to that.  If, for instance, the result of the Boundary Commission were that the territory known as Northern Ireland, which is not now subject to the legislation of this Government, came under the legislation of this Government, conceivably the royal title would remain possibly King of the United Kingdom, but the definition of United Kingdom there would be, as before the Union, United Kingdom of England and Scotland.</P>
    <P>It is also possible&mdash;I do not want to anticipate things or in any way prejudice things&mdash;that as a result of the findings of the Boundary Commission, or as a result of whatever arrangement is come to under Article 12 of the Treaty, that a certain part of Northern Ireland may remain as it is at present, outside the jurisdiction of this Government.  In that case it is conceivable that the royal title.  &ldquo;King of the United Kingdom,&rdquo; might have a definition to it as United Kingdom of England, Scotland, and such an area known as Ireland.  As I said before, the royal title up to about 1800 was &ldquo;king of Great Britain and of France.&rdquo;  The people of France might have protested to their Government periodically about this thing, but it was the fact that counted there; the title existed until its non-relation to fact made it meaningless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the people of France subscribe to that and accept it, as you are asking us to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking you to do anything of the sort.  I say it was not one of the clauses of the Treaty of the 6th December, 1921, that the Royal Titles Bill must be immediately amended.  As a matter of fact at the present time, if the British people want to keep the term &ldquo;United Kingdom,&rdquo; as they have a perfect right to do, it is a matter then of the definition of the United Kingdom, and at the present moment that is not a matter which has been finally settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not suggest, as there was an attempt made to represent me as suggesting, that the Boundary Commission was going to consider Royal titles.  I said <Col N="2934" /> nothing of the sort, but I say that the definition attaching to the Royal title, if the term &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo; remains, may vary according to the findings of the Boundary Commission, or according to the result of whatever action is taken under Article 12 of the Treaty.  For that reason, I do not urge the thing as I otherwise might have done, but at the same time if the British Government refuses to bring in an Act of Parliament to amend the Royal Titles Act, I am not at this moment aware of how you can force them to bring in such an Act any more than they can force us to bring in an Act.  I for one would very much resent any attempt on their part to force us to bring in an Act, merely because something here was not in proper relation to fact.</P>
    <P>Subject to the correction of the Attorney-General, I do not say that we have any power to put it up to the British Government that they are bound to bring in any Act of Parliament.  As their law stands, and until a new Royal Titles Act is brought in, the Royal titles remain as they are.  There has been a consistent attempt here to suggest that there was dishonesty in presenting the Treaty as we got it.  We presented it as we got it with our own preamble so far as it related to Ireland.  Until Deputy Esmonde spoke about the signatories, I had not even thought about this. This is a proposal for a Treaty between the United States, on the one hand, and the countries of the British Commonwealth of Nations on the other.  It is for the Executive Council, and in this case we might be described as asking for a direction and a recommendation from the Dáil, to say whether or not the terms contained in these Articles, as set forth on the Order Paper, shall be entered upon in our name.  It is a fact that treaties of this nature are entered into between the heads of States, between Sovereigns, and the vehicle used under the existing Constitution here is the machinery of the Crown.  That is the fact, and there is no good in trying to conceal it, that in this matter the Crown acts. I say this plainly because the newspapers did not report me quite properly to-day: that in this matter ratification is done at the instance of the Government&mdash;as far as the Free State is concerned <Col N="2935" /> at the instance of the Government of the Irish Free State&mdash;but the Crown is actually the machinery used. The full text of the Treaty was sent to us, and we were kept very closely informed about it.  As Deputy Esmonde knows, better perhaps than any other Deputy here, we ourselves recommended this Treaty.  Deputy Esmonde was there and agreed.  On one occasion we recommended its acceptance because we wished in no way to act in any unfriendly spirit or to attempt to be in any way unhelpful to the United States Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, may I say that I think the Minister's memory has failed him in the reference he has made to me.  I would not mention this, but for the fact that he stated that I was present at the Conference, and had agreed to this Treaty.  I challenge him to produce the reports of the Imperial Conference in which it is stated definitely in black and white, that there should be no treaty.  It was unanimously decided at the Imperial Conference that there should be no treaty; that no kind of agreement should require Parliamentary sanction.  It was decided that matter could be settled between Great Britain and America by an exchange of Notes, which is not an International treaty between the heads of States; but it is an agreement between the members of two Governments.  That was the unanimous decision at the Imperial Conference, and when the Minister says that I agreed to this Treaty he is utterly mistaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FITZGERALD Mr. FITZGERALD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FITZGERALD</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit, as far as I remember, that Deputy Esmonde agreed as to the general tenor, if I may use the word again, of this arrangement. Afterwards it was discovered, that in view of the result of legal actions, that the Volsted Act would and could be interpreted again in the law courts as it was interpreted before, and that the only means of overcoming that difficulty was the Treaty, and that is how the Treaty came along.  We actually ourselves recommended that this agreement should be entered into with America.  The undertakings that are <Col N="2936" /> given on the one side and on the other were submitted to us, and we finally recommended that they be signed.</P>
      <P>As far as this Dáil is concerned, I say, subject to correction by the Attorney-General, that the only thing binding on us are the terms of the Treaty, as set forth on the Order Paper.  I am advised by the Attorney-General that, as set forth in the Order Paper, it is quite correct.  As far as I am concerned, and as far as the Government is concerned, there was no attempt to conceal anything from anybody here.  We were asked ourselves did we agree to these terms.  We said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; that it was all subject to ratification, and that before we finally recommended ratification we would bring the same terms as were submitted to us before the Dáil, and ask it to agree with us in recommending the ratification of this Treaty.  As far as the signatories are concerned, Deputy Esmonde says that the Dáil has not seen them.  I have not seen the actual signatures myself.  There are two signatures so far attached, but the Treaty itself is not a fact until it is finally ratified, and it is for that ratification that we bring it before the Dáil.  The signatories are &ldquo;A. C. Geddes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Charles Evans Hughes.&rdquo;  They act as plenipotentiaries, as agents for the two heads of States, namely, the British Crown and the President of the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the signatories should act as representatives of the heads of States, and I think I gathered that the heads of States are to be presumed to be acting on instructions of the Governments of their respective countries.  It would be important, I think, to know whether there is any superscription indicating that the signatory, on behalf of the British Crown, has acted on behalf of the Government of the Saorstát, and for that reason I think it is important that the Dáil should be made aware, in its official records, on the Order Paper, of the full text of the proposed Treaty. But it is even more important that the Preamble should also be laid before the House formally, as well as the Articles of the Treaty proper.  The Preamble <Col N="2937" /> undoubtedly affects, and must affect, the reading and interpretation of the Articles.  I think the point made by Deputy Esmonde is a sound one; and he is to be congratulated on having brought this matter to our notice in the way he has done, both in the fact and in the manner of his bringing it forward. I support him in his view that the full text, from beginning to end, should be laid before us before we are asked to approve of the ratification of the Treaty and to recommend the Executive Council to advise the Crown on behalf of the Saorstát to approve of this Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend at this stage to go into the merits of the Treaty.  I think they have to be very carefully considered, and I agree that the matter is important; that is the matter of the method of approach and the way it has been brought before us, and the authority that has been given for entering into such an arrangement on behalf of the Saorstát. We will assume, from what the Minister has stated, that negotiations for this Treaty were instituted at the instigation or with the concurrence of the Executive Council of the Saorstát, and that the signatory for the British Crown has been acting as plenipotentiary, appointed by the Crown&mdash;acting on the advice of the Saorstát.  Are we right in that assumption, and is it so stated in the records of the United States Government?  Do they understand that Sir Auckland Geddes, when he put his signature to this, was acting as the plenipotentiary of the Saorstát?  It seems to me that notwithstanding what the British Government may think of this matter, when entering into negotiations which involve, in some degree, the Saorstát, the other party to the contract has the right to be quite clear that the person speaking on behalf of the British Crown is also speaking on behalf of Saorstát Eireann specifically appointed for that purpose.  Are we entitled to believe that that is the fact, or is it that the Treaty is to be ratified after it has been made, and that no authority was specifically given by the Government of the Saorstát to enter into these negotiations? We may find from the text of the proposed Treaty between the Saorstát and the United States that all that is made perfectly <Col N="2938" /> clear and easily understood, but we ought not be asked to assume it, or even to deny it, until the text has been laid before us.  Without going into the other matters I support the amendment proposed by Deputy Esmonde, and I ask the Ministry to accede to the suggestion so that proper discussion upon the merits of the Treaty may be brought forward at the earliest possible date.</P>

It is a reasonable thing to expect that before the Dáil would consent to the ratification of the Treaty that the full text should be given to Deputies, and on that question of fact I am going to support the amendment.  Deputy Esmonde says we have not got it, but the Minister for External Affairs says we have to a certain extent, but that there are certain eliminations.  Without going into the question of law, I say that before we agree to ratify this Treaty I believe we ought to know its full text.  No answer was given to the point raised by Deputy Esmonde in regard to the word &ldquo;tenor.&rdquo;  In one case we were asked to ratify an agreement the terms of which were submitted.  In the other case we were asked to affirm a Treaty the tenor of which was submitted.  I think we have a right to insist upon the full terms and on the facts more than any of the other Self-governing Colonies.</P>

      <P>I am only speaking here as a man not versed in Constitutional Law.  I am speaking as a common citizen, and I am saying how a common citizen would recognise the King, and we in Ireland only want to visualise the position and to show by our action that we do not recognise him in his title as King of Great Britain and Ireland.  He is King of Great Britain and a piece of Ireland if you like, but we do not recognise him in that way.  It may be so in law, but the ordinary man in the street does not understand him in that way, and the Government and the Minister, by omitting to put that particular point, knows that feeling is there, and why not let us understand where we are?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have been referred to in connection with the motion on the Paper, there are one or two observations I would like to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schedule to the motion on the Paper contains all the articles of the proposed Treaty.  As I understand, it will not be a Treaty until it is ratified. It is at the moment a group of Articles which have been negotiated, and, so far as the representatives of heads of States were able to do so, they have negotiated and arrived at those Articles, and those articles must subsequently be ratified by the various Parliaments involved.  The Dominion position does involve that, as regards political treaties, the Crown is the mouthpiece through which the various Dominions speak assent or dissent, and it is for the purpose of indicating through that mouthpiece such assent or dissent that the Motion is on the Paper. In the negotiated Articles as they appear over the hands of the negotiators &mdash;and I understand that during these negotiations the Government itself was kept in close touch with every phase of the negotiations&mdash;one of them describes himself as the plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty, and he sets out certain titles and designations in full description of his Britannic Majesty.  It did appear to me that if those were set down in the Order Paper we could not assent to the Treaty, including those, because we could not assent to the particular description of the British Crown, and it did seem to <Col N="2940" /> me that the only way that we could deal with the terms, as they had been arrived at, subject to ratification, would be to see whether or not we agree with them.  We could not involve ourselves in saying whether or not we agreed with Mr. Geddes' description of the titles of the British Crown.  The position as regards the titles is this.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; is one of the series of expressions which have been attached to the British Crown by an Act known as the Royal Titles Act, which is internationally recognised.  I believe that it is a necessary implication of the Treaty that that royal title must be modified.  The Minister has said that the question as to whether the British are bound to bring in an Act to change the title is one for the Attorney-General. I dissent.  That is a political matter; it is not a mere legal technicality; it is one of the constitutional and political matters arising from the Treaty to which we are parties, and I believe that it is a necessary implication of that Treaty that, as soon as it can be conveniently done, the British Government should take steps to make the necessary modifications in the Royal Titles Act.  It has been already pointed out to them, by myself among others, that there is no great difficulty, because the expression, &ldquo;United Kingdom,&rdquo; was one which existed before the Act of Union, so that it is a matter that ought not to present to them any great difficulty.  It is one that ought to be pressed upon them, and I am not sure that this opportunity may not be a useful one for pressing the point.  It does occur to me that perhaps there may be a way of dealing with it here in this way, that while the Dáil might assent to the terms, if it approves of them, it might, at the same time, instruct the Government that it is to direct attention to this matter of the titles, and to say that such assent must not be expressed through the Crown as representing the former United Kingdom but as representing the Dominion of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add a few words to reinforce what the Attorney-General <Col N="2941" /> has said; not that I believe or would suggest that what he has said requires strengthening, but simply because it sometimes happens that when a great legal authority makes a pronouncement, ordinary people go away under the impression that it is some subtle, ingenious, juristic point which may not be sound in the view of the man of ordinary commonsense, and it is to add support to what he said that I speak, merely from the point of view of the ordinary man.  I have another purpose. It is to repudiate in the strongest terms that I am at liberty to use within the limits of Parliamentary procedure what Deputy Wilson said a few moments ago.  It is not within the competence of a Deputy, who has promised his allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State, and has promised also to be faithful to the Treaty, to repudiate the very first Article of that Treaty where there is a question of the fullest and most explicit assertion of the rights of the Irish nation in consequence of that Treaty.  Deputy Wilson professes to be supporting Deputy Esmonde, and he is under the impression, I believe honestly under the impression, that he is doing something fine and patriotic, whereas he is declaring that to be a fact which, if it were correctly described by him as a fact, would mean that there is no Irish nation at all, and, therefore, no Irish nation whose rights require to be asserted in this full, public, and explicit fashion.  The first Article of the Treaty is: &ldquo;Ireland shall have the same constitutional status in the community of nations and shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  Ireland is the Irish Free State; the Free State is Ireland.  It is not, as Deputy Wilson suggests, portion of Ireland. It is the whole of Ireland that is described in the first Article of the Treaty as the Irish Free State: &ldquo;Ireland shall be styled and known as the Irish Free State,&rdquo; and that is the style it ought to have in any amended form of the Royal title.  We should no longer hear of Great Britain and Ireland in the old-fashioned sense, and the old-fashioned connotation, but we should hear of Great Britain and the Irish Free State, or, if you like to give a fuller expression, include Ireland among the community <Col N="2942" /> of free nations known as the British Commonwealth of Dominions, and so on.  Deputy Wilson is one of the many people&mdash;and I deal with him as a type&mdash;who would have the public believe that when we protest against partition we are in some wise under the impression that Ireland has been dismembered, whereas what has happened, and what it is necessary that he should understand, is that the area of jurisdiction of the Irish Free State is, pending certain negotiations, limited to twenty-six counties.</P>

We have here to-day what seems to be not more than a tempest in a tea-cup, except in so far as it provides an opportunity for allowing the Dáil to express a considered judgment on this whole matter.  One of the Deputies referred to the Treaty with Turkey.  That has been ratified by Australia; but the very latest news from Canada is that Canada has refused to ratify it; and that is of enormous importance in this connection, because the second Article of the Treaty is that the relationship of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on the amendment, following what was said by the Attorney-General.  I think the proposition in the amendment is useful, but forcing it to a division, or debating it as if it were in some way essentially in conflict with <Col N="2943" /> the position of the Minister for External Affairs, is a mistake.  I think, Sir, you would rule that that is in order. It became necessary as a sort of prelude to what I am saying to deal with the extravaganzas of Deputy Wilson, to put them out of the way, because someone might assume that a Deputy speaking on a matter of this sort knew what he was speaking of.  There is, I suggest, no essential conflict between the position taken up by the Attorney-General and that taken up by Deputy Esmonde, because both exercise their powers of interpretation and their knowledge of the constitutional position to the same end.  One omits the obsolescent, or the obsolete, if you like. At the same time, as to the use on the other side of the water of the title of the Crown, one leaves that out specifically, and the other wishes to have it brought in, but the purpose in view in both cases, paradoxical as it may seem, is identical: it is to safeguard the position of Ireland in regard to these Treaties, and to see that the law, practice and constitutional usage of Canada, which is to determine our position in relation to the Crown, the Imperial Parliament or Government, shall govern this situation.  I was about to say, when the question of order was raised, that the bringing forward of the amendment was valuable, because it has forced to the forefront the consideration of this very important question of the status and rights of Ireland, but, on the other hand, I believe there is no necessity to carry the matter further, so as to have a division, for example, on the amendment, because those who support the amendment of the Attorney-General are, so far as regards the basic aspect of the question, at one.</P>

      <P>I had intended not to make any statement on this matter, because I felt to a large extent that it is outside the purview of the ordinary man in the street.  At the same time I resent to a certain extent the imputations made by Deputy Professor Magennis against Deputy Wilson, because I maintain Deputy Wilson has a right to get up and express his point of view on <Col N="2944" /> any matter, and nothing must be reserved for specialists or people who think they have a right to monopolise the discussion on any particular subject. I am sure Deputy Wilson was giving his honest point of view on the matter, and I think the Dáil has a right to hear and respect his view.  I think this matter is one of very great importance, because precedents may be established now which would control the whole future of this country, and consequently will give rise to discussions&mdash;perhaps acrimonious discussions.  I think it is very advisable we should not take any move in regard to this matter without being absolutely certain we are doing the right thing.  With regard to the Treaty, there are one or two points&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the postponement of the Treaty, I think it is advisable that it should be postponed so that we may have placed before us the full text, and that we may know what we are sanctioning.  I think it is not right that we in this Free State, a Self-governing Dominion, should delegate to the representatives of Great Britain the right to make treaties for us, in the making of which we have no voice, and which we are simply asked to ratify when they are made.  I ask the Minister for External Affairs what would be the effect if we refused to ratify a treaty.  We have simply to accept it <i>in globo</i> or refuse to ratify it altogether.  With regard to the title of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, we understand from Deputy Magennis that the king is King of Canada and King of South Africa.  We do not hear the title of the King of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, and South Africa, but Ireland is very distinctly referred to in that title.</P>

He called himself King of France, and he might now, according to the Minister for External Affairs, call himself King of Ireland.  I may remind the Minister for External Affairs that the King has called himself for a considerable time Defender of the Faith, and we in this country deny his right to that title. Similarly, we might reasonably deny his right to call himself King of Ireland, and I think very likely, having regard to the courtesies that exist between free States, that if it were suggested to the Government of England that it was inadvisable that any title which did not meet with the approval of the people of this country, and which concerned this country should form portion of his title, the English Government would not persist in such a title.</P>

That is the difference between one man and another.  The drafting of one was done by one man and the drafting of the other by another.  The actual situation, as I tried to explain, is that these Articles set out on the Order Paper were submitted to us and we actually agreed that they should be signed.

Had we done so we would have had to bring it forward in its present condition, because at that time these were the Articles of Agreement that had been submitted to us and whose signature we had recommended.  In bringing it forward in this form there was no proposal to commit the Dáil to more than the Dáil actually had before it.  We have not yet discussed the terms of the Preamble, which only reached us at a later date and which, Deputy Esmonde will be relieved to hear, can be now bought for 2d.&mdash;not quite as expensive as the Lausanne Treaty.  The Dáil is only asked to be committed to the terms of this.  After that it leaves it perfectly free to the Executive Council to take up with the British Government the terms set forth in the Preamble which, as I say, we only received at a later date.</P>

We only ask the Dáil to <Col N="2947" /> be committed to what we put before it. As I say, we put it before the Dáil exactly as it came before ourselves. This came before us at a certain date and we agreed to its signature.  We put it before the Dáil at that stage and ask the Dáil to agree to the same thing. At a later date a document comes before us containing this Preamble, on which we have so far not made any recommendation.  Before we make any recommendation or commit ourselves with regard to the Preamble, it is possible to have the Preamble brought before the Dáil and ask for its assent.  At the present moment the Dáil is only asked to assent to what it has before it, and assenting to that leaves it open to discuss the matter of this Preamble.</P>

With regard to the Royal titles, I want to point out that the words &ldquo;His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; have actually no relationship with Ireland.  They are not included in that part of the title. The relationship with Ireland comes in in the later part, &ldquo;of the British Dominions <Col N="2948" /> beyond the Seas.&rdquo;  It is as &ldquo;British Dominions beyond the Seas&rdquo; we are included, and not as the &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo; Although the name Ireland is used in one title and not in the other, the relationship between the Crown and this country is contained in the one in which the name of Ireland is not mentioned, and is not contained in the one in which Ireland is mentioned.</P>

      <P>I only want to say, as I already stated, this Treaty is one legal whole.  It is there, and is an Act of International Law, and you either accept, reject or amend it.  Even if there is an amendment as suggested approving of the Articles of Agreement, that implies that we do not approve of the whole Treaty.  The Treaty, as I said, is composed of several parts&mdash;probably four parts.  It is one single whole; an ordinary legal document, and cannot be divided up into sections like that.  Ratification has no significance whatever in International law if some section of the Treaty is left out.  The principal point made in the Dáil has been that the matter of the title is of no importance. It is not only a matter of the title.  This Treaty, I say, is being inscribed in the law of the United States as a Treaty between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States.  It will be inscribed in the same phraseology in the League of Nations.  For that reason, and in order that we may have the full text before us before deciding, I still press my amendment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in my name, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Minister for Agriculture be directed to take action in the matter of the conditions obtaining with regard to the importation of Irish cattle into Great Britain on the lines suggested by the Irish Cattle Exporters Association at their meeting on the 12th March, 1924, viz., that the Free State and Northern Ireland Governments hold themselves responsible for payment of compensation for live stock compulsorily slaughtered in British lairages until the usual detention period of ten hours expires, and after that that representations be made to the British Government to accept liability for payment when proof is established that the disease was contracted in Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a question of vital interest and of considerable importance, not alone to the men engaged in the export trade of Irish live stock, but to the whole agricultural community of the Saorstát. Accordingly, I would ask the sympathetic attention of the Dáil to the views I am going to put forward. These views are the considered opinion of the whole live stock trade, and I am glad to say they have received the sympathetic consideration of the Party to which I have the honour to belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2951" /> In order to put Deputies in possession of the full facts of the case, I will commence by stating the present position. Deputies are aware that all live stock exported from this country are at present subjected to a detention period of ten hours at the ports of landing in Great Britain, after which if they show a clean bill of health a licence is issued for their removal to their destination.  As matters stand at present, if those cattle, sheep or pigs, while being detained in the lairages, contract foot and mouth disease, they are slaughtered by order of the British Board of Agriculture, and no compensation is paid to the owners either by the British or Irish Governments, because the lairages in which they are kept are regarded as a sort of No Man's Land, and the cattle are looked upon as neither English nor Irish.  I am sure that the Dáil will consider that this is a great hardship on Irish exporters of live stock, who, as matters stand at present, are compelled to suffer the total loss.  I wish to point out that up to the passing of the Free State Act, and for the past thirty years, when Ireland was an integral part of the United Kingdom so far as the Diseases of Animals Act was concerned, the same regulations applied to both countries, and any Irish animals slaughtered at the British landing-places suffering from foot and mouth disease were paid for by the British authorities.  I had better explain how these regulations affecting Great Britain and Ireland came into force, because they have a great bearing on this question.</P>
    <P>In the nineties, when Canadian cattle were being imported into England, they brought in pleuro-pneumonia, which, next to rinderpest, is the worst and the most deadly of cattle diseases. This disease spread with great rapidity throughout the country, and thousands of cattle were slaughtered all over England.  The Government of the day made an order in 1894, under the Diseases of Animals Act, prohibiting the importation of cattle into the United Kingdom, except for slaughter at the landing stations at the ports, and declaring that all countries outside the United Kingdom were foreign countries within the meaning of the Act.</P>

      <P>This, as I have said, has a great bearing on the position today. For thirty years since the passing of that Act up to the passing of the Free State Act, the same regulations, so far as the Diseases of Animals Act is concerned, applied to the two countries. Those regulations remained the law of the land up to the passing of the Free State Act, after which the embargo on the importation of Canadian cattle was removed, and then a short time afterwards foot-and-mouth disease broke out in England.  Then the question arose as to whether the regulations of this Act or Order of 1894, which were translated into an Act of Parliament in 1896, still applied, or, in other words, whether Ireland was still an integral part of the United Kingdom or a foreign country.  Sir Edward Carson said that Northern Ireland was still an integral part of the United Kingdom, but that Southern Ireland, being a Free State, and having the same status as Canada, was a foreign country within the meaning of the Act of 1896.  That put up another Boundary question; but the British Government settled it by passing fresh legislation called the Importation of Animals Act, 1922, and it is under this Act that we are working at present and with which we have to comply.  The position, so far as exportation of live stock from Ireland to Great Britain is concerned, is that neither the Free State Government, the Government of Northern Ireland, nor the British Government accept responsibility for animals slaughtered in Great Britain.  Naturally this is causing a great deal of dissatisfaction among agriculturists generally, and the question must be dealt with sooner or later, and the sooner the better.  While every <Col N="2953" /> protection is afforded to a British agriculturist whose stock is slaughtered owing to foot-and-mouth disease, this sword of Damocles is still hanging over the heads of men engaged in this industry in Ireland.  It may be put forward by the Minister for Agriculture that there is no money at his disposal to pay compensation to owners for losses sustained by the slaughter of their stock at the landing places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to state for the information of the House that from 1894 up to 1922 there was always a sum voted in the British House of £140,000 annually to cope with contagious diseases.  There was £40,000 of this set aside to stamp out swine fever. There was £100,000 put at the disposal of the Ministry to stamp out other diseases.  When we were legally an integral part of the United Kingdom and when we had a visitation, as we had here in 1912, of which I have sad memories, because nearly everyone engaged in the trade then suffered immense losses, and when we were restricted for a considerable time before the disease was stamped out, compensation was paid, and I have received from the Department of Agriculture a return of the amount of compensation that was paid from 1914 to 1923.  This is a return showing the number and kind of animals and the amount paid to owners, inclusive.  In 1914 the amount paid for cattle was £1,119; for swine, £380.  In 1921 the amount paid was £197; and at Holyhead £585 was paid.  The total amount paid was £2,281 17s. 8d.  There was nothing paid since the Free State Act was passed for the recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, and the owners in those cases had to stand the whole loss, which was very considerable.  In one case in particular brought to my notice a man lost £456 on 50 head of cattle.  I want to contrast the position of a man in the live stock trade here with that of the man on the other side.  Of that £140,000 that was voted from 1894 up to 1922, <Col N="2954" /> Ireland, whenever disease broke out, got a share; but in 1922, when foot-and-mouth disease was rampant through Great Britain, in that year alone the compensation awarded to owners for the slaughter of cattle in Great Britain amounted to the sum of £751,000.  The grant was then no good, and here is a statement made by the new Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Buxton, as to what they did.  I hope it will be a headline for our Ministry.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister explained that the resolution would pave the way for a Bill to meet the costs of the present visitation of foot-and-mouth disease, which had proved very much in excess of the statutory limitation.  The outbreak in 1922 had cost £751,000.  The Government of that day decided to depart from the usual practice, and that only one-half of the cost should be defrayed from Imperial Funds, leaving the remaining half to be borne on local funds. In regard to the present epidemic, the late Government had to decide what should be done to pay for it, and, not long before they left office, it was agreed that the greater part of the expense should be borne by the Exchequer. The present Government had decided to follow that procedure. Of the maximum sum of £140,000 which by the Act of 1894 might be devoted annually to defray the cost on diseases of animals, £40,000 had always been kept back for swine fever, so that only £100,000 was left for dealing with other diseases.  This outbreak had cost the enormous sum&mdash;comparatively speaking&mdash;of £3,250,000.  It was proposed that the share of the expenditure chargeable to the Local Taxation Account, in the case of England, should be limited to a sum estimated at £250,000. The amount chargeable to the Local Taxation (Scotland) Account would be 12-88ths of the share borne by the English account.  In view of the possible contingency that it may be necessary to exceed next year the amount allowed by Statute, it was proposed to remove the limitation for two years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you see there, the British Ministry, with the exception of the £250,000 that is going to be raised out of the Imperial <Col N="2955" /> Exchequer, have paid the huge amount of £3,000,000 to British owners for compensation for losses sustained by the slaughter of animals.  We are in a very chaotic condition in this country at the present time, and that is due to a fact that men in the trade do not know exactly where they stand.  They know well that the British will accept no responsibility for losses sustained, even though the disease is contracted, as it has been, in Great Britain; and the fact that, despite all the attempts made by enemies of this country and of the trade to try and instil into the minds of the British public that we are cloaking up the disease, we have proved&mdash;thanks to our efficient Board of Agriculture&mdash;that this country has the cleanest bill of health of any country in the world so far as live stock is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is very disheartening to men engaged in the industry, who have for a number of years done their best to make it flourish and prosper, to be rendered nervous by reason of the fact that prevailing conditions are not in any way satisfactory.  I bring forward this motion in order to focus the attention of the Executive Council, and especially the Minister for Agriculture, on the fact that something must be done, and done quickly.  Otherwise great hardships are going to be inflicted upon the trade. Often times great losses are incurred by those engaged in the export trade, and also by the farming community.</P>
    <P>Deputies can well realise the effect in this country of a disease that has spread like a prairie fire all over England, and of the spasmodic outbreaks at the ports.  Often times it has occurred that when an outbreak takes place in England a wire is sent to those engaged in the export trade here, acquainting them of the outbreak and the fact that animals have to be slaughtered.  That immediately causes a lot of persons in this country to abstain from buying, and cattle drop from £2 to £5 a head often.  Not alone is the exporter hit, but the farming community suffers, and the man who suffers worst of all is the man who is raising store cattle.</P>
    <P>This industry is larger and more important than many realise.  I desire to <Col N="2956" /> show the Dáil the extent of this industry by quoting portion of the evidence given by Mr. T. P. Gill at a Commission of Inquiry into the removal of the embargo on Canadian cattle.  No doubt you are all aware Mr. Gill was over twenty years Secretary of the Department of Agriculture.  In his evidence he stated that: &ldquo;The total cattle herd in Ireland had been increased in twenty years by over half a million head; the annual supply to Great Britain has been increased by 125,000 head.  But the improvement in quality&mdash;their quality as beef, and as early maturers and quick fatteners&mdash;has been recently estimated as representing an intrinsic value, irrespective of market fluctuations, of £5 a head.  In 1920 Ireland had only ten per cent. of the population. She had 43 per cent. of the cattle in the United Kingdom.  She consumes less than one-quarter of the cattle she produces; the rest are sent to Great Britain.  Two out of every five beef cattle slaughtered in Great Britain before the war were born in Ireland.  During the period of the war Ireland sent to Great Britain 3,862,223 cattle, and none were lost through submarine action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I hope that I have convinced Deputies that it is absolutely necessary something should be done in the near future.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture will give this motion his support. If he does not see his way to give it the support that the members of the live stock trade expect, I would like to know what the Government propose to do.  Now that we are not pooled with Great Britain so far as the expenses of the Diseases of Animals Act is concerned, I would like to know if, since the Treaty, any separate sum has been set aside under that Act to cope with contagious diseases here, such as foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever.  If there has been, I think the Minister would be quite justified in compensating owners for losses sustained, the same as owners were paid out of the British Exchequer in days gone by.  The trade want the Government here to accept responsibility and pay compensation for losses sustained by exporters until the licence is issued after the detention period of <Col N="2957" /> ten hours is completed.  Then, after that, representations should be made to the British authorities to pay compensation out of their funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to mislead the Dáil into supposing that in making representations to Great Britain in this matter we can be treated as a purely isolated case, because of the fact that we are a Dominion the same as Canada, Australia and South Africa, and that it is possible to legislate for us without legislating for other parts of the Dominions.  I quite agree the British Authorities may put up that argument if the Minister approaches them on the compensation question.  I hold it is within the power of the Minister for Agriculture here to compensate owners for losses sustained up to the expiry of the ten hours' detention period.  After that representations could be made to the British Government. If the trade got in the thin edge of the wedge by getting the Ministry to accept responsibility up to the time the licence is issued, it would take a lot of uneasiness from the minds of those engaged in the industry.  I hope something will accrue from this discussion to satisfy the trade.  At present the members of the trade are dissatisfied.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I will not approach this matter from the point of view of hardships inflicted on the trade, but rather from the point of view of what seems to me to be a grave injustice to the agricultural community.  The position at present is intolerable.  The matter is on anything but a businesslike basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cattle leave our ports, land in Great Britain and are detained for ten hours. While they are there, they are neither English nor Irish.  Unfortunately for the people dealing in the trade, they are destroyed.  If an outbreak occurs in England within a 15-mile radius of the port, the cattle are taken and destroyed in the British interests.  That is what we quarrel about.  The British Government destroy them in the British <Col N="2958" /> interest and therefore it is plain that the British people ought to pay for them.  That is the position as I see it. The position from the English point of view is indefensible, and it is the duty of the Minister for Agriculture to see that this thing is adjusted as between the two Boards of Agriculture, a conference, if necessary, taking place.</P>

      <P>This is a very important question. It is an extremely important question.  It affects a trade of something like £20,000,000 between this country and England, and I am sorry that we have not a longer time to deal with it.  We spent an hour and a half on something preceding it which is of comparatively no importance whatever. But this is a matter which affects the biggest part of the Irish trade between Ireland and England, and there is not adequate time to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  I am very well aware that it is not necessary that this discussion should finish this evening.  I am merely talking of the probabilities.  Now, let me clear the ground.  First of all, there is no point in quoting figures in connection with a sum that has been paid into a certain fund in order to enable the Treasury to pay for cattle slaughtered in Ireland and England before the Treaty. The position is this, shortly&mdash;we are only concerned with the law as it stands.  Now, the law as it at present stands is that the English pay for all cattle slaughtered in England, except the cattle that are slaughtered at the wharves or landing-places.  We would pay for all the cattle, regardless of cost, slaughtered in Ireland because of the foot-and-mouth disease.  The Irish Government pays for all the cattle slaughtered in Ireland as a result of getting infected with foot-and-mouth disease, or such contagious disease.  The English Government pays for all the cattle slaughtered in England, except, as I have said, the cattle slaughtered at the wharf or landing-place.  There <Col N="2959" /> is just one point.  Who is to pay for the cattle slaughtered at the English wharves or landing-places?  It is a very important point, and a highly contentious point.  I was extremely glad that Deputy McKenna brought this motion forward.  I would like to have it fully discussed in the Dáil by every Party. Because I would like to have the benefit of the views of all sections.</P>
      <P>The fact is that nobody pays for the cattle slaughtered at the English wharf or landing place.  The proposal of Deputy McKenna was that we should make an offer to the British Government; that we should say, &ldquo;We will pay for all the cattle slaughtered at the landing places provided they are slaughtered within ten hours.&rdquo;  Deputy Gorey's proposal is slightly different.  His position shortly is this: That we should not pay for any cattle except cattle slaughtered in Ireland, and that we should not admit the principle that we are liable for compensation for cattle slaughtered in England.  I agree with that at the moment.  Let me read for the Dáil the section that deals with the landing of cattle in England, or, rather, let me deal with the Order.  This is the Order made under the Importation of Animals Act, 1922.  Under Section 3, the first paragraph of that Order runs as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister has, by Order, directed:</P>
      <P>(1)  Each cargo of animals shall on landing at a landing place be driven to an approved reception lair, detained and isolated there, from all other animals, unless and until the whole cargo has been examined in daylight by an inspector, and until the expiration of ten hours after the landing of the last animal from the cargo, and until again their removal from the reception lairs is authorised by an inspector.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What does all that come to?  Simply this: that the minimum period of detention for Irish cattle landed at English landing places is ten hours.  The maximum may be ten weeks.  It is in fact at present a week.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to hear it. The proposition that is put up to me by the trade is this: &ldquo;Make an offer to the English Government; say that the Irish Government will pay for the cattle slaughtered in England within the minimum period of ten hours.&rdquo; Now where does that lead?  I do not want to develop this, and this matter should not be debated in the Dáil.  But I ask any man here who is a farmer: Where is that going to lead?  If we say here officially, &ldquo;We are willing to admit the principle that we will pay for cattle slaughtered in England, but we will want the time confined to ten hours,&rdquo; where is it going to lead? I want an answer to that question.  I will leave it to the Dáil.  It is a proposition that I have definitely refused to put up.  My position in the matter is simply this&mdash;that the English should pay for the cattle slaughtered in England unless and until it has been demonstrated that the cattle became infected in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Imperial Economic Conference is the last place in which I would like to raise it.  I will tell you why.  I do not want to admit for a moment that our cattle are in the same position as the Canadian cattle.  That is what raising it at the Economic Conference would mean.  They are not. We have been making representations to the English Government for the last six months.  It is an extremely difficult problem to solve, but certainly in the interests of the trade itself I am not <Col N="2961" /> prepared to make an offer to the British Government, saying, &ldquo;We will pay for all Irish cattle slaughtered in England within a certain period.&rdquo;  Supposing the move came from the other, side, I do not think I would agree to it. Surely you will admit that it is a dangerous thing to do.  Surely anybody who knows anything about the trade will admit it is a highly dangerous thing to do in view of the way in which English thought is running on the matter at the present moment.  Why are we running this danger?  This is a question that could be settled in Committee. It should not have come to this. I say there is no way out of it.  I quoted the report from the various cattle trade associations, and with all respect to Deputy McKenna, I do not agree that it is the unanimous view of the cattle trade.  However, he stated his position.  I say officially that my view is that what he has stated is not the unanimous view of the cattle trade. The unanimous view is more like what Deputy Gorey stated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are only one association out of the six.  Now what is the difference all about?  What is the amount of money involved?  The trade in cattle between Ireland and England is worth £20,000,000 yearly. I am giving round figures.  Deputy McKenna read out the amount of money involved since 1914.  The value of the cattle paid for, that is to say, the value of the cattle slaughtered in the landing places and paid for between 1914 and the year 1921 was £1,109.  Since the Act of 1922 came into operation, that is, during 1923, when the biggest outbreak occurred in England&mdash;more serious than all the outbreaks for the last forty years&mdash;360 cattle, worth about £5,000, were slaughtered at landing places, so that £5,000 would probably insure this risk, taking all the probabilities into account for twenty years. That is the position.  £5,000 would cover the trade between this country and England, which is about £20,000,000, and I am asked by the Cattle Traders' Association to put up a <Col N="2962" /> proposition which I know is unsound, which I know is in their worst interests, for the sake of £5,000.  I am well aware that £5,000 is to the unfortunate farmers who lost their 360 head of cattle just as much as if the total was extended over more farmers to £5,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Northern Government has the same difficulty.  The Diseases of Animals Act in the North is administered by England.  For the purposes of the cattle trade the North of Ireland is part of England.  Yet they are treated the same as we are being treated.  Mr. Coote, M.P., expressed his desire to become a rebel on the question.  He wrote letters to the newspapers complaining of the desperate state of affairs that obtained in the North concerning this matter, and said he was beginning to think there was something in the Sinn Féiners all the same.  They are in the same dilemma in the North as we are here.  I know what they are doing.  Our interests are identical in the matter.  Are we to be forced by a trade controlling twenty-four millions worth of cattle exports for the sake of £5,000 to a proposition which may lead &mdash;where?  I do not blame the cattle trade, because it is disorganised.  They have five or six traders' associations.  There is the Farmers' Union, there is the Royal Dublin Society, and there are two associations in the South of Ireland.  One of these associations has taken up an absolutely sound line on this matter, but both these associations are fighting for the title of the South of Ireland Cattle Traders' Association.  All this comes back to this, that the farmers of Ireland must organise themselves for business purposes, or else they will get nowhere.  If there was any co-operation between the different Cattle Traders' Associations, this problem would be solved without coming to the Dáil to ask to have it solved temporarily, and would give us a chance of putting up a right proposition to the English Government on the matter.  That is my view.  The slaughter of these 360 cattle took place eight months ago.  I know that there are a number of small farmers in the South who have lost practically their all in this matter.  They are writing letters to the Department <Col N="2963" /> asking what we are going to do about it.  Naturally the associations to which they belong kicked up a row, and asked what are we going to do.  I have every sympathy with these men, and I realise their position fully.  I know they are in an extremely bad way, but I put it to the trade that it is too bad that at this hour of the day that I should be forced to put up a proposition which is immature to the British Government, because the trade which controls twenty-four million pounds' worth of Irish cattle is not able to tide over a period of three months, and find the small sum of £5,000.  That is what the case comes to. I am glad that Deputy McKenna raised this question, and I am sorry that there is not a longer debate on it.  It is a very important question with many reactions.  It has caused me a lot of thought and trouble for the last six months.  I am dealing with another independent Government &mdash;the British Government&mdash;and I have not been able to make up my mind as to what the final solution of this problem is to be.  I suggest to the Farmers' Party that they ought not to press this resolution.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister when he states that the sum of £5,000 is comparatively small compared with the extent and the importance of this, one of our greatest industries, if not our greatest.  That being so, I desire to ask him if we will consider the possibility of the Government being able to provide the small sum of £5,000 in the manner he has suggested&mdash;that is to say, by way <Col N="2964" /> of insurance to enable the small number of farmers who have suffered this unnecessary loss to be recouped, pending the final decision on this matter as between the Irish and the British Governments.</P>

      <P>That is the whole point. Supposing I discussed this matter with the English Ministry of Agriculture, and it is open to anyone to say that you have paid this money, what would my position in the matter be, or what would be the position of the cattle trade?  We will not admit liability for cattle slaughtered in England.  That money should be paid by the British interests.</P>
