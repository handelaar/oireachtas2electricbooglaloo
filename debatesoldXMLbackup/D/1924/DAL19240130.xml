    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="TOMAS O CONAILL TOMAS O CONAILL">
      <NameTxt>TOMAS O CONAILL</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Postmaster-General if he will state what are the outlets of promotion available to Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists, and what has been done by his Department to relieve the stagnation of promotion that has been such a cause of discontent in the Postal and Telegraph Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the previous Administration the main avenue of <Col N="680" /> promotion available to the Sorting Clerk and Telegraphist Grade was to the Overseer grade, and thence to the Assistant Superintendent, Superintendent, and Postmaster grades.  This avenue is still maintained, and while the average number of promotions, by means of it, was 22 per annum, it has averaged 34 per annum since the advent of the Irish Administration.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, however, we have recruited the Headquarters Clerical Grades wholly from the Sorting Clerk and Telegraphist Grade, and have filled from the Sorting Clerk and Telegraphist Grade every vacancy on the Clerical Grade which has occurred since the change of Government.  The total number of Clerical Officers on the Headquarters Clerical Establishment is 259, and of this number 120 are officers whom we have promoted from the Sorting Clerk and Telegraphist Grade, of whom 67 have been definitely appointed as Clericals, and 53 will be appointed as soon as their probationary period expires.</P>
      <P>We have also been instrumental in the promotion of Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists to clerical vacancies in other Government Departments, and 38 have been so promoted.</P>
      <P>That is to say, the present Administration has opened up an avenue of promotion for this class and in less than two years has provided for 158 officers an outlet which had been previously altogether beyond their reach.</P>
      <P>I may add that under the reorganisation scheme there will be a certain number of redundant Post Office Assistants, and that I propose, subject to the concurrence of the Ministry of Finance, to fill all future vacancies on the Headquarters Clerical Establishments from the Post Office Assistants Grade, until such time as the redundant officers have been absorbed, subject, of course, to a supply of suitable officers being available from that grade.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I am wholly in favour of improving the outlets for the Post Office main grades.  The fact that in less than two years we have promoted to the Clerical Grade more Sorting Clerks and Telegraphists than the British Administration did in its whole existence here, speaks for itself.</P>

      <P>The only claim that appears to have been received from Sergeant Whelan is one for £5 18s. 6d. in respect of hirage of cars during the month of March, 1921. Pending a general decision on the question of pre-Truce claims, it is not possible to consider Sergeant Whelan's claim.</P>

      <P>The President, who is absent in the Seanad, asked me to deal with this question.  It will be remembered that the late British Government had decided to call a Conference, and a date was fixed provisionally for the 15th December.  Political conditions in England became somewhat chaotic in December, and the Conference did not meet.  The new British Government, immediately on taking office, informed us that their policy in this particular matter does not differ from the policy of their predecessors, and they wrote suggesting that the Conference meet on Friday, 1st February.  We have accepted that invitation on the same basis as our acceptance of the invitation from Mr. Baldwin.</P>

      <P>In that connection I would say that the President's announcement yesterday can only be technically regarded as an announcement to a party convention.  It was an announcement through the medium of that gathering, to the people, and it was considered advisable, in view of the unrest, anxiety, and irritation that has been occasioned by the delay in this matter, to acquaint the people of the development at the earliest possible moment.  It was very far from being the intention of the President in any way to slight the Dáil collectively or any individual Deputy.</P>

      <P>I have received notice from Deputy Johnson of an amendment to Amendment 1, to delete the words &ldquo;wherever reasonably practicable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment sent down from the Seanad, and to which we are asked to agree, is to insert this new Sub-section.  The words, &ldquo;where-ever reasonably practicable,&rdquo; which occur in it, seem to me so loose, and render the new Section so loose, as to make the new Section of no value whatever as a protection.  &ldquo;Where the responsible officer . . . . has reasonable ground for anticipating that it will be necessary to enter a dwelling-house.&rdquo; Surely, where there is reasonable ground for anticipating that such a course would be necessary, it would be practicable to call for a police officer to be present, but when we, having spoken about having reasonable ground for anticipating, then put in the words, &ldquo;wherever reasonably practicable,&rdquo; we must ask ourselves who is to judge of the reasonable practicability, and immediately it will be seen that these three words simply nullify the whole effect of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very desirable that the section should be embodied in the Bill, but if the section is to be an effective one, it ought to ensure that the military will not be free to enter a dwelling-house without being accompanied by a police officer.  And the new section, if the amendment I am moving is accepted, deleting these words &ldquo;wherever reasonably practicable,&rdquo; would give some assurance, at least, that the intention was to ensure that a policeman would be present when the military were going to enter a house.  But if we leave these words in &ldquo;wherever reasonably practicable,&rdquo; we simply nullify the effect of the new section, because it may be that the soldier himself will say it was not reasonably practicable, and if there is any doubt in the mind of the citizens, it can only be decided by going through a long process of law.  If these words remain in the effect will be that the responsible officer who, in given circumstances may be a private soldier, will be empowered to <Col N="688" /> enter into a dwelling-house to make an arrest and he will be the judge of whether it was reasonably practicable to ask a police officer to come with him. I think that ought to be avoided if possible.  I think the new section would be a protection for the citizens if these three words were deleted, and the responsible officer is quite well guarded when he is asked to ensure that an officer of the police should accompany him when he has reasonable ground for anticipating that it will be necessary to enter into a dwelling-house.  The anticipation must be there before he breaks the law.  The new section only deals with cases which are prepared beforehand, and if there is any preparation for entering a dwelling-house to make an arrest, surely it is not unreasonable to insist that the police officer should accompany the soldiers.  I do not think that the case would be so strong for the deletion of these three words if we had not defined the responsible officer as being a private soldier who had got authority from a superior officer, but taking that definition into account I would urge the Dáil to agree to the deletion of these three words from the new Section, which would then be a real protection to the citizens against the irresponsible action of people who are called &ldquo;responsible officers,&rdquo; and who are defined as being soldiers acting under general authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of this amendment in the Seanad is that it was put up, in the first instance, without these three words.  After I had spoken to it and recited certain objections which to me seemed obvious, the suggestion came from one of Deputy Johnson's colleagues in the Seanad that it would be reasonably acceptable if these three words were inserted.  That was subsequently agreed to, after consultation with the Minister for Defence.  Deputy Johnson has spoken much of the necessity of protecting the citizen, and Deputies have to ask themselves wherein lies the best protection for the citizen, whether you are to impose restrictions on the military that may render their activities and their operations in certain districts extremely difficult, or simply trust to a responsible spirit and a responsible outlook to take all necessary <Col N="689" /> precautions.  You cannot legislate really on the basis that you have even a rough uniformity in the conditions throughout the country.  Conditions in Kildare, for instance, will differ very much from conditions in South Leitrim or West Cork, and that ought to be realised by Deputies.</P>
      <P>Now take the words in this amendment from the Seanad: &ldquo;In any case. where a responsible officer of the Military forces of Saorstát Eireann has reasonable grounds for anticipating that it will be necessary to enter a dwelling-house for the purpose of effecting an arrest,&rdquo; and so on, it might be said that an officer going out in charge of a patrol in a particular area might always anticipate, and should reasonably anticipate, that in the course of his duties for the day it might be necessary to enter some dwelling-house, and it is suggested that every day an officer, going out in charge of a patrol in a particular area like West Cork or South Leitrim, should take with him a member of the Dublin Metropolitan Police or of the Civic Guard.  Who is to interpret, or who is to say, when an officer has reasonable grounds to anticipate that it will be necessary for him to enter a dwelling-house?  I submit that no one can really say that except the officer himself, judging the conditions in the area, and judging what the nature of his duties in the course of the day are likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saving clause with the words, &ldquo;wherever reasonably practicable,&rdquo; is inserted simply out of an appreciation of realities.  An officer in charge of a party of troops starting out on a patrol may have had no real grounds to think that it would be necessary for him, in the course of that day's duty, or couple of hours' duty, to enter a house at all, but on the way he either sees a very much-wanted man entering particular premises, or gets very definite information that such a man has entered particular premises.  The nearest Civic Guard Station, let us say, is ten, twelve or fifteen miles away.  Is he to halt his men on the road and send an urgent despatch for the Civic Guard officer to come along so that he may enter those particular premises?  You <Col N="690" /> need that saving clause, and you simply need it because you are not dealing with straight lines, you are not dealing with a uniform situation, but with a situation that is an essentially patchwork one; you cannot draw your straight line or put your two-foot rule to it and say, the thing shall be done in such a way and not in such a way.  In South Leitrim, and in parts of Cork, a party of troops patrolling might find it necessary, at any time&mdash;on quite short notice, they might find it necessary, I say, or at least highly advisable in a proper performance of their duties&mdash;to enter a dwelling-house, and it might be utterly impracticable to secure the attendance of a police officer so that that particular visit might be carried out in accordance with the law as it would be if Deputy Johnson's amendment to this amendment were to be accepted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister that the Bill, as it stands, pre-supposes that the responsible officer or some of his responsible officers, if they happen to be below the rank of Commandant, must, before they make this arrest, or before they enter a dwelling-house to make the arrest, be empowered in a particular case to make such an arrest.  Now, if that power has been given specifically, in a particular case, surely at the time of giving that authority it is practicable to arrange for a policeman to enter. I submit that the three words &ldquo;wherever reasonably practicable&rdquo; simply mean that the soldier will use his own discretion, whether he calls a police officer to assist him in making the arrest, or to be present at the time of the arrest.  Now, the Minister should take it perhaps as a compliment to the Force for which he is responsible, that we should require that a police officer should be present when soldiers are doing work which clearly should be done by a policeman, and the fact is, of course, that from experience people have not confidence that soldiers will be so discreet and so well disciplined as to refrain from entering houses when they have that general power, even though there is no justification for their entering houses.  We are hoping that that stage has passed, and <Col N="691" /> we are hoping that we will never have occasion to regret the acts of soldiers doing such things as they have done, but the Bill as it stands does give authority to troops who may have, by general order, been empowered to make arrest, because the Section as it stands does give them the authority to enter dwelling-houses to make these arrests.</P>
      <P>I desire that we should ensure that these powers are only to be exercised when there is specific authority given, and in such a case it is practicable, I suggest, to arrange that a police officer should accompany the soldiers when entering dwelling-houses.  But, I submit, that if we are to leave in the words &ldquo;wherever reasonably practicable&rdquo; we lessen that assurance very considerably, because we leave the judges of practicability to be the people who are going to make the arrest, and who may be, according to the Bill, a private soldier or private soldiers under the direction of a sergeant, or any other officer junior to a sergeant.  We have enlarged the definitions of the Bill in such a way as to make it necessary to provide that a police officer be present when the military are going to make an arrest. I admit that much of this argument depends on the reading of the Bill, and particularly of Section 8, which defines the case where the military may use these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appears to be a grave misunderstanding, judging by the debates which took place in the Seanad, as to whether the power is to be given to military to make particular arrests of particular persons, or whether the Bill gives powers to military over particular areas.  There is a very wide divergence of opinion on that, but I think the Minister for Defence will agree that his speech on Tuesday, 15th January, makes it quite clear that his intention, at any rate, was that this power should apply to particular cases, that is to say, to particular persons in particular areas.  In view of the doubt in the matter, as between the two Ministers, which will have to be resolved, presumably, by a Court, involving very considerable expense on the community, it is better to minimise the <Col N="692" /> evils as far as possible.  That is why I urged that the responsible officers should always, wherever there is anticipation that an arrest will be necessary in a dwelling-house, be accompanied by a policeman.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the compliment was not undue.  I think I made it plain, when speaking on the matter, that we wanted to avoid placing any general administrative area in the country in the hands of the Military. The administration of law and order in the country rests with the police.  We have the country studded with military areas, from the point of view of the administration of the Army, but there might be areas where conditions are such that we might have to say the Commandant of a particular area and his superior officers shall be regarded as the &ldquo;responsible officer&rdquo; for the purpose of certain clauses in this particular Bill, and that in such area that Commandant would be empowered to delegate the powers of &ldquo;responsible officer&rdquo; to a lower officer. That would be in the case of an individual Commandant commanding a particular Battalion.  You then get to the other end of the question, and because the administration of law and order is in the hands of the police, say in Co. Cork, that does not prevent this situation arising.  People have heard of Kealkil and some of these places.  A responsible military officer or a responsible police officer might say there is a bunch of fellows in Kealkil and they should be rounded up.  There are men there who are carrying arms and who are making themselves a nuisance to the people.  The military might not be able to satisfy themselves as to whether this particular person or that particular person is in that particular group. You might have to send out a Military Party to deal with that particular situation.  The question might arise as <Col N="693" /> to whether a Civic Guard should accompany the party of military who are going out on an expedition of that kind. I regard it as not unreasonable that the responsible Military Officer should say: &ldquo;The circumstances we may find ourselves up against in this particular matter, are such that we should not bring with us a member of an unarmed force.&rdquo;  Even at this particular stage of normality in the country there are places where a problem like that might arise, where a party might have to enter a dwelling-house.  I admit that it is an extreme case.  I admit that the normality in the country is such that you might take it, as a general rule, that even in such cases you could bring a member of the Civic Guard with you, but in the actual carrying out of the work a small military party might have to enter a house at the same time as three other houses were being entered.  One party might be entering a house five hundred yards to the north side of Kealkil, and they might have a Civic Guard with them, but at the same time another party might have to enter a house five hundred yards to the south side, and they might not have a Civic Guard.  We do need&mdash;and this is a matter that really requires to have particular attention drawn to it&mdash;the protection of the law for the members of our Military Forces, who, in the present circumstances, are called upon to deal with very delicate situations.  It is, perhaps, quite right that members of the military forces have not said &ldquo;miss&rdquo; or &ldquo;ma'am&rdquo; or &ldquo;please,&rdquo; at quite the right moment, in particular parts of the country, but their duties have been very difficult and, just at the present moment, when you want to have them absolutely circumscribed by law, their duties are bound to be infinitely more difficult. I feel that by leaving in the words that are here we give our military forces, at any rate, some protection from the law, which, if it were stringently applied without this protection, in every particular case, would make the working of the military forces absolutely impossible, because we are taking up the attitude in regard to our military forces generally that they are working in normal times and that we impose upon them the restrictions of normal times <Col N="694" /> in all their work.  Having had to perform exceptional duties in exceptional cases, we have been having our men exceed the law in many parts of the country, and they could be made amenable to the law.  If a responsible officer realises that a certain action is necessary, which would redound to the public good and the public safety, and takes action, he takes the responsibility of such action.  If he does good we praise him, and if he puts his foot in it we say the Army is a terrible institution and we must put down this sort of thing.  But we are giving our greatest possible attention to the necessity for bringing our military forces out of the situation.  The fact that this Bill gets finished in the Dáil in this particular form is a very good earnest of that.  I would plead for the acceptance of these three particular words, &ldquo;wherever reasonably practicable,&rdquo; for the simple reason that it protects the military forces in the discharge of very difficult and very delicate work.  From the legal point of view, they are due that protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, has certain desires, and he is doing his best to achieve his wishes in regard to the Army and with regard to the administration of the law and the like.  He seems to forget that when this Bill becomes an Act it is not his intentions or desires or wishes that the soldiers will be working under, apart from internal discipline.  So far as the law is concerned, it will be the Act as it will then stand.  In acting, the officer will not plead the speeches of the Minister in the Dáil.  If he can show, having committed a certain act which he is being charged with in the Courts. that it was not reasonably practicable to get a police officer, and that he is the judge of practicability, he might justify going anywhere to make arrests.  The Minister in reality is pleading for a free hand for the Army.  That is what it amounts to, though it is not what his intention is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as arrest and detention for one week is concerned, I maintain that the Act will empower any police officer not below the rank of Superintendent, or any person who has authority delegated <Col N="695" /> to him, to do anything that the Act allows to be done.  That is disputed. If we are to leave the judging of practicability to the officer concerned or to the persons not being officers, not even being sergeants&mdash;any persons who have been detailed to arrest any person or persons&mdash;then they are free to go into any house in such an area if one Reading of the Bill is to be accepted. They are free to go into any house in such an area and arrest such a person without fear of the law.  The Minister says he wants to protect the Army from the law.  I commend him to the Minister for Justice, and would remind them both of the advice given about the necessity for enforcing the law.  I would like this law, now sought to be made, to be free from doubts, and that it should not protect soldiers acting with very loose authority in a way in which soldiers have been known to act within the last few months.  I think one move in that direction would be to delete these three words.</P>

      <P>I have little to add beyond this, that Deputy Johnson puts one extreme view and says, &ldquo;This amendment, as it stands, means a free hand for the Army.&rdquo;  If we are going to say extreme things and quote extreme cases at one another, let me say that Deputy Johnson's alternative is that if any soldier in any set of circumstances in Leitrim or West Cork, or anywhere else, enters a house in search of a wanted man, without having along with him an officer of the Civic Guard or Dublin Metropolitan Police, that soldier is liable to action for burglary.  That is an utterly absurd position&mdash;an utterly unsound position.  The Deputy or Senator who would put that forward would be thinking and talking with the minimum of advertence to the realities of the situation.

      <P>I intend opposing the motion.  I do not think that the case made by the Minister in his short statement warrants the Dáil in departing from the usual procedure set down in the Constitution, on the ground that this is an urgently necessary requirement. The Bill, or Act, as it will be in a few hours, I suppose, is intended to give power of arrest and detention to certain people for the preservation of the public safety and the protection of personal property.  The arguments that have been used in favour of this Bill have been illustrated by reference to bank robbers, highway men, bandits, thugs and the like; that there are men who may be arrested in the future, and that there are men at present under arrest who are known to have committed crimes of the kind indicated, but against whom it is not possible to bring specific evidence of guilt to warrant a Court of Justice finding them guilty and imprisoning them. There have been, admittedly, large numbers of men released from prison within recent weeks and months who are known to have been, or who are alleged at least, to have been guilty of crimes for which other people are detained. The Bill does not confine the powers of detention to thugs and bandits and bank robbers.  Even were that so, I would say that the necessity for this motion is not apparent in view of the fact that the law is strong enough to deal with any such cases without these special powers.  The reason for this motion, of course, is, that it will enable the Minister to keep in prison such a number, say, 1,800 men, who are at present in his charge, but whom it has not been found possible or desirable to bring and charge in the courts.</P>

      <P>Yes, I beg your pardon, 1,300.  The Minister has to make a case before his motion should be accepted and show that it would be a danger to the public safety to allow these 1,300 people who are not and who have not been charged, and against whom it is difficult to found a charge or prove a charge before the <Col N="699" /> court&mdash;that the release of these 1,300 would be a danger to the public safety. I cannot find consistency between that attitude and the action for which we are all thankful, that has led to the release of several thousands.  But there is more than the thug, and the bandit, and the bank robber to be considered in this matter.</P>

      <P>There are more people besides the thugs, and the bandits, and the bank robbers detained by the Minister.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Bill has been justified in the main by the Minister by the illustration of bank robbers and bandits, I am going to put a question again, and that question is: why does he detain men like Eamon de Valera and Austin Stack, when he releases other men just as innocent or just as guilty as those men?  If there is justification for detaining them over an ensuing seven days, and over the twelve months for which this Bill is intended to apply, will he give us any reason why they should not be detained interminably? And will he say that he has not in his possession evidence on which either of those men could be convicted of an offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will say, as he has said in other language, that it is not politic to charge these men before a court.  I agree, but it is more impolitic to detain them without a charge, and it is obvious, in such cases, that they are being detained because they are believed to be powerful political opponents of the Government.  The Minister's case is that they are dangerous inasmuch as they are likely to foment opposition, even violent opposition, against the Government of the Saorstát.  Have you, I ask, not powers under the law to deal with any subsequent offences, and will they be less liable in twelve months' time, after being detained for twelve months, or will they be less liable in three months time, after being detained for three months, to rouse enmity against the Saorstát?  Is it not rather a fact that, with every day's detention, you are embittering the feelings of those who are against the Saorstát, <Col N="700" /> and that you are weakening in fact respect for the law by detaining men who are detained because they are political opponents.  It is clear they are not detained because they are violators of the law; it is clear they are not detained because there is not sufficient evidence available to bring them before a court.  They are clearly being detained because they are opponents of the established form of Government, and they have been detained for some months, during which period they have not been able to take part in operations intended to overthrow the established form of Government.  Therefore, it cannot be said that they are being detained because of any act, any specific act, differing in degree or in intensity to similar acts committed by thousands of men who have been released.  If this motion is not passed, the effect will be that the Bill cannot be legally operative for seven days, and that then all the powers that are required to preserve the peace and the public safety, to protect person and property, which the Minister believes are necessary as embodied will be available, but they will deal with future offences.  The only purpose of this motion is to ensure that people will be detained for offences or a suspicion of having been guilty of offences, or on a suspicion that they may in future be guilty of offences, but not for offences against the law or against the public safety which may be committed after the Bill becomes operative.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be beneficial for the State that this Bill should not be operative for seven days, and that those who have been detained and who will not be charged, should be released, and that the risk of releasing thugs, bandits, and bank robbers, ought to be taken, and that those who are not either thugs, bandits, or bank robbers should have an opportunity to join in enforcing that respect for the law, and that prevention of crime which the Minister so sincerely and earnestly desires to become the common practice and the ideal of the people.  I hope the Dáil will not pass this motion, and that they will express themselves in this way as being desirous that the political prisoners now under arrest be released forthwith.</P>

      <P>There are 300 prisoners in custody who have been sentenced by Military Courts, whose cases will be reviewed by the Judges set up to do that revision under the Indemnity Act. There then remain 1,049 cases of persons held in custody in a manner that Deputy Johnson would object to.  They are made up as follows:&mdash;There are 379 persons who are definitely regarded by the military authorities as dangerous persons, and as having been largely instrumental in stirring up the armed activities that there have been against the Government.  There are 300 cases in which civil proceedings are pending. The evidence in these cases is only being got together, and it will take some more time to complete the putting together of that evidence.  There are 113 cases that have been referred by the military authorities to the civil authorities with a view to allowing the civil authorities as the responsible persons in the different districts to say whether these persons should be kept in custody or not, and there are 257 cases which are under investigation. You also have the fact&mdash;it is perhaps not expedient that figures would be quoted in the matter, but there are definite figures&mdash;of persons organising in different parts of the country to be available to use arms against the Government, and of persons who are actually on full time on military work preparing to take up arms against the Government.  There are also figures quotable as to the quantities of arms that are dumped to be at the disposal of such persons.  The Government is asked by Deputy Johnson, in circumstances such as these, to throw out these 1,049 persons of varying degrees of criminality into a situation such as that without having given each of these particular persons the full seasoned thought that their own particular cases and the general circumstances of the country would demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we should put ourselves in the position that these persons would have to be thrown free into the country in its present condition. A decision of that kind would have only one effect, and that would be to weaken respect for the law that <Col N="702" /> the Deputy wants to avoid, and wants us to avoid by simply throwing out these prisoners.  That is the position in which we are asked simply to cut short and to put ourselves in the position that the jails will be absolutely cleared with the exception of those men who are definitely sentenced.  I think it is not a reasonable way to discharge our responsibility to the Government, and I doubt if, in his heart, Deputy Johnson is really convinced that it would be a reasonable way of dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>The proposal of Deputy Johnson amounts to this: that he would scrap this measure, but I would remind him that there are more people than the thug and the bandit to be considered.  If his proposal were carried the most important factor in the Free State&mdash;the citizen&mdash;is not going to get the protection the Government is in bounden duty compelled to give him; the protection it is willing to extend to the thug and the bandit.  The bona fides of the Government as regards the desire to release all cases of prisoners in which it is felt that release may be effected without endangering the public safety is evidenced in the fact that within the last couple of weeks 500 of the prisoners have been released.  But a fortnight ago when discussing this Bill in the Dáil, the number interned was over 1,800.  To-day we have the figures of the Minister for Home Affairs that the number is reduced to 1,349&mdash;a reduction in two or three weeks of 500 in number.  That reduction has followed upon a reduction of 7,500 previously, so that the bona fides of the Government in respect of cases in which they should exercise their clemency towards the prisoners cannot be doubted.  The Deputy said that some had been either detained or released were guilty or as innocent as Mr. de Valera.  Well, I am sure that in all such cases the Government considered the personnel of the persons released&mdash; the power they possessed for future mischief and further trouble, and they also considered in relation to the case the previous record of the individuals, and, taking both these considerations into account, they felt that they could <Col N="703" /> safely discharge their duty to the public by releasing in some cases as they have released.  The suggestion that prisoners are detained because they are powerful political opponents against the Government is one that I need not discuss.  Any Executive Government that would be guilty of such a crime against the community as holding in detention a large body of men simply because of the fact that they may be active and powerful political opponents in the accredited sense that you recognise a man as a powerful political opponent&mdash;a man who opposes you on the ground of policy&mdash; I say that any Executive Government would not be deserving of the confidence of the people who would be guilty of such a crime against the citizens as that.  These men were detained because they were powerful political opponents when you measure their power by the gun or the revolver. It is because not of the propaganda from the political point of view, not of the legitimate agitation against the Saorstát, that these men are held in prison, but because they have threatened life, in some cases taken life, looted property, and have been guilty of crimes in the name of liberty. God help us!  If that represents liberty then patriotism is a title that most people would shun being identified with.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will supply information as regards others, I am sure the Government will consider it.  I think the Minister for Defence exactly hit the situation as regards the Deputy's attitude.  I am sure he does not desire, honestly desire, that these men should be released, but the suggestion that he makes is that if this Bill be not passed and if the proposal of the Minister for Home Affairs be defeated, we will then have the ordinary powers of the law to fall back upon to deal with future crimes.  If people have been guilty of crimes in the past, and if the Government are satisfied, and if the Minister is satisfied, that he would have to detain the number only that are so guilty, then it is a duty <Col N="704" /> the Government owe to the citizens, and which they owe to the State, to continue to detain them until they feel that the circumstances of the times warrant their release.  It is true that normal peaceful conditions do not prevail in this country.  Day after day for some time past you have had recurrences of crimes of the thug and the bandit.  You have had robberies, and robberies associated with murder, and you have in the country a certain element who are not going to give any help to the authorities in detecting such cases.  Some of them, through a concealed form of friendship with the people identified with these crimes, and in thousands of other cases through moral cowardice, have failed to come forward to assist the authorities in the detection of such crimes.  In the circumstances, I feel it would be absolutely dangerous if the powers that the Minister seeks were denied him by this House, and the House would be failing in its duty to the country. In these circumstances I hope, and I have no doubts at all, that the good sense of the House will be represented in the vote they will give if there is a division in respect of this amendment moved by Deputy Johnson.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Home Affairs asks that this resolution should be passed by the Dáil, because, in his opinion&mdash;and it is set out in the resolution&mdash;it is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace.  These are the grounds on which the resolution claims support.  Beyond the very short statement that it was his opinion that such was the case, the Minister put forward no argument whatsoever.  I think it was due to the Dáil, if they were asked to support this resolution, that he should show very much more clearly than he attempted to do that the public peace would be endangered, and seriously endangered, if these men were released, and it would and should be necessary to be very serious, indeed, when the constitutional rights of citizens would be interfered with, as it is proposed to interfere with them in this case.  You would imagine from Deputy O'Mahony's speech that all the really dangerous people were selected and <Col N="705" /> kept in.  There are no more of them left now, except those who are ready to foment civil strife.  Anybody who knows the facts knows that that is not the case.  The Minister for Defence, in his statement, did not attempt to answer the point made by Deputy Johnson, which is a very important point in this connection.  He did not attempt to show why men who are known to be leaders, and who have been prominent in the movement for the past year or so, have been released, while others, young fellows&mdash;nonentities in the movement, you might say&mdash;have been detained.  The whole question fines itself down to the 379 men whom the Minister for Defence described as dangerous, because I take it that in the other cases in which civil proceedings are pending or that have been referred to the civil authority, or in cases that are under investigation, assuming that the men were released in the morning, the Ministry is in a position to make out a prima facie case against them for trial.  Within the last three months seven or eight thousand men all over the country have been released.  For that step, a bold step, I admit, credit is due and has been given to the Executive by Deputy Johnson and others. That step has justified itself.  The public peace of the country has not suffered as a result of it, and surely it cannot be said that it is going to suffer because of the release of a few hundred more. We have had in the meantime instances of grave crimes committed, but it has not been shown in any case that these crimes have been committed by released prisoners.  There is one aspect that has a very important bearing on this question.  There are numbers of men interned in Northern prisons by the Northern Government.  Appeals have been made from time to time for their release, but surely no such appeal can properly or justly be made by those who have sympathy with those men, in view of the fact that here in the Free State we are doing the very same thing&mdash;in fact, to a greater extent than it has been done in the Northern area by the Northern Government.  I think that is a matter that ought to appeal to the Ministry and the Government in considering this question.</P>

      <P>The Minister for <Col N="706" /> Home Affairs, in moving his resolution, said very little by way of argument why the House should pass it.  I suppose the Minister for Home Affairs is satisfied that he can occupy his seat, and that the Dáil will pass this resolution, that it is not necessary for him to advance argument in favour of the resolution.  On the other hand, I am so satisfied that the Dáil is going to accommodate the Minister that I am going to say very little against his resolution, because I can understand that arguments from that point of view are not acceptable.  The Minister for Defence made the only argument that has been made.  The argument he makes is that in some districts things are not just what they ought to be, that some of these prisoners and other people are maintaining some form of organisation. He has given the Dáil to understand that things are not just satisfactory. He says it is not advisable to give further information, but I would like further information on that point.  As far as my knowledge goes, and any knowledge that I can gain from Deputies from other parts of the country, I do not know of anything that is taking place in any part of the country that would warrant the passing of this Bill. There is not, at least to my knowledge, any danger whatever that the releasing of these prisoners would have an injurious effect.  I cannot be satisfied that it will have any injurious effect.  I have met prisoners who have come home, and I saw no disposition on the part of these men to play any part in further civil strife.  I am satisfied that the same thing applies to those who are being detained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other point that I want to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence to.  Serious complaints are being made, and have been made, about the treatment of some prisoners in his charge, and serious complaints have been made to me of the treatment of prisoners in hospitals, and of the detention of such prisoners in hospitals.  I cannot see for the life of me, and I wonder if the Minister for Defence himself can see, what is the danger to the public peace that makes him detain in prison or in hospitals men who are not in good health, men who have been operated on more than <Col N="707" /> once.  I do not think that these men are likely to be a danger to the public peace.  I would like if the Minister would tell us.  I will probably be asking the Minister on some other occasion how many of these people he has in his charge.  I would like to ask the Minister if it is his intention to continue under this Bill to detain prisoners in the hospitals, when if they were out they could be no danger to the public peace.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, we are entitled, firstly, to know from persons who say they can speak with knowledge outside, whether the men outside the jails and the men inside the jails, by the help of the arms they have outside, are not prepared in a practical way to challenge the principle of &ldquo;one Government, one Army,&rdquo; in this country.  We are entitled to know that.  We cannot move in the dark.  We take our actions in broad daylight, knowing that practical arrangements are being made in that direction.  In the second place, a volume of complaint against the Army Medical Service, taking up special cases, has been circulated from certain quarters recently.  I knew that it was practically an insult to our Medical Service to ask them to annotate these complaints for me.  But I have had them annotated, and I will circulate copies of these complaints, annotated by the Medical Service, to any Deputy who so desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army Medical Service has had a great deal of work thrown upon it, and its work will stand the most intimate investigation by anybody who wants to know what is at the bottom of these complaints.  There are men in hospital at the present moment and they are being treated by the Army Medical Service in a manner in which they would not be treated in many of the public hospitals in Dublin.  Operations have been carried out on wounded Irregulars that could only be carried out in very few hospitals in Dublin. Any of the wounded prisoners who have been in our hands&mdash;and I have seen a number of them personally&mdash; will tell anybody who looks for the truth from them, that they have got <Col N="708" /> care at the hands of the Army Medical Service that they could not hope to get elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Baxter complained that I put forward no arguments in support of the Motion.  I really intended that as a delicate compliment to Deputies. I regret very much it has been misunderstood. I took it that the motion would need very little argument, that Deputies, knowing the conditions in the country and knowing the general line of policy of the Government, would agree that it was undesirable that there should be a wholesale and immediate release of those persons who are still in custody by reason of the revolt of the last two years.  Apparently, we are not unanimous on that point.  Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Johnson and Deputy Baxter think that it would be wise and politic and expedient to release all these persons immediately and &ldquo;hang the consequences,&rdquo; so to speak.  That is a point of view, I admit, but it is a point of view that is not widely shared by the plain, decent people of the country, to whom our responsibility lies. Certain people came together and combined to press the button for a crime-wave unprecedented in the history of this country.  That crime-wave has not entirely subsided.  Before it has entirely subsided, we are to fling out again on the country the people who pressed the button.  That is the proposal. &ldquo;Trust to luck, hang the consequences !&rdquo;&ldquo;Be idealists; be bleating optimists; stake all on the ingrained decency and generosity of these men.

      <P>These men, when they had the country, as they believed, at their mercy, showed no broad or generous or magnanimous spirit, showed no respect for the rights of their neighbours and their fellow-citizens, whether those neighbours agreed or disagreed with them on matters of doctrinaire politics.  They simply went for the country's neck and the country and the country's Government have not returned that in kind and have not <Col N="709" /> treated them cruelly or unfairly.  Who will say that a couple of weeks or a couple of months or a year's detention in a comfortable condition with spring beds in Gormanstown, or Hare Park, or elsewhere was in any real sense of the word punishment for their offence? It was not punishment.  It was deterrent detention.  There has been no punishment.  While we appreciate very fully the moral havoc and the material havoc these men wrought in the country, while we appreciate very fully the extent to which they put back the clock of progress for the country, there is no desire for punishment and there is no vindictive spirit.  It is simply a matter of doing our plain duty and acting up to our plain responsibilities to the people of the country in affording them that protection which is the primary and elementary duty of a Government to afford.  We cannot take chances, and we are not entitled to take chances, or do any vague, haphazard <Col N="710" /> thing.  We simply propose by considering each case on its merits in a careful way, to do the best we can. Simply because of the expiry of a particular Act on a particular date, we should not be forced to hurl out again on the country those men who, in the past, have been responsible for so much crime and so much havoc.  When the State&mdash;which is still reeling and staggering from the onslaught made upon it&mdash;has recovered, when it feels the ground firm under its feet, when it feels fully able to deal with any set of circumstances that may arise, then one can consider the release of those men&mdash;even the release of those who were the prime movers and prime instigators of the criminal conspiracy of the last two years.  Then, and not till then, would we be justified in considering the matter.</P>

      <P>On the last day when this Bill was under discussion the Minister was not in attendance.  I wanted to make sure that the information I received already was correct.  Is it a fact that these Civil Bill Officers are non-pensionable officers, and is it required to make provision for these if they are deprived of their position by reason of this Bill?  A deputation of them waited on me, and I wanted to put their case before the Minister.  They say they are entitled under the Treaty to a pension if they are deprived of office.  The Minister said they were not pensionable officers.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the amendment standing in my name, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> To delete sub-section (1) and to substitute therefor as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the Secretary or Clerk of any local authority by which a rate has been made if and when instructed to do so by an inspector of the Ministry of Local Government to furnish in the prescribed form and manner, to the Minister for Local Government, the name of any person (in this Act called the defaulter) who has not paid such rate or part of such rate due and payable by him, and to which this section applies, together with the amount due by the defaulter in respect of the rate aforesaid and the situation and description of the property in respect of which the said rate has been assessed (in this Act referred to as the rateable property) and thereupon it shall be lawful for the Minister if and when he shall think proper to issue to the Under-Sheriff of the County in which the rateable property is situate, a warrant in the prescribed form certifying the name of the defaulter, the amount due by him as aforesaid and the situation and description of the rateable property in respect of which the rate is recoverable, and authorising such Under-Sheriff to levy in accordance with the provisions of this Act the amount due aforesaid, provided however that no person shall be deemed a defaulter within the meaning of this Act who has paid a rate for any period between 30th September, 1920, and 30th September, 1922, in respect of any property situated within the area of such local authority to any person acting or purporting to act with authority as collectors to the local authority aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section departs radically from the first section of the Bill introduced by the Minister for Local Government. In that section the Minister had power to send a certificate of liability on any ratepayer to the Under-Sheriff of any county in which the defaulter resides or has a place of business.  That was one portion.  But I hold that such a procedure is altogether wrong.  Rates have been assessed, and the principle <Col N="714" /> governing the assessment of rates has been that the property was liable more than the individual.  It had a local and not a mere personal effect.  Under this Bill as introduced there is a radical departure. The Minister at all times had power to go down on lands and places. There is nothing novel in it.  As such we are not objecting.  But why go into other lands or into any other property of the defaulter?  There are various reasons why a man may be a defaulter, some of them even honourable reasons.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, in law and practice, the premises which heretofore had been liable for the rates are not any other property held by the defaulter. At the present time, and seeing the enormous amount of poverty there is, the hardship is very great.  Supposing a man had land in Clare and lives in Dublin, and that he has been deprived of the use of this land in Clare through no fault of his, is it right that his business in Dublin should be held liable for the rates on the farm in the County Clare, that he has not been able to use? There is a constitutional objection also. The land is there, and it was there for the past three years, when the rates could have been levied by distress, if necessary.  But that was not done.  The defaulter in this case is not so much to blame as the County Council; they could have gone and issued a distress warrant, at the right time, and season, if the rates that were due on such a farm had not been paid.  The deduction should now only be made from the compensation which is being allowed to persons who suffered injury to their property.  It is for the Minister for Finance to deduct from the compensation the amounts that would pay these rates, and to forward them to the Secretaries of the Local Authorities. Now, the second portion of the amendment is: &ldquo;Provided, however, that no person shall be deemed a defaulter within the meaning of the Act who has paid a rate for any period between the 30th September, 1920, and the 30th September, 1922, in respect of any property situated within the area of such local authority to any person acting or purporting to act with authority as collectors to the local authority aforesaid.&rdquo; That is really designed to safeguard <Col N="715" /> persons who paid unauthorised collectors who acted or purported to act under the Black and Tan regime. Under the provisions of the section of the Bill introduced by the Minister there is no safeguard whatever to anybody who paid his rates under these circumstances.  I can speak with authority on this matter, because I paid rates to one of those unauthorised collectors, yet I am returned as a defaulter. I can vouch for the payment I made, for I have a receipt, but under the provisions of this measure my receipt is invalid.  I hold the Minister ought to make some such provision against these things, and, seeing that he has not done so, I must ask the Committee to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that Deputy Connor Hogan has introduced this amendment with special reference to conditions in the County Clare.  I know the conditions down there are pretty bad, and that the farmers and other ratepayers are pretty hard hit as a result of having to undergo an unduly difficult time during the Anglo-Irish war, and as a result of having exceptionally high rates.  I do not see the point in that part of his amendment which seems to take it for granted that no part of a defaulter's property should be liable except the rateable property. The rateable property should, of course, be primarily liable, but, as soon as a ratepayer becomes a defaulter, all his personal property and he himself become personally liable.  So much for that part of the amendment.  I am aware of the fact that we have an anomalous state of affairs down in the County Clare.  Some unauthorised people have gone around there and have insisted on having rates paid to them without having any authority at all from the County Council.  In some cases people paid these persons rates knowing that they had no authority to collect the rates.  In some cases they paid them the rates, knowing very well that they had no authority to collect. Then there are cases of people having receipts from persons who acted as rate-collectors, and who, in fact, did not pay their rates at all.  I think Deputy Connor Hogan is aware of that <Col N="716" /> fact also.  On the whole, it is a very difficult situation to deal with, and you cannot deal with it by laying down any hard and fast rules and regulations. The way we have decided to deal with the matter, and we have done this after consultation with the sub-sheriffs from other parts of the country, is to give the power to act in this matter to the Minister and to his inspectors.  If we left that power to local individuals, cases of favouritism or, perhaps, cases of prejudice and of victimisation might occur, and for that reason we have taken the matter out of the hands of the local people and left it to the Minister and to his inspectors.  I will only act on the report of the inspector, and I will go carefully into each individual case, and will take every possible precaution to see that no victimisation occurs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister has not convinced me with his statement.  I have laid it down definitely in my amendment that no person should be deemed a defaulter who has paid rates for any period between the 30th September, 1920, and the 30th September, 1922, in respect of any property situated within the area of the local authority to any person acting or purporting to act with authority as collectors to the local authority.  I think that that disposes of the Minister's contention that parties have willingly paid rates to undesirable people during the period of the irregular campaign.  I say the 30th September, 1922, and I delimited it, so that really the Minister cannot score any point on that.  I do not want to stress the old-established procedure that the rates should only be liable on the property.  After all, is not that in keeping with the traditions of the past? And there is something in the nature of latent wisdom in it.  The Dáil should seriously consider whether it is going to depart from established precedents at the suggestion of the Minister.  I hope it will not.  The Minister is more or less legislating for an abnormal period which will, we hope, soon pass away, and I do not think it advisable in the circumstances that we should make such a radical departure as he proposes.</P>

      <P>To insert immediately before sub-section (5) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every such order made by the Minister under the foregoing sub-section shall be laid upon the table of each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if either of these houses shall within twenty-one days next ensuing after such House has sat pass a resolution annulling such order, such order shall then be annulled, but no proceedings shall lie against any person for any act done previously under the terms of such order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a necessary corollary to sub-section (4) (quoted).  This, at least, should not be contentious.  Orders made by the Minister are invariably laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and I do not see why in this instance similar procedure should not be followed.</P>

      <P>There is a certain element of truth in what Deputy Hogan says, that orders of this kind are usually laid on the table of the House, but a distinction has to be made.  This is purely an administrative matter, and it comes solely under my jurisdiction.  If I am not to be permitted powers of this kind, you might as well do without a Minister for Local Government altogether and run that Department through a Committee of the Dáil.  There is in this very Bill provision for laying certain Orders on the table of the Dáil, but those provisions apply because in <Col N="720" /> that case I am vested with more or less quasi-legislative powers.  In Sub-section 3 of Section 7 of the Bill, I am empowered to adopt certain enactments.  For that reason my powers are practically quasi-legislative. This is purely an administrative matter, and I think it would be very unusual, and not in accordance with any precedent, to ask me to accede to the amendment.  For that reason I cannot accept it.</P>

He speaks about it being an administrative matter.  That very fact, in essence, calls for the production of his orders and the placing of them on the table of the House.  It is really needless to stress the point.  It would be wrong and altogether inconsistent with public policy to give the Minister a free hand in applying this highly contentious measure, which may provoke very bitter animosities in the country.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 15 and 16, to delete the words &ldquo;within his bailiwick, belonging to the defaulter named in the warrant or.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 27, after the words and figures &ldquo;(No. 21 of 1923)&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;other than the power conferred by sub-section (6) of the aforesaid section to sell at any place outside the territorial boundaries of Saorstát Eireann goods, animals or chattels taken in execution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to prevent the Sheriff's officer, having seized goods in default of rates, from taking those goods to Scotland, England, France, China or Pernambuco for sale.  Unless this amendment is accepted, the powers under the Act <Col N="723" /> would allow the Sheriff, having seized goods, to take them anywhere, to secure a sale, and charge the expenses of the transfer to the debtor.  The requirements of the case, I think, make it clear that where goods are seized in this country, at this time, or at any time in the future, there is no need to give power to the Sheriff to take them outside the jurisdiction of the Free State.  I rather expect that the Minister will accept this amendment.  Therefore, I will not enlarge upon the arguments at present.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Johnson were moving an amendment which curtailed the sheriff's power to sell goods outside his own bailiwick, I would oppose it very determinedly.  However, this only restricts the power to sell outside the territory of An Saorstát, and there does seem to be something in favour of that point.  I would like to consider it if the Deputy would raise it on the Report stage.  I do not like to decide finally on the matter at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not a sprung amendment, and I think it would be better if the Minister would accept it, and then consider any verbal modifications on the Report Stage.  But this amendment has been handed in for several days, and it has had some consideration I have no doubt.  I urge that the Minister would accept it.  It was certainly not the intention, and it does not follow in the least from this amendment, that it should confine the sale to the bailiwick of the Sheriff. This amendment endeavours to restrict the sale to somewhere within the territorial boundaries of An Saorstát.  I would perhaps remind the Minister of the discussion that took place on the Finance Bill on this very point.  I think that if Deputy Magennis were here he would be a very hearty supporter of this amendment of mine.  He spoke very eloquently and very convincingly in its favour the last time it was under consideration.  The reasons urged against it at that time were, of course, the state of the country.  If the Minister wants to delay the time to consider this very obvious question, he can <Col N="724" /> hardly be inclined to plead the state of the country.  Otherwise it is a condemnation of the Government of the last six months.  I will ask the Minister to accept this now, and then if there is any verbal change required at a later stage, he could produce that amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that it will not be a case of a verbal change. It will be a question either of accepting the principle or not accepting it.  I have a difficulty in doing that at the present moment.  The fact is that Deputy Johnson moved a similar amendment to this, in the last session of An Dáil, and I think that amendment was turned down.  And it is precisely because I think the conditions have changed considerably in the Free State since then, that I am not disposed to turn that down at present.  If this Bill had come up then, I would refuse to consider the amendment, but I would like to discuss this amendment with the other Ministers before coming to a decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the Minister for Local Government desiring to confer with other Ministers on a matter within his Department. But the Minister surely is going to accept responsibility to the Dáil for a Bill he has brought in dealing with his own Department and for which the Executive Council is not responsible. It is quite clear that it is necessary to state a case for this amendment.  The Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment.  In fact he wants to have power given to the Sheriff who has seized goods in lieu of rates to take those goods away to England or Scotland and sell them by auction, and to charge against the debtor all the expenses of that sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that is a very bad principle to embody in a Bill.  It is bad in the Finance Bill.  It is bad in the Enforcement of Law Bill, and it is ten times worse in this Bill.  I wonder can the Minister for Finance help the Minister for Local Government by telling him if there has been a case, since either of those two Bills was passed, which required that the Sheriff should take seized goods over the water, or to the <Col N="725" /> North of Ireland, to sell them by public auction for the purpose of paying the rates?  I doubt very much that there has been a single case of the kind. There may have been.  I ask Deputies to bear in mind what is possible under the Bill, and to declare whether or not they are in favour of it.  An under-Sheriff may seize goods and he may please himself whether he takes those goods to England or Scotland, or the North of Ireland, or any other country under the sun, to sell them, so long as he cannot be accused of malice, and he can charge the debtor with the expense of transferring the goods.  I am moving that power should not be conferred upon an under-Sheriff, and the Minister hesitates to accept that.  I would ask the Dáil to express its own views whether or not those powers should be given to an under-Sheriff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point to be remembered in this.  Once we gave the Sheriff power to sell outside his bailiwick we ought not to prevent him selling in a place that might be in the best interests of the debtor or defaulter. For instance, if goods were seized in <Col N="726" /> Donegal, adjacent to Derry City, and it was a question of sending the goods to Derry or Dublin for sale, it might be definitely to the advantage of the defaulter or the debtor that they should be sent to Derry rather than to Dublin.  That is a point some weight might be attached to.  In general, we can feel the force of the argument, if circumstances permit, for confining the power of the Sheriff to sending goods to a place solely inside the Saorstát. The essential thing is the power to sell outside his bailiwick.  Once you allow the Sheriff to sell outside his bailiwick, there are advantages, perhaps, in giving him the wider discretion.  I do not know of any case in which goods have been sent across the water, or into the Six Counties, since either of the Acts mentioned came into operation.  There may have been such cases, but they were very few.  That rather goes to indicate there is not any great likelihood of a person suffering as a result of this provision.</P>

      <P>One is in a difficulty here.  We are asked to judge between two allegiances&mdash;that due to the Minister for Local Government and that due to the Minister for Finance&mdash;and any other citizen who has got a judgment may go hang.  But as between the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Local Government, there may come the question as to whether a claim for income tax and a seizure for income tax due should have priority over a seizure for rates due.  The Minister for Local Government desires that rates should have a preference, and that what is due to the local councils should be paid first, or at least that the seizure and the warrant for seizure on account of debts due for rates should have priority over a warrant of seizure for debts due for income tax.  Apparently the Income Tax Department has been in conflict with the Local Government Department, and the Dáil is now asked to come between these two Departments of Government and say which they will choose to support.  That is a difficult position to put the Dáil in, and I think that Deputy Duggan ought to inform us whether he has been able to make up the difference between the two Ministers.  Perhaps it is not desirable, perhaps it is better that the Minister for Finance should come forward and make his claim, and that the Minister for Local Government should make his claim.  I am inclined, on this occasion, at all events, to stand with the Minister for Local Government and to urge that the rates should have a first claim upon the goods seized under these warrants.  I think on the whole the Minister for Local Government has got a prior claim, and I am inclined to support the argument that it may be an advantage to support the Minister for Local Government in his original desire if he still desires to have precedence over the Minister for <Col N="728" /> Finance.  I am quite prepared to reconsider the position, but I think it would be necessary to have some argument adduced in favour of the change.</P>

      <P>It is evident there is one other condition attaching to the position of a Minister who is not a member of the Executive Council beyond the fact that he is irremovable during the lifetime of the Dáil.  Once he secures Government time for a Bill he can put into that Bill anything he likes without consulting the Executive Council.  We are now in a deadlock, and I suppose the Minister will have to try to resolve the difficulty that has arisen.  Having regard to the case that Deputy Johnson has made, I think it would be very desirable to have the point argued, and that we should be told why income tax should have priority over rates, and vice versa.  Naturally, until we are told that, I do not see how we can very wisely proceed with this amendment, or whether the excuse is that the Minister for Local Government has been overruled by the Executive Council, or whether the point that is dealt with in this amendment was overlooked when the Bill was first introduced.  I think a little more enlightenment on the issue raised by this amendment would be very valuable indeed to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>However, other considerations have to be taken into account as well as the consideration affecting one particular Department. Representations have been made to me from various quarters all over the country that this provision, if it were left here unamended, might cause a serious and undue hardship to people who are trying to recover debts for perhaps the last twelve months, and even over a longer period.  As a result of these representations, I agreed with them <Col N="729" /> that it was better withdraw this, and not insist on a priority for any kind of debt, either for rates, income tax, land annuities or any debts of that kind.</P>

      <P>On the motion that the Section, as amended, stand part of the Bill, I desire to say that while I have not put down any amendment myself I think this motion affords me an opportunity to say a word or two on the general question, and particularly with a view to get an assurance from the Minister that he does not think that the proposed Section will solve the real difficulty that exists at present with regard to the collection of rates.  I am sure the Minister is aware as to how unsatisfactory the position is, both because of the complexity and even diversity of the law under which rates are collected.  I do not think he would contend that the powers given to him under this Bill will really solve the difficulty.  I am sure he is aware that these difficulties exist, particularly with regard to cases where holdings are small and where they are held as small weekly tenancies, principally from District Councils, and in cases where the power for recovery of the rates would lapse if the rates were not paid by a certain date.  That provision applies especially in the case of urban rates, but I understand the power would not lapse in the case of poor rate.  I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate the difficulties that prevail, because I am sure the Minister is aware of them.  I merely raise the question in order to get an assurance from him that he is aware of the fact, and that, perhaps, he will introduce a measure to deal with the whole thing in a general way at as early a date as possible.  I recognise that he could not do it very well in a temporary measure of this kind, and, therefore, I did not think it well to put down any amendment.</P>

      <P>It is not exactly unopposed. Part of the information cannot be got without an enormous amount of trouble.  I will just state the position. I cannot give him the number of persons in receipt of old age pensions in the Saorstát for the last five years, because the returns have only been kept separate for the last two years.  I can give him returns for the whole of Ireland for a good period. Then I can give him the figures for the Saorstát in the year ending September 30th, 1922, and the year ending September 30th, 1923.  I can give him the number of persons having the full pension, the number having 8s., the number 6s., the number 4s., the number 2s., and the number 1s.; but there is no record kept as to the amount of means of any person who has 10s. or less.  The return that comes in simply means not exceeding £26 5s. a year, or there is nothing available.  It would mean an examination in each case.  If we were doing something like altering the schedule where an examination of each case would be required, it could be given, but for the purpose of private information it would mean that pension officers would have to visit each individual pensioner and make enquiries which would mean an enormous amount of trouble and would take many months.</P>

      <P>I move</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should put into effect the recommendations of the Report of the Canals and Inland Waterways Commission, July, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In setting down this motion my primary intention was to get from the Ministry some declaration of policy in regard to a report that would be admitted to be of very considerable importance. There have been, I believe, something like seven or eight different Commissions during the past century in connection with the canals and inland waterways of Ireland.  I think I am correct in saying that there is hardly one, if there be one single recommendation, made by one single Commission, during the whole of that time that has been put into operation.  It <Col N="735" /> would be a pity, I think, if in the Free State a Commission of this importance, dealing with a matter of this importance, were to have reserved for it the same fate as has been reserved for all earlier Commissions, dealing with the same question.  I am sure that the Ministry will agree that, whether the report be or be not of such a nature as should be put into effect, in all its provisions, it is at least deserving and worthy of some Ministerial statement as to what is going to be done.  I am not going into the details of the report. It is a very lengthy document.  It has gone into a mass of material, some of it dealing with the history of canals and waterways in Ireland, and it has made a definite series of recommendations, all of which have been very carefully considered by the Commission. In general outline, the proposal of the Commission is that the canals and waterways of Ireland should be nationalised&mdash;should be undertaken by the State and run by the State.  I need not labour the importance of these canals&mdash;and when I say canals I include the various waterways, whether rivers or otherwise, that make of the whole one single, complicated pattern of communication other than communication by rail&mdash;but they are vital, and could be made of very great service, indeed, to the economic life of this country.  It has been stated by the Commission&mdash; and I have heard it stated in public for a long number of years&mdash;that if the canals and waterways were to be worked properly as one system under single control, that the costs of transport in Ireland could be very materially reduced.  It follows that if the cost of transport in Ireland could be materially reduced, the cost of living in Ireland could be reduced too.  Take only one part of the country&mdash;the great Midland plain.  Take the towns of Mullingar, Athlone and Ballinasloe.  I do not touch upon those for any reason except that they furnish an example of what can be said of a good many other towns.  If the canal connecting these towns were put into proper repair and equipped as canals would be equipped in any other country in the world, the cost of commodities in these towns would be very materially <Col N="736" /> reduced, especially those commodities that are drawn, under the conditions under which we live, from the imports received by this country from other countries.  More than that, there are manufacturing products&mdash;I include in &ldquo;manufacturing products,&rdquo; industry, not alone as the term is used in other countries, but as it is used here in respect of our chief industry, agriculture&mdash;and the freights on the export of those products to the ports of this country could also be materially reduced in respect of such commodities as can be sent by the waterways.  There is a very excellent reason why the canal system of this country should be undertaken under one single direction&mdash;that single direction preferably being the direction of the State&mdash;and worked for the national advantage, more or less on the lines recommended by this report.</P>
    <P>I realise very well&mdash;no Deputy can fail to realise&mdash;that the Government at the present moment have undertaken probably as many problems as they can hope satisfactorily to solve.  I do not know what reply the Government will make to the proposition put up to it by the Canal Commission, but if the Government should reply, &ldquo;We have in hands about as much as we can hope to undertake,&rdquo; I think they will have stated something very reasonable from their point of view.  But if that answer should be returned, the problem of the Canals will still remain a problem deserving of immediate attention.  I think myself&mdash;I have long been of the conviction, and I say it here now as prefatory to anything else I may follow with&mdash;that the right way in which the canals and waterways in this country should be worked would be under one single direction, and that that single direction should be the direction of the State.  I am fortified in that conviction by the fact that practically every other country has done the same.  In France and in other countries, as this Report sets out&mdash;I will not go into the details of it&mdash;all the canals are run under the direction of the State.  In France it is insisted upon that the rates quotable by canals should be at least 15 per cent. lower than the rates quotable by rail, although the State runs both rail and canal.  I repeat that I think the best method by which this problem can be answered would be by State <Col N="737" /> control in this regard.  But if the Government should say they are not prepared, at the present moment, to undertake this problem, that they have their hands full with the railway question, and will be for some time engaged and pre-engaged with that problem, then I say the Government should state that it is prepared&mdash;I want to make a practical suggestion as an alternative to what I consider the best scheme&mdash;to lend legislative sanction to disengaging the canals from the control of the railways. I take one particular canal&mdash;the Grand Canal.  I am quoting from the evidence given by the Minister for Public Works in Ireland before the 1906 Canal Commission. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In 1846 authority was given for the sale of this Canal to the Midland Great Western Railway Company, and a section in that Act provided that all the works connected with it shall be maintained, upheld and preserved by the Company for the purpose of navigation in as full, ample, and perfect a manner as by the Act of 1818 is authorised and required; and the Lord Lieutenant and the Board of Control shall exercise the same powers over the Railway Company and Canal as over the Canal Companies and Canal.</P>
    <P>I ask if anyone who has ever travelled up and down this line would profess for one single instant that that Canal&mdash;an important waterway and an important connection of transport&mdash;is being maintained as it should be maintained.  It is obvious that it is not being so maintained. It is further obvious that the Canals are being withheld from their proper use, lest they should prove too strong an opponent to the railways.  In other words, that one form of transport has taken a hold of the rival form of transport, and has strangled it as a competitor that would imperil its own progress.  Whether it be done by way of the recommendations of this Report or not&mdash;and I think it should preferably be done by way of these recommendations&mdash;I do urge that it is very important to this country that the Government should determine that the canals should be disengaged from that stranglehold by the railways, and that the Government should say that if any person or persons&mdash;failing their own undertaking of this control&mdash;are willing <Col N="738" /> to undertake control and run the canals in competition with the railways, they (the Government) are willing to lend such a proposition their active assistance. I do not suggest that that assistance should be by way of new legislation. That is a point to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance.  I do not suggest by way of new legislation, but merely by insisting that the legislation that has been already enacted and which we, by Article 73 of the Constitution, have taken over as the legislation of the Free State shall be executed within the full meaning of its provisions.</P>
    <P>In other words, if a railway company have taken over a canal and have undertaken to maintain it in the state of perfection in which they found it and are not doing so, the railway company shall be compelled, having failed to keep its contract, to part with its interests in these canals in order that the canals may be run as they should be run, and as they are run in other countries in competition with the railways; and they should not be run by railways that are very careful to see that they will never run them in competition with themselves.  The Minister for Agriculture has here and outside the Dáil argued that one of the main questions before this country is the high cost of living.  He has also touched upon the problem of high rates of transport and high freights.  I believe that in the report made by the Canal Commission a very successful contribution has been made to solving the problem that the Minister for Agriculture has indicated.  I do not want to press this Report too strongly upon the Ministry. The Ministry, I admit frankly, have got a reasonable case&mdash;even if they say that the Report would carry their entire conviction but yet that they are not able to put it into execution because of the many other matters that must engage their attention.  Then I would urge in the alternative that they should declare publicly that they are willing to give any assistance that lies in their power in disengaging the canals from the control of the railway companies, and in the future to insist that the canals should be kept apart from the control of the railway companies, and to see also that in the future they should be run as an alternative <Col N="739" /> competitive transport system to the railways.  The best way to do that is to do it themselves.  But if they cannot do it themselves they should give assistance so that it shall be done by others and done as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Speaking on behalf of the agricultural industry, we feel that the present system by which canals are under the control, in part, of the railway companies has not given an opportunity for the competition in freights.  Any thing that would tend to lower freights is to the advantage of the community, especially to the advantage of the agricultural community.  In the instance that Deputy Figgis has mentioned about the canals he inadvertently named the Grand Canal when he should have said the Royal Canal.  The Royal Canal is owned by the railway company, and anyone who knows the condition of affairs in that canal knows that it has been strangled, therefore the competition that would be given effect to in Mullingar, in Longford and other places has been taken away.  I do not expect that the Government will nationalise the canals.  As a matter of fact the farmers are opposed to nationalisation in any shape or form. But there could be inside the lines of the Report sufficient information by which we could have an alternative means of transport to the various points which these canals serve.  For that reason I formally second the motion.</P>

      <P>I think it is scarcely worthy of the consideration of Reports such as this that there should be such a small number present&mdash;that there should be only one Minister supported by two of his colleagues.  If the Minister for Finance agrees, I would move the adjournment of the debate to enable the Minister responsible to come to the Dáil and to make a statement with regard to the matter moved by Deputy Figgis.  That is the way out of the difficulty at the moment, because there is a difficulty in the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in the fact that there is such a small number <Col N="740" /> present.  I think that before any further debate takes place on this matter that the responsible Minister should make a statement of Government policy.</P>

And I suggest the adjournment of the debate to allow him to make a statement of Government policy arising out of the Commission.  I think that such a statement is due to the Dáil, and I suggest it would be more appropriate that such a statement should be made by the responsible Minister, and not by a Minister who has nothing to do with the matter under discussion.</P>

    <P>It was rather a surprise for me when the Minister for Local Government opposed this motion this day week.  It will be well within the recollection of Deputies that similar motions have been put down asking for Returns, and invariably the rule has been to supply the Return asked for.  I explained last Friday that the Return I am seeking was needed, from the farmers' point of view, in connection with a sworn inquiry into County Clare administration, which opens on the 19th February.  On the Second Reading of the Local Government (Collection of Rates) Bill, the Minister said: &ldquo;So far as my Department is concerned, we have done everything in our power to prevent that mal-administration, and I do not think Deputy Hogan has anything to complain of. He complained to me some time ago about the condition of affairs in County Clare, and I immediately agreed to hold a sworn inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If opposing a motion seeking necessary information to endeavour to establish decent conditions in the county, can be regarded as fulfilling this pledge, I am at a loss to understand what the pledge means or to interpret his words. Deputy Figgis put forward a motion on the 20th instant asking for a Return, and that Return was supplied him.

      <P>It is rather a serious question when a Minister refuses to supply a return and when he makes a blank refusal.  It seems to me, as I had occasion to point out in the debate to-day on the Committee <Col N="743" /> Stage of the Local Government (Collection of Rates) Bill, that our Ministerial neophyte&mdash;if I can use such an expression&mdash;has yet to assimilate the traditions of Government.  The next thing we will have in the Dáil is a refusal on the part of Ministers to answer questions; they will ignore the existence of Parliament and deny its right to challenge any abuse.  I say that is an impossible position.  As a matter of fact, the information I seek has already been promised as far back as two years by the then Minister for Local Government, now President Cosgrave. In consultation with the then Minister for Local Government, an agreement was drawn up on behalf of the Clare Farmers' Association, by which a conference was to be held with the Clare County Council.  One of the terms of reference of this conference was that the county and district officials were to give the Clare Farmers' Association all reasonable facilities for collecting such statistics as might be required for submission to the conference. I may add that these facilities were never granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those officials and their committees absolutely refused to allow the Farmers' Association to inquire into the condition of their institutions and to find out how the ratepayers' money was spent.  If there is anything at all consistent about administration and about departmental procedure, it is that the pledges given by one Minister are always honoured by his successor.  An Inspector of the Local Government Department actually suggested, and, in fact, dictated, the heads under which information should be collected.  The Secretary of the Clare Farmers' Association, armed with that authority, presented himself, and in one institution he was told there was no occasion for him to enter, and that any extern supervision was merely a work of supererogation.  I will read one little extract from the statement of a Councillor in regard to the Secretary of the Farmers' Association requesting the statistics I have referred to.  This is what the Councillor said: &ldquo;I think this is terrific cheek, and I, as a member of this Council, protest against anybody <Col N="744" /> interfering with any Committee or any body set up by us.  We have set up Committees to manage every hospital and institution in the county, and we have thorough confidence in their ability to do so.  I propose the communication, or the resolution, or whatever you like to call it be marked read.  It is absolute cheek.  When they get into office they can appoint their own Committee, but while we are in office we will have our own Committees, and we have confidence in them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinary state of affairs to have existing in any county. The ratepayers are called on to pay excessive rates, yet they are not allowed to know how one penny of their money is expended.  The Minister for Local Government, in refusing my motion, has made it a question of confidence in himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the Motion.  Without entering into the merits of the case and without saying anything in regard to the Clare County Council, I think it is a reasonable motion, and except there was undue expenditure needed to produce the figures required, I think the Minister ought to supply them without the necessity of having a debate here.  After all, what is asked is information necessary at a sworn inquiry.  I should like to know the Minister's reason for refusing to supply it; it is merely to give those people every facility to see if abuses exist in County Clare.  We have heard a lot about mal-administration there, and I think the Minister ought to facilitate the people by giving them the information required.  It is for this reason that I formally second the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As my name has been mentioned, I must say I have no immediate recollection of the undertaking that Deputy Hogan says I gave. I believe I gave an undertaking that we would facilitate an inquiry.  I would ask the Dáil to consider what is asked for in this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to go back to the year 1899, that is 24 years ago, and to furnish particulars for that particular year.  Now, I would like to know what possible bearing the cost of services in the year 1899&mdash;the first year after the <Col N="745" /> Local Government Act came into operation&mdash;can have in relation to the cost of services to-day.  I do know that in the intervening period of years many and important services have been brought into operation in Local Government. An enormous extension of expenditure has also been incurred, and I think it is what the lawyers would call special pleading, to bring in a thing of that sort.  I have some experience of local enquiries, of sworn enquiries, and so on.  I was a member of a local authority in Dublin for a great many years, and I say, from the experience I have gained there, that piles and piles of statistics serve no useful purpose.  They are rarely of use in coming to a sensible conclusion on any subject that is being considered; they only provide ammunition for the legal profession to support, or attempt to support, in whatever manner they may consider best in their own interest, the case that is put up.  They support their case from some remote statistics that are probably as much out of date as any event that happened in 1899 is with things that occur to-day. Coming to the third paragraph in the Return asked for, we are asked for a list of officials superannuated in the County Clare.  I think that information could be had in Thom's Directory; I am not quite sure, but I know that up to recent years one would find that information in Thom's Directory.  What is asked for, according to this resolution, is to put some official of the Local Government Department at work in order to compile this, and supposing you had the whole lot furnished to you, what advantage would be derived from it? A case ought to be made, if public money is going to be expended, that some advantage is going to be derived from the information asked for, if it is going to entail cost in supplying.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Local Government I realised the size of the problem we had in hand, and the dislocation that arose in the accounts of the local authorities and services of the local authorities, and the big work there was in trying to keep the machine going at all, with the cogs knocked completely out of some of the wheels, and some not operating at all, and so <Col N="746" /> on.  When it was first mentioned by the Government that was operating from the Custom House that grants would be withheld from local authorities it became immediately necessary to economise on every side, and to cut down services which might be even remotely described as luxuries or extravagant ones, and in that particular category there was one service which could not by any stretch of the imagination be called a luxury or an extravagance, but which was not heard of at all in 1899, and that is the treatment of tuberculosis.  There was a particular reason for stopping any expenditure that could possibly be avoided in connection with that service because half of the cost, if my recollection is correct, was borne by the Local Government Board, and so on with regard to many other services; and to ask for a return of 1918 and 1919 is also unreasonable if the case be that in those years it was x pounds and that now it is 2½ times x pounds.  I am sure the Deputy would admit himself that it would be impossible for him to submit to this House his budget of expenditure in 1918 and 1919, and to give his budget for 1922 and 1923.  A great many of these returns which were in the custody and possession of the particular Department then in charge in the Government of Ireland were destroyed. The Deputy will admit that that was the case.  He has probably heard of an accident at the Custom House a couple of years ago, when many documents were destroyed.  To give these returns now asked for would mean that we would have to get into communication with every local authority in every county and ask them to look up their files and so forth, and to send in particulars of every case, and then when you have got them it would take an accountant&mdash;a legal man well versed in local government&mdash;to be able to make anything out of them.</P>
    <P>I am positively certain that if the Deputy were to see the Minister for Local Government and to narrow down the points he wants information upon, and if he gave some consideration to the events of the last three or four years the Minister for Local Government would meet him in a reasonable <Col N="747" /> demand.  I have no recollection of ever saying to any deputation from the Co. Clare that I would seek for and get particulars tabulated showing the cost of services in 1899 and 1914, and 1918 and 1919, and 1922 and 1923.  I have no recollection of saying anything of that kind at all.</P>

      <P>It is rather to be regretted that the President did not follow the precedent of the Minister for Finance earlier in the evening when he was replying to a motion of Deputy Johnson, for he not only indicated the reason why he could not give the information, but he also indicated what information it was in his power to give.  No doubt the President did indicate to the Deputy that he might confer with the Minister for Local Government on the motion if he divided it up, but he did not indicate how far.  I agree with the Deputy's desire for information, but I agree with the President that the demand is a far-reaching one, but so far as it affects the important items 4 and 5 the information should not be difficult to obtain and particularly in regard to the Clare Mental Hospital.  Presumably that institution keeps its own accounts and could supply the information.  The Government always adopt a very lofty attitude&mdash;an attitude I admire&mdash;&ldquo;they say&mdash;let them say.&rdquo;  We are living in the most suspicious country in the world, and it is occasionally desirable to provide facts.  I think item 4 would probably provide facts available which would help to dispel suspicion rather than create it, and therefore, if possible, I urge that the Government should meet the Deputy in this respect at all events.</P>

      <P>The President in his remarks has certainly put his finger on what I think is the unnecessary information looked for under item number one, but as far as item number two is concerned, and as far as it relates to the years 1914, 1918, 1919 and 1922-23, I do not think it is unreasonable to look for the statistics mentioned, nor do I think it is proper to describe them as extravagant demands. The President, in his statement, did not <Col N="748" /> give an answer as far as that portion of the motion is concerned, and I think it is only right to point out that this demand for information was not put down in a flippant spirit.  The information asked for has been refused by the officials of the Clare County Council. The President stated that it would give considerable trouble to his Department, or indeed to any other Department, if it had to supply this information.  All these figures that have been asked for are in the possession of the Clare County Council and its officials.  The records are in their possession, and they were asked for the information, but refused to give it, and I think that the proper authority here in Dublin should insist on the production of the information asked for.  The officials of the Clare County Council have refused to give this information to anybody, and there is no means of getting it if we have not a sympathetic Department here to see that the demand is complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, as Deputy Cooper said, it would be in the interests of good administration, and would help to restore confidence in the country, if the Government here made the Clare County Council, or the officials responsible to it, produce the figures asked for.  It would clear the air if the information was supplied.  If they have a clean sheet why hide it under this cloak of refusal, such as telling us about the trouble and the expense that would be involved if the information were to be supplied.  I hope that when the Minister rises to reply that he will give the information, especially in regard to the years that I have already referred to.  I think we should also get a list of the officials in that county who have been superannuated or whose offices have been abolished.  We have an instance in Clare where a certain officer was dismissed for incompetence, but despite that ten years were added to his period of service for superannuation purposes.  These are matters that must appeal to the Minister and to the Executive Council.  They are of vital importance in the interests of clean administration in Clare, and I think it is about time that the light of day was thrown on some of these proceedings. <Col N="749" /> I suggest to the Minister not to take up the same attitude as that adopted by the President, but rather that he should meet in a reasonable way the demand put forward for this information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word of explanation.  I was not giving a Government decision on this at all.  It is a matter for the Minister for Local Government, who is the External Minister concerned, and he can give all the information he considers, or is advised, is necessary.  I should also say that I am not so sure that the Minister if he ordered the county council to do these things, would be entitled to see that his order was carried out.  I am not so sure at all on that point.  You have extraordinary powers with regard to boards of guardians and possibly rural district councils, but I do not know that you have these extraordinary powers with regard to such bodies as county councils.  The suggestion I made was that the Deputy would see the Minister and ascertain what reasonable information was possible and which would not be extra costly to supply, because if the demand made is acceeded to, every Deputy in the Dáil would have the same right as Deputy Connor Hogan claims to have to ask for the same amount of information in respect of the other twenty-five counties. You can see at once that if you are going to place such a burden as that on the Department, and if you also consider the expense involved that the other work in the Department must be held up and naturally, if this extra work can be done, it may be said that the officials are apparently not doing their work.</P>

      <P>This, to my mind, is another attempt to level another blow against local administration in this country.

Now, I would advise the Government not to give this return.</P>

      <P>I am not in the habit <Col N="750" /> of either putting on a cloak or a blanket, but I am out for clean administration just as much as Deputy Gorey or the Party to which he belongs.  I think I heard Deputy Connor Hogan say that there was to be a sworn inquiry into the conduct of the affairs of the local bodies in the county of Clare. Now, if that is a fact, is not that the proper tribunal at which to elicit the information asked for here.  Is it fair, I ask, for a Deputy because of his privileged position in this Dáil to come here and ask for certain information which he will have beforehand&mdash;not I say in the interest of the ratepayers of that county as a whole, but in the interest of the particular organisation that he represents here.  That appears to be the line he is going on all the time. He appears to resent very much the attitude of the Clare County Council or some of its committees because, forsooth, the Farmers' Union representatives were not allowed to go in and examine the work the committee was doing.  The committee, it appears, from what we have been told, was engaged on some work in a room, and these representatives from the Farmers' Union went there and made the claim, it appears, to go in and examine the work on which the committee was engaged. They were refused admission, and I certainly would congratulate any public board in Clare which refused them such permission.  In the course of the debate it was alleged that the President made a certain statement.  I never heard him make the statement he was supposed to have made, and from my experience I think he knows as much about local administration as any other man and that he would not make the statement attributed to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is going to be a sworn inquiry into the administration of affairs in the County Clare it would, in my opinion, be a very undesirable and injudicious thing for the Government to give this information.  In the event of such an inquiry being held the giving of the information would prejudice the position of the Clare County Council. It would create an atmosphere which would condemn the County Council beforehand and before any evidence had been heard, because certain <Col N="751" /> inferences would be drawn, as I am sure certain inferences will be drawn even from this debate to the effect that the public bodies in Clare are not carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>It is the popular thing, as I said before, to condemn local Councils, but it ought to be remembered in their favour that these Councils have had to carry on under very abnormal conditions, and I think they ought to get a chance to settle their affairs.  I do not think it is a reasonable thing at all to ask for this information in view of the fact that there is going to be a sworn inquiry.  Deputy Cooper says we are living in the most suspicious country in the world.  That may be, and I suppose we are.  But I think debates of this kind are going to make the people in this unfortunate country far more suspicious still and far more suspicious of the public bodies charged with the administration of local affairs.  As I have said already, if there is going to be a sworn inquiry in Clare, I would advise the Government not to give the information asked for, but rather to offer every facility to the ratepayers of that county as regards the holding of the inquiry with a view to trying to get clean administration in Clare, and, indeed, in every other county in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I intend to support Deputy Corish.  I understood him to say that if there was need for a sworn enquiry, a sworn enquiry should have been asked for, and it should not be necessary for a Deputy to put this series of meaningless questions, to my mind, before the House and the Minister for Local Government.  It strikes me that to ask for this return is simply stating that the County Council in Clare, like a great many other County Councils in Ireland, have on these public bodies men who do not do their duty.  If the farmers in Clare and elsewhere took an interest in their work and saw that the work these men are sent to do is done, and if there was proper treatment of their various institutions, mental hospitals <Col N="752" /> and asylums and roads and so on, by the farmers who are returned by the Farmers' Union to do these duties, there would be no need to ask for returns as far back as 1918 or 1919.  Why these figures are asked for I do not know.  I know nothing about the position of County Clare or of the County Council or other bodies, District and Urban Councils there, but it seems strange to ask for the names of the Councillors in Co. Clare as if the people of the county did not know who they were.  If they do not know it means that these men are not attending the meetings, and it is time for the Farmers' Union to see that these men do their work even if they don't know their names.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bryan Cooper referred to the purity of the conditions under which we are living.  Of course in the past we were always rather doubtful of public representatives, and unfortunately those who were in control of affairs, Grand Juries and other bodies, were not, like Ceasar's wife, above reproach.  Let us hope in the future that we will not act on the lines that were adopted by these bodies, but that the Farmers' Union will take steps to see that the work of their representatives will be something other than voting for increased salaries and, above all, sending to the Local Government Department proposals that ten years should be added to the superannuation of a servant of theirs who is about to retire.  It is generally on the recommendations of councils that these ten years are added, and the Local Government Department have very great difficulty in not acceding to the requests of the county and district councils.  It is up to the Farmers' Association to see that they have proper representation, in the same way as it is up to the labourers, the Cumann na n-Gaedheal, and other bodies, to see that the right people are appointed and not to be asking for these meaningless returns from the Local Government Department or other authorities.</P>

      <P>I think it is because the farmers of Clare were not able to do what Deputy D'Alton would like to see them do that this motion has been put down, because they could not succeed in getting the information in <Col N="753" /> their own county, that they thought they were entitled to as ratepayers, that this demand is made.  Is it too much for the ratepayers of Clare to ask?  Perhaps it is, but that is the opinion only of some Deputies.  It is not the opinion of the ratepayers of Clare, and as ratepayers they are entitled to be supplied with that information; they are entitled to know what money has been spent in their county, at least from 1918.  They are entitled to know if there is reason for their suspicion that more money has been spent&mdash;injudiciously spent&mdash;than should have been spent.  The question that the Minister for Local Government has to answer is:&mdash;How far is he prepared to meet Deputy Hogan, and what information is he really prepared to give?  Deputy Cooper struck the nail on the head, and I would say to the Minister that if he wants to create the feeling that his Ministry is perfectly impartial, this information will be given, and that he will supply whatever information is at his disposal.  If he is not prepared to do this what will the ratepayers in Co. Clare say? They will say that other influences are at work to prevent the Minister doing so, and their suspicions will be removed from the Clare County Council and the Clare District Councils to the Ministry of Local Government.  The Minister himself can answer whether it will be a good thing or not for his Ministry if the people of the country feel that when information is refused by the councils or their officials, these people are also able to prevent the Ministry from supplying this information.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy loses sight of the fact that certain documents were burned in the Custom House.  There are audits open to any ratepayer to go into, and a ratepayer is not entitled, if my recollection of Local Government law is right, to ask for particulars regarding years gone by.  It is supposed to be his duty to look to one particular year.  Under local government, I may say that a ratepayer has a life of only twelve months.  He exists only for one twelve months, and he is liable for that twelve months.  The new list of ratepayers in <Col N="754" /> the county is responsible for the next twelve months.  It may be altered, increased, reduced, but the liability lasts for twelve months.  A man going into County Clare this year has no right to look at last year's accounts, for he was not a ratepayer there then.  A man who came out of Clare last year and came to Dublin has no right to look at anything in Dublin for last year, a thing which is not generally known, or not generally appreciated.</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured to facilitate the Deputy in every way I could.  Clare County Council and Deputy Hogan asked for an inquiry.  I sent a man down to hold one, over a month ago, and that inquiry would be proceeding at present only that Deputy Connor Hogan asked me to adjourn it, so that he might be in a position to state his case there.  I also sent down an auditor to audit the accounts, and Deputy Connor Hogan, like every other <Col N="755" /> ratepayer, had an opportunity of attending while that audit was in progress, and getting whatever information is to be had from that source.</P>
      <P>The pressure on my Department at present is very heavy, and the work entailed in compiling this information is very heavy, and I find great difficulty in compiling it.  It would mean getting information from all those various local authorities and would take considerable time.  It would be much more convenient for the Deputy to get that information from the local bodies themselves. As I have said, I have done everything to facilitate the Deputy in the way of appointing this Inspector, and when the inquiry is opened and in full swing he will have every opportunity of making any enquiry he desires, and if there is any information withheld, which he thinks is material to his case, he can bring that matter before me and I will make sure he will get justice.  With regard to this information he asked for, if I were to give him the detailed information required of me in this motion it would run into a book, and as Deputy Gorey, or some other Deputy has pointed out, every Deputy is entitled to ask for such information.  If we were to proceed on those lines we would have to set up a staff to deal with these returns alone. I am not opposed to giving Deputy Hogan any information that can be procured without going to any exceptional cost or trouble, and if the Deputy will come over to me and look for this information I will be willing to oblige him in every possible way, but I cannot undertake to give him this huge amount of information he looks for in the return asked for.</P>

      <P>As far back as two months ago I wrote to the Minister for Local Government asking for this return.  He referred me back to those councils and subsidiary associations. What is that but treating the ratepayers with contempt?  In fact, he made a gesture of impotency by stating that it was not in his power to grant it.  There was nothing left then but to come to the Dáil and demand it. He speaks of having directed a sworn inquiry on behalf of the County Council, <Col N="756" /> yet, curiously enough, it was at my request, or after the interview I had with the Minister, that he directed it. We are making specific charges against those councils, and they have an efficient staff and legal aid at the expense of the ratepayers.  Are we, who provide all this money, to be out in the cold?  I say it is an impossible position. Deputy D'Alton says I should refer myself to the farmers on the Clare County Council.  As a matter of fact there are very few farmers on Clare County Council.  I should say 75 per cent. of the members are officers in the Army, men who are too keen on and fond of rattling the sabre.  The Minister for Local Government had this inquiry opened, and it was only as an afterthought, again at my suggestion, the auditor appeared.  I think that sufficiently disposes of the case made. The Minister has only put up futile arguments, and I say it will leave a very bad impression on the country if this motion is refused.  It will certainly go to a division.</P>

Was the Deputy aware of that fact, and did he take it into consideration, when he was making these grave charges against men who are in the Army and who are members of the Council?  I do not like to hear Deputies getting up and making charges against men because they were in the Army. These men, if they had the opportunity, would have done public business as well as Deputy Hogan or any other one.

      <P>There is another motion on the Order Paper by Deputy Heffernan:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that special measures should be taken by the Government to recompense the suppliers of milk to the creameries of the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland for the losses which they suffered owing to the seizure of those creameries in May, 1922, by unauthorised persons.</P>

      <P>I would like to know, with regard to this motion of mine, from Ministers if they would like to have it deferred until another day. I do not see the Minister for Agriculture present, and I think he is the Minister best acquainted with what happened during this trouble.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here either, and he is also acquainted with the subject.  If Ministers prefer that the matter should be discussed now I will do so.</P>

      <P>I think it would be better if the Deputy moved the motion now.  I have been looking into the matter and unless it would come within the scope of the Damage to Property Act.  I do not know how any provision could be made for payment. If it does come within the scope of the Damage to Property Act it is, I should <Col N="759" /> say at least, a consequential loss which is excluded.  Perhaps if the Deputy is willing to postpone it we will look into it.</P>

      <P>The claim has been investigated.  It is denied that any money was taken by troops, but parts of a Ford car were removed in order to prevent the use of the car. Arms, ammunition and Irregular correspondence were found at the time, and Mr. Geraghty was arrested.  In the circumstances his claim cannot be entertained.</P>
