      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that Mrs. Rose Walpole, 23 North Great George's Street, Dublin, has been refused compensation for the loss of her son, an ex-British soldier, who was killed in his own home during an attack on Fowler Hall; if he will take steps to secure a re-hearing of this case, and further, if he will state whether victims and their dependents can appeal against the decision of the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee.</P>

      <P>Where applications for compensation were made in cases of death resulting from injuries sustained, the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee were requested in making their recommendations to have regard to the actual extent of the dependency of the applicants upon the deceased persons. In this case the Committee, after taking all the circumstances into account, consider that there was no dependency of the applicant upon the deceased person and the application was refused.  I see no reason why the case should be reopened.</P>
      <P>As the Committee is a purely Departmental one and its recommendations are made on a purely <i>ex-gratia</i> basis, there is no question of a right of appeal, out where a reasonable <i>prima facie</i> case for further consideration of a claim is made to me, I will have the matter looked into.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the sum of <Col N="2800" /> £350 has been granted to Miss Margaret Loughman, of Kilkenny, by the Compensation Committee (Personal Injuries), presided over by Judge Johnston, for the loss of her right leg, resulting from the wound she received on May 2nd, 1922, during the operations between the National troops and the Irregulars in Kilkenny; if he is aware that she has lost almost two years wages, has had to incur doctor's expenses, solicitor's costs, her expenses and those of witnesses from Kilkenny to Waterford, where the claim was dealt with, as well as the price of an artificial limb; if he is aware that the amount of compensation allowed falls short of one-third of the expenses thus incurred, and, as the limb has been amputated almost from the hip, thus leaving her a cripple for life, whether he will undertake to see that the amount of compensation is reconsidered with a view to an increase which will be adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering applications for compensation in respect of personal injuries presented to them, the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee were requested to have regard <i>inter alia</i> to the actual earning capacity of the injured person prior to the injury, and to the impairment of earning capacity attributable to the injury.  I am satisfied that this case was carefully considered from these points of view by the Committee, and that they have taken into account all the other circumstances which were put before them in arriving at the amount which they have recommended to be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that question, is the Minister quite satisfied that less than one-third of the expenses involved in securing that amount of compensation is adequate for the loss of a limb and the fact that a person is rendered a cripple for life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly am not; but I do not accept the facts indicated in the question.  Miss Loughman, at the time of the injury, was employed as a book-keeper and was paid 22/6 a week.  The loss from failure to be able to earn can be calculated as far <Col N="2801" /> as that goes.  The injury was not such as to incapacitate her from carrying on as a typist and book-keeper.  I do not accept the facts that the Deputy seems to accept.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware this is not the only case of a like nature in which dissatisfaction has been expressed at the findings of this Commission?

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state upon what grounds the Cavan Urban District has only been allocated £700 for improvement of trunk roads as against £1,000 to Monaghan Urban District, and if he is aware that the sum allocated to Cavan Urban District should be at least doubled to meet the requirements in that district, and if in view of this the amount allocated to Cavan Urban District will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>, replying: The grant recently made available for trunk roads was apportioned on the basis of population, valuation and road expenditure. As each of these is greater in Monaghan Urban District than in Cavan Urban District the share of the former in the grant is the greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2802" /> As the grant has been apportioned no further sum can be allocated therefrom. It is, however, open to the County Council of Cavan to supplement, out of the grant allocated to to them, the £700 allocated to the Urban District Council of Cavan as has been done by the Councils of other counties in the case of certain urban district councils within their counties.</P>

      <P>From the information obtained by the Department of Agriculture, it is not evident that such necessity exists as would justify the extension of the scheme beyond the areas already approved.</P>

      <P>I should like to give my assent to the nomination by the President of Deputy P. McGilligan for this post of Minister for Industry and Commerce and Member of the Executive Council.  I have been stating, in connection with another matter, that the combination of three qualities in the man appealed to me very strongly, and that is, a combination of commonsense, honesty, and modesty.  I am told, and I believe, that the Minister nominated by the President has this combination in full quality.  I have heard several Deputies ask the question that Deputy Good has put, namely, <Col N="2810" /> what qualifications Deputy McGilligan has for the position.  Now the responsibility, I take it, rests with the President in making nominations, and I think, so long as the gentleman nominated is one who has a good character and ability, I think the responsibility ceases and that we, as Deputies of the Dáil, should give our assent to this.  I might say in this connection that no Minister who has gone into that position had his business at his fingers' end when he went into office first.  The President himself has got the thread of three Ministries into his hands.  The Minister for Home Affairs has had no training in the position in which he has been such a superlative success, and the Minister for Finance has grappled not only with Local Government but also with intriguing matters of finance, and I think if Deputy McGilligan possesses the ability and has the confidence of the Dáil that he is a gentleman of the highest character, then I think we may take it that he will be quite capable of carrying out the duties imposed upon him.  I should like, in an aside, to congratulate the President on the wisdom he has shown in selecting another gentleman with a Northern birthright.</P>

      <P>I take it that the idea of submitting the names of persons nominated by the President to act as Ministers and members of the Executive Council for the assent of the Dáil is not to ask the Dáil to approve formally of their qualifications for the office, but rather to give the Dáil an opportunity of saying whether there is any positive reason against such <Col N="2811" /> acceptance&mdash;reason, say, of character or otherwise.  If we are asked to give our formal and considered approval then we should require to canvass the capabilities of the Deputy brought forward, and we would be taking responsibility for the choice of the Executive. I do not think that that is the intention of the Constitution.  I do not think it is a practice that we ought to adopt in regard to the Executive Council, and when I am asked to give my assent to the nomination of Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am not asked to say that I believe he is a fit and proper person for that position, but I am given an opportunity to say to the Dáil if I know anything derogatory to his character or his fitness which the President may not know.  We are not relieving the President of his responsibility in his choice; we are merely assenting to allow him to go his own way in this matter.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is not my duty at present to deal with any expression of political heresies that might possibly be pronounced in the Dáil.  In that connection, I might say that while members of the Dáil may, perhaps, relieve themselves of responsibility in connection with any nomination that I might make, or that any persons coming after me might make, as the Constitution stands the nomination of a person here, for which the assent of the Dáil is given, is certainly a privilege and a right which ought not to be written down or discounted in any way whatever. It is open to any Party, or to any member of any Party to say, in this connection, that the responsibility is the responsibility of particular persons. Nevertheless, it would, in my opinion, be rather unwise to stress that to an unreasonable extent.  It is the right of the Dáil, and not the right of any person outside the Dáil, to assent to the nomination of any member of the Executive Council who would be put before it.  To that extent it would be necessary for me to enter a caveat, and I do so.  The statement made by Deputy Good, and the very able statement of Deputy Craig leave very little for me to add. Deputy Craig has, perhaps, mentioned <Col N="2812" /> in the three attributes that he referred to, one which is, in my opinion, one of the most important attributes that any person could have in a representative capacity, and that is common sense.</P>
      <P>I do say, in connection with these appointments, that some little consideration should be given to the circumstances of the time, and to the need for very careful study on the part of any person who is appointed a member of the Executive Council, to the undue strain-that has fallen on members of the Executive Council and on Ministers generally during the last couple of years, and which, as far as can be seen, is likely to continue for a very long time.  In that connection I might say that I have had no reason whatever to find any fault, or suggestion of a fault, on the part of either of the two members who have left the Executive Council.  This particular appointment is one which is scarcely open to the ordinary business man to take up.  It is a whole-time appointment, whole-time in more senses than one, and no matter what business one is engaged at, I do not know that one would have even sufficient time to take up one's income tax account if one were to discharge the duties of this particular office with any degree of satisfacton to the person holding it, or to the satisfaction of the Parties comprised in this House. I put forward this nomination of Deputy McGilligan, who has all the qualifications necessary for this office, and I ask the benediction of the House on his appointment.</P>

      <P>As I indicated last evening, I propose that the Dáil should not agree with amendment 25 from the Seanad as it stands, but instead should accept the amendment, the terms of which I mentioned last evening, by which the position would be preserved exactly as it was stated by the President when the Bill was in Committee before the Dáil.  A proposal which I have no doubt will be acceptable to everybody as a solution of the <Col N="2814" /> question that was raised is, that until the end of the financial year, that is to say, the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, the salaries of District Justices shall be paid out of a Vote, but that from and after that date the salaries of the District Justices shall be charged on the Central Fund, and so remove the Justices from the realm of discussion as to the discharge of their judicial functions.  It has already been explained why a short period of payment by annual Vote is considered by the Executive Council to be desirable, and I do not think I really need add anything to what has already been said on that subject.  The effect of this amendment that I propose, in lieu of the Seanad amendment, is to attain exactly the object aimed at by Deputy Johnson and other Deputies who supported his view, namely, that the discharge by the District Justices of their functions as judges should not be open to debate.</P>
      <P>I beg to move accordingly: &ldquo;That the Committee disagree with amendment 25, and that the following be inserted in lieu thereof: In Section 71, lines 3 and 4, page 16, to delete the words `to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas' and to insert in lieu thereof the words `until the end of the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1927, be paid out of moneys to be annually provided by the Oireachtas, and shall thereafter be charged on and be payable out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.' &rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that I was one of the persons to whom the Attorney-General referred yesterday.  He seemed to think that their persistence in placing these District Justices on the Estimates was due to some sinister motive.  I was wrong, and I admit that, but it was not through any sinister motive it was done, but simply through pig-headedness.  The Government having made up its mind to a certain course, absolutely refused to depart from it, but now it has made some concession, for which I thank it.  The concession the Government makes does not altogether meet our objection to having District Justices liable to be canvassed on the <Col N="2815" /> Vote for the Estimates in any year. It is better to have this course for three years than that it should continue for ever, but I object to having these salaries put on the Estimates at all.  I think the object which the Government wishes to achieve will not be fully achieved.  The Attorney-General has given his reasons for the action that has been taken.  He says that we, from time to time, will have power to review the number of District Justices, and to say whether fewer are needed.  We ought to be able to say at any time whether more or fewer are needed, but, putting them on the Estimates will give us no power to say that there ought to be more.  We can move a reduction, but not an increase, in the number.  If, in our opinion, the number of District Justices be too few, we could not increase it to more than thirty-three. This is a purely one-sided arrangement in which we can reduce the number, but cannot increase it.  As regards a reduction of the number of District Justices, that could be achieved apart from this amendment altogether.  Under Section 66 of the Bill it is provided that the number of such justices shall not exceed thirty-three. Supposing the Dáil came to the conclusion that a larger number than thirty-three was necessary, could we not pass a resolution to that effect, and would not the responsible Minister act on such a resolution of the Dáil?  I am always being told by the Minister for Finance in connection with other matters, that a resolution of the Dáil will absolutely have the force of law, and that the responsible Minister would be bound to act on it. Why should it not be so in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Attorney-General that he will achieve his object with less friction here and in the Seanad if instead of putting forward this amendment, although it is an improvement on the original proposal put forward, he put forward an amendment to Section 66, providing that the number of such justices shall not at any time exceed 33, unless a resolution of Dáil Eireann authorising such increase be passed.  I believe that would give an opportunity <Col N="2816" /> of reducing or increasing the number if it were necessary, and it would remove a very serious objection of allowing the conduct of the District Justices to be discussed in this House because of the ruling of An Ceann Comhairle that while the individual decision of a District Justice could not be discussed on the Estimates, their qualification, their possible partisanship, or lack of partisanship, might be discussed, and although the Attorney-General does in his amendment give a certain improvement upon the Seanad amendment, I think he agreed with me&mdash;the Seanad certainly agreed&mdash;in thinking that would be a most undesirable thing. I earnestly appeal, not in any partisan spirit, to the Attorney-General to take a little more time for consideration and to see whether an amendment of Section 66 would not do what he wants quite as well as an amendment placing the District Justices on the Estimates for three years.</P>

      <P>The whole question of what would happen if the District Justices were on the Estimates and the question of rulings were hypothetical, and I call attention to the fact that I answered none of them.  The Attorney-General said what he thought would probably be the ruling in one case, and a Deputy arguing against the Attorney-General gave a very emphatic ruling in another direction.  I merely said that not having to deal with the matters at the time I could give no ruling whatever, and I think that should be made quite clear.

      <P>I do not know if the Deputy thinks that the matter has not been considered with all the suggestions that should be considered, because I assure him it has really received every consideration from all those points of view.  One might have expected perhaps that Deputy Cooper might have advocated what prevails in another place, because there justices of this particular rank&mdash;<Col N="2817" /> stipendary magistrates and so on&mdash;are on the annual Estimates, and are fully open to discussion as to the methods in which they discharge their duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but I rather anticipated that the Deputy, from his previous experience, might have advocated that course, and had he done so I should have found myself in opposition to him, because I do not, nor do any members of the Executive Council, favour the dragging of the judicial work of any of the courts into discussion or to debate the position of independence which it is desired to preserve.  One of the questions which may arise, and properly arises, in every discussion is this, whether in the allocation of Justices, in the making out of the districts, which is a departmental and administrative matter, there may not be considerable room for improvement, and until we have felt our way for a couple of years and seen how the justices can best be distributed for the efficient discharge of their duties, and their districts made workable and a sufficient number appointed, it is desired to keep that open for discussion by the House, and it will be for the House to consider whether it should pursue any further discussion upon that matter.  Certainly it will not be encouraged from these Benches.  No debate on the judicial work of these Justices will be encouraged here.  I must say I put that amendment forward to meet the point raised, and I think it is a fair and reasonable proposition, and I believe it will be accepted, where the same view is taken, in the other Chamber, and certainly there is nothing unreasonable or, as the Deputy said, pig-headed about it.  It gives just that short interval allowed for consideration and then puts the Justices permanently upon the Central Fund and takes them permanently out of discussion in this House.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee disagree with Amendment 22 from the Seanad.  The amendment reads:&mdash;Section 66.  The word &ldquo;justices&rdquo; deleted and the word &ldquo;judges&rdquo; substituted therefor.  The words &ldquo;District Justice&rdquo; and &ldquo;District Justices&rdquo; deleted wherever they occur and the words &ldquo;District Judge&rdquo; and &ldquo;District Judges&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that I asked that the consideration of this amendment should be postponed until we had disposed of amendment 25 is this, that I believe the particular object of those who proposed to change the title of the District Justices was to remove the suspicion that they might not bear the character of judges and might not have attributed to them that independent position to which they are entitled under the Constitution.  Now, having admitted the principle of charging their salaries upon the Central Fund in the same way as the salaries of other judges, and having thereby admitted their right to a position of independence in the discharge of their judicial functions, I do submit that the whole object of the proposed change in title has been achieved, and that once that object is achieved the preservation of the existing title of District Justice is one that would meet, I think, with general approval. At any rate the amendment as it has been made in the Seanad is quite incapable, as I mentioned last evening, of being given effect to in the text of the Bill.  In order to carry out an amendment of this kind, or to give effect to an intention of this kind, it would be necessary to have had at least 20 different amendments made in the text of the Bill.  As it stands, this amendment would have the effect wherever, for instance, the title of the former Act, temporary Act, District Justices Temporary Provisions Act, 1923, occurs, of changing that into District Judges Act.  I therefore submit this amendment should not be agreed to and that the purpose is achieved by charging the salaries of the District Justices upon the Central Fund after a certain number of years, and also that the amendment as proposed <Col N="2819" /> by the Seanad is not incapable of being given effect to in the text of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Attorney-General has made it quite clear that this House has a right to reject this amendment sent down from the Seanad.  At the same time, I think it is necessary to state at this stage that even apart from the logical question the Attorney-General has raised in connection with the alteration of the name, any such alteration that could be made or reasonably claimed would not be for the benefit of the District Court at all.  The question of the District Justices was originally one of the first which came up before the Judiciary Commission.  They are not the same as judges in this respect that I would hope and expect that the positions would be filled by men who have experience rather in the solicitors' branch of the profession than in barristers&mdash;in other words, by men who in the ordinary course of their work have come into more intimate contact with the people than that which falls to the lot of the ordinary barrister.</P>
      <P>Clearly, amongst all sections of the Judiciary as laid down in the Bill, the only section that is open to the appointment of solicitors is this one of District Justices, and in my judgment it is a court that is, must be, and should be, a distinct court in itself, having practically no relation to the Circuit Court or the High Court.  I think that the name District Justice for the position best describes the work that they would be called upon to do and I think any alteration of that would be very unfortunate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I undertook to mention this evening the personnel of the Committee of Inquiry which the Government proposes to set up in connection with the Army.  It will be within the recollection of the Dáil that on the last day that this matter was before them I mentioned that it was the intention of the Government that <Col N="2821" /> three persons should hold this Inquiry &mdash;Mr. Justice Meredith, the Minister for Education, and Mr. McGilligan. On Friday last General Mulcahy raised this question on the adjournment, and during the debate there was a desire expressed, I think on behalf of two of the parties in the Dáil, that the scope of the personnel of this Committee of Inquiry should be extended.  I think there was an objection from a member of one party to any member of the Dáil being on the Committee.  I mention these things to show that while endeavouring, as far as possible, to meet those who have spoken in this matter since it was first raised that it is not possible in view of the conflicting opinions that have been expressed, to meet all sides.  Having considered the matter, we decided that we should appoint a Committee of five, two legal persons and three others.  Considering the matter subsequently, we came to the conclusion that the four parties in the Dáil ought to have representation on the Committee.  On subsequent reflection I decided to ask the Chairman of each of the parties to nominate a member of their party to act on this Committee. The Committee then that I was proposing would consist of Mr. Justice Meredith, Mr. FitzGibbon, who was a member of the last Dáil, a representative from the Farmers' Party, a representative from the Labour Party, a representative from the Independents, and Mr. McGilligan.  I have got a nomination from two of the parties, but Mr. Johnson informs me that the view of his party and himself is that nobody outside the Dáil should be on this particular Committee; that it is a Dáil Inquiry.  I cannot subscribe to that.  This Inquiry was originally intended to meet a case that was put up by Deputy McGrath for the purpose of inquiring into the administration of a Department of State. Events which occurred subsequently have altered to some extent the situation, but my undertaking was to Deputy McGrath.  I have not been able to see Deputy McGrath to know if the particular personnel or the arrangement of this Committee of Inquiry meets with his approval.  The <Col N="2822" /> personnel of the Inquiry is Mr. Justice Meredith, Mr. FitzGibbon, Mr. McGilligan, a nomination with which I agree from the Farmers' Party, a nomination with which I agree from the Independents. I have not yet received one&mdash;and from what has been said to me I do not anticipate a nomination, unless a change occurs in the course of the debate&mdash;from the Labour Party. That is so far as the personnel of the Inquiry is concerned.</P>
      <P>General Mulcahy put several questions to me on Friday regarding the Inquiry:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We should like to know if witnesses before this Inquiry shall be examined on oath?&rdquo;&mdash;There is no legal power to examine on oath upon such an Inquiry.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether there shall be power to compel witnesses to attend and give evidence if required?&rdquo;&mdash;There is no legal power to compel the attendance of witnesses before such an Inquiry. I might add that there is no reason to anticipate a refusal to give evidence on the part of any necessary witness.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether a verbatim report of the evidence would be taken?&rdquo;&mdash;Yes.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What will be the form of the Committee's report; whether they will be expected to fix responsibility for any matters involving mutinous conduct?&rdquo;&mdash;Responsibility only to the extent of how far a threat of mutiny or insubordination is due to &ldquo;muddling, mismanagement or incompetence&rdquo; in Army administration.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If it is intended that the Committee will make recommendations, what will be the scope of these recommendations?&rdquo;&mdash;It is not suggested that the Committee should be asked to make recommendations other than such as they may make under the terms of Reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Will persons who may be involved be allowed to be present constantly at the Inquiry or to depute persons to represent them, or, alternately, will any persons involved be given a copy of any evidence implicating them in any way, and may they appear before the Inquiry for the purpose of rebutting any such evidence?&rdquo;&mdash;Persons involved will be allowed to be present during the whole of the Inquiry or to depute persons to represent them, copy <Col N="2823" /> of evidence implicating any person or persons to be furnished to them and an opportunity to be given to rebut.</P>
    <P>That, A Chinn Comhairle, is all I have got to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the President will go into my point with regard to extending the Terms of Reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not read that in the Report, but I accept it that it is there.  It is not intended to extend the Terms of Reference beyond what I have already announced in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is due to the Dáil that we should give some explanation of our attitude.  On consideration of this matter, we have come to the conclusion that, in view of the Terms of Reference and the kind of Inquiry that has been called for, which is an Inquiry into the administration of a Department of State, it is not good policy to call in persons who are not members of the Dáil, inasmuch as this is a matter for which the Executive Council is directly responsible, and the Dáil is the body to whom the Executive Council is responsible. We think this course is liable to be taken as a confession that the Dáil is not competent to inquire into the affairs of State for which it has the ultimate responsibility deputed to it.  The terms of reference read out by the President last week were:</P>
      <P>To inquire into the facts and matters which have caused or led up to the indiscipline and mutinous or insubordinate conduct lately manifested in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may be true that the setting up of this Tribunal was the result of a pledge made by the President to Deputy McGrath, there was at the same time, or subsequently, a pledge made to the Dáil.  Deputy McGrath may have been the first person to whom the pledge was made, but subsequently it was stated to the Dáil and became then the property and responsibility of the Dáil.  The facts and matters which have caused or led up to, or which may have caused or led up to, or which are alleged to have caused or alleged to <Col N="2824" /> have led up to, the indiscipline and mutinous conduct were referred to publicly in the Dáil, and a charge was made of incompetence, bungling, and mismanagement.  When that charge was made in the Dáil by a member of the Dáil it became the responsibility of the Dáil to make inquiry into the truth, or otherwise, of the charge.  It is on those grounds we take the view that such an Inquiry must be made by the Dáil, and that the report must be made to the Dáil&mdash;that it should not be a mere Executive inquiry, and in any case, that it should not be an inquiry participated in by persons brought from outside who have no responsibility to the public.  Though they may be infinitely more competent than any person in the Dáil, and assuming that that be true, nevertheless we have been placed here with responsibilities and we have no right to throw those responsibilities upon persons who have not been elected.  Consequently, we take the view that this should be a Dáil Inquiry, and we are not inclined to participate in this Inquiry in which nonmembers of the Dáil are asked to take part.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson's point is one with which I have the greatest possible sympathy, and one which I raised somewhat unavailingly in a different form with the President when I discussed with him the personnel which he suggested to me he was going to put on the Committee.  I fully appreciate the point, but I was prepared, seduced by the promise to get a verbatim report of the thing down in black and white, to come and sit before any Inquiry or any Committee set up by the Executive Council.  That was my position. I was prepared to go and see what evidence could be put before a committee composed as the President has suggested. I find myself unable at the present moment to comment on my attitude.  If the President forces the matter, I find myself so anxious to get things in black and white, that I would go before a committee consisting of a representative of the Farmers and a representative of the Independent Party and any other nominees of the President of the Executive Council.  That is a decision actuated more by a certain amount of desperation <Col N="2825" /> than by any judgment on my part.  I do feel, in the circumstances, that I would be prepared to do as I have said. I am prepared to waive the point that evidence should be on oath.  I am prepared to waive the point that witnesses should be compelled to come and give evidence, in order to see the nature of the evidence in black and white, and in order to give myself and the officers concerned in this inquiry an opportunity of putting down in black and white what we desire to put down. The position now is a very difficult one. We heard on yesterday week the voice of an Executive Minister shooting across the Dáil and saying, when challenged on a point of responsibility, &ldquo;Take a vote on it.&rdquo;  We thoroughly realised the implication of that particular cry.  The implication of it was that if persons here had any touch of the rashness that the members of the Executive Council had when they swept away the heads of administration from the top of the Army&mdash; if there was anybody here as rash as, without any serious thought, to challenge the Executive Council here in the Dáil, and, say, take away the Executive Council, they could face the position of putting up another Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do feel that we are in a position now in which the Executive Council say that they cannot give the committee of a certain kind, and more particularly that they cannot extend the Terms of Reference. I heard the same voice crossing the Dáil with the same implications and saying, &ldquo;Try a vote on it.&rdquo;  Very extraordinary things have happened, and matters involving the confidence of the people and the confidence of the Dáil in the Executive Council have arisen and I would seriously ask the Executive Council to consider it, too, and to say whether, in the circumstances that have been created, that they cannot, both in the matter of extending the Terms of Reference of the inquiry, and in extending the nature of the Committee, meet the Dáil.  In the particular circumstances of the present occasion I regret that they cannot be induced to meet the wishes of the Dáil as a whole in the matter of this Inquiry.  Now I say very extraordinary things have happened.  I do not want to touch on the fact that the administrative hands have been taken away from <Col N="2826" /> the head of the Army, the hands that have held the Army administration during the past two or more years, or perhaps more.  I am satisfied that what I said of the Army was right, and that the Army will carry on.  I do not want to have my tongue wagging about things that at present are purely Army matters.  There has also happened this &mdash;three officers have been taken away&mdash; officers who had served the State during critical times, officers who occupied an extraordinary position, say, twelve or eighteen months ago, when the whole fabric of the State here was pretty well shaken.  To-day they are looking for employment.  As a matter of fact, they are looking urgently for employment. Their period of service was terminated without a day's notice on the 19th March, and at the end of March they received cheques paying them up to the 19th March, with deductions for income tax, that makes the matter of finding employment more urgent.  I am only aware of the case with regard to one officer.  His employment was terminated the 19th March, and two days ago he received a cheque paying him, to be accurate, £15 19s. 3d., and a notification that £87 15s. had been stopped for income tax.  As I say, the matter of his employment is an urgent one.  These officers go to the employment market, seeking employment, and their characters have been broadcasted to all prospective employers.  They go with the broadcasted certificate from the Minister, in whom employers have confidence the Minister for Education.  He has broadcasted the warning that so far as the prospective employers are concerned, there are as good fish in the sea as any of these three officers are likely to be. He put it that they were people who have a touch of chieftaincy about them, and that they have a certain tendency to find that they have certain proprietary rights in places where they ought not.  The person whom prospective employers regard as being a person who soon will be called the Minister for Justice has had broadcasted to them that men with the experience and judgment of the Executive Ministers had come to the decision that these men had been too long in their position, that they were men who did not keep in the Army an impersonal discipline; that they were the <Col N="2827" /> water that had passed under the mill; that they were persons who had done all the useful work they were capable of doing, and that some of them suffered from incurable unpopularity.  The Minister for External Affairs, who would take a high and wide view of things had to say of them that they had not realised his high hopes, that they had not turned out a model army, and that even ordinary members of An Dáil, with certain and well-earned reputations for commonsense and judgment, had allowed themselves to be drawn into giving them the character that to a certain extent they wanted to be a law unto themselves. They go on the employment market with characters like that, and with the knowledge that the Irregulars and the Irregular Organisation of the country look on them as members of the Army Council who Army Councilled the Irregular movement to what it is to-day, and with the knowledge that the new type of opposition that has raised itself up against the Government on important points of policy regards them as the Army Council that they asked to get rid of. These officers who have served the State as much as these officers have served it, are put in that position to-day by the Executive Council.  The confidence of the country is, to some extent at any rate, undermined in the Executive Council because of actions like that, by refusing now to give an inquiry that will give any reason, apart altogether from satisfaction, to anybody as to why these three officers were removed from their positions in the Army.  Opportunity has been taken here in the Dáil to criticise and to make charges, and to throw, I may say, into a certain political place these three officers, so that if they were shown to be very, very grievously wrong in the statements that have been made here, it could quite easily be argued by the ordinary person in the street and the ordinary person in the Dáil, that because these officers had become the subject of so much noise, so much talk, and so much suspicion, whether it was founded or not, there was good reason of public policy why they should not be returned to the Army or to the positions from which they were taken by the Executive Council.  The attitude taken up with <Col N="2828" /> regard to this inquiry is an attitude that undermines the confidence of the country in the Executive Council, and we are put in the position that we cannot get satisfaction by an inquiry without having a voice coming across the Dáil from the Executive benches with its implications, &ldquo;Try a vote on it.&rdquo;  It is a very difficult position both for me and for the ordinary Deputies of the Dáil to find ourselves in.  I question very much whether I would be justified in trying a vote, or whether a member of any Party in the Dáil would be justified in trying a vote with the Executive Council on that matter, because the Deputies are not in a happy position. It has been put by the members of the Executive Council that three of the officers who had been removed and myself are a kind of Fee-Fah-Fum Society, and that is all you know about it.  It would not be reasonable and it would not be just to the country that either I or any Deputy here would take up the challenge that was thrown out by the Executive Council and take a vote on it. It is because of that, that even with the restricted Terms of Reference that the Executive Council offers, and even that persons in the Dáil feel that they could not conscientiously be associated with an inquiry, I for my part would be prepared to go into the inquiry that the President suggests, because I am satisfied that even out of that restricted and unsatisfactory inquiry a clearing of the air will come, and that the Deputies will know, at any rate they will be clear in their minds, as to whether in justice to themselves and in justice to the country they can or could take up the challenge which the Executive Council is apparently slipping again across the Dáil for the taking of a vote.  I should like to bring this matter in some way to a definite conclusion one way or another, but I do not quite see how exactly it can be done.  I realise the very difficult position that Deputy Johnson is in, and if the Executive Council do not see their way to move further in the matter, then I think that the next move might be with Deputy Johnson to reconsider whether he would put up or would allow a representative of the Labour Party to sit on this committee <Col N="2829" /> and deal with the matter as far as that committee is able to deal with it in the present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is better to have a discussion on the matter now.  For the past week I have given it very careful consideration, and I have made many statements in the Dáil.  I am anxious that there should be in the mind of General Mulcahy a conviction that I meant to see what I stated on Friday last would be carried out, and that is that he would have justice in the matter.  It was in that sense that this particular Committee was nominated.</P>
      <P>On that Committee I had hoped to have a representative from each of the four Parties in the Dáil.  As to the Chairman of that Committee, he is a judge, one of the old Dáil judges.  As to Mr. FitzGibbon, I think there should be some satisfaction with regard to his ability, impartiality and his desire to do something which would benefit the State.  From the way in which Deputy Johnson has taken this, I would myself add anything I could to what General Mulcahy has said, so that he might reconsider his decision.  I do not know that General Mulcahy correctly interpreted the interjection of the Minister for Education when he said to Deputy Baxter, &ldquo;Take a vote on it.&rdquo;  I am prepared in this matter to leave to the judgment of the Dáil a free vote on anything in connection with it, if General Mulcahy will put down a motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I do not want to appear to be pernickety in this matter.  We have no right to ask for, or take a decision on, the Terms of Reference or the personnel of the Committee that is to be set up on the nomination of the Executive Council to report to the Executive Council.  We may approve of the action of the President in forming this Committee and composing it of certain persons.  But it is not a Dáil Committee, and the Dáil is not in a position to say whether these Terms of Reference are satisfactory, or whether the personnel of the Committee is one that it approves of.</P>
      <P>It is not a Dáil Committee; it is an Executive Council Committee.  As a consequence, the composition of the Committee or its Terms of Reference are not matters which lie within the competence of the Dáil to approve or disapprove; it is not in the competence of the Dáil to approve or disapprove as they would in the case of a Dáil Committee. If the President asks us to approve of his action in forming this Committee with these Terms of Reference, that is one thing; but it is not the same thing as asking the Dáil to approve of certain Terms of Reference and the composition of a certain Committee as it would in the case of a Dáil Committee.</P>

I do not see where the discussion is to end, or whether it will be possible to reach any decision.  I assume <Col N="2831" /> that if we are to have a discussion it will be in connection with the President's statement.  For my own guidance I desire to have the Terms of Reference so that I could use them as a guide to discussion. The discussion cannot eventuate in a decision, because we have no motion.  Unless we are going to discuss the personnel and the Terms of Reference of the Committee which the Executive Council propose to set up to report to themselves, I cannot see what we are going to discuss.</P>

I am sure it is the intention of the President and of every member of the Dáil, to do justice in this matter, but from the very restricted Terms of Reference, as I consider the terms to be, I do not see how justice could be done, and it is upon the Terms of Reference that I rise to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the President answers Deputy Gorey, I would like to support Deputy Johnson's contention, namely, that as charges were made in this House by members of this House, it should rather be a matter for the setting up of a Committee of the Dáil than the setting up of a Committee composed of persons outside this House.  Now, I am sure there is no Deputy in this House who has not got the highest regard for the personnel of the Committee enumerated by the President. But that, if I may be allowed to say so, is not the real point.  The Terms of Reference also are an important matter, but that again comes afterwards. The real question, I think, for the Dáil is whether this is a matter for a Dáil Committee or whether it is a matter for a Committee appointed by the Executive Council.  If it is a matter for a Dáil Committee to decide, then the responsibility rests upon the Dáil to appoint that Committee, and, of course, a discussion is perhaps both necessary and proper, but I do submit that if it is a matter for the setting up of a Committee by the Executive Council, and that is the nature of the Committee that has been proposed by the President, then it is not a matter for discussion in the Dáil as to the Terms of Reference in the first place or the personnel in the second place, but rather as to whether the House approves of the Executive Council's attitude in the matter, I would appeal, if I may be allowed to do so, both to the President and to Deputy Johnson in this matter.  It is of vital importance to us all.  I think the House will agree with me when I say that nothing could have exceeded the magnanimity of the tone and candour and general desire expressed by Deputy Mulcahy that in spite of the fact that he had not been met in the various ways which he had suggested, yet he was willing, and is still willing and only too anxious to throw as much light upon this unfortunate business as possible by appearing before the Committee, although neither the composition of it nor the Terms of Reference which are to govern it have been entirely approved by him.  I would <Col N="2834" /> appeal, therefore, to the President, who has stated very candidly that he is only too anxious, as I am sure he is, to leave this matter entirely to the Dáil, to consent now to leave this question&mdash;and I think it is a vital question &mdash;to the Dáil as to whether a Dáil Committee should be set up or a Committee of the nature he has proposed. If he does that he will be doing a service which will be appreciated by all parties in the Dáil and by people in the country.  If the President does not see his way to take that course, which I would very much regret, I would then appeal to Deputy Johnson. I think Deputy Johnson is actuated by the best possible motives in the interest of the Dáil in the attitude he has adopted in this matter, but with the example set to him by Deputy Mulcahy, who, after all, has got some say in the matter&mdash;he is himself personally and intimately concerned with the whole question&mdash;I say that the example set by Deputy Mulcahy, who has expressed his willingness to appear before and to accept this Committee, is an example that Deputy Johnson might follow, because it certainly is, in this instance, worth following. For the sake of unanimity in the Dáil I would appeal to him therefore, in the eventuality of the President denying the Dáil the opportunity of deciding whether it should be a Dáil Committee, to follow Deputy Mulcahy's example and agree to the setting up of this Committee and accept the Terms of Reference whatever they may be.</P>

      <P>If the Terms of Reference that have been announced by the President this evening, narrow as they appear to be, are acceptable to, or have been accepted by, Deputy McGrath on the one hand, and Deputy General Mulcahy on the other, then I doubt if Deputies would be showing wisdom by interfering from that point of view with the progress of the Inquiry. Certainly, at any rate, it will not be my intention to interfere if that is the position that we have arrived at.  What I am most concerned with is that part of the President's announcement dealing with the character and constitution of the Committee.  I would be very <Col N="2835" /> jealous of any right that I assume I possess as a direct representative of the people, especially on a grave question of this kind, to pass on my authority, or to throw my responsibility upon any outsider who has no authority from the people and who is not responsible to them in a matter of this kind.  Therefore, I would urge on the President, for many reasons, that he should leave it to the free vote of the House to say whether or not it should be a Committee of the Dáil or a Committee such as that which has been announced here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President stated that the Inquiry had been agreed to as a result of the case put up by Deputy McGrath.  Personally, I must plead my absolute ignorance of the case that was put up by Deputy McGrath, because, as far as we know, the only case that he did put up was put up at a Party meeting of which we have no knowledge whatever. But part of that case, such as it is, that is supposed to have been put up by Deputy McGrath involves, in my opinion, a charge equally as much against the Executive Council as against the State Department to which he referred.  Therefore, I challenge the wisdom of the Executive Council, the old members of the Executive Council, who are endeavouring to set up a Committee of their own nomination when they themselves are under suspicion.  I think in a case of that kind the Executive Council should be quite willing to leave it to the House to nominate the constitution of that Committee for the reasons that I have stated.  The President made a statement in reply to a number of very important questions which Deputy General Mulcahy put to him on Friday last.  One of these questions dealt with the power of this Committee to compel witnesses to come forward and give evidence on oath.  We have had experience of that on one occasion before, and we are now informed for the second time that the Government have no power in this case, as apparently they had not in the other, to compel witnesses to come forward and give evidence before a Committee, the constitution of which had the approval of the Dáil.  I say it is high time that such <Col N="2836" /> powers should be acquired, and if it is necessary that a Bill should be brought forward in order that such powers should be acquired by the Government, then I say that such a Bill is long overdue. I hope that what has occurred in this instance will influence the Government in bringing forward shortly a Bill such as I refer to, if one is necessary.</P>
    <P>We were told in the case of the Food Prices' Commission that it turned out to be a farce, simply because the Committee nominated by the Government had not the power to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of certain documents.  I suggest also that a Committee of the Dáil would have, and must have in a case of this kind, although it may be restricted to a certain extent, much more powers in regard to the conduct of an inquiry, than a committee constituted with outsiders on it would have.  I should have said earlier that I had no personal objection whatever to any of the members who have been nominated by the President, and who have been referred to as outsiders. I take no exception whatever to the individuals whose names have been given here.  I do not know, but it may be so, that the President, in nominating a number of legal men on the committee, did so simply because he wanted to have legal advice at the disposal of the committee. I suggest that if a committee of the Dáil is agreed to and set up, even though it might not include legal men, it will be presumed to have power to call in legal gentlemen, the Attorney-General or anybody else who may be required to give a decision on any legal question that may arise.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if that is a consideration that influenced the President in bringing in these two outsiders who are prominent legal gentlemen, I say that that aspect of his case falls to the ground; that is if they were brought in for that reason.  However, the charge that has been referred to by Deputy McGrath in the Dáil is a charge of muddling, mismanagement and incompetence against a certain Department of State.  This is not a Party matter, but it is a matter in which every member of the House, quite apart from Party associations or connections, has a direct responsibility to the people who sent him here.  If <Col N="2837" /> there is any charge of that kind, and I think it is agreed that when the charge is made it should be and will be investigated, then the investigations should be made by a committee that has the approval of the members of this Dáil who have a direct responsibility to the people who sent them here.  It is for that reason that I am not prepared, under any circumstances, to agree to the inclusion on a committee of this kind of men who are brought in from outside, and who have no responsibility to the people and no authority from them.  I suggest in the interests of the Executive Council, whose attitude and actions will only be clear when the committee's recommendations come before the Dáil, that in their own interests and being under suspicion as to responsibility for what has taken place&mdash;because they are collectively responsible for the administration of this particular Department of State&mdash;they should allow the free vote of the Dáil to say whether the committee shall be nominated by the Dáil or whether it shall be nominated by the President.</P>

      <P>My undertaking was not in respect of this.  This is the first time, as far as I can find out from the reports, that the claim has been made that this Committee should be a Committee of the Dáil only.  The claim was made first by Deputy Johnson, if my recollection is correct, that somebody should be on it other than members of our Party.  I think that was the case that was made. Then I went a step further than that. At least Deputy General Mulcahy mentioned the last day that he thought it was due to the various Parties that they should get a nomination on the Committee.  Now I have met that, and having met it, I do not think it is fair that the other case should be made now that it should be a Dáil enquiry. If that is the claim that is being made now, I suggest that it ought to have been made here on the 26th March when we asked for persons other than members of our own Party to act on the Committee.  Now we have allotted three more persons who are not members of our Party.  Two of them are legal men, neither of whom I ever saw at a political meeting as far as our Party is concerned.</P>

      <P>The President has indicated the lines on which he enlarges the original Committee by giving representation to the different bodies outside the Government Benches.  In doing so, I think he has met any demands that have been made in the Dáil up to to-day.  As far as I am concerned, had that Committee that he proposes come up as a proposition from the Executive Council I would have felt that the President had met everything that I asked him to do.  But the matter becomes serious when one of the parties who were most insistent that an extension from the purely Executive Committee should be granted by the President now takes up the attitude that they will not nominate anybody on the Committee because it ought to be entirely a Dáil Committee.  I have great sympathy with that line of argument, but I do think it is hardly fair that this question should be raised now for the first time.  I think it places us in a very grave difficulty.  General Mulcahy has, I think, said that individual deputies <Col N="2839" /> are in a somewhat unhappy position over this Army crisis.  We all want to do what General Mulcahy claims we should do and must do; that is, to inquire into the cause of what has taken place.  It is reasonable to say that we are the elected representatives of the people and that we are responsible, but in the Committee that is proposed it seems to me that the addition of outsiders does not necessarily weaken the Committee as a Committee of Inquiry. I do say that it would be singularly unfortunate if this Committee were to sit and the Labour Party were not represented on it.  If, therefore, it is a case of the Labour Party persisting in not being represented on the Committee, because there is somebody outside the Dáil on the Committee, then I would suggest that the matter is too important, and that the matter of the outside representation is too unimportant, that the Dáil should be severed in this matter.  Rather should we try and come to an unanimous conclusion, whereby we will all give every possible assistance to the Committee that will be set up.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Redmond's suggestion to the President is a fair one.  If he is not in a position to persuade the Labour Party to sit on this Commission with outsiders the matter is too serious, as far as the country is concerned, to go on with the Committee. I do not know whether anything I could say would influence Deputy Johnson in the attitude he has taken up, but I do say that the constitution of this Committee, if the Labour Party is not on it, will be very incomplete.</P>

      <P>I just desire, before Deputy Johnson speaks, to repeat my appeal to the President.  It is probably true that this is the first time he has heard the suggestion that this Committee should be a Committee of the Dáil.  I for one plead guilty to the fact that I did not make the suggestion previously.  However, as in other things, perhaps, better late than never. My appeal to the President was this: that if Deputy Johnson does not see his way&mdash;he and the other members of the Labour Party&mdash;to be represented upon this Committee, will he leave the <Col N="2840" /> question as to whether there should be a Dáil Committee appointed to the free vote of this House?  That is the question that I ask the President.  I know that he has gone a very long way indeed towards meeting the various requests that have been made to him about representation on the Committee, and I give him all credit for the steps that he has taken in that direction.  I confess that I am now asking him to go one step further.  But the step that I am asking him to take is of paramount importance, because, after all, if a Committee is to be set up to deal with a matter of such vital importance as this, it would, indeed, be a grave matter for the Labour Party, and those whom they represent in the country, not to be represented on that Committee.  Let the fault lie at either door, but, at any rate, let us try to arrive at a decision whereby the Committee shall be composed of as many elements in the country as possible.  I do not want to reiterate my opening statement in regard to the question of the rights of the Dáil, but I think that that argument in itself should have great weight with the President, in persuading him to come to the decision to allow the Dáil by a free vote to express themselves as to whether this should be a Dáil Committee or an Executive Council Committee.  This House should be, and is, most jealous of its rights and its privileges, and on this occasion this is undoubtedly a question for a decision by members of the Dáil on charges made in the Dáil, by a member of the Dáil, against the administration of certain Departments of Government by other members of the Dáil.  Nothing that anyone could say would make me depart from the stand I take that this is supremely a matter for the elected representatives of the people, and for nobody else.  That being so, I would urge upon the President, having regard to the attitude taken up by the Labour Party, that he should see his way&mdash;I do not think it is asking very much&mdash;to allow the Dáil to express their opinion as to whether this should be a Dáil Committee or a Committee of the Executive Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the <Col N="2841" /> President has some justification for saying that this plea that this Committee should be a Committee of the Dáil has not been put forward in these terms before.  But I want to draw attention to certain considerations. First, let me say that I am moved, and those acting with me in this matter are moved, mainly because we want to insist upon the powers of the Dáil. There are possible Committees of three chief kinds&mdash;a Departmental Committee, which is more or less a minor affair; a Committee of the Dáil, which has very considerable powers, and a specially-appointed Committee, which may have, and ought to have, given to it special powers.  The Minister read out last Thursday the Terms of Reference, and there was a discussion the following day.  On that day he was asked certain questions regarding the powers of the Committee and the Terms of Reference.  He has answered to-day that the powers of the Committee are to be limited.  The Committee is to have no power to insist upon attendance of witnesses or to take evidence upon oath.  Notwithstanding his confidence that there would be no difficulty regarding attendance of witnesses and that presumably there is no risk of witnesses who do attend saying anything but the truth and the whole truth, I am not quite confident.  If we have not a Dáil Committee, if we have not a special Committee with special powers, we have merely a Committee appointed by the Executive Council. If it is a Committee appointed by the Executive Council to inquire into matters of Departmental administration and to report to the Executive Council, then let the Executive Council do as they have done, and, as I presume, they were going to do&mdash;name the Committee. We have been asked to nominate somebody on such a Committee.  We have not seen our way to do so.  That does not prevent the Executive Council from appointing a Committee to inquire into the work of one of its Departments. We are not obstructing the appointment of this Committee. We are saying it is not the kind of Committee that is required, that it is a Committee that will not be able to make the inquiry that is necessary and which will not <Col N="2842" /> have to report to the Dáil.  If you are to have a Committee composed of persons, some of whom may be outside the Dáil, then raise that Committee to a category where it will be of a very special kind and have very special powers, and if you are appointing legal men of eminence upon that Committee, do so because of the importance of the Committee and because that Committee has exceptional powers.  In such event, the aspect will be changed completely. They will be able to compel witnesses to attend.  They will be able to take evidence upon oath and they will make the most thorough possible inquiry. But the Committee that is to be set up will depend wholly and solely upon the willingness of the various people concerned to give evidence.  That is not a satisfactory Committee for the Dáil to appoint.  If the Executive Council thinks that it is enough to appoint a Committee of its own nominees, or persons who may be suggested to them, to report upon a departmental matter and to report to them, that is their responsibility and not ours.  But, if we are asked to do this thing in the name of the Dáil, let us do it with a Dáil Committee, and that Dáil Committee may then come to the Dáil and say, &ldquo;We want more powers,&rdquo; and the Dáil will undoubtedly grant those powers. If, on the other hand, it is said by the Executive Council, &ldquo;We do not think a Dáil Committee is capable of doing this work and think that a much more important Committee even than a Dáil Committee, a Committee set up by special Act, if you like, with special powers, should be appointed,&rdquo; then let the Executive Council act accordingly, and I have no doubt we shall be quite willing to reconsider our views.  I do not think a Departmental Committee, without powers, can do the work satisfactorily, because I do not think they will get the evidence that they may believe to be necessary.  If the Dáil does not accept my view, that will not prevent a Committee proceeding on the lines desired by the President.  It becomes a minor matter; it is an Executive Council matter then, alone, and they will proceed to appoint their own Committee.  Consequently, I do not think there is any need to appeal to those of us who are sitting on those <Col N="2843" /> Benches to make any move in favour of the Committee or against the Committee. We simply say that such a Committee does not meet our view of what is required and we are not nominating anybody to act upon it.  Give it powers or let it be a Dáil Committee, and then we are quite prepared to consider the matter afresh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">

      <P>To begin, I say that it is hardly fair to the President at this stage, having taken up the attitude which has been taken up, to press now that this Committee should be confined to a Dáil Committee.  You will remember that when this Committee was first proposed it was to inquire into the difference that was then confined to the Executive Council, and the proposal was that it should inquire into the differences that had arisen within the Executive Council out of charges made by one member of the Executive Council against another member of the Executive Council, and that the proper Committee to inquire into that matter was a Committee of the Executive Council.  When that proposal was put forward it was urged, as I have said, that that Committee should not be confined to the Executive Council alone, and I think that point was made clear because the question subsequently became a very much bigger question than the form in which it appeared before us in the first instance, as a difference between two <Col N="2844" /> members of the Executive Council.  I agree with the President when he enlarged the Committee and took in outsiders to deal with the larger situation that had arisen.  But I do not agree with the President that having enlarged the Committee to meet the larger situation, he still confines the operations of that Committee to the original Terms of Reference.  As the question has developed and enlarged, I think the Terms of Reference and the personnel should have developed with the question.</P>

      <P>The question, to my mind, is not alone one that seriously affects the Dáil as it does at the moment, but it has become a great national question, and one of the biggest problems that the Dáil has had to deal with.  To my mind the Committee that should be set up to deal with such a problem as that, would be an impartial outside tribunal whose decision would carry the confidence of the country, and I would urge the President that now, since all the different parties are not prepared to cooperate in setting up a mixed Committee of the Deputies of the Dáil and outsiders, that an impartial Committee composed wholly of outsiders, should be set up, and that the Terms of Reference should be so widened as to give that committee an opportunity of dealing thoroughly with all the aspects of the question. Furthermore I think that the Committee should be endowed with powers to enable it to call for such evidence as it is necessary to call for.  That, to my mind, would be the form that that Committee should take, and I think, as I said before, that the matter is one of such importance that it calls for such a Committee.  I think that having set up such an impartial Committee, and given them wide powers of reference and full powers, we have done all that we would be called upon or expected to do in this very important matter.</P>

      <P>The matters to be determined by this Committee are of national importance.  The decision of the Committee may have far-reaching consequences.  A fortnight ago the country was very pessimistic as to the <Col N="2845" /> result of the Army differences then disclosed. Under conditions such as these, there should be no question as regards the composition of the Committee or as regards the compass of its operations. Everybody should be satisfied that the Committee should be composed of those that will satisfy every representative element in the Dáil, and that the compass of the inquiry should be one that will enable every circumstance leading up to the disturbances being thoroughly discussed, and enable the Committee to arrive at a conclusion that will make it clear to the country from what causes the present troubles arose, and what are the remedies that should be applied to prevent a repetition of them.  I regret very much that Deputy Johnson cannot see his way to be associated with the Committee as it is proposed at present. The severance of the Labour Party from that Committee would be a serious loss. I know that they would approach the questions connected with the serious position that will have to be considered by that Committee, with a freedom and criticism that would be very helpful to arrive at a just conclusion, as regards what it was that caused the disruption that we have now to deal with.  I feel, also, that the request of Deputy Davin is a reasonable one, that if the law does not enable us at present to take evidence on or to compel the attendance of witnesses, that a short Bill or such measure as may be necessary to enable evidence to be given on oath and to compel the testimony of witnesses, is absolutely necessary to enable the Committee to come to a definite and satisfactory conclusion as to the causes that were originally responsible for all this trouble. Personally I feel that the inclusion of two outside gentlemen would be rather helpful than otherwise.  They are men whose legal knowledge would undoubtedly be of great service to the Committee in coming to a satisfactory conclusion in this matter.  The Terms of Reference, too, should enable a full and exhaustive inquiry into all the causes to satisfy the demand&mdash;what I would consider a reasonable demand&mdash;made by General Mulcahy last week.  He has given us an admirable instance this evening of the sinking of self, and whilst he states he is not satisfied with the compass of the inquiry, <Col N="2846" /> he is prepared under these unsatisfactory conditions&mdash;conditions that undoubtedly would be a disadvantage to himself personally&mdash;to contribute all he can to enable a definite and correct solution to be arrived at, as regards the troubles resulting from the Army differences. I would add my appeal to the appeals of the other Deputies in the Dáil to Deputy Johnson to ask if he and his party could not reconsider their decision.  After all, the inclusion of these two legal gentlemen, to my mind, would be helpful.  It is a case in which we should not differ over what, after all, is a trifle.  The dignity of the Dáil will not suffer anything by the inclusion of these two gentlemen.  They will, as I have said, be helpful as regards the reception of evidence, and I consider their inclusion of much more consequence than the compass of the inquiry, for if one is to measure the compass of the inquiry on the basis of the inquiry into broadcasting you can discuss everything, because there they discussed everything from the establishment of a Casino to the rebuilding of Cork.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not in to hear the names of the proposed Committee.  I have had a list handed to me, and I expect that is correct.  Personally, I do not see any reason why two legal gentlemen from outside the Dáil should be brought into this inquiry.  I will just take you back to the day when I promised to make a statement on the succeeding day to the Dáil, and to my acceptance of a statement by the President on that succeeding day that a Committee would be set up to inquire into charges I had made, or was prepared to make. I was at all times ready to give here in the Dáil any information I had.  I was asked not to, and I agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do believe that, in view of the fact that publication of what will be brought up at this inquiry may not be wise, the best thing to do is to have each Party represented in the Dáil represented on this Committee of Inquiry.  That will place individual members of the Dáil in the position of seeing that at least there is nothing kept from the Dáil.  If and when the question of publication arises, the <Col N="2847" /> Dáil will be the best judges as to whether the public should get the full details of what went on at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>I think I mentioned to the President last week that as far as one legal representative was concerned, it might be necessary to have him, as there might be a necessity to keep things in order.  What is required in this is not the legal mind, but the commonsense mind.  Legal people do not control all the commonsense of the country, and if there is any necessity for a legal man, it is merely to keep matters in order.  I believe that if there is any obstacle in the way, it is the very composition of the Committee. The classes represented by some of those nominated will be a barrier to me in taking part in this inquiry. It will not be a barrier as far as I am concerned, but it will be a barrier to the people that I may be speaking for. It may prevent their participation in the inquiry and affect some of the things they would have to say when they are there.</P>
    <P>Things have changed a great deal since I agreed to attend this inquiry. When one hears people speaking of powers to make witnesses attend, I think those people are very wide of the mark in introducing anything at this moment to compel people to attend&mdash;particularly at this inquiry.  My position at the moment is this: You will remember that last week I mentioned I was keeping an open mind. The principal witnesses that I have to depend on at this very moment say, and say very definitely, that they will attend no inquiry and give no evidence.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that I will be able to get over that difficulty.  If I do not my position will be perfectly clear.  It will be then quite plain that I cannot, and will not, have anything to do with the inquiry.  It may be said that that is a very extraordinary attitude to take up.  If you remember the events that have taken place since I agreed to attend the inquiry, and if you consider them you will see that after all there is some reason behind this action and some reason why they will not attend <Col N="2848" /> as witnesses.  They have been treated, as I alleged before, and as I allege now, in a scandalous fashion, just as I have been treated myself.  There have been broken agreements.</P>
    <P>I appealed to them to wipe this out, as it were, and they have agreed to do so.  They are out now, and their attitude is that they are finished, and let the Dáil or the Government or anybody who likes clear up the mess; they will not lend a hand.  That is their attitude. It may be right, and it may be wrong, but there is a good deal on their side. If I can get them to agree and get over that difficulty, I will attend the inquiry.  I do not want to say definitely that I will not attend the inquiry.  I am of opinion there is no necessity for bringing two legal gentlemen from outside to form part of this inquiry.  As a matter of fact, there is one legal gentleman already named, Deputy McGilligan, who would be quite competent to keep things in order, and he is a member of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>As regards the representative from the Independents, and particularly the one mentioned, I have no objection; he is a bit of a mutineer himself.  Those, together with a representative from Labour, and a representative from this Party, would be quite sufficient to inquire into everything that will have to be inquired into.  People need only have a little common horse-sense in order to arrive at a proper decision.  I think it would be a calamity, and I would regret it very much, if Labour is not represented on the Committee.  If the President is not definitely committed to it, I think he might reconsider that point regarding confining the Committee absolutely to members of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It is a very full-time position.  There are several points raised in connection with this matter which, as I have said already this evening, are now raised for the first time. We knew perfectly well, when I undertook to set up this inquiry first, that there was no legal power to compel the attendance of witnesses, and there was no legal authority for administering <Col N="2849" /> oaths to persons giving evidence.  We knew that.  If there were that power in our hands I am positively certain the inquiry would not be in the nature of an inquisition.  We could not, as it were, take a man off the street by the back of the neck and say to him: &ldquo;We want to examine you on what you know about the Army and its administration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do say, without intending any disrespect whatever to a Committee of the Dáil, that this question is not a question which would admit of absorbing something like four months of our time and resulting in 600 pages of a verbatim report.  It is reasonable to assume that if this Committee means business its inquiry should be over inside a fortnight.</P>
      <P>I think the plea made by Genaral Mulcahy on behalf of certain officers who have now to earn their living is one that should be considered.  His plea was that it is a matter of urgent necessity with them that this subject should be dealt with, and it is possible to deal with it within a reasonably short space of time.  I have some experience of inquiries, and in a few spare moments I have read over some of the evidence submitted to the Broadcasting Committee.  My experience is that I think much of the material that was under discussion there would not have been allowed as evidence.  We are not in any worse position now in regard to having authority to administer, than we have been since we started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application was made to us first, or the representation was made to us, for the inclusion of somebody other than what was called the Party or the Cabinet in the Inquiry, and we consider we were more than meeting that by extending it in the form in which it is proposed now.  I do think that while Deputy Johnson may be perfectly within his right, and his Party may be within their right, nevertheless, either when this Committee is sitting or afterwards, he will come to the conclusion that it would be a mistake to stand out from it and not to take part in it. His is the only Party in the House not doing so, and he has been at all times anxious that the authority of the Dáil should be supreme, and should be admitted as such.  Very well, if you take <Col N="2850" /> up that attitude and if you admit, also, that every Party in the House is a part of it, you cannot stand out and say then: &ldquo;I resign my responsibility.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have already explained; we cannot afford four months for an Inquiry of this sort, and it is unreasonable to expect that a Committee of Inquiry on this matter, before it can make up its mind, should have six hundred pages of printed evidence.

We were invited to bring before the Dáil everything; to tell the Dáil everything, and we have taken this opportunity of doing so, and now we are told you cannot do it that way, you must do it another way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No. But every member of the Committee will have all the information that transpires at that Inquiry, which is the next equivalent to bringing it before the Dáil.  I submit it is not fair to ask me to leave this to a free vote of the Dáil.  What is meant by a free vote is that the Party Whips will be withdrawn.  Does it mean that if the Party Whips are withdrawn and the vote is against me I will not resign?  These are matters which ought to be explained.  I am prepared in this matter where there is danger of injustice and of unfairness&mdash;where any person affected by this is likely to feel there is any injustice to be done to him &mdash;I am prepared to leave that to the free vote of the Dáil&mdash;free to that extent, either to bring about the resignation of the Executive Council or not to bring it about&mdash;either the one or the other.  If it be asked that it should be a free vote without any resignation of the Executive Council I agree, and if it be asked the other way whether it should bring it about I agree also.  Would Deputy Johnson object if I nominated him from his Party to act upon this Committee of Inquiry?  If he agreed I would include his name as one of the members, so that his Party would be absolved from any responsibility in taking the initiative in regard to the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath asked me why bring in two legal men.  I think I have explained that.  This is a matter that requires attention immediately.  I do not know to what extent it may be possible for either, or both, of these two gentlemen who have kindly consented to act upon this Committee, to sit day after day if required; I do say, having regard to the appeal of General Mulcahy this evening, that this is a matter that ought to be dealt with urgently and at once, therefore, there should be no delay, but a real attempt to try and find out this cause, and see if it is possible to remedy that, and if the Committee thinks fit, to apportion the blame.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to oppose this Bill to the end, and I am going to ask the House to refuse to give a final reading to this Bill to penalise old age.  I do not think that Deputies individually, whatever the Dáil collectively may have done, appreciate what is being done by this Bill that they are enacting, and what they are giving their assent and consent to.  It has generally gone abroad, and Deputies seem to be satisfied, that the effect will be to cut off one shilling a week from those receiving 10/- a week. People have been persuaded by the arguments of the Minister for Finance that they are as well off to-day or that they will be as well off on 9/- a week as they were two years ago on <Col N="2854" /> 10/- a week, and that sacrifices have to be made after the country has gone through rough times, and many evil things have been done and much great damage has been done, and that the country is in a financial mess and that old age pensioners have to bear a share of it.  That is the argument that has appealed to members of the House. I want Deputies to consider the matter a little more closely again and to realise that it is not only one shilling a week that is taken from pensioners receiving 10s., that is not the only punishment awarded under this Bill. I pointed out several times that the effect of it is to deprive pensioners who are also in receipt of other income which brings their total income, pension and other, to £1 to reduce that total income to 16/-.  That is to say, we are reducing the standard of living of people over 70 years of age by 20 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only that, but the intention is under this Bill to revalue the income from whatever source outside his or her pension.  If this income was from any little property that may have been in his or her possession bringing in a small income to supplement the pension that is to be revalued, and a good portion of the value as previously allowed is to be deducted.  We are asked to agree&mdash;and I would like if Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good and others had been present to hear again what I said before&mdash;we are asked to agree that in the case of the aged poor, and only in the case of the aged poor, capital property held by them producing interest is to be deemed to be exhausted in 10 years time.  Now, that is a principle that has not yet been affected in the case of any other section of the community so far as I know, and while I think it is ethically sound to say that certain property in bricks and mortar or materials of any kind does exhaust itself and is therefore not entitled to perpetual drain from the community, I am not prepared to say that that principle should be adopted in the case of old <Col N="2855" /> age pensioners until it is adopted in the case of property owners generally.</P>
      <P>But there is running alongside this new proposal of the Minister, and implicit in it a review of all the existing pensions, a re-examination of the present pensions and a re-valuing of all the present living, and what has happened is this; that acting on the instructions of the Pensions Authority, presumably the Local Government authority, and the Local Government Minister, as I suspect, but acting at the instigation of the Minister for Finance, pensions officers are to-day going through the country making inquiry into the kind of livelihood that old men or old women are being allowed by their friends and re-valuing them with a view to cutting down the existing pensions.  Now, I am not making any complaint that there should be an examination and re-examination, if necessary, of pensions. I am making a complaint that the kind of instruction, or, shall I say, the action that is being taken presumably upon instruction is to so re-value the perquisites as they are called, as to involve a deprivation of a great portion of the present pensions even before the cut that is involved in the Bill takes place at all.  That is being done with regard to pensioners generally. I ask the members of the Dáil here to realise the effect of that upon a very helpless section of the community whose case I have tried to plead, namely, the blind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are learning that there is a special inquisition going on into the cases of blind persons who are receiving pensions, and apparently, in accord with the intentions of the Bill pensions officers have decided to object to the retention of pensions in cases where any blind recipient cannot be said to be stone blind.  It was never intended that stone blindness should be absolutely essential to receiving the pension.  What is laid down is such blindness as would prevent such a person earning a living; that is clearly the intention.  But what is being acted upon now is an interpretation which says unless a person is absolutely stone blind he is to <Col N="2856" /> be deprived of his pension.  That is cruel, and it is going to be detrimental to the good name of the country and to the Government of the country.  I have, for instance, a case which appropriately I received yesterday.  It is authenticated by a local schoolmaster. It is a case of two blind persons. In one instance the man is paralysed for the last ten years; he is speechless for the last four years; he had a cataract on his eyes about ten years ago, and was suffering such terrible pain in consequence that he injured himself jumping out of bed, and became paralysed.  He has been paralysed since.  He is in such a state now that his wife cannot understand anything he says, as he is suffering from paralysis of the tongue.  He has to be spoon-fed like a baby.  This cataract dissolves at certain periods of the year.  During the winter his sight slightly returns.  Now he is told by the medical inspector that he is deprived of his pension, and the local shopkeepers have deprived him of credit.</P>
    <P>The other case is also a very sad one.  It is the case of a man who all his life has been known as &ldquo;Blind Sheehy.&rdquo;  He had a cataract on his eyes all his life until about six years ago.  He then lost one of his eyes altogether.  The cataract remained chronic on the other eye.  He is practically blind because of the growth of the cataract on the second eye, and he is now in the position of a person who cannot earn a living on account of the loss of his sight.  That, again, is a case where, for some reason or other that I cannot understand, the local pensions officer has reported that the pension must be taken from him.  That is an illustration&mdash;one of many that one hears of&mdash;of the way that the Ministry is now proceeding to economise at the expense of the poor, the aged and the blind.  Then there is the case of men who have, by thrifty habits and care in their youth and manhood, made some attempt to supplement whatever may come to them in their old age.  They have paid in for superannuation to trades unions, friendly societies, and the like.  If that superannuation amounts to 10s. a week, then because of the fact that the contributor was <Col N="2857" /> thrifty he has to lose 3s. per week.  His total income henceforward is to be 16s. I say that that is a deprivation which we ought not to sanction; it is penalising thrift and is running entirely against the current of social justice. Nothing that has been said in defence of this Bill satisfies me that we ought to take our revenge upon the aged and the poor.  We ought not to oblige the aged and the poor to pay for the faults and the waste and, if you like, the criminality of the youth during the last few years.  The effect of this Measure is to impose upon the aged that responsibility, and also the effect of it will be to sever family relationships. The effect of it will be to oblige in many cases the old man or the old woman to be discharged from the care of the son or the daughter.  Although it may seem inhuman and unfilial, it has been done, and it will be done in many cases.  The aged will be discharged from the house of the son or the daughter and obliged to seek the protection of the Poor Law to get the pension, and then, perhaps, they will go back to the house.  You are not doing justice in this Bill.  Worse than that, you are doing positive injustice; you are acting unreasonably and, in some cases, almost inhumanly.  We have talked of contracts, but there is, and has been, an implied contract; there has been an understanding, at any rate, with the aged that we were not going to let them down, a phrase that has become very common recently. We are asked in this Bill to let down the aged poor, and I am going to ask the Dáil to refuse to agree to the passing of this Bill to let down the aged poor and the blind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr BLYTHE Mr BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has said that in this Bill we are going against the current of social justice.  We are driven to do things that we would not wish to do, but we are interfering with the aged poor as little as we can interfere with them.  We are doing it in such a way as to inflict no injustice, and in such a way as not to inflict hardship on them, as compared with their state a year or two years ago.  It cannot be denied that there is greater purchasing power in money at the present time than there was, say, two years <Col N="2858" /> ago or three years ago.  It is, I think, also undeniable that the reduction of a shilling in the maximum pension does not leave the pensioner any worse off than that pensioner was a couple of years ago, when the value of money was less than it is at the present time.  To that extent at any rate we are not going against the course of social justice; we are not injuring the position of these old people.  Perhaps we are not able to go forward, but if we are not able to go forward in this matter of making the lot of those who are old and worn more comfortable, it is due to circumstances which everybody knows about.  In regard to the review of pensions, anything that is taken off the pensioners is not taken off those who are poorest or those who are most needy.  It is taken off the pensioners who have other means of a character which, having regard to the means of the majority of old age pensioners, are somewhat substantial.  The overwhelming majority of the old age pensioners will not, by this Bill, suffer anything except the one-shilling cut.  Deputy Johnson has gone over many matters that were discussed on the previous Stages of the Bill.  I replied to these points from time to time, and I do not want to go over them again.  He has quoted cases that seem very pitiable.  I would just say that a law, especially a law which throws charges on the Central Fund, has to be administered with some degree of strictness.  It is often more necessary that such a measure should be administered with strictness than a law which throws a burden on the local rates.  The people affected by excess or improper charges where local rates are concerned will have a greater opportunity of seeing them and will more readily intervene.  Where the charges are thrown on the Central Fund, a great deal that is wrong may happen in a particular district and may not be brought to notice at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Blind Pensions, we certainly found that there was a very considerable degree of laxity, that very large numbers of persons were receiving the Blind Pension who, by no stretch of the imagination, could be regarded as entitled to receive it, because their sight was, in some cases, perhaps as good as the sight of most <Col N="2859" /> members of this assembly.  It is necessary that the Act should be enforced with some degree of strictness.  It is necessary that the Blind Pension should be given because of blindness.  One can hardly ask, in administering such an Act, that other circumstances of the person should be taken into account if the degree of blindness required by the Act does not exist.  I do not want to stand over what was done in a particular case without having an opportunity of examining the facts.  I would simply say that most of the pitiful circumstances related by Deputy Johnson are, as it were, irrelevant.  The real question that the Inspector had to decide was: Was there blindness as required by the Act?  I do not think we <Col N="2860" /> should have any undue rigidity in the matter.  I think we should only have that degree of strictness which is necessary to prevent the growth of great abuses.  In putting forward this Bill, we have in mind that it might be possible to effect, as it were, economies on this particular service by very great strictness in administration, by forcing, as it were, every point against the old age pensioner or against the applicant. Our view is that while the law shall be administered in the fairest way, that we shall not force it against the pensioner, that it is better where you have to effect economies, to effect them by changing the scales or basis rather than by too much forcing of the pace from the point of view of administrative strictness.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Dáil to accept the final report submitted in this volume by the Committee which was set up to consider the question of broadcasting.  I think the discussion that is going to ensue on this matter will centre mainly around the question of whether broadcasting should or should not be a State service. Our Committee considered that question in all its aspects, and their firm opinion was that it would be in the best interests of the State to have broadcasting under Government control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, news which would be of interest to farmers.  There would be more likelihood of that reaching the farmers in proper time if broadcasting were under State control and not in the hands of a private company. That would also be true as regards amusements.  If these amusements were under a director who could be removed at any time by the Postmaster-General the amusement would be likely to be more national in tone and in sentiment.  Private companies, no matter how good their professions might be, would after a short time look more to a question of dividends than to what <Col N="2862" /> would be in the best interests of the State.  Mention was made by the President early this evening of the size of this volume, the time spent on it by the Committee, and also the cost to the State.  I think that the independence of this Dáil and its members is well worth the time and the expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is a hopeful sign of the times to see a Committee representative of all Parties in the Dáil quite ready to probe every question as regards any matter of undue influence to the bottom and have the matter made public.  I will not refer further to this now, but I think that honesty and purity in Irish public life are well worth a good deal of expenditure and time.  I beg to propose the adoption of the Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I am not in full agreement with the findings of this Committee.  Since their voluminous report was issued, I have given it as much time as I could spare, and I have definitely arrived at the conclusion that it is not advisable the State should take over control of a wireless system in this country.  I am largely in agreement with the Postmaster-General when he says it is not advisable that the State should be placed in a position of trying to control entertainments.  I do not agree with the statement in the report of the Committee that it has been the function of States in the past to supply the public with entertainments and amusements. In connection with that, the Committee instanced such things as picture galleries, but I do not think these can be classed as amusements, because they partake more of an educational character.  I am not aware that the supplying of amusements to the public has ever been successfully carried on as a State-controlled business. It is acknowledged by the Committee that, at least in the early <Col N="2863" /> stages, wireless control by the State is almost inevitably bound to result in expense to the State, and that the expense will be much greater than is anticipated at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to deal in detail with this Report, but I think entertainments should be outside of State control, because I do not believe that entertainments controlled by the State would be accepted by the people as meeting their requirements. The providing of amusements is a specialised art.  It is a business that men have devoted their lives to, and one at which men have become experts.  I do not believe that the Postmaster-General or the Post Office officials, even though working through Boards of Directors or Advisers, would be in a position to deal with these matters.  I am anxious to see broadcasting taken up in this country, not necessarily by the State, but perhaps partially as a State undertaking.  I believe that wonderful advantages can be gained by our agricultural community if a wireless system is properly utilised.  Through it market prices and other matters of a kindred nature can be broadcasted, but even in that regard its uses are, I think, sometimes exaggerated.  It is a bit ridiculous, I think, to talk about giving lectures on bee-keeping and on agricultural subjects through wireless.  I think the greatest advantage from an installation of wireless will be felt by the people in rural communities.  One of the greatest curses in rural life is the useless way in which people spend their spare time.  They really do nothing, and from the ethical point of view that, of course, is very bad.  It would be a great thing if they could have the advantage of the entertainments placed at their disposal by wireless. I believe it is along that line of development that wireless broadcasting will be found to be the best paying proposition, but I am dubious of its success as a State-controlled business. Some of the services connected with the Post Office have not been such a great success.  We think that the telephone service could be made of greater advantage to the country than it is at the present time, and we think <Col N="2864" /> that the same applies to the telegraph service.  I am inclined to think that if the Dáil were to agree in full with the findings of the Committee that such a course would not be in the interests of the community in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was to the effect that I did not think at this stage in our national life we would find a representative of the farmers from the Co. Tipperary suggesting that the broadcasting of different matters in Ireland, such as entertainments, etc., should not be controlled by the Irish nation.  I am mainly interested in this matter from one angle, that of the Irish language, Irish literature, Irish culture and Irish music.  I think you can find a very good reason for putting under the control of some national body, such as a State Department, the entire control of everything that appertains to the revival of Irish culture, and everything that is proper and distinctive in the life of the nation.  First of all, it can be used as a medium for cultivating and popularising the study of the Irish language.  It is being used for the cultivation of the French language in England, in giving people an opportunity of learning that language for commercial purposes.  Now, if we are really in earnest, and I am sure we are, in the growth and cultivation of the Irish language, I think we ought to give a State institution some power or control in order that the study of that language may be popularised.  The same thing applies to Irish music.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2865" /> What we have got to ask ourselves is, whether any private body is going to take the same interest in the revival of the Irish language and of Irish music as the State would take?  Let us just take one instance, and look at what is being done by private institutions in regard to the Irish drama.  What do we get in the different theatres throughout the country?  Do we get anything that is pertinent to the life of the nation or anything that is likely to be uplifting or to help the cultivation of Irish distinctiveness? We do not.  If we let control of this popular and extensive means of cultivating our national distinctiveness pass from our hands into private institutions, we will find that these private institutions will be more interested in producing dividends than in doing any good for the life of the nation.  It is from that angle that I am attempting to approach this subject: the help it is calculated to give to the cultivation of the Irish language, Irish music, Irish literature and Irish culture in general.  It is a matter that deserves serious consideration. For that reason, if for no other, the control of broadcasting installations in this country should, in my opinion, be entirely under State control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMacBride" hpid="Mr. McBRIDE Mr. McBRIDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>I object considerably to the control of broadcasting by the State.  Broadcasting is really a commercial occupation, and no State ever yet, as far as I know, made a success of commercial undertakings.  It has been objected to this control by individual companies that they are out to make dividends. That is the right and proper thing, that they should be out to make dividends.  It is not to lose money that broadcasting should be instituted.  If these companies are out to make dividends they will just give me what I want and nothing else.  I believe that the Postmaster-General will not give me, as the user of a broadcasting instrument, what I require, but, rather, what he thinks I should require.  I may be very heretical sometimes.  I like to hear something heretical, and I really object to the Postmaster-General setting himself up as an inquisitor of my estimate of the proper standard of tastes and morals. That is a ridiculous thing to put into a Report.  The State has for a long time subsidised, the Report states, national <Col N="2866" /> libraries, national galleries, paintings, national museums, etc.  I do not object to their subsidising broadcasting; let them cancel my licence, and let me get my broadcasting free, but I do object considerably to this Government or any other Government controlling commercial undertakings, as this should be, because it is to supply the needs of the individual just as the individual requires them, and not as an inquisitor or court of inquisitors should decide or might decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I have had much time in this last week or two to give very much consideration to this Report, and I would like to deprecate the adoption of the Report, that is if the adoption means that we are to proceed to set up a wireless broadcasting station and to run it directly by means of a State service, until consideration from the financial angle has been given to it.  It seems to me, looking at the thing casually, that the Committee interpreted their Terms of Reference somewhat liberally.  The Terms of Reference state:&mdash;&ldquo;That a Committee of this Dáil be appointed to consider the Circular addressed to Deputies entitled `Wireless Broadcasting' especially in regard to the proposal by which it is intended that the State should pass over the right to license and tax incoming wireless apparatus to a Clearing House under the control of a private Company,&rdquo; and it was ordered that the Committee should report back to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that that was chiefly an instruction to the Committee to consider the particular proposal that was put forward here, either to condemn it or to set forth their criticisms of it or to approve of it.  As it is, there seems to be a certain detailed recommendation of actual course of action, not that set out in the White Paper to which the Committee's attention was directed. We have very heavy calls on the Exchequer. We have an unbalanced Budget, and we are carrying out the most drastic economies in order to effect a balance of the Budget.  It seems to me that before the Dáil adopts the proposal which would commit the State to a new service and to an expenditure, perhaps very considerable, on that new service, that there should be <Col N="2867" /> the usual opportunity of financial examination and financial criticism.</P>
    <P>It is a recognised rule in the Cabinet that when a Minister has a proposal to put forward involving finance that he does not bring that proposal down to the Executive Council and point out the wonderful merits of the work that he intends to do, but that he should first submit it to finance with a view to getting criticism of the whole proposal from the finance point of view.  He brings it down then with that financial criticism on it, and the matter is considered along with the financial objections that can be urged, either the ordinary objections of economy or objections pointing out that perhaps the same object could be achieved in a cheaper way.  It strikes me that the adoption of this Report is going absolutely to commit the State to the setting up of a State operating wireless broadcasting station, and that we are rather rushing the matter.  If it is only a recommendation, or an expression of opinion on the evidence submitted, and, so far as the examination has gone, an expression of opinion that that is what should be done, then of course it is a matter that could be decided right away; but if we are to take something in the way of a final decision here I would urge that the matter has not received the consideration that a matter involving expenditure should have.  It is an extremely difficult thing to know what the ultimate expense would be. There is no doubt that if good programmes are not given, and good programmes mean expense, there would be a falling off in interest in broadcasting, a falling off of licence duties.  The matter is one that from the purely finance point of view is deserving of very careful consideration, and it ought not be undertaken, as it were, hurriedly.  I think, moreover, that whatever the Dáil adopts here it ought to take care to adopt a thing that would not prevent the fullest financial control and criticism of the enterprise henceforth. I think it would be undesirable that any enterprise should be given a sort of special blessing that would in any way free it or exempt it from criticism, either root and branch criticism which might say that very poor results were <Col N="2868" /> being got, and that the service should be discontinued altogether, or criticism which would say that this was being done in an entirely wrong way, and should be altered.  I do not know what is desired in the motion, but certainly unless we are to postpone it and take further time to consider it, I think the Dáil ought not to adopt a motion which means taking a final decision on a matter which ought to be in the nature of a recommendation in view of the facts so far submitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the Minister should have spoken when he was not prepared to give his views one way or the other.  It is quite certain that the matter cannot be left as it is, that either side must handle this question, and that something after the method of the White Paper must be adopted.  Either the State or a private company has to handle it, and I take it we have all a voice in the matter.  No Whips appear to be anywhere; divided voices are everywhere. Opinion will be also divided on our Benches.  To my mind, we are just at the threshold of a great development. This matter is only in its infancy.  I think we ought to step in now and take our place.  Wireless in the future is going to find its way into all the rural homes and villages of the country.  Hitherto, our big towns and populous districts have had amusement; they have had almost everything they could wish for, while our rural areas have been neglected.  The only amusements the people in villages find are standing up against walls, playing pitch-and-toss, playing cards, or visiting public houses.  Wireless will afford an opportunity to these <Col N="2869" /> people to get away from some of the vicious amusements or some of the undesirable amusements to which they have resorted in the past.  It might even supply another service to the Post Office to replace the telegraph service in rural areas, which, at the moment, is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time creameries, private individuals, and a good many others living outside the mile area, have to pay from a shilling to three-and-sixpence for telegrams.  Wireless may remedy that disgrace.  It may go a long way to replace the very inadequate and very expensive method of communication we have at the moment&mdash;expensive for those individuals who live outside the charmed circle.  It will also bring to the whole community a channel of amusement they have never had before, and those who have had it before will have a cheaper amusement.  The amount of money that has been spent in this country and in other countries on amusements will be greatly reduced through wireless installation and by the establishment of a proper wireless service.  I think it would be well for the State to spend a good deal of money in order that the people could have cheaper amusement, and amusement of a better and healthier description. Control, if the matter is handed to a company, will not lie with the people's representatives, no matter what restrictions you put on.  If you have a State concern control will lie directly with the people's representatives. The people's representatives in the Dáil will be able to effect remedies, if remedies are required, at very short notice.  It is essential that control should be exercised.  There is a class of house and a class of people in the country that should be prevented from having wireless sets.  The installation of sets in public houses in the rural districts should not be allowed. That may be a wild doctrine, but I do not think it is right that houses licensed for the sale of drink should be allowed to instal sets and thereby draw custom that otherwise would never go to these houses.  It would not make for good citizenship and it would not make for a sober country.  Private companies will cater <Col N="2870" /> for the populous districts; they will give programmes to suit the populous districts, and these programmes may be such that they will not be good for our national life.  In every sense I think it is essential that the State should control broadcasting.  It is not necessary that the Postmaster-General should be the custodian of our morals.  Any intelligent community ought to be able to organise control, ought to be able to organise a system that will deal with this matter as it should be dealt with.  If they are not able to do that they certainly are not able to take on the Government of a country.  Personally, I am convinced, even if we were to lose a good bit of money, even £15,000 or £20,000, that if the rural population would get a better service and if the national life would be better cared for, State control is preferable to control by any private company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the report of this Committee, I do not think their recommendations are very definite.  They give a sort of qualified approval to the question of the State fathering this scheme of broadcasting. I think everyone of us will recognise that this science of broadcasting is very much in its infancy.  What will be the development within the next six, twelve or eighteen months, none of us, I think, can foresee.  But I think we can all recognise that the opportunities that disclose themselves in connection with the army of people who are at present trying to plumb the depths of this new science are bound before very long to have effect.  As we stand to-day, I think the Minister for Finance would be very disinclined to give his consent to any expenditure that was unnecessary.  As far as I can see, a broad programme of broadcasting on national or other lines would not be very well handled by any Government Department.  Government Departments, we know, are not particularly prone to exhibiting a large amount of initiative.  The centring of this in any Government Department would not be for the benefit or the progress of what we might call the industry. Neither do I think would it tend towards the entertainment, even <Col N="2871" /> of the villages about the country, that the Postmaster-General should be the person to initiate a programme of amusement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hardly describe the Postmaster-General in any circumstances as a showman, but in this particular case what Deputy Gorey wants is that a programme of amusements should be distributed all over the country.  I am afraid that even that would require a great deal of consideration, for a village in one part of the country might be entirely dissatisfied with the programme that another village would think was very nice.  At all events, in this country we have got used to very great and diverse differences of opinion, and I think in connection with broadcasting we will probably have a good deal of differences of opinion.</P>
      <P>If a lecture in Irish came through to me, it would not be very much help to me, nor do I think it would be very much help to the majority of people down the country.  Although it is very desirable we should all be able to follow a play in Irish, I am afraid at the present time not many of us are able to do it.  As a principle, I think the State ought not to undertake this work.  On the other hand, there is a public to-day requiring that broadcasting should be developed, and the unfortunate state of affairs which has arisen in connection with this question is certainly tending to stop the development we might otherwise have. But looking round the country to-day, is there any urgency in the matter?  Is it not a fact that a considerable number of instruments have gone all over the country, and that to-day people are enjoying the benefit of programmes all over the country?  If the question were confined to an experimental station, I think the claim might reasonably be made that the Government should father a small experimental station so as to keep abreast with the whole question.  A small expenditure in that direction, I think, would be all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but my idea is merely a temporary arrangement to get over the impasse we have arrived at, and to get into smooth waters, so that the whole, big question of broadcasting can be developed on commercial lines.  The proposition of the Postmaster-General that those different companies should come together for the purpose of forming a broadcasting company has certain weaknesses, but in my judgment, it is the soundest proposition that has come before us in connection with this matter.  That is as regards broadcasting, pure and simple. If you come to deal with the distribution of propaganda, I think you will find it very hard to get a broadcasting company to pay a great deal of attention to what you call propaganda, which, generally speaking, would not bring in any great amount of money. The main recommendation is that as a permanency the State should take control of broadcasting.  As far as I am concerned, I would oppose that, because it would simply mean the expenditure of a very considerable amount of money, and would not give an effective service.  Looking at the industry as being in an experimental stage, with the people able to get programmes on their own valve sets as they are to-day, I think that development will come, and that in a comparatively short time we will be in a better position to deal with the subject as a whole on the lines of a broadcasting company being started.</P>

      <P>As a matter of enlightenment, may I intervene to ask your ruling, A Chinn Comhairle, upon the effect of this motion? I understand the question before the Dáil is the adoption of the Report. <Col N="2873" /> There are several matters in the Report. There is no question whatever about Government control, because I think this is one of the matters affected by Article 11 of the Constitution, and that there must be supreme Government control over the service. But when one comes to the further question of recommendation of Government expenditure on the machinery for exercising that control, whether it is done through a Government establishment or installation, at Government expense, or whether it is done by a grant by the Government of a licence to companies, how far are we committed, by adopting the Report, to a decision that money shall be expended from the public funds?  Will such a decision be in order, or will it be subject to that expenditure being subsequently recommended under Article 37 of the Constitution?  I think there is need of a little definition to assist us in arriving at a decision as to what way we shall speak or vote.</P>

      <P>I take it the adoption of the Report by the Dáil would mean that the Report generally meets with the approval of a majority of Deputies.  The adoption of the Report could not possibly mean that public money would have to be expended forthwith, because money could not be expended except under the conditions of Article 37 of the Constitution.  We would require a Message and a Resolution proposed by an Executive Minister.  We have had, on occasion, motions proposed in the Dáil, recommending that the Executive Council should make certain expenditure.  These were merely recommendations to the Executive Council and need not necessarily be followed by the Executive Council.  They would not necessarily mean that the money would have to be provided.  I think exactly the same position obtains here.  If the Report were adopted, the Executive Council would be in the position of having an expression of opinion upon a number of matters.  It would not necessarily have to provide the money.</P>

      <P>When, a week ago, I appealed <Col N="2874" /> to the Dáil to give a little more time to the consideration of this Report before presenting it for acceptance or rejection, I assumed that the Committee in the interval would have taken the necessary steps to ascertain whether the Minister for Finance was prepared to back this primary recommendation of theirs if it were adopted by the Dáil.  It surprises me very much to-day to learn that, though the recommendation has been presented to the Dáil, the very obvious step of finding out from the Finance Department whether, in its view, the scheme was financially acceptable or not, was overlooked by the Committee.</P>
      <P>Now, members will remember that in the case of the scheme put forward by me in November last that preliminary had been attended to.  I think we are more or less wasting time here in discussing the scheme in the absence of some assurance that the Finance Ministry intends to back it, should it pass the Dáil, because if we merely pass this pious resolution, we might find ourselves later on face to face with an adverse decision on the part of the Finance Ministry, and we might be thrown back on some other scheme, and, in consequence, we might have to cover the whole ground again.</P>

      <P>I would not like to sit under the magnifying of the position of the Ministry of Finance, which, I think, the Postmaster-General is indulging in.  There is no doubt that if the Dáil passes the resolution, it is not a thing that can be turned down lightly by the Minister for Finance, but I do not think that he should be bound by this.  He should have an opportunity of bringing it to the Dáil for further consideration.</P>

      <P>The question of finance enters very largely into the control of broadcasting.  We have spent some hours this afternoon deciding whether one shilling should be taken off the very meagre amount of the old age pensions, and the majority of the Dáil showed its readiness to deduct that amount.  This spirit of <Col N="2875" /> economy which has been in evidence as a general policy on the part of the Government for a considerable time past, meets with my entire approval, and it had quite a lot to say in determining my decisions in regard to non-State control of this service.  I recognise that there are dangers to uncontrolled communications. In times of trouble they may be used to the detriment of the country, but recognising that I had in the case of the White Paper&mdash;and this is a point the Dáil should understand&mdash; provided that if private enterprise supplied the financial requirements, all the control which any State proposal and which the present State proposal provides was provided for in that scheme of mine.  I aimed at the elimination of any financial responsibility on the part of the State, and I maintained, on the other hand, all the necessary control which a State should require, otherwise control without financial responsibility. We are discussing here a question which, to my view, has rather resolved itself into one of nationalisation versus private enterprise.  I do not wish to accuse the Committee of availing of this opportunity to forward the former, but, doubtless, this is what has transpired without, in my opinion, having any justification whatever for involving the State in the financial risks of this enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee, in order to impress its desire for nationalisation, has accepted that financial responsibility.  I must ask the Dáil to consider what the White Paper provided for.  It provided that market reports, agricultural reports, weather reports, and educational matter should be transmitted free.  It also agreed that any official propaganda or pronouncements that might be considered necessary should, as a matter of course, be transmitted without cost.  Now, these are the features which the Committee has put foremost in urging that broadcasting should be a State service.  These are features which were already provided free on the part of the company mentioned in the White Paper, but there is this difference, that whilst in the case in the White Paper these services were provided free, in the case of the scheme <Col N="2876" /> before the Dáil the nation will pay for it.  Services which were formerly provided free will henceforth, if this scheme is adopted, be paid for by the taxpayers of the State.  I can well understand some Deputies showing their nervousness at handing over a scheme of this kind to private enterprise, but in the particular scheme put forward in November, I want to point out that every possible precaution, next to complete State control, was provided for.  It was, for instance, decided that at any time the Postmaster-General may veto a programme, that at any time his representative may enter and inspect the doings of the Broadcasting Company, that at any time, should this Company fail to meet the requirements of the State and the Post Office, six months' terminal notice could be served, and finally&mdash;this is the important thing &mdash;that after the State had got a fair and reasonable opportunity of witnessing the working of broadcasting, otherwise at a termination of a period of five years, it may, if necessary, assume the responsibility itself.  It is a very remarkable thing that this country should be made the stalking horse for what I consider a very peculiar form of nationalisation.</P>
    <P>We have the example of stations in England and France, with the exception of the Eiffel Tower, which is a military station, handed over for a number of hours as a matter of convenience. Spain, Belgium, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia, and possibly others &mdash;in fact every country in the world that considered this matter, and no doubt considered it from the different angles of State control versus private control, decided against the former. Every country in the world decided against State control, and not one but this young State, which is struggling to get on its legs, has been made the stalking horse for what I consider to be a foolish and ill-advised experiment. There is one country an exception to those which I mentioned in the production of concerts and public amusements, and that is Russia.  In Russia the State had quite a lot of enthusiasm for this particular line at one time, but information of a later <Col N="2877" /> date indicates that there it is found it can be better conducted by private enterprise.  Therefore, we stand alone in the world.</P>

I have no doubt myself, if this House determines that the Post Office must do the showman, must differentiate between rival organ-grinders, rival tenors and people of that kind, and even rival politicians who want to get control and preferential treatment, we will be able to do it; but we will do it at a price, and it will be a very dear price.</P>

      <P>I speak of Advisory Board distinct from Director. What are to be the relations between <Col N="2878" /> this Advisory Board and the representative of the Dáil, who has got the spending of this public money? Will the Advisory Board take a hand in the expenditure, or will the P.M.G. alone say what is or what is not to be spent, and in the former case is the P.M.G. merely a unit in this determining machine?  If, for instance, he finds himself in a minority, who is to decide how public funds are to be disposed of?  That is not all.  Is it considered by the Committee that there is to be no check on the expenditure placed at the disposal of the Postmaster-General and this Advisory Committee in this connection? Is it assumed that the Ministry for Finance will not insist, according to its mood, in determining whether a certain employee, otherwise a certain musician, is or is not to be employed, and what were her previous employment and wages, and whether her voice is good or bad, and is she entitled to 5s more than her neighbour's daughter? Will not the Finance Minister ask those usual and regular questions in this instance, or will they waive this established practice?  If so, we may very well conclude that we are going to have a file of papers for every artist which the Broadcasting Company requires. I can plainly see difficulties ahead.  It is said by the Committee that one of its main reasons for State control is that amusement is only subsidiary. Well, my information from people who have had experience in other countries is entirely contrary to that.  I am assured that the ordinary user of receiving sets feels that anything else but music jars on his nerves. He does not want anything else.  In England, when the Broadcasting Committees decided to get out on educational matters, they were overwhelmed with protests from the public.</P>

If you believe in this station which you propose to put up in Dublin to cater for <Col N="2879" /> the citizens of Dublin, that you are going to get away with your agricultural reports, your fishery reports, and your education, and that the people will possess themselves with wireless sets and pay licences for the purpose, I am satisfied that you are assuming something that will not materialise.  What, for instance, do the bulk of the people of Dublin city require to know about agriculture?  They have not as much land as would sod a lark.  What do they want to know about fishing?  I think it is all nonsense, and if you believe it is necessary to saturate them with education, I think they will very much disagree with you.  Most of them think they know all that is to be known.</P>

      <NameTxt>POSTMASTER-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is, and you cannot get away from it, much as one may sympathise with the idea of enlightening a community in the various ways suggested by the Committee, the people want amusement through broadcasting; they want nothing else, and they will have nothing else.  If you make amusement subsidiary then you will have no broadcasting, nobody will buy an instrument, nobody will pay a licence, and the thing will never begin.  Those who have got expensive instruments will find material from the other side, and there is the beginning and end of your broadcasting scheme.  The question of expense has come up rather prominently. Remember that under the White Paper, whilst the State got all the control that it needs, and whilst we were promised an efficient service and a universal service, universal in the Free State, it cost the State nothing. As a matter of fact, not only did it cost it nothing, but the Post Office exacted what I might indeed term a private profit of 5s. on each licence.  What do we find in this case?  It is proposed to put up a station in Dublin, which will be only a makeshift, and it is to be followed by an expensive one later on. The station is to cost £5,000, that is, £5,000 of the public money unnecessarily gone bang.  Later on the State will be faced with a vote for a second £5,000 for engineering expenses.  That <Col N="2880" /> is £10,000.  At the same time it must, whether it likes or not, if there is anything real in this proposal, vote at least £10,000 for the provision of concerts and for the maintenance of a Director and an Announcer, and all their hangers-on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil will be called upon to vote at least £10,000.  Any person who has gone to the trouble of reading that book will find that a station of the kind cannot be managed for anything under £10,000.  That is £20,000 of public money.  For what?  For the novelty of saying that we have introduced nationalisation into the control of wireless. We had the substance before; it was not the case of a shadow.  Now, we have what is more; we have nationalisation. Perhaps we might get £5,000 as a result of licences.  It would reduce our liability to £15,000.  When I say we are faced with a loss of £15,000 for Dublin, I am only speaking for Dublin.  But the people elsewhere will insist that our generosity, generosity with money we have no right to hand out, must be extended to them, and we will have to go down to Wexford, Waterford&mdash;I say nothing about Cork&mdash; and go down to Kerry and other places. We have petitions every other day for the erection of stations in every county in the Free State.  You do not know what the thing is going to lead to.  To say that you are only going to lose £15,000 is, in my opinion, altogether underestimating the responsibility that you are accepting in this business.  I do not mind whether you accept it or not, except as a public representative, but I think it would be undoubtedly unfair on my part if I were to accede to unnecessary expenditure of public funds, considering that I have been screwing down the people through the medium of the Department I have had control of during the last twelve months; that I dismissed 475 postmen, men who had no other means of supporting their families and themselves, that I shut Post Offices, and deprived poor people of a living, and I have curtailed the ordinary requirements of the people.  And to come along and say lightly, &ldquo;I do not mind this, and I will agree to pouring out this public money in other directions,&rdquo; would be, I <Col N="2881" /> think, a piece of gross inconsistency. That was the main reason which determined me, in the first instance, in removing any financial liability from the shoulders of the State and handing this over to private enterprise.  The whole objection to this private enterprise arose from the idea that the State was making a concession.  The State had some El Dorado to hand over: the mere fact that it had the imprint of the State on it necessarily implied that it was an El Dorado, and because of that everybody who could not be in the thing objected, as a matter of course, to anybody else coming into it. It is merely narrow human prejudice. But let us see as to this concession. A concession, from my point of view, is something one concedes.  What did one concede in this case?  Our own experience is that the concession is a burden of £15,000 which the State has now discovered.</P>
    <P>If all concessions were of that nature, I certainly think that the State could well afford to hold a cheap sale of concessions, and unburden itself of much of the State responsibility which it now shoulders.  It would certainly be to the national advantage.  This is no concession.  It was a responsibility which men believed they could take&mdash;at a risk&mdash;and it is a great pity that they were not permitted to take it, and remove that risk from the shoulders of the taxpayers.  I think this enquiry into Broadcasting has been one of the most costly things that the State has had to face for many a day.</P>

      <P>As I said, if the State is prepared to shoulder responsibility for this, the responsibility will be heavy, but my Department has no objection whatever to take on that responsibility, provided the State is prepared to pay the piper. But there is one thing that I would like <Col N="2882" /> the Dáil to understand, and it is this, that the control of Broadcasting ought to be either a purely State control or a purely private enterprise.  Dual control is, in my opinion, impossible.  There is no chance whatever of reconciling dual control with efficiency.  That is my experience of life, at any rate, and though I do not mind whether this proposal of the Committee is accepted or not, I do not see at the moment how it can be otherwise than accepted, because there is no alternative.  I see no feasible alternative now, seeing that the original scheme was knocked on the head with, I think, very unnecessary haste.  I see no objection, provided the Dáil is prepared to meet the expenditure in the acceptance of this proposal. If you do not accept that, I can clearly see that you will lead to chaos in broadcasting, and chaos will simply mean that the State will wash its hands of all responsibility; that it will simply refuse to take any responsibility whatever in the matter, either control, or financial risk, and if that state should arrive it will, at any rate, have one result; it will free the State from any particular loss, and it may not be, on the whole, a bad result.  I do not feel the least bit satisfied that the best thing has been done in regard to broadcasting. I think it has been very badly messed and muffed from the beginning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow.  I will turn to the question of economy, which is within the scope.  I have pressed the question of economy on the Minister for Finance as strongly as anybody else, but there is an economy which is a false economy, and that is economy neglecting potential assets.  Now, suppose a land-owner is hard up&mdash;and most land-owners are hard up&mdash;he will be guilty of a grave fault if, in order to raise money, he cuts down a wood of which the timber would be very much more valuable in twenty or thirty years' time.  It might even pay him to spend money in fencing it to keep out rabbits, hares, and so on.  I look upon broadcasting as only the beginning of a potential asset which may be of extraordinary value to the State.  I do not know if any Deputies have read a book by H.G. Wells, which I read as a boy, in which, more than twenty years ago, he foretold a state in which all the news was given by loud speakers. He anticipated the loud speakers, and the newspapers being supplanted by these loud speakers, which called out the news and advertisements.  Supposing something like that should happen, is not that an enormous asset, which should not be in private hands, but which the State should control and scrutinise?  I am not entirely impressed by the Postmaster-General's argument that the cost of stations will be enormous, and that Waterford, Wexford and other places will demand stations. From reading this evidence I have gathered that the programmes from a central station in Dublin or Cork would be relayed to places of this kind.  They would have relay stations, and the only reason that it is not possible to do that in Ireland is because the Postmaster-General's telephonic system is so inefficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The system which the Postmaster-General has inherited from the British Government.  I wish to be absolutely fair.  There is another point: not only is broadcasting a potential asset, but it may be made a means of economy, because if properly worked and developed it may be used to economise in education.  For instance, at least £50,000 was spent last year in the teaching of Irish, very often by teachers who had acquired the knowledge comparatively hastily. Surely it would be better to have native-speaking teachers giving lessons over the wireless to all the schools and having them reproduced by loud speakers.  The same would possibly apply to the Ministry of Agriculture. A large sum of money is spent by the Ministry on lectures on fruit trees and the various systems of tillage, and so on.  Used intelligently, this new weapon of science might be of far greater value.  You could have more interesting lectures and you could hold the attention of the people better.  The only disadvantage would be that the audience would not be able to ask questions. There would be no interruptions, and Deputy Gorey would be very unhappy.  Again, the Postmaster-General never looked to the credit side. There are to be fees for licences.  One point I am disposed to criticise is that the Committee have assumed that you must have a flat rate of fees for licences.  I do not see why a man with a crystal set which only cost him a few pounds should pay the same fee as a man with a four-valve set that cost £50. You might grade it at ten shillings, say, for a crystal set, £1 for a two-valve set, £2 for a four-valve set, and so on.  I know a Senator who is installing a wireless set that will cost him £75, and he could quite afford to pay a £5 licence on that, and in that way an effort could be made to make the accounts balance more nearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn to the question of the necessity of the State controlling wireless, because of propaganda.  The one doubt in my mind when I read this Committee's scheme was that it will set up the Postmaster-General as a censor of what we should hear and what we should not, because the Postmaster-General is a little too virtuous for the ordinary man. <Col N="2885" /> He thinks because he is virtuous we should take no more cakes and ale.  He is rather disposed to be troubled about the idea of an Advisory Board.  After all, an Advisory Board is not a new thing in connection with Government Departments.  The Department of Agriculture carried on for a long time with two Advisory Boards&mdash;one for agriculture and one for technical instruction. The Minister for Fisheries has set up an Advisory Board, and why the Postmaster-General should not work smoothly and harmoniously with an Advisory Board in this matter rather baffles me.  I assume the usual procedure would be followed.  The Postmaster-General will tell the Board how much he can spend on entertainments, and the Advisory Board will spend the money to the best of their ability.  I really think it will work out very well. A rather parallel case occurs to me.  In Great Britain lecturers were employed in the various Museums and Art Galleries, and there is no question on the Estimates as to why So-and-So was employed, and why he lectures on Spanish Art three times a week and Dutch only once.  These things do not happen.  Another reason why I rather mistrust the Postmaster-General's censorship is because he declared before the Committee he would not allow any racing news and information.  Mr. J.J. Walsh has an absolute right to that attitude, but I am not quite sure that Deputy J.J. Walsh, who represents a large number of people in Cork who are interested in racing news, is entitled to take such a strong line.</P>
    <P>I certainly think the Postmaster-General, as a supplier of wireless information, is not entitled to use his own personal opinion, or his own preference, to discriminate in one way or another.  Even if he did so, he would not be consistent, because he allows over the post, and over the telephones and telegraphs an enormous amount of racing information, and not merely that, but he actually conveys a very large number of bets.  I rather wish that he had not done so last week.  It would be to my personal advantage if he had not.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any servant of the State is entitled to set up his own predilections, whatever they may be, <Col N="2886" /> when there is a case of a public demand that has to be fulfilled.  The Postmaster-General on this matter has expressed what I know is a genuine desire to protect us from foreign propaganda. I am willing to go with him to a great extent; I would much sooner see genuinely Irish propaganda, and see on the Advisory Board such people as the Minister for Education, Dr. Larchét, and Colonel Brasé, the Director of the Army School of Music.  They would give us the kind of entertainment that the Irish people would need. Remember that good music is not merely entertainment; it is an education as well.</P>
    <P>The Postmaster-General rather overlooked that idea.  How did the Postmaster-General, in the White Paper, propose to protect us?  To begin with, he proposed that there should be no Irish broadcasting on Sunday.  Sunday is the one day on which there is what might be described as propaganda. Sermons are broadcast from all the British broadcasting stations, and I presume there is no clergyman worth his salt who does not make his sermon embody some form of propaganda.  It may be good or it may be bad, but it is propaganda all the same, and it would not be desired by the bulk of the people in this country to have sermons from clergymen of another religion.  His other method, which I will refer to cursorily, is to protect us from British propaganda by giving the principal interest in the Irish Broadcasting Company to a gentleman whom the late President Griffith believed to be an agent of Lord Beaverbrook.  That is almost too original for words.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Cooper heard what I said at the beginning of the discussion. I said that no questions of personal reputations could be introduced, as they did not arise in connection with the Final Report.</P>

      <P>I did not hear that, and it makes my withdrawal all the more complete.  I withdraw that at once.  Now to come to the general question of broadcasting, I say it must be a monopoly.  The experience of the United States proved that it must be a monopoly.  You must have one company and only one broadcasting company, and in the second place I would like to point out it is always a danger to give a monopoly to a private corporation. There is always a suspicion of your motives.  Therefore I would prefer the Committee's suggestion of a State scheme, and failing that I believe that the best way to get a satisfactory service is by the second scheme, a partly State-controlled scheme.  In that connection I think we ought to note that the Postmaster-General turned down the scheme of the Irish and Foreign Corporation submitted to him. That Corporation is a Corporation of which the directors are men well-known in public life, not mainly as financiers or men who seek a profit.  Two of them are Senators, and their names are known to the public, and in addition one-half of the shares are held by the National Land Bank, which is not a <Col N="2888" /> Company-promoting or a profit-seeking institution.  I think a little more should be said about that.  If it is necessary to give it to any private company let it be given to a private company the Directors of which are well known and are above suspicion.</P>

      <P>I should just like to make one remark.  In the first place, it is that Deputy Cooper put the position of the Committee, I think, exceedingly well; but he misrepresented us in one respect, and that was to say that we made a recommendation that there should be a flat rate of one pound per set.  That was merely put into this report as a basis of calculation.  I would like to call the attention of the Dáil to what I think would very much shorten the debate, and that is: What would be the actual effect of the passing of the resolution which was proposed by An Leas-Cheann Comhairle? But as I fancy there are several other Deputies who wish to speak on this discussion, I would wish to know whether the Dáil would prefer that I would move the adjournment of the debate to another Sitting&mdash;say, until Tuesday next?</P>

      <P>Thomas Muldoon was sentenced to death by a Military Court on the 31st May, 1923, on a charge of having in his possession a certain written document calculated to be or which might be used for purposes prejudicial to the safety of the State or of the National Forces.  The sentence was commuted to ten years' penal servitude and duly confirmed.  It is not practicable to release him.</P>
      <P>I may add that the prisoner has not yet made application for the review of his sentence by the Commissioners appointed for the purpose under the provisions of the Indemnity Act, 1923.</P>
