      <P>asked the President whether he is aware that in the allocation of the Saorstát share of the recent British Grant for the erection of houses for ex-soldiers and sailors the Committee responsible determined on one hundred and fifty such houses for the Cork City area at a cost of £800 per house: whether the British Treasury has now sought to reduce this sum to £500 per house, and whether, in the event of such reduction being insisted on, representations will be made to the effect that the total sum involved in the higher figure will be expended in this area: also, if he will state whether the British Government intends to make further grants towards housing schemes of this nature in the Saorstát in fulfilment of its promise to ex-soldiers and sailors.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the allocation of money provided from British sources for the housing of ex-soldiers and sailors of the British Forces is a concern of the British Government.  I will seek information on the matter from the Colonial Office, London, and communicate with the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is <Col N="866" /> aware that William Downey, Chapel Street, Bantry, joined the National Army on May 1st, 1922, with the rank of Quartermaster, and was discharged on March 24th, 1924, that up to September 15th, 1922, he only received one week's pay, that he has made several applications for arrears of pay, and has been promised that the claim would be investigated, and whether the arrears of pay due to Downey will now be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Army pay records show that Mr. Downey received remuneration for army service as from the 6th August, 1922.  Prior to that date, according to a statement furnished by himself, he was not able to take up duties as a soldier.  It therefore appears that there are no arrears of pay due to him.  The matter will, however, be investigated further, and I will communicate the result to the Deputy in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>No estimate can be given of the face value of the copper token coinage in existence in the Saorstát, but as regards silver it has been estimated that the face value of silver coins in the hands of the public and of Irish banks in their offices in the Saorstát amounts to £1,500,000 approximately. The profit which would be made by replacing these coins would not be an annual one, and would depend on the composition of the alloy used in the new tokens and the cost of minting and distribution.</P>

      <P>Assuming that the alloy used was that in the British coinage at present, 50 per cent. silver and 50 per cent. alloy, and assuming that the silver was bought at its present <Col N="867" /> value, the profit would be in the neigh-bourhood of £800,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the premises of Mr. E.J. O'Hanrahan, Sneem, Co. Kerry, were occupied for five months by National Forces while the owner was in prison; that his wife and family had to leave the house and find lodgings elsewhere; that Mr. O'Hanrahan's house was badly damaged and a considerable <Col N="868" /> amount of his property destroyed, and whether, seeing that he has not yet received any compensation, settlement of his claim will now be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is being investigated by the Department of Defence and by the Board of Works. The Department of Defence state that the premises were occupied by the troops for one month only, and not for five months, as stated in the question. The claim made was for £794, but the inquiries of the Board of Works, so far as they have proceeded, seem to show that a sum of from £50 to £100 should cover the loss and damage caused.  The investigation will be expedited. The Department of Defence are, however, informed that the claimant took an active part in the campaign of destruction.  The inquiries of the Department of Defence are being pursued with the view of ascertaining whether the activities of the claimant have been such as would debar him from receiving compensation from the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY (for Tomás O Conaill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he can state the number of Registrars of the Dáil Circuit Courts for whom employment has been found in connection with the existing Courts or otherwise, and if he will say whether any steps have been taken, or are in contemplation, to compensate those for whom employment has not been provided and who became unemployed as a result of the closing of the Dáil Courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this question is possibly based on some misapprehension as to the facts.  The Registrars of Dáil Circuit Courts were usually junior barristers who came down from Dublin from time to time with the Judges of the Dáil Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The holder of such a post, even in the British Courts in this country, was regarded as a part-time, non-pensionable officer, and this applies even more <Col N="869" /> strongly to the Dáil Courts.  These professional gentlemen did not rely upon this part-time employment for their living, and they did not become unemployed when the Dáil Courts ceased to function.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I do not think that the question of compensation or re-employment arises.</P>
    <P>The only class of Dáil Court officers who had a reasonable claim in this connection were the Registrars of the District Court, of whom almost all who gave their allegiance to the Saorstát Government have been re-employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">

      <NameTxt>TOMAS MAC EOIN</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can state, or give an estimate of, the number of insured persons who will enter the Fourth Benefit Year with sufficient contributions to entitle them to unemployment insurance benefit, and if those who will have sufficient contributions to entitle them to benefit for the maximum period, and the probable average duration of benefit expected to be drawn by insured workers during that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible for me to give the statement or estimate required by the Deputy without first having had an individual examination made of the accounts of about 200,000 insured contributors&mdash;an undertaking which would occupy much time and involve expense which I could not justify.  As only a proportion of the insured contributors will be unemployed at any one time and not always the same persons, I do not feel satisfied that the information would serve any useful purpose.  Any statistical information regarding the unexhausted credit of insured contributors must therefore necessarily be confined to those insured contributors who are out of work and who claim benefit.</P>
      <P>In the benefit year which finished on 29th October last benefit was allowed on 76,509 claims.  That represents total claims made and not the number of individual applicants.  For statistical purposes these claims were divided into four groups, according to the amounts of benefit payable against the contributions to claimants' credit, up to the maximum of ten weeks or 60 days fixed by the Act, and it is found that 9,558 were entitled to between 1 and 18 days; 9,873 were entitled to between 19 and 36 days; 7,669 were entitled to between 37 and 48 days; 49,409 were entitled to between 49 and 60 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that most of those falling into the last group will have sufficient contributions to put them in benefit for the current year, but I will not be able before the middle of next month to have the position analysed and to state the extent of the credit of <Col N="871" /> those who will have claimed benefit up to that time.  If the Deputy repeated his question about the middle of next month I should be able to let him have statistics in regard to the current benefit year similar to those now supplied in relation to the last benefit year, and also to state the average duration of benefit on the basis of that statistical information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The information required by the Deputy is not available precisely in the form in which he asks for it.  Claims were made at the commencement of the Third &ldquo;Benefit Year&rdquo; on the 30th June, and continued to be made throughout the period ending on the 29th October.  No daily record of the number of claims lodged has been kept, but the total number of claims made in the whole period was 82,908.  Of these 3,279 were disallowed (because either the statutory conditions were not fulfilled or statutory disqualification had been incurred), and 76,509 were allowed, in the first instance.  I have given an analysis of this total in reply to Deputy Johnson.  For the answer to the last part of the question I would also refer to the reply just given to Deputy Johnson.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state on what grounds unemployment benefit was refused to Thomas Dwyer, Lisronagh, <Col N="872" /> Clonmel, Co.

      <P>On a claim made on the 7th July, Thomas Dwyer, of Lisronagh, Clonmel, was allowed benefit for 60 days.  After he had drawn benefit for 45 days, further benefit was suspended and the claim disallowed, on the ground that the applicant was not unemployed and not unable to obtain suitable employment.

      <P>Will the Minister say that if a man had been in continuous employment for forty years, and then falls out of employment and goes to live with his brother who has a small farm, that automatically he ceases to be employed?  That is what it amounts to in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, is the Deputy's account of what it amounts to in this case.  It should be remembered that the Unemployment Insurance Fund is not set aside as a sort of pension fund for individuals who have worked for forty, or for one hundred and forty, years, if you can imagine such a period.  They must come under certain statutory conditions before they can draw the benefit. Even if a man had been employed for forty year, and at a particular period was found to be unemployed or was not available for unemployment, the claim would disappear.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, before Section 1 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where any business other than the sale of intoxicating liquors is carried on in any licensed premises the whole of such premises shall be closed during the hours in which the sale of intoxicating liquor is prohibited by this section, unless the portion of such premises in which such sale is carried on is structurally separated from the remainder thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is that where mixed trading is carried on in a licensed premises, no portion can remain open for any purpose, even for the sale of commodities which are otherwise than intoxicating liquor, after the hour prescribed by the Bill, unless the portion of the premises in which the intoxicating liquors are sold is structurally separated.</P>

      <P>I would ask that this amendment be postponed.  It would inflict great hardship on the poor people in the different localities in the country who have to call to some of the public houses on Sunday mornings or Sunday evenings for their new milk. They cannot do so if this amendment is carried.  Apart from milk, they call for other necessaries of life.  It is very easy to laugh at that, but I assure you that I am quite serious.  It would be a great hardship on poor people who have no other place to go for milk and other commodities.  They would be dealing in that public house during the week, and they would not get even a pint of milk in any other house in that village.  My experience of the law as that what is now proposed is nearly the law already; but formerly, realising the necessity of the thing and seeing that it would inflict hardship, the English Government did not enforce it. With the Commission staring us in the face, we ought not to proceed with this amendment now.  We are told that in a couple of months we will have different public houses, regulated to meet <Col N="881" /> the requirements of all.  Let this amendment be postponed until the new Commission is set up.  When we reach that period we will be making little saints of all the publicans in the country.</P>

I suggest that those amendments are embarrassing on both the traders and the people, and they should be left over pending the Commission's decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks when, and if, these amendments are passed, what will be left for the Commission to consider?  The main business of the Commission will be to consider the large excess of licensed establishments in the country beyond the reasonable requirements of the people; but there will be other matters. There will be, for instance, such matters as the <i>bona fide</i> traffic, which this Bill does not touch upon at all, and a good many minor matters arising in one way or another from the drink trade in the country.  This amendment is scarcely worth the time we are giving to it.  When it passes, people who run a mixed business will have, for the purpose of such business, thirteen hours for every day in the week excepting Saturday, and twelve and a half hours for Saturday.  It is a small thing to say that the people who run, under the one roof and in the one room so to speak, a trade in intoxicating liquor together with some other business, shall confine that other business to the hours in which it is legitimate to deal in intoxicating liquors; in other words, the hours are from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on the ordinary week-day, and 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. on Saturday evenings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong, and it would make matters extremely difficult for the police, from the point of view of supervision, if a mixed shop could be kept open after the hours in which it <Col N="882" /> would be legitimate to keep an ordinary licensed establishment open, so that people could be in that shop, professedly to buy bacon or butter, or new milk, as the Deputy suggested, and the onus would be on the police to show that those people had actually consumed drink there.  Nothing short of a policeman stationed in the shop would secure that, as the Deputy knows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I will vote against this amendment.  I think it is an amendment that should be withdrawn. If it be passed there will be many cases of hardship.  Of course, we all appreciate that public houses are open thirteen hours of the day, and that period is quite long enough for anybody to consume all the liquor he requires. It may, however, happen that people who reside a mile or two from a town may not get paid early on Saturday, and that when they come in to town on a Saturday night after being paid, they would be unable to get the goods they would require.  I think the withdrawal of the amendment should be agreed to.  If it is pressed the Deputies will have to vote against it.  As Section 12 was deleted on last Tuesday, that ought to be enough to convince the Minister that the structural alterations principle is knocked out.  It would seem now as if the Government were trying to bring in by the back door what had been kicked out through the front door.  If this amendment is agreed to, I would not be surprised to find, later on, amendments to the effect that the publicans should be permitted to sell nothing except liquor, and that they should have to provide a separate shop in order to sell groceries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand why some of the Deputies in these Benches laughed when Deputy Daly mentioned the sale of new milk.  These Deputies who live in the city know nothing about the country.  Deputy Daly is perfectly <Col N="883" /> right.  In many parts of the country the publican in a town or village is the only milk vendor for miles around. Naturally it is to his house people have to go for milk, and they have to go there before and after closing hours. As far as I am concerned, I will vote against this amendment, and, if no other Deputy calls a division on it, I will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I just want to say that I know that this is the law already.  But I wanted to point out that even the British Government did not enforce the law, and they allowed their police discretion in this matter.  I would not divide the Dáil on this amendment, but if the Minister for Justice cannot accept it, I would ask him to issue regulations to the police not to be too strict in enforcing this section, and to say to them that wherever there was a genuine case of a poor person looking for milk not to prosecute.  Of course, if the policeman saw a hardy annual walking in with a pint vessel under his arm it would be a different thing, and he could nail him.  I will not press for a division on this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be right to oppose this amendment. I am partly in the trade myself. The publican has got practically 13 hours per day in which to sell milk or any other commodity that he likes.  I do not think, if it is only milk the publicans sold, that the profits that would accure from the sale of that milk would run much danger or risk from this amendment.  I am supporting the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Purely on the grounds of restriction of shop hours and the employment of assistants within certain limits of hours I support the amendment.  I would urge on that ground, if on no other, that the amendment should be carried.  To open shops before nine o'clock in the morning for the sale of groceries or milk is going against the general trend of modern legislation for the hours of sale of commodities in shops.  It is desirable to restrict <Col N="884" /> the hours, and not have people resuming the practice that was common years ago, of keeping shops open and assistants employed for 14, 15, and in some cases 18, hours a day.  On that ground and no other I ask the Deputies to support this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on a point of personal explanation, because it concerns myself.  In reference to Deputy Johnson's appeal to the Dáil to support this amendment, I want to make it clear that by going against the amendment I was not advocating longer hours for shop assistants.  But we know that under the terms of their employment shop assistants work a certain number of hours per week.  If any extra work is to be done it must be done by the owner.  Consequently, Deputy Johnson's argument about long hours falls to the ground.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this section shall vary or impair the rights enjoyed by the holders of licences for hotels and restaurants within the Dublin Metropolitan Police district under the Hotels and Restaurants (Dublin) Act, 1910.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> That particular Act is one in which I am interested, because it is my only legislative effort.  It was brought in by the members for the City and County of Dublin in the British Parliament. It empowers the proprietor of a hotel or restaurant in the Dublin Metropolitan Police district, after giving due notice to the police, to apply for an extension of hours for a particular purpose.  It is under this Act that I think the St. Patrick's Day banquet is able to be held, and the Tailteann Games banquet was able to be held.  It is not, I think, at all clear in the Bill as it stands.  On the Second Reading I asked the Minister whether the right would still continue, and he said it would.  But, of course, what a Minister says is not necessarily the law. What the Dáil passes is the law, and in this case I thought it desirable to put down an amendment.  Even among lawyers I found some conflict as to whether the passing of this Bill would not repeal the provision.  I would like to have a statement from the Minister as to the exact position.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary give us some information as to why 10 miles was selected?  I agree that the abuse of people taking a ticket from Westland Row to Lansdowne Road, going into the station to have a drink and travelling no further, should be put a stop to.  Is there any particular reason for the figure 10?  It will practically cut out the whole of the Dublin suburban traffic.  Unless people live as far away as Bri-Chualann they will not be able to get a drink at a railway station going home.  I think it might be argued that a man working late and going, say, to Dun Laoghaire, or possibly Blackrock&mdash;the Minister might not like it&mdash;is a bona fide traveller. Would it not be better to fix some limitation of price and say that the ticket must cost more than 6d., or something of that kind?</P>

      <P>I wonder if I made it 9, would it suit residents of Dalkey? The idea underlying the provision was that there might be a case of people undertaking a journey or coming off a journey being unable to get reasonable refreshments.  When a man goes into a station and buys a penny ticket and then consumes drink out of all proportion to the price of his ticket, that is in fact an evasion of the provision.  Ten miles was arrived at simply as a round figure.  It is, at any rate, a <i>bona fide</i> journey, and I do not know that there is very much to be said for any lower figure&mdash;I mean in matters of that kind you can never make a case for one figure.  If I said 12, it could be said <Col N="889" />&ldquo;Why not 11, why not 13?&rdquo; and so on.  Ten seems a reasonable figure to establish the genuine nature of the journey, and I think a small suburban trip of three or four miles is not the kind of journey to meet which the provision was originally inserted.</P>

    <P>This is an amendment put down in reply to a challenge of the Minister's. He asked me when I proposed to allow boys under eighteen years of age the comparatively harmless drink of ale or cider, why instead of trying to defend drinking by a boy I did not attack the question of age.  I never refuse the Minister's challenge.  So now I am taking the question of age, and I shall be interested to see what case he proposes to put up, because he proposes himself in Amendment 12, or rather he has got Deputy Duggan to propose, that a boy over 16 years of age may serve behind a counter in a bar.  The Minister's own proposition is that a <Col N="890" /> boy over sixteen, and under eighteen, may serve behind the counter in a bar. There he will have all the harm that has been suggested by other Deputies of the environment of a publichouse. I think myself they exaggerated their case, but there is no doubt if he wants a drink he will be able to get a certain amount.  It is practically impossible to prevent a boy behind a bar occasionally helping himself by pouring out short measure, or something of that kind.  At the same time, as the Bill stands, if this amendment of mine is not carried, a boy over sixteen and under eighteen would not be able, if dining in the most respectable restaurant in Dublin or Cork to have a glass of beer.</P>
    <P>I think if you are going to allow boys of seventeen to serve behind bars you may allow boys of seventeen to have a glass on the other side of the bar, or with a meal.  I do not think that this is a provision that will make for increased drunkenness.  The average boy of that age does not care for drink, but I have known boys of sixteen to drink beer and they were none the worse for it.  In fact I have seen the husband of the lady who was responsible for a provision of this kind in the British Parliament, when he was about seventeen years of age drinking beer and he seems to have been none the worse for it.  I do not think this is a provision that will make for drunkenness.  It is certainly consistent with the amendment Deputy Duggan has immediately following.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper has, generally, an orderly kind of mind. He suggests that he has confronted me with a great difficulty, something that it will be very hard to make a case for, because there is a provision in the Bill by which a small number of the youths in the Saorstát, possibly not more than a couple of hundred, may start their apprenticeship in this trade at the age of sixteen.  The Deputy suggests that it is impossible, or very difficult, to square that with a refusal to allow all the youths in the Saorstát, between sixteen and eighteen years of age, to drink freely on licensed premises.  I do not think the Deputy burned very much midnight oil over that particular question.  It is a question of the proportion of the thing.  As I say, in the one case it is confined to a small number of youths of a certain class, who desire to enter the trade, and wishing to commence their two or three years' apprenticeship at the age of sixteen. In the other case we have to face, generally, the question of whether we consider it a desirable thing that the boys of the country, even between sixteen and eighteen years of age, should be enabled to get drink in publichouses, and consume drink in publichouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>And hotels and restaurants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>And hotels and restaurants, certainly.  The Deputy says he has seen boys taking beer and ale without any very terrible results. I have no doubt you cannot legislate in that way.  You have got simply to take broad facts, and ask yourself whether it would be a good thing that the boys of the country, generally, of <Col N="892" /> school-going age should be enabled to drink in publichouses or hotels.  I do not think it is.  The youth of eighteen years of age will probably be able to look after himself if he is the kind of person who ever gets to the stage of being able to look after himself.  But the couple of years below that, the years of sixteen and seventeen, are not quite the same; they are more formative years, and slight influences one way or the other may affect the whole trend of the person's life.  I think it is right to insert in the new legislation a provision to the effect that boys from eighteen years downwards may not buy drink freely in publichouses and restaurants, and consume it there.  If in their own homes their parents, or guardians, consider it a reasonable or a proper thing that they should be allowed to drink beer, wine, whiskey or any other drink, that is one thing, but it is another thing to say that they may go freely into publichouses, hotels and restaurants, and buy and consume drink there.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that it is in any way inconsistent with, or in any way repugnant to that, that we feel that we must allow youths of sixteen to begin their apprenticeship to a particular trade.  It is, perhaps, regrettable that boys so young as sixteen should be employed in that trade, but the case has been made here of the hardship it would mean to prevent that, as it might mean a boy hanging around idle or being dependent on his parents for a year or more after he left school, before he could begin his apprenticeship to this trade.  Possibly, later on, if the school-going age itself is raised, there might be a strong case for raising the age at which boys may commence their apprenticeship to this trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which particularly affects, or at least so it seems, the representatives of the County Dublin.  I think the Minister has been very lenient with Deputy Cooper, whose proposition is, that not merely boys of 16 should be free to enter public houses and buy whiskey, but that girls of the same age should be free to enter public houses and buy beer, gin or wine, or any other kind <Col N="893" /> of intoxicating liquor.  Deputy Cooper agrees that girls under 18 should not be allowed to sell intoxicating liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooper not merely suggests, but wishes the Dáil to enact, that a girl of 16 may be served in a public house with spirits or beer.  Possibly Deputy Cooper knows persons of 16 years of age to be ordered by doctors to take intoxicating liquor, but I defy him to produce any case where a doctor ordered a girl of 16 to go into a public house and buy intoxicating liquor.  The proposition, coming from Deputy Cooper, is very retrogressive, and I do not think he will find very many to support him. The Minister, as I have said, was very lenient in dealing with Deputy Cooper, and assumes that only boys of 16 are referred to in the amendment.  But I would point out that Deputy Cooper does not make any restriction in respect to sex.  He includes any person, boy or girl, and the effect of his amendment, if carried, would be that it would be lawful for a licensed person to sell intoxicating liquor to any person, boy or girl, of 16 years of age and upwards.  I hope that the Dáil will not accept Deputy Cooper's lead in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that this is the only section in the Bill that I agree with.  I think it is wrong to allow youths to be served with drink at a public bar.  If boys and girls, under 18 years of age, are allowed to be served with drink in public bars, then, when they reach the age of 24 or 25, they will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to give up taking intoxicating liquor.  If they are not allowed in their youth to take drink publicly, I am sure that their parents or guardians will exercise sufficient control over them in their own homes to see that they do not get intoxicating liquor at home.  I am opposed to Deputy Cooper's amendment. In fact I would go so far as to say that young people under 20 years of age should not be served with drink at a public bar.  If boys and girls get accustomed to taking drink in their <Col N="894" /> youth it will be hard to prevent them from continuing to do so when they reach manhood and womanhood.  I hope the Dáil will reject an amendment which proposes that, I might say, children of 16 years of age should be served with drink in publichouses.  The point which Deputy Cooper raised about a boy going to serve his time to business at the age of 16 years has no bearing on this at all, for the reason that control can be exercised over an apprentice by the publican or his foreman. They will see that the apprentice will not get any intoxicating drink, and if he is caught taking it he should be dismissed immediately.  In fact, if a provision to that effect were inserted in the Bill I would be quite satisfied.  If the Bill is to achieve any useful purpose at all, it ought to be to prevent boys and girls from being afforded facilities for taking intoxicating drink.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>If this section is passed it will almost become obligatory on publicans to take out some kind of a medical degree.  It would be almost impossible for a publican to tell the age of a boy of 16, 17 or 18.  You might get a boy of 17½ years of age almost twice as big as a boy of 18 years.  He might have an older looking face than the boy of 18, and how, I ask, in such a case is the publican to know whether he is 17 or 18?  The publican, of course, might do what is done in the case of persons who present themselves as bona fide travellers. A youth say, comes in and asks for a drink.  He is asked if he is over 18, and of course if he wants a drink he will say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  How is the publican going to refuse him?  What mode of procedure will the policeman adopt when he takes the alleged offender to the court?  On whom will the onus of proof lie?  It will put the publican, the boy himself and the policeman in a very awkward position, while the District Justice will be put in a terrible position.  I am of opinion that this section will lead to endless trouble.  When the case comes to the court the policeman may be put in a very awkward position if he is asked by the District Justice to say on his oath whether or not the boy is 17 or 18.  Personally I may say that I am <Col N="895" /> very much against any young fellow of 17 going into a publichouse and calling for drink.  I do not like it, and I am as much against that as any Deputy here.  If only the truth were known perhaps I am more against it than any Deputy here.  Though I speak for the licensed trade, I do not want to say that I am the patron saint of it.  At the same time I desire to point out that publicans will be placed in a very awkward position if this section is passed.  How are they to know whether a boy is 16, 17 or 18?  In late years you cannot get boys at that age to tell you a word of the truth.</P>

There are very few shops, I think, except those carrying on mixed businesses, which have boys under sixteen, and in any such mixed businesses I think certainly they would be able to find plenty of employment in the other departments without requiring to sell liquor.  There is nothing to prevent their continuing their apprenticeship and doing other work besides selling liquor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">

      <P>That may be all very well for cities or large towns with nine or ten thousand population, where there may be large premises and where there may be sufficient work for boys in selling groceries at one particular counter until they have reached the age of sixteen.  But in small towns there may be only one boy employed in a very small business.  He would have to sell everything and if such a boy was not sixteen years of age, if this amendment was adopted, he would not be allowed to go inside the bar to sell a drink, although he would not have sufficient to do at the other counter. In some shops both counters are together.  There are shops in country towns where there is hardware and grocery and licensed business all in one shop and at the same counter and <Col N="898" /> if a boy is behind that counter he cannot keep a certain number of feet for groceries and a certain number for licensed business.  I raise no objection in this case as the Minister guaranteed to bring in an amendment in the Seanad with a view to enabling those boys of sixteen who are already in apprenticeship to remain at their business.</P>

      <P>I think it is well to find out whether the same thing might not occur here as occurred in the case of female members of a publican's family.  What is to be the position of a lad of fifteen-and-a-half years, the son of a publican assisting his father, if some provision of this kind is not brought in?  I think it is absolutely necessary in this case, as in the case of a daughter or a step-daughter, to bring in the publican's son, and in that case I think the Minister ought to say he will have this matter put right in the Seanad.  It will cause great hardship to many people who have sons of that age if they cannot be of assistance to them.</P>

      <P>Does it not also close up another loophole?  This amendment is rather loosely drafted, but probably it is drafted as well as I could draft it myself.  But I think it will also prevent a member of the club living on the premises ordering a drink for a friend.  Under the provision originally drafted it was possible for a member of the club who is living there to order a drink for a friend as well as for himself, and I think this is shutting the door.  It is rather drastic, but on the other hand it may be necessary because there may be clubs where you have a person such as the secretary living on the premises.  He might order drink for anybody.  But is that contemplated or not?</P>

      <P>It is contemplated. There is a definite intention to stop the loophole to which Deputy Cooper refers in addition to that to which Deputy Duggan referred.  The intention is that no one except a <i>bona fide</i> lodger on the premises, a person staying in the club, should be able to buy and consume liquor on the premises after the legal closing hour.  We are not entirely out of touch with practical facts and we are aware that there is such a thing as a club locker in which drink is stored which has been bought before the closing time and is simply put into the locker and is available for consumption after closing time.  The intention is that the club shall be placed in this respect on all-fours with the licensed establishment and that drink shall not be consumed <Col N="900" /> there into late hours in the night.  The only mitigation of that, is in the case of a man for whom the club is for the time being, at any rate, a home&mdash;a man who is staying there and who could reasonably claim he is entitled to as much freedom there and as much liberty as he would probably have in his home.  He can get drink but he should not be free to take advantage of his temporary residence there to enable some other person who is not residing there to have a drink after the legitimate hours.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage the Minister for Justice promised that club opening on Sundays <Col N="901" /> would be restricted to the same hours as publichouses.  That is not being done on the Report Stage.  The same would apply also to Saturday evening, but that is not being done on the Report Stage; and I would like to know from the Minister why this understanding was not met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is overstating the case.  I undertook on Committee to consider whether it would be practicable to make a provision of that kind for clubs on Sundays, and in so far as I gave the undertaking I have fulfilled it, because I have given careful consideration to the matter, and I am not satisfied that it is necessary or practicable to change the existing position with regard to clubs on Sundays, namely, that drink may be consumed between the hours of 1 p.m. and 10 p.m.  As the Sunday position and the bona fide position stand at the moment, an attempt to alter the hours for the sale and consumption of drink in clubs would simply lead you into a morass and lead you into a state of affairs in which it would be impossible to enforce or administer the law which you would pass.  You would simply be courting a position in which a man could not get in his club what he could get by leaving the club and walking round the corner to a publichouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a golf club in Rathfarnham. If you say that people there are restricted during certain hours, say from 2 till 5, then outside of those hours you simply drive the members of the club down to the licensed houses in the village where they may get all you seek to deny them in the club.  As long as the existing Sunday provisions, and as long as the existing bona fide provisions last, I am satisfied you would gain nothing by attempting to interfere with the existing club hours on Sunday.  It does seem, perhaps, a bit liberal that members of clubs under this Bill, when it passes, will be free to obtain drink between the hours of 1 and 10 p.m., but having looked into the thing very carefully, I do not agree that anything would be gained by attempting to impose restrictions in view of the present bona fide facilities, and I think you might very easily run the danger of simply increasing such <Col N="902" /> abuses as do exist in connection with the bona fide traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In page 9 to add at the end of section 13 (1) the following words: &ldquo;Provided that it shall be lawful for a Justice of the District Court on application from a club, whose members are compelled by their professions or avocations to work at hours other than the usual hours of work, to vary by Order the hours during which excisable liquor may be supplied to members.  Any application for removal of such Order shall be made annually at the time of the renewal of the certificate of registration of the club.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In this amendment there are two misprints. The first misprint, which is an obvious one, is &ldquo;13&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;18,&rdquo; in the first line.  The other, which is less obvious, is in the last line but two. &ldquo;Any application for removal&rdquo; should be &ldquo;any application for removal.&rdquo;  I am afraid that my bad handwriting is responsible.  But in effect it makes little difference, because if the club is to apply for this Order to be renewed annually, it is open to the police or to any persons who have objections to state their objections against it.  It is an attempt, not, I am afraid, a very successful attempt, to draft an amendment to meet the case which the Minister promised to consider.  I would like to say now that a promise of consideration does not mean a promise of favourable consideration.  I am not suggesting that if the Minister turns this amendment down he will have committed a breach of faith.  But he promised to consider the case of people who work at night, the case like that, for instance, of the Press Club in London.  I believe there are in the Saorstát two clubs now used by railway workers, which are allowed to keep open at night, and this is an attempt to say that when such a club&mdash;I do not like using the word bona fides in connection with liquor&mdash;has proved its good faith, we will translate it, a District Justice may, by order, fix a time and have the hours varied during which liquor may be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two things in this amendment which I do not like myself. <Col N="903" /> and I will anticipate the Minister's criticism.  The first is &ldquo;whose members are compelled by their professions or avocations to work at hours other than the usual hours,&rdquo; is perhaps rather loose.  I know that it is, because I came up against the difficulty that in many of these night jobs there is a day shift and a night shift, and the workers are transferred from one to the other.  The consequence is that if you say &ldquo;to all whose members&rdquo; or, &ldquo;whose members are exclusively employed at night work,&rdquo; the result would be that people would have to resign from a club when they were put on the day shift and join the club when they were put on the night shift, and <i>vice versa</i>, and that hardly seems a tenable proposition.  If the Minister considers that the amendment would not be too loose, I hope he will accept it. If he does not I suppose the amendment will meet the fate of very many other amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should give a little extra time to the clubs on week nights, particularly Saturday nights.  Clubs do not require to be opened at 9 o'clock in the morning. A little extra time ought to be given on week nights so that people who were in business all day could get refreshments when they came to a club at night.  I would suggest an hour or an hour and a half longer than the licensed premises.</P>

Dublin is in a different position from the provincial towns, or from most of them.  I am not talking about Dublin, its golf clubs, and its club facilities, but about the provincial towns where there are no golf clubs and where the clubs are purely drinking institutions on Sundays, without any supervision up to now.  It is there the abuses I complain of exist, and if these clubs are allowed to open until 10 o'clock on Sunday nights in provincial <Col N="904" /> towns, where there is no question at all of <i>bona fide</i> travelling&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not accepting the Deputy's amendment.  I have considered it, and my reason for not accepting it is that I am not satisfied that there is any present need for a provision of this kind.  I think the amendment, even as it stands, would be construed more strictly than the section.  I think that &ldquo;whose members are compelled by their professions&rdquo; would be construed as applying to all the members.  If you take the amendment in that way, it suggest a club entirely composed of members who are obliged to work at night, or whose work lies outside the hours in which intoxicating liquor may normally be obtained.  I do not think that there is any such club in the Saorstát.  There are probably clubs of which a few individual members may have to work at night, or may have to work occasionally at night, but even the number of those, I should say, would be very small, and generally the dimensions of the hardship, in so far as it exists at all, are not such as to call for special legislative provision.  That is the result of the consideration that I have caused to be given to the matter, and that is the attitude I take on the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If life here in the city were to alter very appreciably and a situation developed in which quite an important section of the city's population would be compelled to work at night in various avocations, there probably would come, and I think there certainly should come, an alteration of the law to meet that state of affairs.  But I am entirely satisfied that the most circumspect amendment that you could insert to meet the little hardship that exists on an almost infinitesimal scale in Dublin would simply be seized on <Col N="905" /> and exploited, and would in the course of time inevitably become simply an evasion of the spirit of your legislation, would simply become an opportunity for a great number of people to sit up into the small hours of the morning consuming intoxicating drink.  In its origin and in its intention the amendment would, no doubt, be an attempt to meet the reasonable claims of a very limited number of night workers.  In practice it would become simply a kind of illicit night club where people straying around at night could drop in for a drink, and that is an objectionable kind of establishment.  I would ask the Deputy to believe that as much consideration was given to the matter as could fairly be expected, and that what I am saying now is not merely just the traditional negative to his amendment, or to amendments of this kind generally, but the result of a good deal of examination.</P>

    <P>It may be necessary to explain the meaning of the repeal of portion of Section 2 of the 1906 Act.  That section made provision for the closing of public houses in towns of a population of less than 5,000 at 9 p.m. on Saturdays. The present Bill makes provision for uniform closing on Saturday evening at 9.30 o'clock, irrespective of population.  It was thought better to make that clear.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo; In doing so, I would like to make a few remarks with regard to Section 7 as it stands.  I seem to have occasioned considerable consternation by accepting in Committee an amendment moved by Deputy Johnson providing for the use of standard bottles to be prescribed by the Minister.  In discussing and stating my intentions to accept it I said very casually and tentatively something to the effect that, possibly, the standard bottle would be a bottle of 14 to the gallon. Since then I have had considerable correspondence, the general tendency of which is to point out that a standard of that kind would be extremely <Col N="907" /> inconvenient and undesirable, and that, in fact, 90 per cent. of the bottles in use are 16 to the gallon.  That of course is an important consideration that would be adverted to in the fixing of a standard, but I may, perhaps, have been somewhat hasty in accepting an amendment in the exact words in which it was put up because the words are mandatory rather than enabling, and are very comprehensive in their scope.  Sub-section (1) of Section 7 reads: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any licensed holder to supply any intoxicating liquor in bottles unless such bottles are of standard sizes to be prescribed by the Minister.&rdquo;  That sub-section, as it stands, puts the onus on the Minister of prescribing a standard sized bottle for every class of intoxicating liquor, including wines and liqueurs.  That would be somewhat of an undertaking, and it is an undertaking at which I would be inclined to shy a little.  I would prefer therefore something in this form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Justice may from time to time by order prescribe a standard size of bottles in which intoxicating liquor may be sold.  Every licence holder who shall sell or expose for sale any intoxicating liquor in bottles of a size other than that prescribed by the Minister in the manner aforesaid shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence to a penalty not exceeding £5 and in the case of any subsequent offences to a penalty not exceeding £10.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That would give all the power that is needed and the operation of that power would take place, from time to time, according as there may seem to be a case for it.  In the exercise of that power, it seems to me that there would be a case for a rather full consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce as to the exact reactions of the fixing of a particular standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the wording which I suggest is preferable to the sub-section as it stands, and it would be my intention to secure in the Seanad an alteration in that direction, making the first sub-section permissive and enabling, <Col N="908" /> rather than mandatory, as it is at present. I think that this announcement will probably calm a good deal of the apprehension which is being aroused by the suggestion that we were going to have in the immediate future a standard size of bottle, prescribed of 14 to the gallon.  The position under the Bill, or certainly under the Bill with the proposed amendment, will simply be that, from time to time, the Minister for Justice may prescribe a standard.  The Bill contains no suggestion as to what the standard will be, and before the power is exercised very full consideration will be given to all the reactions of the fixing of any particular standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the statement of the Minister for Justice he reserves to himself a lot of power to review these things at any time.  I think that a better and more practical way would be to drop the whole section, for the reason that it would involve the destruction of hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of bottles throughout the Saorstát, and it would not be worth that.  Take the case from a working-man's point of view.  He does not go in very much for drinking bottles of stout, but, if he did, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the publican putting another halfpenny on the bottle. There is no protection at all for stout, even though it is looked upon as a food. When Deputy Johnson handed in his amendment I raised an objection on a point of order, and the Minister for Justice pointed out that in his opinion it was really a matter concerning weights and measures.  I agreed with him, and I still agree with him, and I ask him to stick to that, and it will remove all the trouble.  What good is this proposal going to do to a person getting a dozen of stout when he will have to pay 4d. or 5d. more for it? Is it going to do any good to a man who gets a bottle of stout with another halfpenny added on to the price? There is no protection from the Government, nor is there any reduction in duty.  We would all agree with the Minister for Justice if he said: &ldquo;I am getting £5 a barrel out of this much-abused stout, and it is nearly time that <Col N="909" /> I reduced it to £3.&rdquo;  The consumer would then get his pint of porter cheaper.  That would be a step in the right direction, although the publican will only have the same profit.  You may be sure that the Minister for Justice does not leave it optional to the publican.  He says to him: &ldquo;You have to sell stout 14 bottles to the gallon, but I do not care how much you charge a workingman for it.&rdquo;  There are three or four hundred thousand pounds' worth of bottles going to be smashed if this proposal goes through, and I think it would not be worth the whole of it.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the section, and leave it to the famous Commission which is coming off.  I have been written to by several bottlers throughout the country &mdash;I will not hide that fact&mdash;and they will have to destroy, as I have said, hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of bottles if this section is allowed to stand.  I ask the Minister to withdraw this section, because otherwise he will be doing no good to the consumer or anybody else, but will be doing a considerable amount of harm to the bottlers.</P>

      <P>There is another serious side to this bottling question. I would be glad if the Minister would make it clear to traders in the country that if they give orders now for their Christmas bottling that the bottles will not be confiscated or destroyed in the near future.  The standard bottle is 16 to the gallon, and it is an imperial half-pint measure.  When the Minister for Finance in his last budget put a tax on bottles, the bottling companies put on extra pressure and started to accumulate stocks of bottles of 16 to the gallon.  Within the past week, since the announcement about the standardisation of bottles, travellers have been refused orders, with the result that the bottling works will either be stopped or put on short time.  If it is not made clear that any orders given now for bottles of 16 to the gallon will not be interfered with there is a great danger that the bottles now manufactured will be left on the hands of the bottle factories.  I ask the Minister to make <Col N="910" /> it clear that no serious loss will result from orders given now, and that there will be no necessity for bottle works ceasing while waiting for any decision which may be arrived at in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy responsible for the amendment inserted on the Committee Stage, I would like to say that the trouble publicans in the country seem to have got into has arisen out of a very casual, and quite obviously unconsidered statement by the Minister, which he threw out, that possibly 14 to the gallon might be the standard.  That was certainly not taken by any Deputy as a considered figure, and I, for one, am quite satisfied that on consideration the ordinary bottles in use, 16 to the gallon, would be the standardised bottle, in so far as porter or stout is considered.  The reason for the standardisation lies in the fact that a number of people here and there, not by any means a great number, have adopted 14 to the gallon. I think it was stated, whether justifiably or not, by representatives of the licensed trade at a Commission that they were filling 12 to the gallon. Whether that is true or not I cannot say, but it was stated on behalf of the licensed trade in Dublin.  It is necessary, however, to have a standardised bottle for stout.  Obviously the standard bottle will be the one which fits in with the general system of weights and measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one wanted to argue from the point of view of the bottle makers, it is desirable that they should have a standardised bottle for the purposes of their own industry, so that they will not have to provide new fitments for their machines and to break what is called the straight run in the making. I do not think that there is any likelihood of any standard other than 16 being adopted, but it must be borne in mind that the Minister said, and it was generally agreed, and quoted in the newspapers, that there would be no change for twelve months.  That period would be required to enable the present stocks to be exhausted, so that Deputy Byrne's query regarding the <Col N="911" /> present Christmas trade should be set aside at once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I must remind Deputy Johnson that occasionally bottles last for five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, occasionally. The matter, possibly so far as stout is concerned, would be met by a prohibition on the import of other sized bottles or their manufucture.  I think the standardised bottle is made not only for stout, but for other kinds of liquor, and it fits in with the general regulations regarding weights and measures. The temptation to adopt as a form competition variation in the sizes of measures, as of weights, is a temptation which should be removed.  It is a temptation on the one hand to reduce the size of the bottle, and thereby deceive the consumer; on the other hand to increase the size of the bottle by way of offering a larger dose, if I may so call it, to the prospective consumer. I am glad the Minister has made it clear that there is no intention to prescribe the bottle to be outside the size in common use without due notice. Nobody, I think, ever suggested that any such action would be taken by the Minister.</P>
      <P>As regards the suggested variation in the form of the section, it probably is a better form, and I would be quite prepared to advise any person I can influence in the Seanad to agree to it, because I believe it will secure that at some date in the future bottles shall be standardised.  I would call attention to this possible defect in the phraseology of the Minister's proposed draft&mdash;the use of the words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; may suggest the possibility of frequent changes, and that is very undesirable.  Until weights and measures generally are altered I do not think there should be an alteration of the standard size of the bottles, and once the standard is fixed I think it should be understood as fixed for quite a long time, until there is a recasting of the whole system of weights and measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHenrikBeamish" hpid="Mr. BEAMISH Mr. BEAMISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we should have some definite standard in <Col N="912" /> regard to the capacity of bottles.  It is no use for us to talk about bottles in dozens.  We have to take them in hundreds and thousands, and even hundreds of thousands.  The question as to the standard of size is of vital importance.  We have heard it suggested, I think, by Deputy Johnson, that there should be fourteen bottles to the gallon, and if that is so we should have a period of years in which to make the change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest fourteen bottles to the gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHenrikBeamish" hpid="Mr. BEAMISH Mr. BEAMISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it was under discussion and I think Deputy Johnson spoke on the matter.  It was suggested that the period of the change should be left at one year.  I say that one year would be too short.  Those in the trade in a wholesale way have much capital invested, and if there were a change in the standard size of bottles I do believe that five years would scarcely clear out the present standard. I have to deal with very large numbers of bottles and I am giving you, from my own personal experience, what I think is reasonable.  What I am suggesting comes largely because of the experience I have had in the business.  Variation of size is another question.  At the present time the general size of bottles in the country, and bottles in the city, is undoubtedly such that sixteen would go to the gallon.  An alteration from that standard would take over five years to carry out, if a large loss is not to be incurred by those in the trade.  If we fix the standard definitely at sixteen, and if we hold to that standard, then there will not be too small a bottle, and possibly we might be able to tempt Deputy Johnson, regardless of the proposal to have fourteen to the gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHenrikBeamish" hpid="Mr. BEAMISH Mr. BEAMISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that you did.  Possibly we might not keep you all the time so temperate as you are.  As I have said, the general standard over the country is sixteen to the gallon; that is the standard that a great number of the bottlers have <Col N="913" /> worked on.  If that standard is altered, it would mean a very serious loss in capital.  It would mean a lot of money being lost if those in the trade have not time gradually to buy in the standard bottles of fourteen to the gallon, and get rid of their standard bottles of sixteen to the gallon.  If the Dáil does not make some provision in that respect, the bottlers will suffer.  I am sure the Dáil do not want any loss in the bottling trade; I hope not.  It is a very serious matter for bottlers.  If we do not get at least five years it would be a very serious matter, and there would be considerable capital lost.  I know it is a very nice thing to have sixteen bottles to the gallon; but perhaps competition would arise, and one publican might give fourteen bottles to the gallon in order to capture the trade of a rival.  Possibly Deputy Johnson, or any other gentleman, would take the standard of fourteen to the gallon. Naturally that would be so.  It should be stated definitely whether fourteen or sixteen to the gallon is to be selected as the standard.  I know that the fourteen to the gallon would be a better bargain, but in the country at the moment the standard is sixteen.</P>

A very vast capital sum of money is sunk in the present standard, and it would take considerably more than one, two, or three years to substitute the fourteen to the gallon standard for it.</P>

We do not want to encourage that Minister to break up the careful arrangements that our worthy Minister now is making with a view to keeping the country reasonably sober.  On the other hand, there should not be introduced a standard which would mean an unfair loss to the trade and which would be to nobody's benefit.  If we could persuade the Minister for Justice to accept a standard of sixteen to the gallon, the country on the whole would be agreeable to it as a reasonable and fair verdict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much amused at the discussion that has taken place.  I happened to serve on the Commission to which Deputy Johnson refers.  I would like to deal for a few moments with the evidence put before us there.  The evidence given was that before the war the standard was twelve bottles to the gallon.  Counsel appeared for the licensed trade and presented certain figures of a very unsatisfactory character to show what the profits made before the war and at the present time were.  I asked Counsel what number of bottles to the gallon his figures were based upon, and he said fourteen.  I pressed very hard, pointing out that the standard was sixteen and not fourteen, and the licensed vintners present prompted him to insist that the standard was fourteen. I pointed out that as far as the figures were concerned, if sixteen bottles, as I maintained, were the standard, then out of the 32 gallon barrel they were getting 64 bottles more than they were claiming, and they had an extra profit of £2 2s. 8d. on the barrel.  What became of the twelve to the gallon <Col N="915" /> bottles and the fourteen to the gallon bottles?  The point I put to Counsel at the Commission, when he was very uncertain as to the size of the bottle, was: &ldquo;Did he not think it right that the public should know the quantity of stout they were paying for?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One of the very few recommendations made by the Commission was for the standardisation of bottles; that was made on the evidence before us.  I do not care a jack-straw whether the standard is sixteen or fourteen to the gallon, so long as we know what it is. I do maintain that the trade gave evidence that the standard was fourteen to the gallon, and insisted upon it. Deputy Beamish now states that it took years to establish the sixteen to the gallon standard.  I would be sorry if the Minister would weaken with regard to the standardisation of those particular bottles.  I say quite clearly&mdash;and we saw at the Commission&mdash;that it would be impossible to have a standard as far as wine and other bottles of that sort are concerned.  I hope the Minister will keep in mind what I have stated now in regard to the evidence at the Commission.  What was stated there in evidence was what the trade considered they were taking credit for in the returns they made with regard to profits.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Daly that this clause should be deleted altogether, because I do not think that in practice it will be found possible to carry it out.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Johnson was rather sprung on the Dáil on the Committee Stage.  Very few of us knew anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now said that he is prepared to alter the clause in order that the power will be permissive rather than mandatory. Well, that certainly is an improvement in the right direction.  At the same time, the Minister has not indicated what standard size of bottle it is proposed to put in force.  There has been <Col N="916" /> a good deal of discussion as to whether the standard size should be fourteen to the gallon or sixteen to the gallon. Personally I agree with Deputy Johnson, that if it is a question of adopting a standard, it should be Imperial measure, and it should be sixteen to the gallon.  In other words, the bottle should contain a half-pint.  But under the clause, as amended now by the Minister, the Minister may establish either a standard of twelve, fourteen, or sixteen, or anything else he likes, to the gallon.  As a businessman, I certainly object to too much Government interference with business.  We all know what Government interference means.  If the Minister definitely states that he is going to put in force sixteen bottles to the gallon, then we know precisely where we are.  But if he takes power to prescribe whatever size of bottle he wishes, then we do not know where we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great many practical difficulties in connection with the operation of this section, which may not appeal to the general body of the Dáil. Take the case of a wholesale bottler. He may have forty vans going all over the country, delivering stout and beer. His men may have to take back any empty bottles they get in return. These bottles are brought into his bottling store, filled, and distributed again by him.  Now it seems rather severe that if one single bottle were taken by the Gárda Síochána, and found not to conform to the regulations of the Minister, that that would be sufficient cause for a prosecution and a fine of £5, and in the case of a second conviction, £10.  As Deputy Beamish pointed out, there is a very considerable amount of capital involved in the bottling trade.  I would hesitate to put a figure upon it.  But it would run into a considerable sum of money&mdash;considerably over a million pounds, speaking offhand. Undoubtedly, if the Minister is going to prescribe any standard size, he will certainly, in reason and justice, have to give a considerable time for the operation of the clause.  Furthermore, it is going to give him a great deal of bother in other respects.  It will be necessary for him to set up <Col N="917" /> machinery to examine every single consignment of bottles coming into the country, in order to see that they conform to the standard.  Those are some of the considerations I would like that the Minister would give his attention to, before he decides that the clause is to stand as it is.  On the other hand, if he definitely puts before the Dáil that he proposes to establish the standard at 16 bottles to the gallon, I do not think that the trade as a whole would have any tolerable objection to that, provided that they would be compensated for the large quantities of bottles that would have to be destroyed, and that sufficient time would be given to them in order to make their preparations.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes.  I would like to ask a question as to whether this proposal will include whiskey and wine bottles, and Baby Power bottles?  If it does, it will be, of course, a great inconvenience to a lot of people.  Now, in a country town it may happen that one might send for a drink and get it in a bottle that would not be the suitable size for the drink required.  For instance, if you sent for a naggin of whiskey, they might not have a naggin bottle.  Would this proposal mean that all these bottles would have to be destroyed, in favour of a special standard?  If a publican is caught putting a glass of whiskey into a mineral water bottle by the Gárda Síochána, will he be liable to a prosecution?</P>

It is that he may be doing a great hardship to a considerable proportion of men all over the country, and to traders generally here in the City of Dublin, where you have a bottle-making concern, if he does not specify here and now, the size of the bottle that he is going to prescribe.  It will be a source of inconvenience to traders and the public generally, if they are kept in a state of uncertainty as to what the size of the bottles will be.  I think it would be better for the Minister if he dropped this section, or to state now that he will prescribe sixteen to the gallon, thus fixing the number at what <Col N="918" /> everybody will be satisfied with.  If that is done, it will ease the situation, and the trade and the public will be satisfied.  I think the Minister should amend the draft he has, and state that the standard bottle for beer and stout shall be sixteen to the gallon.</P>

      <P>When this matter was on in Committee, we took exception to the method.  We believe that the public are hood-winked with regard to the value they are getting for their money. It has now been proved by the statement of Deputy Sir James Craig, which was not contradicted, that at the recent Commission on Prices an attempt was even made to hoodwink the Commission, and that it was, in fact, hood-winked. I do not know whether it was a Commission on oath or not.  That Commission was hoodwinked, just as the public had been hoodwinked by the trade all those years.  This standard bottle of sixteen to the gallon is sold at eight pence.  It contains an Imperial half-pint, and that works out at 1/4 per pint.</P>
      <P>I think that in respect of these bottles of stout, or whatever is sold, they should have displayed in their windows that the bottles were sixteen to the gallon or whatever amount they will now contain, and so let the public know what they are getting.  Deputy Beamish referred to the grandmotherly efforts of the trade in introducing sixteen bottles to the gallon.  It was an effort, I think he said, to keep the country sober.  It is a very laudable ambition and a very laudable effort on the part of the Deputy and the people in the trade.  Incidentally, when you come to look at the thing from the other end you will find that this effort to keep the people sober incidentally guaranteed bigger profits, at the rate of something about £2 2s. 8d. per barrel, as Deputy Craig pointed out. So this effort to keep the country sober meant very, very swollen profits for the people in the trade, including Deputy Beamish.</P>

I think the grievous sin the Minister is committing against the trade is, as Deputy Egan pointed out, that bottles to the value of £1,000,000 will have to be destroyed.  Deputy Sir James Craig pointed out that he attended a meeting&mdash;I believe it was of a food committee to provide food for the poor, and it included stout as food, and that food is taxed to the hilt.  I would like to impress on the Minister for Justice that he should do justice to the people in the trade and not confiscate <Col N="920" /> £1,000,000 worth of bottles by one stroke of the pen.  I would ask him to delay the proposal until other times would do justice to his character.</P>

      <P>There seems to be substantial agreement as to the desirability of a standard.  Without going into the question of what the standard should be, what is proposed is that power be given to fix a standard size of bottle.  I have said that if such power is given I would consider it the duty of my Department, and my own duty, to consider very carefully all the reactions of the fixing of any particular standard in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Quite casually, in a discussion on this matter in Committee, and quite tentatively, I made some mention of a standard of fourteen to the gallon.  I have already explained that I was not committing myself to any particular figure.  Since then I have received substantial evidence that a very different standard would be more suitable.  But I cannot here, when the question is whether or not power should be given at all, commit myself to the fixing of a particular standard.  That was what Deputy Egan seemed to expect.  First of all, no power has been given.  It is simply a proposal that power be given. Deputy Egan invites me to say straight off what the standard would be that would be fixed in the event of the power being given.  It would show a poor appreciation of the responsibility of fixing the standard if it were to be fixed simply hastily in the course of discussion here.  Up to date, and from the facts before me, I incline to the view that the most suitable standard to fix is sixteen to the gallon half-pint standard bottles, at present in use, probably to the extent of 90 per cent. throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be drawn into the question of price, except that, probably, when a standard bottle is in use throughout the country it will be easier to arrive at a uniform price throughout the country.  People calling for a reduction of price will not be met with the plea: &ldquo;Oh, how can we sell fourteen to the gallon; we <Col N="921" /> sell twelve.  The man down the road sells sixteen.  Get him to reduce it.&rdquo; If you have uniform standard bottles, the question of price can be looked at in the uniform way, and people will know exactly what the profits are and what the profits are not; you are discussing something that can be known, that can be ascertained and got to grips with.  At the moment, I seem to be simply forcing an open door.  There is agreement that there ought to be a standard.  Someone should have the responsibility of fixing that standard. It is proposed in the Bill to give it to the Minister for Justice, and if it is thought necessary, it can be inserted in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

I think there is general agreement as to the desirability of the thing. There was, not unnaturally, apprehension, as to its immediate reactions.  I hope I have allayed any fears or any doubts that arose on that.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>(1)  On and after the appointed day it shall not be lawful for any <Col N="923" /> person to keep or have in his possession any bull to which this Act applies save in so far as such keeping or possession is authorised by a licence or permit granted to such person under this Act and for the time being in force.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every person who shall keep or have in his possession any bull to which this Act applies in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds.</P>
    <P>(3)  In any prosecution for an offence under this section the burden of proof that a licence or permit has been granted under this Act in respect of the bull and was in force shall lie on the person prosecuted and unless and until the contrary is proved it shall be presumed that no such licence or permit had been granted or that if such licence or permit had been granted it was no longer in force on the day on which the offence was alleged to have been committed.</P>
    <P>(4)  For the purpose of a prosecution for an offence under this section a bull shall be deemed to be kept by and to be in the possession of each and every of the following persons, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the owner of the bull, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the owner of the lands or premises on which the bull was when the offence was alleged to have been committed, and</P>

      <P>I wish to propose the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;In Sub-section (2), line 20, to delete the word &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;ten.&rdquo;  I need not amplify the idea.  The idea is that the penalty is too high.  I think the same thing prevails throughout the Bill. The penalties have been made very high.  We, on these benches, think there is no necessity for such a high penalty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.K. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the <Col N="924" /> amendment on the ground that these heavy penalties in the Bill will defeat the object that the Minister has in view.  He will get up the backs of the dairy farmers without whose co-operation it will be impossible to get the full effect of the Bill.  I think the Minister ought to bear in mind that the dairy farmer in the country views with great uneasiness the penalties to be imposed under this Bill in connection with his business, which certainly ought not to be made more uninviting than it is at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I also desire to be associated with the amendment. I think that the principle involved in the Bill is to deter people from keeping bad bulls rather than to show a spirit of vindictiveness.  I think that a permissive fine of up to £20 is too high.  £10 meets the case fairly well. I know it will be argued that this fine is permissive, that the District Justice need only impose a shilling, but at the present time many of these District Justices are more or less martinets. They have got into the habit of imposing rather severe fines.  I think then, the Dáil at the outset, ought to limit their powers of fining to £10, which in the circumstances is a pretty stiff fine.  For every day a person keeps a bull without a licence the maximum fine can be imposed.  Under all the circumstances I think a fine of £10 meets the case adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the amendment for this reason.  There has been a necessity in the country for this Bill for a great many years, and this Dáil approves of the Bill.  If you are going to make the Bill effective you have to take steps to see that all to whom it applies comply with the regulations. We are aware of steps that have been taken to enforce the law in certain matters in this country, and we are aware that numbers of people evaded the law because they found that it paid them better to evade it, the fine being so small.  That applies to several cases that I have knowledge of, and that other Deputies in this Dáil have knowledge of.  They were fined a nominal 30/-, and in one case I know of they saved about £8 or £10 in wages. <Col N="925" /> In other cases they may be selling stuff that is wrong and the profit was treble the amount of the fine.  I say there is a necessity for this Bill, and I think the Dáil and the Department of Agriculture ought to make it clear that they are determined to enforce it. I believe the Bill will not be put into force until the country is ready for it. The appointed day is a matter that I think the Minister for Agriculture and his Department will consider very carefully and I am quite certain they are not going to make the appointed day next March, before the farmers of the country are ready for it.  They will not be ready for such a Bill next March. There is very little possibility that anyone will be fined the maximum fine. The odds are that it is the minimum fine that will be imposed.  Those who will be dealing with offences will consider the merits of the case and they will have the option as to what fine they are to impose.  Where it may be a hardship to impose such a fine as £20 they will impose perhaps a fine of £2 or £3.  But there are certain people who will be determined to make this law valueless.  It is for those people that the £20 fine is intended.  The farmers generally will recognise that it is to their own interest to comply with the regulations.  I feel certain that the Department will not use their power in an arbitrary way.  I would much prefer to let the maximum penalty stand and let the District Justices use their discretion, taking each case on its merits.  There will be very few who will deserve the maximum penalty and what Deputy Connor Hogan wants will be really carried out.  In nine cases out of ten it will be the minimum fine that will be inflicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister not to be influenced by some of the arguments put forward.  We say that a minimum of £10 ought to be sufficient to meet any offence that is likely to occur.  It is not a case where an offence against the regulation will mean huge profits.  The profits that Deputy D'Alton referred to will not apply in this case.  In the case of the beast that the Bill claims to get rid of, the profits may be put down as nil.  As a matter <Col N="926" /> of fact, £20 which is put down as a maximum penalty might be the value of two of these bulls.  £10, perhaps, would be the value of the offending beast.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Hogan says, you want the co-operation of the people of the country.  It is the people of the country that matter.  You want the enthusiasm of the people of the country to act as one with the Ministry.  I say that this penalty of £20 is too high as a maximum.  In my opinion, £10 would be sufficient for a maximum.  That penalty would be sufficient to achieve the object aimed at.  I could not conceive an offence sufficiently grave to merit a fine of £20, and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I intend to oppose this amendment strenuously.  I ask Deputy P.K.

      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to Section 4 of this Bill, under which the Minister may revoke the licence held by the owner of any such animal as he alludes to.  If the Minister takes power, as he does, to revoke the licence held by the owner of such an animal, why is there any necessity for him to argue that a fine ought to be imposed on the owner of that animal?  If a man keeps such an animal, then the thing for the Minister to do is to revoke the licence.  It will be sufficient penalty on the owner of the animal to have the licence revoked.</P>

      <P>I would like an answer to the question I put to Deputy Hogan, of Limerick, and Deputy Gorey.  I would like to have an answer to that question for the benefit of farmers.  Deputy Hogan stated that <Col N="927" /> farmers generally will object very strenuously to the penalty of £20.  The section reads: &ldquo;Every person who shall keep or have in his possession any bull to which this Act....&rdquo;  That applies not only to the man who keeps a bull for the use of his own herd, but also to the man who keeps a bull for the use of the herds in the neighbourhood.  The question I asked, and to which, so far, I have received no answer, is this: If a man is found for the third time keeping a bull which is spreading contagious abortion in the district, does Deputy Hogan of Limerick think that £20 is too big a fine to inflict on such a man, or does he think that the owner of the animal ought to be put in jail?  Does he imagine that the dairy farmers of Limerick will think that a fine of £20 is too big&mdash; these men who realise what contagious abortion getting into a herd means?</P>

      <P>You can have it any way you like.  The third time in one season, or the third time in different seasons. Does Deputy Baxter think that in the case of a man who has been keeping, without a licence, a bull that is spreading contagious abortion in the district, it would be a sufficient penalty to revoke the licence of such a man and say to him: &ldquo;You are not to do that again&rdquo;?  Would that be fair to the farmers of Cavan?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quoting an impossible case, to begin with. I think that if the Act is administered properly, the obvious thing for the administrator to do in a case like that would be to revoke the licence.  I do not think it possible that an individual, after paying a fine of £10, and after having his licence revoked, could be induced to invest in another such animal.  You will not get any sensible farmer to do that.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask the Minister if he thinks it likely that a man who has been fined the maximum <Col N="928" /> penalty of, say, £10, is going to commit a third offence.  My objection is to the principle of these high penalties which the Minister has always shown a tendency to impose in his Bills.  This Bill will not be received with open arms by a lot of people in the country, but we want to coax the people to take it and work it.  I think it is by acquiring the goodwill of the people rather than by making an example of one man by imposing a fine of £20 that we can make this Bill acceptable.  I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments regarding his proposed maximum penalty of £20.</P>

The Minister must forget the provision of Section 12 of his own Bill, which orders the slaughtering of such an animal.  Does the Minister propose to have the animal left alive until a third offence has been committed or suggest that such a bull should not come under the operations of Section 12 and not be destroyed?</P>

      <P>Deputy P.K. Hogan equally knows that it is quite possible for a person who wished to evade the Bill to keep a bull and allow that bull serve cows, not having intimated to the Department that he was keeping a bull suffering from contagious abortion. The harm would have been done and would have gone through 3 or 4, 6 or 7 or perhaps 20 herds in the district. I am talking of the possibility of keeping a bull suffering from contagious abortion without the owner intimating that he was keeping such a bull and it is quite possible that before the Civic Guard or somebody else would have discovered that the bull was suffering from this disease he would have served 20 or 30 cows and introduced abortion into the herds. Deputy Heffernan seems to think that it would be a mild offence if it only happened twice.  I ask Deputy Heffernan&mdash;I have asked two questions already and both of them have been evaded, because possibly Deputies know what the farmers would think of them if they answered in the negative&mdash;if a man deliberately keeps without licence a bull that spreads contagious abortion is a penalty of £20 too much?</P>

There is no owner of a bull who is not well known to the Gárda, and no man could keep such an animal without its being known.  If this measure is properly administered, there will be no possibility of a case such as the Minister indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very innocent. The suggestion is that it is impossible for anyone in Ireland to keep a bull for a limited period without a licence.  Then, if it is impossible for any man to keep a bull without a licence, why this amendment?  This amendment is to delete the figures £20 and to substitute therefor £10.  Surely if Deputy Baxter's contention is correct, the proper amendment would be to delete the section.  There is no use for it.  It is quite impossible that anyone could keep a bull without a licence. If that is so, why this argument between £10 and £20?  Deputy Heffernan speaks of an average case; the penalty of £20 is not for an average case.  It is a maximum penalty for a few unique cases.  I am now meeting the direct point at issue whether the maximum penalty should be put so high.  I <Col N="931" /> thought everybody knew the possibility of a man keeping a bull without a licence and spreading contagious disease.</P>

I have known of cases&mdash;and I have an <Col N="932" /> intimate knowledge of the district for which I speak for the past forty years, and an altogether greater knowledge than some people who have not lived in the country for forty months&mdash;where these animals have been disinfected.  I know where one cow was brought to an animal from another herd.  This cow had aborted and the bull took the disease and spread it.  It was passed from herd to herd in four or five herds, and two dairy farms in my own district had to give up business altogether because the cattle were not disinfected. I am speaking of what I know and not merely of what I heard.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any prosecution for an offence under this section the burden of proof that a licence or permit has been granted under this Act in respect of the bull and was in force, shall lie with the Department for Lands and Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> As the Bill stands, the burden of proof is thrown altogether on the owner of the bull.  I should say that when this Bill comes into working order and when the machinery is set up, it will be necessary for the Department to keep a register, and I should say that on that register they will have the names of the owners of every bull, and a record of the identification marks of every bull, and I think that in a prosecution the onus of proof should rest rather on the Department of Agriculture than on the farmer.  The Department will have experts who will keep records, and they will have evidence for the purpose.  The farmer might possibly lose his licence or the record in connection with the bull, and I think the natural thing should be that the Department should have the onus thrown upon them of proving the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept this amendment, and I will explain why.  I think it is well established as a general principle that where the subject matter of a party's allegation, whether affirmative or negative, is peculiarly within the knowledge of his opponent, it lies upon the latter to rebut such an allegation.  I depend upon that well-founded general principle. It is nothing new; the same principle has been adopted in other Acts of Parliament.  Of course the Department will have to keep a register&mdash;that is certain&mdash;a register showing the names and addresses of everybody to whom they issue licences, and the sort of bulls for which they get the licences.  In addition they will mark the bull; they will tattoo his ear with a special number. But it is quite conceivable that a man would have a red bull, or a roan bull, licensed this year.  Something might happen that bull and he would buy another red or roan bull.  The officer of the Department of Agriculture would be morally certain that it was not the same bull, would have absolute information completely convincing him that it was not the same bull, but he would not have the kind of information that would be admissable as evidence in a court of law.  That could <Col N="934" /> quite conceivably happen.  It is no hardship in such a case to put the onus on the defendant to go into the witness box and simply swear that it is the same bull.  If we did not do that, if we had not such a provision as this, the Inspector of the Department of Agriculture would go to the court and all he could say, when all is said and done, even if he was absolutely certain that it was not the same bull, is that he thought it was not the same bull, which is not evidence.  If the owner knows that it is the same bull and is prepared to swear it, that finishes the matter.  I do not say that that would cover every case, but at least it puts the onus on the owner of going into the witness-box and swearing that it is the bull.  Otherwise the position would be impossible.  There would be a good many roan bulls followed by other roan bulls, red bulls followed by other red bulls, and the licence for the first bull would be used for the second.  The officer of the Department, in a great many cases would be, perhaps, absolutely certain and have confidential information that it was not the same bull, but after all that is not evidence, and he could not swear it.  It is not asking too much of the owner to go into the witness box, pull out his licence and say: &ldquo;That is the licence of the bull that is the subject of this prosecution,&rdquo; and that finishes it.  It is not a question of asking the farmer to keep a register; we are asking him to keep a licence, which is his authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Department licences the bull they give a licence to the owner of the bull.  He has that licence in his possession; if he loses it he can get another in respect of the same bull. All that he has to do is to go into the witness box, produce the licence, and say that that licence belongs to that bull.  The onus is on the Department to prove it, but in order to put the matter in form, in order to avoid an obvious irregularity of that sort, it would be necessary to put the onus on the defendant, the farmer, to produce his licence and to say that that is the licence held in respect of the bull which is the subject of the prosecution.  What harm does it do the farmer?  It does <Col N="935" /> not force him to keep books; it forces him to keep nothing except the little slip of paper which is the licence he gets.  If farmers generally agree that this Bill has been sought for a great many years when voluntary methods have failed; if they agree also&mdash;and I took some trouble to give figures on the Second Reading in connection with this Bill&mdash;that the possibilities of profit to the farmers are so immense, why should they oppose such a simple regulation as this, that will make it easier for the Department of Agriculture to administer the Bill, and that will not cause the slightest hardship on any farmer who will not be trying to evade the Act?</P>

      <P>I should like to know the authority from which the Minister quoted, because I think the opinion expressed was rather unique. It was a rather solitary voice altogether, for it is in conflict with all established principles of law.  After all, although such an offence is not a criminal one, it is what you might call a misdemeanour, and I contend that the principle that prevails in criminal prosecutions should prevail here also.  In criminal prosecutions the onus of proof is thrown on the prosecution&mdash;proof of the crime or offence&mdash;and I fail to see why there should be a difference in this case, because there is a common principle between the two.  The Minister put up another hypothetical case, that it would not be easy for the Inspectors to identify a bull.  Is it not a wellknown fact that when the Department registers, for instance, cows on the Dairy Register, they put an identification mark as well on the beast?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see, from some little experience I have had, that this amendment would be impossible.  First of all, it would entail the Department of Agriculture keeping on more officials than should be necessary.  It would mean a photographic staff and several other things.  Certain matters have come under my notice in my own county in connection with the question of premiums.  These may be within the knowledge of some other Deputies.  A <Col N="937" /> premium bull died in the possession of a certain individual, who substituted another bull and continued drawing the premium.  If this bull had not been of a distinctly different colour from the previous bull, he would have been able to carry on the fraud.  This is what this class of individual would do, and it would be absolutely impossible to expect the Department to get all the proof.  I appeal to the Deputy who put the amendment to withdraw it because I happen to know there is this class of individual, perhaps, to be faced.  There is certainly one of them which I mentioned where this fraud was sought to be perpetrated, and it was only found out when it had been six or eight months practised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is wrongly drawn and the fault is mine.  In putting this amendment, I was not so certain about the effect of it myself and I must say I have been rather convinced by the Minister.  The only thing I would say is that I am not convinced by this argument in regard to the tattooing.  I would say that might be got over by making it a penal offence to keep a tattoo mark which ought to be rightly kept by the Department of Agriculture.  I think if the suggestion is thrown out that the tattoo marks used by cow-testing associations can be copied it is a very serious thing, and I hope if they are copied it will be made a penal offence.  Apart from that, in view of the statements made by Deputy Gorey and the Minister, I am willing to withdraw this amendment.  I ask permission of the Dáil to withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell me how this amendment is going to be put in force?  I am, of course, speaking subject to correction from the legal gentlemen on the Government benches, but is it not a fact that the simple oath of an owner of a bull would not in law be sufficient proof?  If a calf comes into the world the farmer will have to collect a witness to prove that it was born on such and such a date.  That is a rather fantastic proposition.  I should be glad to be corrected if I am wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the position. There is no way out of it, and no officer of the Department can contradict him. No one can say what the age is until eighteen months, when he generally gets his first incisors.  We are at the mercy of the owner of the bull as regards the age, but we want him to go into the witness-box and swear on oath as to the age.  It would be open to the Department to summon such a man's herd and ask him questions as to the age of the bull, and we might be able to prove that the owner was not stating facts.  We must, at least, put him on his proof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>But will his own statement in the witness-box be accepted as sufficient proof?  I think it would be desirable to amend this on the Report Stage and to make the position clear, because I think the oath of a party directly concerned is not considered sufficient proof.  I do not want to have a farmer, when a cow is about to calve, shout upstairs to his wife: &ldquo;Mary, come down and be ready to see what time the calf is born.&rdquo;  That would be a preposterous proposition. Would the Minister consider inserting <Col N="939" /> such words as &ldquo;the statement on oath of the owner of the bull, being present at the birth of the bull,&rdquo; being accepted as sufficient evidence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in the case of a prosecution. Suppose, for instance, an officer of the Department of Agriculture takes proceedings against Deputy Cooper for keeping a bull without a licence.  We all turn up in court.  The bull, let us say, looks like a yearling or, say, nine, ten or fourteen months old&mdash;it all depends on how Deputy Cooper treated him after he was born.  The officer of the Department is not in a position to go into the witness box and say: &ldquo;I examined the bull's teeth and swear that it is fourteen months old,&rdquo; the licensing age being, say, ten or twelve months.  He cannot say that.  The bull's teeth will not show it.  Nobody could tell the age of a bull until about eighteen months after birth.  The owner, of course, could tell, and we want to put the onus on, say, Deputy Cooper, by putting him into the witness box and getting him to swear as to the age.  When a cow is calving we do not want the owner to call down his wife or herd, but we want to put the owner in the witness box and have his oath for the age.  There is a possibility, for instance, that Deputy Cooper's herd would be an honester man than himself and that he would say to us: &ldquo;This bull was born four months ago; I can prove it.&rdquo;  We will put up the herd in that case in the witness box. We want to make it quite clear in cases where the owner only is in a position to give evidence that he shall be coerced to go into the witness box.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain how this amendment can possibly come into operation?  The sub-section refers to any prosecution for an offence under this section.  What would be the position of a bull which has not been licensed?  Will the licence be <Col N="940" /> given to any bull unless the age of the bull has been confirmed and unless the licensee has satisfied himself that the bull is of a certain age?  Once the licence has been granted I cannot imagine that the age of the bull could be questioned.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (1) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On and after the appointed day it shall not be lawful for any person to keep or have in his possession any bull to which this Act applies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That raises the question of what our regulations will be like.  What we intend to do is, to say, when the Act is in operation, that no calf born in spring shall be licensed before the following spring, and that the autumn calf shall not be licensed before the following autumn.  We will issue regulations to that effect.  Supposing these regulations are issued next year, and we hold the spring inspection in 1926 for calves born in the spring of 1925, and suppose after that a calf has been born somewhere in Limerick and it is submitted for inspection but it is not licensed, in that case we prosecute the owner and he says that the calf was born in August and need not be submitted for inspection before the following autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if Deputies think that it would be wise to put into this Bill, and make it a hard and fast rule, that all spring calves should be licensed before the following spring and that all autumn calves should be licensed before the following autumn, we can do so, but I think we should make it elastic.  Experience may prove that we should have three inspections in the year.</P>

      <P>In a case where a farmer has bought a calf, will it be necessary for that man, if prosecuted, to produce the man from whom he bought the calf to prove its age?  There is nothing to prevent a man from buying a calf, as far as I see.  The purchaser is told the calf is a certain age, and if he swears that the age he has been told is the age, will that be sufficient, or will he have to produce the <Col N="942" /> breeder of that calf to prove the age? That may happen with regard to every second calf, because a man will breed more bulls than one, and dispose of them.  Does the section put on the owner the proof of age, if his calves are not in the stud book like Deputy Cooper's calves?</P>

      <P>I think, if it were possible, a return of the number of calves in each district should be supplied to the Gárda Síochána.  That would be very useful.  The calving season is principally from February to May.  If a return of the number of calves kept by a farmer were given to the Gárda, it would be a useful record. You cannot keep a stud book for half-bred cattle, any more than for half-bred horses.  Until you do something of the sort I have suggested, I think the clause as it stands will have to remain.</P>

      <P>In a dairying district.  I had almost mentioned that.  I can foresee certain eventualities, and I can foresee where, in a dairying district, an Aberdeen-Angus would be considered of the highest possible importance.  I say that you should have in the same area a pedigree Dairy Shorthorn bull and, in addition a Cow-testing Association, and that you should have the Aberdeen-Angus and the Dairy Shorthorn bull working more or less in couples.  The best milch cows could be brought for service to the Dairy Shorthorn bull, and the inferior ones could be brought to the Aberdeen-Angus. <Col N="946" /> That would be, perhaps, the most economical solution of some of our agricultural questions.  I will admit you should insist that all the progeny of the Aberdeen-Angus should be fattened and sold.  It would be well to have such a policy that the people could, under the Department, get heifers through the Dairy Shorthorn bull.  I want to find out what is the attitude of the Ministry in this respect. Apart from that, does it not appear to be rather far-fetched that a Minister in Dublin should say what type of bull should be put in a certain locality?  He would be running more or less counter to the experience of men in their own districts, men who, from practical experience, know their own needs.  I think better results would be attained if this clause were deleted.  I am open still to conviction, and if the Minister can explain satisfactorily why the clause should be put in, I am quite agreeable to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (b) in this section is one of the sub-sections that needs considerable explanation.  It cannot get too much publicity.  In its bald form here it means that considerable powers will be given to the Minister, some of which may be necessary. It is necessary to know in what direction those powers are to be employed, and what are the particular types of animal that are to be selected for various districts.  The matter requires very full explanation, and it was mainly for that reason that this amendment was put down.  There is a section in the Bill that will enable breeders to carry out experiments amongst their own herds.  That, I take it, will be distinct from public service.  To the ordinary breeder in the country, this is a matter that requires very elaborate explanation, and I hope the Press will take particular note of the Minister's statement.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  The clause which I have inserted safeguards the right of any person in taking a pure bred bull for his own purpose. I am talking of the service of bulls for cows generally.  As regards the Kerry breed, it has turned out to be a very valuable one, too valuable to allow even a pure-bred shorthorn bull into that district.  Possibly that might be a debatable case.  Anyway, you will agree that you could not allow a Galloway bull to be taken to Limerick, or a Jersey bull either.</P>

We must have power to deal with those cases that are coming up at the moment.  We must have power to prevent a Jersey bull from going to Limerick or to the South for service with Shorthorn cows.  It is quite possible that we would prevent a beef Shorthorn bull going to Cahirciveen, in County Kerry.  I could enumerate those examples at greater length, but I think I have said enough to persuade Deputies that there is a necessity for some control in these matters.</P>

      <P>The suggestion I would make is this: the Minister should change his amendment and take out the word &ldquo;pure-bred.&rdquo;  We acknowledge he is going a great distance in this regard, and, to a certain extent, we will support him.  It is set out that a private owner of a herd cannot get a bull for the use of his own cows unless it is pure-bred.  If the Department's officials object, he <Col N="949" /> cannot have a bull.  The officials are getting a tremendous amount of power under this Bill, perhaps more than the Dáil is justified in giving them.  In any case, I would ask the Minister to consider the deletion of the word &ldquo;pure-bred.&rdquo; That would meet our case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McBRIDE</NameTxt>
      <P>In listening to the Minister one would imagine that the Department was infallible. That is the impression it would leave in the mind of anybody who would not know the Department. Now, if I know anything about the Department of Agriculture, I know they made some of the most awful messes in the country.  It is within the knowledge of most people here that the Department of Agriculture ruined the Connemara pony.  And they did that by doing what the Minister proposes to do now in regard to cattle.  They did not consider that the Connemara stallion was suitable for Connemara and they brought hackney stallions from London.  According to the Department, none of the unfortunate farmers in Connemara knew anything at all about the requirements of their district in the matter of horses. The Department knew it all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, after having ruined the Connemara ponies they started out to ruin the milking qualities of Irish cows. They are trying to do the same thing with the cattle by bringing in Dairy Shorthorns which produce at the best about 600 gallons of milk per annum. Now that I see that the Minister is inclined to accept this amendment of Deputy Duggan's and acknowledge the error of his ways, I would be inclined to accept it also if he would rule out the word &ldquo;exclusive.&rdquo;  The farmers know their own business.  As the Bill stands at the present moment, and as all these sections and sub-sections stand. a clerk here in Dublin can regulate the affairs of any farmer down in the country by saying: &ldquo;This bull is not suitable for this country.&rdquo;  Just as they did in the case of the Connemara ponies, and in the case of the Shorthorns, they are now doing by the introduction of the so-called Dairy Shorthorn which is really more of a beef animal than a dairy animal.  Really, <Col N="950" /> I would ask the Minister to reconsider the business and try and meet the reasonable objection of the farmers, great and small, throughout the country.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most flagrant cases of legislating for what might happen.  It seems to be the object of the Minister to provide for every conceivable contingency that might accrue, and as usual it has been defended by a flock of hypothetical cases.  If the Royal Dublin Society would start a competition for hypothetical cases, the Minister, I am sure, would take the prize as being prolific.

      <P>Very well.  Then the case is made through the Farmers' Party.  I wonder why they put this amendment down.  I believe that these things adjust themselves.  Devon cattle, which are a thoroughly bad and useless breed, are not being brought into the country.  It would be the same as if somebody would start a camel stallion for service at the Curragh in order to produce long-distance racers. I do not think that we should legislate for every contingency, and, if we are going to try to do so, it becomes more urgent and more important to provide some power of appeal from the Minister's decision.  I raised that matter on the Second Reading.  There is no amendment put down giving any appeal whatever from the Minister's decision.  If the old Council of Agriculture were in existence that would be a suitable body.  I dare say the Agricultural Committee of the Royal Dublin Society would not be unsuitable as an Appeal Board.  He <Col N="951" /> might set up an <i>ad hoc</i> body.  At present there is no appeal under this at all.  The only appeal you get is to get a referee down and he says: &ldquo;You are quite wrong.  This is not an Aberdeen-Angus; it is a Shorthorn.&rdquo; So that unless the Minister will indicate some intention to give an effective and useful appeal from his arbitrary decision, or the arbitrary decision of any of his successors, I would recommend Deputy Connor Hogan, on the Report Stage, to press this to a division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask the Minister to explain a few points. I feel myself rather in the position of Deputy Connor Hogan.  I think that the Dáil and the people of the country are not quite clear on some points in this Bill.  I think there is no objection whatever to a pure-bred bull being sent into a district.  I make that statement because I want the matter gone into clearly here.  There is no objection to a pure-bred bull being sent into any district.  There is no objection perhaps to a pure-bred Hereford <Col N="952" /> bull being sent to the County Limerick or a pure-bred Polled-Angus bull being sent there.  But I understand that the calves bred by these bulls with the usual County Limerick cattle, which are a mixture of Shorthorn with some registered dairy cattle would not be registered; that the progeny of a cross between the pure-bred Herefords and the Polled-Angus would not be registered, whereas on the other hand a cross between a pure-bred Shorthorn and a cow of a milking strain was considered of sufficient merit to be registered. These are the sort of cattle, as Deputy Hogan knows, that are principally through the County Limerick, Tipperary and even Kilkenny and Wexford.  That is the point that some people are worrying their minds about.  The way I read it is that there is no objection whatever to a pure-bred bull being sent to those districts, but the Department after such a consultation as our friend Deputy Wilson suggests, with the farmers in each district who know the needs of their own districts well, and who are members of a Committee of Agriculture and of the Farmers' Societies could easily decide.  I am quite sure that the Department will consult with these men.  The bull that I understand will not be registered will be a bull that is not suitable for a particular district, and, perhaps, not suitable at all, because we know that the second strain of these cattle is deteriorating right away.  A pure-bred Hereford or Polled-Angus would be registered, but I take it that the cross-breds would not be registered, because it has been proved by farmers, who have tried it, that in a year or two the progeny of the cross-breed are a failure, with the exception of the Shorthorn.  I think it would be well if the Minister made that clear to some of us at least.</P>

It says that the Minister may refuse to grant a licence under this Act in respect of any bull which appears to him to be under (a), (b), (c), (d), (e). It is, therefore, optional for the Minister to grant a licence for any bull, even though he may be subject to these defects. <Col N="953" /> I would have thought that if we are going to lay down in this Bill any of the conditions under which the bull should be granted a licence, we should at least have made it obligatory that it should be submitted to certain qualifications at any rate.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;may&rdquo; here should be a &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  In the case, for instance, of a bull that is calculated to beget defective or inferior progeny, or be affected by any contagious or infectious disease, there should be no option at all.  In respect of the amendment and Deputy Bryan Cooper's point regarding the referee, referees are provided for in the Bill, but it does not seem to be provided for that the referee shall have any function with respect to the suitability of a breed or type for a certain district.  The referee is not prevented from dealing with such a matter, but the general phraseology of Section 14 suggests that his business would be rather to consider only the qualities of the bull as a getter of progeny and matters of a veterinary kind.  We are dealing, in this amendment, with matters of general policy, policy with respect to the types of cattle that should be bred in an area.  Is it the intention of the Minister to leave that question to a referee, subject only to his final decision? I think it is important that we should understand what the intentions of the Minister are in that respect, and whether the Bill fulfils that intention.</P>

      <P>In connection with this particular part of the Bill, I would suggest to the Minister the necessity of having an extensive Advisory Committee, inasmuch as the needs of two or three counties would be similar and the needs of another part of the country would be absolutely dissimilar.  I should say that this is one of the things that an Advisory Committee would be very useful for, and the Minister would be very wise to take into consultation representative men from different counties.  An Advisory Committee in connection with this matter would be of the greatest importance.</P>

      <P>There are so many points raised that I hope I will remember them all.  First of all, with regard to Deputy D'Alton's point, it is not intended, of course, to register a crossbred. I think everyone will agree that that would be wrong.  Let us take the section from the beginning: &ldquo;The Minister may refuse to grant a licence under this Act in respect of any bull which appears to him&mdash; (a) to be calculated to beget defective or inferior progeny, or (b) to be of a breed or type unsuitable to the district&rdquo;&mdash; remember now, &ldquo;may,&rdquo; as Deputy Johnson drew attention to&mdash;&ldquo;(c) to be affected by any contagious or infectious disease, or (d) to be affected by any other disease.&rdquo;  We are inserting an amendment: &ldquo;In the case of a pure bred bull the property of one person and used exclusively for the service of cows the property of that person, the Minister shall not refuse to grant a licence under this Act solely on the ground mentioned in paragraph 3 of sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo; That is to say, solely on the ground that it is a breed or type unsuitable for the district.  The section itself leads to discrimination.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and not &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used.  The Minister may grant the licence or refuse a licence.  The amendment we are inserting makes it mandatory on the Minister to grant a licence if the bull is pure bred and suitable for the district.  &ldquo;The Minister shall not refuse to grant a licence&rdquo; because of (b).</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is mandatory so far as (b) is concerned.  I do not say it goes very far.  Deputy Heffernan suggested that he would be quite satisfied if we took out the adjective &ldquo;pure bred&rdquo; and left in &ldquo;bull.&rdquo;  Just think what that would mean.  Look at the large number of farmers in Ireland who keep bulls exclusively for their own cows, dairy bulls out of registered cows and <Col N="955" /> by, perhaps, pedigree bulls.  All these people would be keeping bulls and they would be supposed to be for their own cows, pure and simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you mean to say you will exclude a bull bred from a registered dairy cow which is a pure bred bull?  Is that the implication of what you said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have said the contrary about ten times.  I say that a lot of people in the country keep their own bulls.  They keep no pedigree bulls, but bulls out of registered cows, exclusively for their own cows.  If you did not insert the word &ldquo;pure-bred&rdquo; there it would mean that anybody who wanted to obey the Act could simply say he was keeping this half-bred bull for his own cows, and he could use the bull for the service of the whole country, and no matter how bad-looking or how wrong that bull was as regards shape, we would have to agree.</P>

      <P>People could say we are keeping those bulls for our own cows and they could evade the whole Act. I take it that Deputies will agree that it would be wrong to allow shorthorn bulls in the breeding districts of Kerry. The Department of Agriculture, for a great many years, have been developing the Kerry cow, which is a very valuable cow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister think it would be wrong to introduce a Polled Angus that was of a good quality into Tipperary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is altogether another <Col N="956" /> question.  I am trying to give an example of the effects of the Deputy's amendment.  It would be wrong for the Department of Agriculture to allow a Shorthorn bull to be kept in the breeding districts of Kerry.  For a great many years the Department of Agriculture has succeeded in developing the Kerry cow, and has made a very valuable cow of her, a cow giving over a thousand gallons of milk a year and very easily fed, an ideal cow for certain parts of this country and an ideal cow for certain parts of other countries.  It is not at all impossible that there is going to be a big demand from other countries, where the conditions are suitable for Kerry cows, to restock their lands with these cows. You have that breed of cow now all over Kerry as a result of the very good Kerry bulls.  The ordinary farmer owns that Kerry cow.  It is not the big pedigree breeder, but the ordinary farmer.  The Kerry cow has been improved by the bulls put in by the Department. There is the nucleus of a very valuable stock that is spreading into other districts in Ireland and which possibly will provide cows for other countries, where conditions are such that you require a cow of that type which is easily fed and is a good milker and so on.  Surely it would be wrong at this stage to allow a Shorthorn bull down there.  A cross between a Shorthorn and a Kerry is not very much good, for beef or anything else. It would be wrong.  That is what I want to avoid.  If we do not have some such provision as Section (b) we cannot avoid it.  On the other hand, if we take out the word &ldquo;pure-bred,&rdquo; anyone could say &ldquo;I want this bull for my own cows.&rdquo;  It would be impossible for any inspection, no matter how rigid, no matter how careful, to prevent the bull serving other cows, and that process could go on, and your whole scheme would be rendered useless. Either this Bill is necessary or it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer that the farmers in this country did this work for themselves, through their associations.  That would be more natural.  Any development from the bottom up is much more satisfactory and more likely to suit <Col N="957" /> conditions than development in other directions.  The fact is we are waiting for this Bill for years, and the fact is, the milk producing qualities of our cows have been deteriorating for years. Failing the efforts of the farmers' organisations it was necessary for the State to step in.  The principle of the Bill was welcomed and farmers admitted that it was necessary for the State to step in to do work which Irish farmers should be doing for themselves. Accordingly you cannot blame us for taking the necessary precautions to see that the Bill is made effective.  If the farmers were so enlightened and so up-to-date that they would not take in a wrong sort of bull in, say, Kerry, where a valuable and a special breed of cattle is being developed for a long time, there would be no occasion for this Bill.  There is occasion for the Bill and the fact that there is, means that we must take the necessary steps to administer it, and take responsibility for what we are doing in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In connection with what Deputy MacBride said, the Department of Agriculture put no hackney ponies into Connemara.  Another body, now defunct, did it.  The Department of Agriculture never put any hackney ponies into Connemara.  That is one of the fables that passes as criticism.</P>

      <P>All the talk about the schemes of the Department of Agriculture injuring the quality of our pure-bred cows is so much nonsense, and at this hour of the day how any farmer would have sufficient cheek to say so, is more than I can understand.  I said before, on the Second Reading, that not more than 2 per cent. of the bulls were Department bulls, and that 98 per cent. belonged to the farmers themselves. <Col N="958" /> That statement was challenged by Deputy Gorey.  Has he taken the trouble to look up the figures?</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>We have statistics showing the number of bulls sent out in connection with the County Committees since 1921.  We have also statistics showing the number of bulls in the country for most of that period.  The Deputy is a farmer, and knows, for instance, that within a period of three years the bull population does not change very much.  What I stated on the last occasion was a slight overstatement, and was slightly against myself, that not more than 2 per cent. of the bulls of the country were Department bulls.  Yet, Deputies come along with this helpless point of view at the end of the day and say that it was Department bulls spoiled the cows of the country; while 98 per cent. of the bulls belonging to farmers were operating the whole time.  These very people never took the slightest trouble to concentrate on their own business, to improve their cows in milk yield and beef.  While they admit the possibilities in the situation, measured in money value, is just as I put them, no one has said I overstated the case.  I <Col N="959" /> deliberately made this statement on the Second Reading to give the farmer Deputies a chance of agreeing or disagreeing with me, or of saying that they would co-operate, so that the results would be brought about early.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Advisory Committee I am willing to consider between now and the Report Stage the question of setting up an Advisory Committee in connection with the administration of this Bill, but it must be an Advisory Committee.  It is not going to be an administrative Committee. The Department of Agriculture had to take the responsibility as the farmers did not do it for themselves. If the Department has the responsibility it must have control.  I am quite willing to introduce an amendment, much on the same lines as that introduced in the Dairy Bill, providing for the setting up of an Advisory Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that he would save a great deal of misunderstanding with regard to this section if he would split it up.  As it stands at present all the various factors which would warrant the refusal of a licence are placed on a level.  For instance the Minister may refuse a licence in respect of a bull which is affected by contagious or infectious disease.  That is put on the same level as a bull that would be unsuitable for a district.  I suggest that the Minister would probably make his intentions much more clear if he would say that the Minister shall refuse to grant a licence, or that no licence shall be granted in respect of a bull which appears to be defective, and then retain power, where it seems to him that a breed or type is unsuitable to a district, to refuse to grant a licence for such a bull.  In one case it would be optional and in the other case it would be mandatory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a good suggestion.  Clearly it should be quite plain that the Department of Agriculture would have no power to issue licences in cases where bulls are <Col N="960" /> suffering from infectious disease.  I will consider the necessary change before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister, having considered the figures about 98 per cent. and 2 per cent. of the bulls, kindly give us the date at which the Department of Agriculture was forced by members of the Council of Agriculture to adopt the dairy shorthorn bull? Would the Minister give the name of the founder of the Farmers' Union who actually had for years to force the Department to adopt that?  Will the Minister tell us how many of the 98 per cent. were the direct progeny in the first or second generation of the crook shanked Shorthorn sent out previous to the dairy Shorthorn being accepted by the Department?</P>
      <P>How many premiums were given to dairy Shorthorn bulls seven years ago, how many ten years ago, and how many to-day.  These are figures that would be of more interest than some of the figures the Minister has been licking up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, of which I gave notice this afternoon, bears upon a question which arises out of the recently published decision of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to locate the central national Post <Col N="961" /> Office on a site known familiarly in Dublin as the old G.P.O.  When, some days ago, there appeared in the Dublin Press an account of the Minister's interview with certain representatives of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, we were not aware that the decision then published was anything more than a pious opinion or an expression of the desire of an External Minister.  It is only to-day, on the occasion of my giving notice of this motion, that we have the public announcement that it is the policy of the Government to carry out the plan which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has conceived. The issue that I raise is one of principle, and I venture to claim that it is a very important question of principle.  I am anxious that it should be well understood that there is no personal matter involved, no question of personal dignity or hurt pride, or offended vanity, or any of these things which, to the ordinary observer of disputations of this kind, lend themselves by way of creators of suspicion.  The Dáil will recollect that when the Local Government Bill was first introduced, several Deputies, of whom I was one, pleaded that the question of the national capital was a separate and distinct question of Local Government and should not be dealt with as merely an item in the larger whole.  In answer to our representations, as you will have seen, the City of Dublin and the County of Dublin were specially withdrawn from the operation of the Bill for a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I dwell upon that for a special reason.  Everyone in Dublin is aware that for quite a long time past there was a movement, very active, for the promotion of town planning, as it is called, in the Capital of Ireland.  The body of citizens most closely identified with that movement took the title of the Greater Dublin Reconstruction Movement and numbered amongst them several members of the Seanad and members of this House.  For quite a considerable time sketches and plans indicative of what, in their view, the future city might become, were on view at one period in a portion of the Museum, and for a longer period down near the site of the old G.P.O. Members <Col N="962" /> of that movement were not committed to those schemes of town planning by way of approval.  Not through egotism, but by way of illustration, I might mention that I, in the last Parliament and in the present Parliament, was actively opposed to one item of that scheme&mdash;the location of the Parliament House at Kilmainham&mdash;so that the Vice-President of the movement was at full liberty, in accordance with the policy of the Committee, to advocate other schemes of location.  That Committee went before the Minister for Local Government in or about the same time as we moved in this House to have the question of the city taken out of the application of the projected Local Government Bill.  In reply to that interview, the Minister was good enough to set up a Commission of Inquiry into the whole question.  In the interval this afternoon, I furnished myself, by the courtesy of the Secretary of that Commission, with the Terms of its Reference and the statement that, as Chairman of it, I made on the occasion of its first public sitting.  The Terms of Reference were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To examine the several laws and the practice affecting the administration of local and public utility services, including local representative and local taxation throughout the Capital City of Dublin and the County (including the urban districts) of Dublin, and to recommend such changes as may be desirable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At subsequent public meetings of that Commission, the Town Clerk of Dublin was examined, and only a few days ago the Chief Commissioner of Police tendered very valuable evidence on the question of transit and of traffic.  While that Commission, appointed by the Local Government Minister, was sitting and taking evidence publicly, this decision is taken by another External Minister and announced in the public Press, and, so far as any of us could learn, without consultation with the Minister for Local Government, without consultation with the Commissioner of Police&mdash;the traffic authority at the moment&mdash;and without any reference to any scheme of town planning, but simply, according to his own statement <Col N="963" />&mdash;at least so far as that statement can be relied upon as given in reports&mdash; upon the communications of his own staff.</P>
    <P>Now it is idle to pretend that there is not evidence of serious dislocation exhibited in this occurrence.  What was the policy of the Government a little while ago on this question of the reconstruction of the capital city?  On the 11th June, 1923, the President wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Greater Dublin Reconstruction Movement which, amongst other things, contained these passages:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are many points of difference on some matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No one was committed to this item of the plan or that item of the plan, but merely to support of the view that town-planning and reconstruction of the capital city on a scale worthy of its position as the national capital, should be promoted.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are many points of difference on some matters, but we are, I think, unanimous on one point, that definite well-defined steps should now be taken to mark the development of the city on well-ordered principles and on a sound economic basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask particular attention to this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your first business would be to have expert opinion on the present Dublin and how far it is possible to remedy its defects in conformity with future requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the President's very kindly and very exhilarating encouragement to the members of that movement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your first business would be to have expert opinion on the present Dublin, and how far it is possible to remedy its defects in conformity with future requirements, development or expansion.  Should it be considered that great changes are desirable, efforts should be made to train all further improvements in that direction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not a speech made on the spur of the moment, without due and precise consideration of the exact force of the language used, but a well-considered letter.  And here is an extract <Col N="964" /> from a speech of the Minister for Finance of the following day:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The question of Dublin's development is now more important for the nation than ever it was, and in the interests of the State the Government must have a policy with regard to making Dublin all it ought to be.  I can promise those associated with the Greater Dublin Movement that their proposals will have the most sympathetic consideration. As I have already said, in the preparation of these plans they have done public constructive service of the very best kind.  We are now at a time when this whole question of Town Planning, and development of the city, will need a great deal of care.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the occasion of our first public sitting, I thought it advisable, as Chairman, to make a statement of the course we intended to follow, and of the interpretaion we put upon the very ample Terms of Reference.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We seek the solution of manifold &ldquo;civic problems that are of &ldquo;peculiar complexity.  We bespeak &ldquo;therefore for our arduous work &ldquo;the patience of the public, and we &ldquo;solicit the active, helpful co-opera&ldquo;tion of all our countrymen, who &ldquo;are sensible of the value that must &ldquo;attach to the right issue of our &ldquo;Inquiry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was not willing to give our work any measure of patience, or to give active, helpful co-operation to his fellow-countrymen, sensible of the value that must attach to the right issue of the Inquiry.  Many of us who have to work very hard, as most of the Deputies here are aware, undertook this very arduous task, inspired by the appeal of the President, to give whatever we could give of thought and helpful consideration to make out of the ruins of Dublin a great capital.  No sooner had we instituted this Inquiry than the whole thing is burked&mdash;deliberately burked&mdash;by the isolated and single action of an External Minister without consultation.  We invited the co-operation of the Minister of Works; we asked for evidence in support of our <Col N="965" /> Inquiry.  Our letter was not acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Now, it will be said I am speaking in my capacity as a promoter of the Greater Dublin Movement.  I wish to say, most emphatically, that that is not so.  In the statement, from which I quoted already, I made this announcement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Three of our members&mdash;Deputy &ldquo;Alton, Deputy Byrne and I&mdash;have &ldquo;felt bound to retire from the &ldquo;Greater Dublin Movement to preserve a position of detachment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not making any complaint, though I might, of the way in which we have been flouted, and treated with absolute contempt.  I rather try to take a higher level on the question, and look at it as a matter of principle. When we were in the last Parliament, discussing the Articles of the Constitution, I never lost an opportunity of denouncing this fantastic scheme of External Ministers.  I had a further opportunity, recently, of referring to them as the one blot upon an otherwise excellent Constitution.  Here we have Ministers responsible only to the Dáil, and other Ministers with collective responsibility &mdash; the Executive &mdash; all viewed as the Government.  Yet one of them can take action, and can precipitate by the action he takes, a total change of Government policy in regard to a matter on which the Dáil itself has, by implication at least, expressed an opinion.</P>
    <P>No later than yesterday, the second section of the Local Government Bill was passed in Committee:&mdash;&ldquo;The following portions of this Act&rdquo;&mdash;and then in detail they are specified&mdash;&ldquo;shall not apply to the county or city of Dublin.&rdquo;  Why not?  Because the Dáil was aware&mdash;as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs must have been aware&mdash;that the question of Local Government for the city and county of Dublin was already <i>sub judice;</i> that it was being considered by a Committee, not indeed appointed by the Dáil, but appointed by a Minister, with a membership exclusively confined to members of the Oireachtas. There is no one on this Committee who is not a member either of the Dáil or the Seanad.  Now, observe how ludicrous <Col N="966" /> we must have appeared to any thoughtful man.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I do not mean the members of our Committee of Inquiry, but I mean all those concerned in Parliamentary Government. One External Minister, who is not regarded as an integral element of the Government proper, can take such action, after consultation exclusively with the staff of his own Department, as will bring about a complete change of front on the part of responsible Executive Ministers, and we become aware of that new policy of the Government in this regard only from his utterance as given to a deputation.</P>
    <P>Surely that reduces, if not to a farce, at least to something closely approaching a fiasco, anything in the nature of stability of public confidence in declared policies.  I added to my motion that it was in the interest of maintaining public confidence in the policy of referring matters to commissions of inquiry.  Once it becomes known, I contend, that important matters are referred to a Commission of Inquiry, and while the commission is notoriously engaged in taking evidence preparatory to giving a report, that someone can take a decision regardless of that fact, and have the whole thing <i>res judicata</i>, a decided matter, how much will the public believe in any future Commission of Inquiry that is set up?  At the present moment there is an attitude of suspicion towards Commissions of Inquiry; that is an inheritance from the old régime, because it was a constant practice of the old Government to put off difficult questions by appointing Royal Commissions, and by the time the Royal Commissions had reported everyone had forgotten what the matter in question really was, or some new agitation had taken its place and supplanted it in public interest.</P>
    <P>Here we are solemnly to declare that a Commission of Inquiry, undertaking inquiries of such importance that a clause is specially introduced in a Bill to take note of the fact, may yet be so ineffective that items that are essential to its report having any value whatsoever, can be dealt with in this irresponsible fashion.  It may be asked: Is all this about the placing of <Col N="967" /> the G.P.O?  I know very well what a popular case can be made on the hustings to a mob, especially if they are unfortunate unemployed, in favour of this hasty decision.  It makes work.  Is there no other way to make work that will not spoil the whole town-planning scheme for the capital of Ireland?  Is there no other work on which those men could be profitably employed?  It was testified by the Chief Commissioner of Police, who is the authority on traffic, that traffic will become an insoluble problem if the Central General Post Office is located with one exit in Prince's Street and the other in Henry Street.  He said that this is one of the most congested districts in the whole city, even under present conditions. What would be the conditions of congestion, in view of the regulation recently made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that all telegrams to be delivered within a certain radius of the centre of the city are to be sent out, not as heretofore, but with swift delivery by boys on motor bicycles? You can imagine what traffic control in the main thoroughfare, O'Connell Street, would become with motor bicycles darting across it at right angles at every moment of the day.</P>

I am merely anticipating criticism, to show that it might be said that this is much cry about very little, a tempest in a teacup. But I want to impress upon you, sir, that no matter how specious a case may be made for hurrying the decision, no matter how specious it may be made by pointing out that this great work cannot be delayed until a dilatory committee has reported, after having made up its mind, that the question of principle really is not on the merits of the placing here or there of any of the great buildings of State.  The question is one that would arise, whether or not a plebiscite had been taken and every citizen in the land had voted in <Col N="968" /> favour of the Henry Street site, and this is really what I wish to insist on &mdash;the utter folly of allowing Commissions to set out upon their inquiries while at the same time the intent is there to determine one of the central pivot points of the Committee's decision. I do not want to occupy the time of the House unduly, because I am quite sure that there are other Deputies who wish to speak upon the matter, and I must leave room also for the Minister for Posts to reply.  I, therefore, leave a great deal unsaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to be what you might call keenly interested in this question, but I realise that a very important matter has been raised by Deputy Magennis, a matter which, I think, affects the privileges of the members of the Oireachtas to some degree, if not the privileges, certainly the prestige of the Parliament, as contrasted with the privileges of Ministers. The Committee which was set up was set up by the Minister for Local Government after announcing the fact, and if one may say so, consulting the Dáil.  It was not a Dáil Committee, because it was thought to be even a more important matter than should be dealt with merely by a Dáil Committee, but a Joint Committee of the two Houses set up by the Minister responsible, to report to the Minister.  While one cannot say that it is a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, it was a Committee comprising members of the two Houses, and, therefore, stands much higher in its position in the mind of the community than a mere Departmental Committee, composed of private citizens.</P>
      <P>Deputy Magennis has used this as an illustration to point to the unwisdom of having Extern Ministers.  I do not want to enter into that discussion, but I want to point out that whether Intern or Extern Ministers, whether members of the Executive Council or not, a similar situation might well have arisen if the Minister for Finance had agreed to the expenditure of public moneys for two diametrically opposed propositions of two Ministers, even though they had been members of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the co-ordinating <Col N="969" /> authority&mdash;and this was argued during the Constitution debate&mdash;in respect of expenditure of the Ministries outside the Executive Council was the Minister for Finance.  Here we have a case where the Minister for Finance appears to have agreed to the expenditure of money for a Commission of Inquiry not merely into the administrative affairs of the County and City of Dublin, but matters dealing with the plans for future public utilities, and the same Minister, who should have acted as a co-ordinating authority, has agreed to the expenditure of public moneys on a project which may be admirable, probably is most desirable, but which undoubtedly prejudices the action, and the decision, and the reports of the Committee which the other Ministry has set up with his consent.  In that way it seems to me that the position of a Committee, a Committee of the two Houses, has practically had taken from it, in the middle of its inquiry, a great portion of its Terms of Reference.  It becomes now a Committee to inquire into certain things, <i>minus</i> a certain portion of its original Terms of Reference.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy had good grounds for complaint.  In view of the genesis of this Commission, in view of the fact that the Dáil has agreed to eliminate from a Local Government Bill now under discussion clauses relating to the powers of councils in the City and County of Dublin and having done that because of the existence of this Commission, the Oireachtas as a whole is in that way brought into the story, and I think that the work of that Commission has been prejudiced. There may be a very conclusive answer, but I am inclined to think that either the Commission ought to be allowed to continue to work and to bring in its report, or it ought to be told by the Executive Council that its work is not of any value, and that it should not proceed any further.  That seems to me to be the logical outcome of the events that have happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a side to this question that should not be lost sight of when we are considering the resolution that is being put before us.  The General <Col N="970" /> Post Office was destroyed eight years ago.  As a result of that destruction, commerce is being heavily burdened with additional postal and other charges for the last eight years.  Commercial men have been pressing on this Government for some considerable time past that these burdens should be lightened, that these burdens were having a retarding effect on commerce which was being reflected in the increased amount of unemployment. That is a question that I want Deputies to attach some importance to.  It is all very well to quarrel about these things in settled relative positions when your trade and commerce have gone, but this question has been retarding commerce for a number of years and we as commercial men say that the time has come when the question should be settled.  Therefore when that Committee, which has been referred to, waited on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and heard from him that this question which they had been urging, had been settled and that it was decided to proceed with the re-building of the General Post Office, and the concentration of the services there which would effect a very considerable economy&mdash;these were pointed out by the Minister&mdash;the commercial men who formed that deputation expressed approval of his action on behalf of the commercial community.  I hold no brief for the Minister; I will attack him when in my opinion he deserves to be attacked, just the same as I would any other Minister, but it is only fair to the Minister to say that his Department has been attacked over and over again.  He has been challenged as to why he cannot effect economies in the Department, and now, when he has brought in a scheme by which he can effect economies he is courtmartialled before the Dáil for having done so.</P>

      <P>Call it whatever you like; I want to get down to practical facts.  We want to get the trade of this country on some other lines than it is running at the moment.  We want to improve trade, and until we get rid of some of the burdens that are hampering <Col N="971" /> trade at the moment we will not get trade running in the direction we would like to see it.  The Postal charges we are carrying are 33? per cent. more than our competitors in Northern Ireland and on the other side are carrying.  That is a burden that cannot continue indefinitely.  I say it is unfair to the Minister who, having heard the complaints month by month of those responsible for the commerce of the country, and who took steps as a result of these representations in order to effect economy, to be courtmartialled before this Dáil.  That, to my mind, is not fair.  For eight years that Post Office has lain in ruins. Surely sufficient time has elapsed for those other people to complete their schemes.  If it is to be argued that this question was to be left over indefinitely and that this burden is to be carried indefinitely, it appears to me that by the time these other bodies have reached a decision amongst themselves on these questions the trade of the country will have flown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the point Deputy Good has dealt with, I may say so with every respect, is not entirely relevant to the question immediately before the Dáil.  If I understand the motion aright, and the complaint that Deputy Magennis has raised, they boil down ultimately to two definite questions.  One is that this House has put a certain question under the charge of a Commission and has entrusted that Commission in its own wisdom to come to certain decisions on a number of matters.  Deputy Johnson touched upon that matter, and Deputy Johnson probably knows that the constituency which he has the honour, and I have also the honour to represent, is very vitally affected by the review to be undertaken by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it is in Deputy Johnson's experience, but it is in mine, that many of those who are likely to be affected by the decision to be come to by this Commission have come to me with regard to many of these matters and have proposed certain public actions which, if taken by them, would unquestionably have brought a <Col N="972" /> prejudice into the considerations of the Commission.  My answer in every case has been that the Minister appointed by the Dáil has, in regard to this particular matter, appointed a Commission, and that all these questions, which were proposed to be raised by the parties who came to me and who asked me to join with them in the complaints they wished to make, were <i>sub judice</i> and that it was not for any persons who feared they might be affected to &ldquo;jump their claim.&rdquo;  That was the answer I returned to such persons who came to me, and I do not think it can be said that any of the persons likely to be affected or any of the public bodies likely to be affected have taken any action that might prejudice the conclusions likely to be come to by a Commission of this sort, a Commission appointed by a Minister of this Dáil and approved of by this Dáil.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Dáil, if this body being the High Court of Appeal with its sister chamber, in the Oireachtas of the Free State, has consented to the appointment of a certain Commission, undertaking to do a certain task, and a number of persons feel that they may be prejudiced by the findings of that Commission, and are told not to take any precipitate action lest they might prejudice these findings, that there is not much encouragement likely to be given to these persons to hold their tongue and not to take precipitate action in the future if they find a Minister of the Dáil has taken such action.</P>
    <P>That, I take it, is the point, and not whether the Post Office should be where it is or whether it should not be where it is, not whether rebuilding should begin or should not begin, not what the postal charges are, but merely the ordinary constitutional fact that this assembly has consented to the appointment of a certain body to undertake a certain task, and while it is continuing its deliberations there should be no attempt by anybody to prejudice its conclusions. I can imagine, when these conclusions are come to, that they will receive a great measure of opposition. It may be that a great many who stand clear and say that its deliberations and conclusions should not be prejudiced, <Col N="973" /> may, in the eventual resort, find themselves in violent opposition to its conclusions. That will be the time when such opposition will be constitutional and correct.  I suggest that any attempt to take any decisions now, is not orderly, nor correct, and therefore should not have been consented to by one who holds the responsible position of a Minister of this State.  That is the first point.  There is a second, and it is this.  I take it to be accepted, in the processes of democratic government in every country, that if there is to be expenditure of money in a new direction it is not within the authority or power of any Minister to determine that new direction and then come to the House and say &ldquo;The expenditure has been incurred.  Here is the responsibility, and you have to pay the charge.&rdquo;  I take it that the right method of procedure is that if any Minister contemplates a new direction of policy which implies an expenditure of money&mdash;and it is the correct method in other countries where you have united Cabinet responsibility&mdash;he should come to the Assembly to which he is responsible and ask authority for undertaking a new course of action which implies the expenditure of money.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper has given an exact sum of money.  I have failed to find any sum of money or any authorisation for the expenditure of this money.  If Deputy Johnson has found it, otherwise than the £1,000 for one section of it, I shall be glad to hear it.  Much more so is this responsibility due by the Minister according to the Constitution&mdash;I am <Col N="974" /> not going into the forms of responsibility there&mdash;but I merely say it was decided in the wisdom of the Dáil that there should be outside Ministers responsible directly for policy to the Dáil and not responsible to their colleagues. If that kind of action is required and expected of Ministers in their collective responsibility in the Cabinet, much more is it in the case of a Minister who is responsible directly and immediately to the Dáil.  These are to my mind the two points raised. One involves the privileges and powers of the Dáil through a commission which it set up, and the other involves the powers and privileges of the Dáil directly and in its own proper person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter did not come suddenly out of the blue, and I think it would hardly be accurate to describe the decision as a rushed decision. Ever since I was connected with the Provisional Government, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has been anxious to have the Post Office in O'Connell Street rebuilt.  After the burning of the Rotunda rink the whole question of Post Office accommodation became much more acute.  For the reasons stated by the President, the Executive Council declined for some time to give financial sanction for any Post Office building or rebuilding. About a year ago I had some discussion with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and he represented to me the handicaps that were imposed on his Department by the way in which it was housed, how there was no Central Sorting Office, how all their departments and various branches were scattered over the city, and I came to the conclusion that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was not being fairly treated in having sanction refused for getting proper accommodation for the Post Office.  Some time in December last year, or perhaps in January this year, I gave sanction for the acquisition of the site in Pearse Street which abuts Westland Row railway station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that the plans of the Greater Dublin Committee had been discussed at various times by the Executive Council, particularly the proposal in the plans for the constitution <Col N="975" /> of a new Central Post Office at the site of the Custom House.  That proposal was also discussed with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and with the Post Office people.  It was felt that there was no doubt at all that that proposition was a bad one, that there would be inconvenience in having the Central Sorting Office there, that it was already sufficiently away from the railway station to make it as little advantageous as if it was a great deal further away, that there was no use in waiting for a far-reaching scheme of railway reorganisation being carried out when you might have a terminus up against the Custom House site.  As I say, about December or January last we decided, after a good deal of sympathetic consideration had been given to the plans of the Greater Dublin Association, that we should not agree to have a Central Post Office on the site of the Custom House, and sanction was given for the purchase of a site near Westland Row railway station.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of office and other accommodation for the Post Office.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, from his own point of view, was anxious for the O'Connell Street site.  From the point of view of the Board of Works and the Minister for Finance, we were anxious in many ways for that, too.  There are good sound walls standing there, and we could see that it was possible to get a great deal more office accommodation there for an expenditure of £50,000 than could be got elsewhere.  The site there is very valuable; I think it is valued at something like £250,000.  I do not think the idea of parting with that site, except for cash down, could be entertained, so it was agreed some months ago, before this Commission began to sit, to give sanction to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for the re-building of the front block.  As a matter of fact, I do not think that that would, if we went no further, interfere with the plans of the Greater Dublin Committee.  At any rate, it would not itself involve the traffic difficulties that have been indicated.</P>
    <P>There is sanction for the creation of a big public office there, and there is considerable <Col N="976" /> space for the accommodation of the Postmaster-General's officers. I think it is desirable that these administrative officers should be housed more conveniently than they are, and it is quite proper that they should be housed there.  It is proper, too, that there should be a big public office in some central street, such as O'Connell Street.  I think, in view of the delays imposed on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that it would be unfair to impose any further delays.  There was also certainly in the minds of the Executive Council&mdash;the matter was one of sufficient importance to be brought before the Executive Council&mdash;the idea that they ought to begin to build in O'Connell Street.  All sorts of pressure had been brought on people to build in order to give employment, and we found that blame was being attached to the Government for not building themselves.  As the whole project seemed a good one it was decided to build, but there was no idea of flouting the Committee or of prejudicing its decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so far as I am concerned.  That was certainly not in my mind in any way.  I think nothing has really been done that would prejudice the considerations of the Committee, that is since the Committee was appointed.  The proposal to use the Custom House as a site had actually been turned down a year ago, and action had been taken to put a very important part of the Post Office at Westland Row.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good has told you that the commercial community are practically unanimous on the question of rebuilding the Post Office on the site it previously occupied in O'Connell Street.  That opinion was formed not yesterday or the day before.  It was, I think, pressed upon the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs years ago, and, therefore, I do not think that any grievance could be put forward, as far as the commercial community are concerned, <Col N="977" /> by the action of the Government. Deputy Magennis, in putting forward his motion, took a line not based on the merits of the site, although, I think, if the Commission accepted the wisdom of the site there would not be very much grievance. Deputy Magennis went on to the question that the Government, in coming to this decision with regard to the Post Office, has flouted the Commission on which he has been so conspicuously active, and of which he is the Chairman. I can quite understand that Deputy Magennis should feel sore in a matter of this kind.  On the other hand, I say, with some deliberation, that it is unfortunate that what I might call the sensations should come from the Government side of the Dáil.  I think Deputy Magennis, in bringing forward this motion, in so far as he is actuated by feelings of the importance of constitutional proceedings in the Dáil, and as Deputy Johnson emphasised, the need to elevate the position of Deputies and the Dáil as a whole, might, at the same time, have taken into consideration that it is hardly an opportune time in the history of the country that these repeated sensations should be brought forward in this way in the Dáil.  One could sympathise with the Leader of the Opposition in attacking the Government as regular Parliamentary procedure on a question of this kind, but may I say that this explosive matter, coming from the Government Benches at the present time, will not be accepted, I think, by the country as the most politic proceedings possible.</P>

It is true that this question of re-building the Post Office is not one of to-day or yesterday.

As I understand it, the Post Office is only authorised to spend a pretty limited sum at present.  Any further expenditure on the big issues with which Deputy Magennis has dealt, must come up here at another stage, and if that is so I can only express the opinion that the decision the Post Office has come to is one that will be welcomed generally in Dublin city.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Commission referred to by Deputy Magennis I would like to say a word or two.  I will be brief.  I am not concerned at this stage where the Post Office will be.  We have had an admission from the Minister for Finance that as far back as January, in deliberating on the very important question of providing a Central Post Office in consequence of representations made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, they went so far as to have the suggestions and plans of the Greater Dublin movement before them at the Executive Council meeting.  In view of that admission, and the fact that they considered it in the light of the suggestions put forward by the Greater Dublin movement, we to a great extent might be prompted in our deliberations at the Commission by the <Col N="980" /> same plans, and the least we might have expected from the Government responsible for setting up the Commission was that they should have notified the Commission that they had already agreed to have the Post Office built in O'Connell Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for POSTS and TELEGRAPHS (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend also to be very brief.  In every discussion of importance on the Post Office during the last two years, we have had something to say on the question of a Central Post Office.  The matter was referred to in the Estimates for 1922-23-24, and on each occasion I appealed to the Executive Council to come to a decision in locating this Central Clearing Office. In asking the Executive Council to come to that decision, I gave full justification for my anxiety.  I wonder whether it is known to the Dáil generally that the Post Office, or rather the ruins of the Post Office in O'Connell Street, have been in the possession of my Department throughout?  The British Government, after the destruction in 1916, proceeded to buy up adjacent property and spent something in the region of £100,000 on those extensions. Immediately afterwards steps were taken to produce plans suitable to an extended building.  These plans, with slight variations, are the plans it is now proposed to go ahead with.  There is no use in coming along here and pretending we are dealing with a subject which is quite new.</P>

      <P>This subject has been discussed here time and time again. The proposal to rebuild the Post Office in O'Connell Street is not a subject of to-day or yesterday.  It has entered largely into discussions in the Press, on some of the local public bodies, and in the Dáil.  I think it was generally assumed at the setting up of this Commission that the Government was not averse to going ahead on the O'Connell Street site, even if the Commission was not aware of the decision of the Executive Council at that particular time. Now it is put forward as a grievance that the Executive Council, on the recommendation of the Minister for <Col N="981" /> Posts and Telegraphs, should make a decision of this kind without consulting the Chairman of the Commission. I might also say that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might likewise advance a very substantial grievance at not being consulted in regard to this matter, when the Dublin Reconstruction Commission was being set up.</P>

      <P>When this Reconstruction Commission was being set up by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, if there had been any intention of including the location of the Post Office in its scope, one would imagine the Minister responsible for that Department would have been asked where he stood in regard to such a proposal, or whether in his opinion the Post Office ought to be included or excluded from the scope of the Commission. I was not consulted in any way, and had I been, I would have objected to this matter being placed before a subordinate body after it had been discussed repeatedly here in the Dáil.  I consider it is a matter for the Dáil, because it has been made a matter for the Dáil and not one for a Commission set up by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of time. It is generally known that I have been, and am being, pressed by the commercial community to produce certain results in the administration of my Department. One of these is an improvement in the receipt and despatch of mails and telegrams.  Another is the reduction in postal charges.  Now, in turn, I have made it clear that I cannot do this as long as this subject is pending.  Therefore it did become a matter of urgency, and not one which could be conveniently switched on to a Commission which might report next year, the year after, or at some future date.  At any rate, to suggest that it is a matter that could conveniently be passed to an Inquiry of that kind, without consulting the Minister concerned, would create a position which I am not <Col N="982" /> prepared to accept.  To my mind, it was very clear that the Terms of Reference for this particular Commission did not include the Post Office.  Had I any idea that the contrary was the case, I most certainly would have exerted myself.  The Terms of Reference are vague; they are wide enough to include a great many other activities. I am in sympathy with certain ideas connected with the Greater Dublin Scheme.  The whole Scheme is a big one, but it does not necessarily follow that certain features of local economic life cannot proceed in the interval.</P>
    <P>Quite recently the Government decided that certain of the barracks were to be handed over for artisans' dwellings. That might conveniently also have been held over until this Commission came to a conclusion.  If you spend money on these buildings I suggest also in the same sense you have to cut across the programme of the Greater Dublin Commission.  If one were to take the suggestion of Deputy Magennis to its logical conclusion, the whole life of the City, from the standpoint of possible change, should be held up.  I am not prepared to accept that.  There is no necessity for me to go further into the reasons why we should make headway with this.  But I do suggest that Deputy Magennis, in bringing a question of this kind to the Dáil, ought, in the first instance, to consult his Commission. Now one would imagine that Deputy Magennis was speaking for the Commission here, and this is as a breach of privilege and that this great breach of privilege, has roused the feelings of the Commission&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Have I said so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and that they decided that the matter should be introduced in the Dáil in the form of very strong indignation.  I suggest that the members of the Commission have not had an opportunity of saying whether or not it was a subject for the Dáil, and that is perhaps the first consideration that should be borne in mind in discussing the subject.  I doubt very much if the members of this particular <Col N="983" /> Commission would agree that this proposal should be held up one moment longer, notwithstanding the protestations of Deputy Magennis.  I believe a great many of them see the necessity of going ahead, and were it introduced, it may be very quickly decided on, and not in a direction favourable to the Chairman.  I have no apology to make for my action in this matter.  I asked for the permission of the Executive Council, and urged them to go ahead with this important public work.  I urged them repeatedly to do so. Eventually they agreed to do so, and I proceeded with the work.  There is no question of merely putting up a quarter of the building and stopping there.  That would be a very foolish action on the part of the Government to spend money in that way.  I presume once the Executive Council have given authority for the erection of the Post Office that that authority stands; and further, I think it would be a serious matter.  At this stage I will refer to the question of the employment being given.  It would be a serious matter if we should fail to give the necessary employment to hungry men.  We have seventy or eigthy men employed in our two schemes.  In the month of January we expect to have three or four hundred employed there.  That is a matter of consideration to us.  I know also that those people, who own destroyed areas here in Dublin, point to our failure to make progress in our buildings, and point to the fact that we have given them a bad example, and that we are not giving them a right example; that, apparently, it is a matter of no concern to the Government as to whether these areas are rebuilt.  I think it would be well for this Commission to let the position stand as it is.  Even if they were to go into it, I am pretty well certain that they would agree that the steps we have taken have been justified, that they are based on careful examination, and that it would be a good thing for the trade and commerce and employment in the City to make headway rather than to have this work cut short, as the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>The question that I raised was not the question with which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs concluded his speech.  It is not at all a question of whether employment is to be given now or that it is to be given at a later date.  I raised the question of principle.  Is the Government of this country to be controlled by an external Minister, or are we to follow the Constitution and be governed by the Executive Council?  Is the Dáil to have its authority and its wishes absolutely disregarded because it does not suit the policy or the wishes of an external Minister to act in accordance with it?  The Minister himself has told you, within the last few minutes, that had he been aware that the Local Government Minister had it in view to create this Committee of Inquiry, with its large scope allotted to it in its terms of reference, that he would not have permitted it.  He would not have permitted it!  The Dáil willed it, decreed it, and approved of it, but the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs disapproving, would not allow it.  Is not this a confession of the very thing of which I have complained? Why, the Minister for Finance told us that the Executive Council had before them the plans of the Greater Dublin Reconstruction Movement, and that they had considered, with particular interest and care, its proposal with regard to the locality which was to be assigned in the planning of the Capital City to the central General Post Office.  According to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he was not aware that the localising and the placing of the General Post Office for the nation came within the scope of the Terms of Reference.  He lived in such seclusion in the period of the Tailteann Games that he was not aware what was reported in the ordinary newspapers.  The little fragments that I quoted to-night were from the &ldquo;Freeman&rdquo; report of the 16th July, 1924.  We did not meet in the dark, and we did not keep our proceedings <Col N="985" /> secret, and everyone of the newspapers reported fully the terms of reference, and our interpretation of them.  Only a few days ago our special interpretation of them in the form of questions addressed to the Town Clerk of Dublin and to the Commissioner of Police dwelt especially upon this, that our central problem was to devise the administration, the scheme of the Government for the future capital in its developed form, and in connection therewith to consider the public and other utility services that were to be provided for the capital, and to determine accordingly over what area those services can, in view of the physical effects, be extended and upon what area the charge therefor can be placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is not aware of what is happening around about him, if he is not aware of the proceedings in this Dáil, if he does not know that the Dáil yesterday passed the second section of the Bill, I suppose that is because he is so devoted to the work of his office. I have already stated to you, sir, that our Committee invited evidence from everyone concerned.  Our Secretary wrote to various Departments.  One very notable Department was invited, in the first place, the Office of Public Works, and our application was treated with contemptuous silence.  The Secretary of the Post Office recently, in connection with his Chief, announced that the experts of the Post Office were quite satisfied with the plans for the rebuilding of the Post Office in O'Connell Street.  The whole expert opinion of the Post Office is in favour of the old site.  It is upon expert opinion, precisely as in the case of broadcasting, that the Minister makes his decision. Surely his subordinates ought to have been aware, if he was not, that a Local Government Inquiry is being held and that it claimed to consider transport, and particularly methods of locomotion, as one of the most vital problems affecting the citizens' well-being, and that traffic and transport depended upon town planning, and that no well-thought-out scheme of civic administration for the capital city could be devised if the question of traffic and transport and the placing, consequentially, of the centres of traffic were not <Col N="986" /> included.  It is not a question at all of whether the Minister's plan for making Henry Street more congested, or Prince's Street more congested than ever, is a better plan than the plan of the Dublin Reconstruction Committee. As a Committee we have nothing whatever to do with them.  What is at issue here is, while to the knowledge of everyone, except the recluse and the hermit, a Local Government Inquiry is going on, a Minister has to take a decision and to precipitate a change of policy on the part of the Minister for Finance.  In other words, the whole question is, are we to be governed by this procedure, that one Minister, not a member of the Executive Council, has to come to a decision and thereby precipitate decisions, that are decisions of national policy, on the part of the Executive Council?</P>

      <P>Well, then, the report in the newspaper requires correction if it is not the tenor of his speech.  Neither is it the tenor of his speech on these benches when he speaks with the voice of an autocrat. The master of the Cabinet spoke a few minutes earlier and declared that he would not have permitted it.  He speaks as if I had nothing to concern me only pique&mdash;the Chairman of the Commission that is set at nought, whose operations are brought to a sudden standstill.  He is perfectly right.  I have not had an opportunity, but will on Tuesday, of consulting other members of the Committee.  We were to have sat on Tuesday next to hear important evidence from one of the ablest men in Ireland, the Town Clerk. That will be the first opportunity I shall have of consulting my colleagues. <Col N="987" /> At all events I can form a fairly accurate opinion of what every member's self respect will dictate in the matter. Are we supposed to go on with the same sort of ignorance of the fact of transactions and environment as the Minister can command, and be wholly unaware that the whole centre of the town planning has dropped out, and that what we are to consider is just so much of the future of the capital city <Col N="988" /> as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will permit us to consider?  I think I can form a very accurate forecast of what the decision of my colleagues will be on Tuesday.  Deputy Hewat is surprised that the truth can come from the Government benches.  I realise the envy that he feels that there is a Party in the House in which there is no curb upon free expression of honest criticism.</P>
