      <NameTxt>Major COOPER (for Captain Redmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that previous to the establishment of Saorstát Eireann, income taxpayers in Ireland were entitled to certain relief in respect of a similar tax paid by them in the Dominions; and whether it is intended to continue such, or substitute other, relief as between Saorstát Eireann and the Dominions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a measure of relief from the Income Tax of the late United Kingdom was granted in respect of Income Tax paid in any of the Overseas Dominions on the same source of income.  This relief was granted irrespective of any reciprocal treatment on the part of the Overseas Dominions.  It is obvious that the Saorstát could not continue to grant relief on this basis, and for 1923-24 and subsequent years the Saorstát grants double Income Tax relief in respect of British Income Tax, but not in respect of Dominion or Colonial Income Tax.</P>
      <P>The granting of relief in respect of Dominion Income Tax would involve effecting a reciprocal arrangement with each of the Overseas Dominions separately, and, as at present advised, I do not consider it either necessary or desirable to endeavour to effect such arrangements.</P>

      <P>The matter of dealing with the guns left us by the British at Island Bridge has had very serious and constant consideration from us.  There is a very big mass of weapons there, and the records left us in connection with those weapons are anything but satisfactory.  Every effort is being made to deal with a very intricate and difficult matter.  Personally I feel that a very great mistake has been made in accepting those weapons and those records.</P>

      <P>The message prescribed by the Constitution has been received from the Governor-General recommending this expenditure.  This is the Resolution to enable the expense to be met which will be incurred in carrying out the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds Bill, 1923, if passed.  The amount of two and a quarter millions will be made up somewhat as follows: The Home Loan is £378,130.  The External Loan amounts to £1,302,150. Taking the rate of exchange to-day for the purpose of making a calculation, at 4.45, it is impossible to know what it may be later, but should the rate of exchange continue to go against us, it might be necessary for the purpose of meeting our obligations to come to the Dáil again.  On the other hand, the exchange rate may improve to such an extent that a lesser sum would enable us to redeem the dollars that we owe in America.  The interest on the Home Loan will amount to £151,252, and the interest on the External Loan, assuming that it is not redeemed until 1926, would be £390,645. The total sum is £2,222,177, and if we are able to redeem speedily in America, and if we succeed in buying dollars at a favourable rate, the amount may be a great deal less than the sum mentioned in the Resolution.  The sum mentioned will, unless there is great difficulty in the matter of exchange, cover the total charge.</P>

That for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to make provision<Col N="168" />for the arrest and detention of certain persons during a limited period and for other matters connected with the preservation of public safety and the protection of person and property, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of the expenses of Appeal Councils including any remuneration paid to members of such Councils in accordance with the terms of such Act.</entry>

    <P>The real purpose of this Motion on the Order Paper is to enable payment to be made to members of the Appeal Council if necessary.  It had been thought originally that it might be possible to get people who would un dertake the duties imposed on the Appeal Council without being paid for their services.  I think now it will not be found possible to get suitable people, and, secondly, it is necessary to pass this Resolution in order that provision may be made to pay these members. I think the expense will be small, and I think it is certainly necessary that we should agree to pay.  It is the only way of getting men who will do satisfactorily a very difficult and a rather unpleasant duty.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To insert immediately before Section 5, page 4, a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Whenever an Executive Minister shall propose to release any person arrested or detained under this Act the Minister may require as a condition of such release that such person should enter into a recognizance with two solvent sureties before a District Justice in such amount as may be approved by the Minister, the condition of such recognizance being that the person aforesaid shall be of good behaviour and keep the peace for such period not exceeding three years as shall be fixed by the Minister aforesaid.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The several enactments regulating the taking before a Divisional Magistrate of the City of Dublin of recognizances to be of good behaviour and to keep the peace and regulating the form and the mode of enforcing and estreating such recognizances shall apply to every recognizance entered into under this Section before a Divisional Magistrate aforesaid and the provisions of Section 34 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, and Section 10 of the Fines Act (Ireland), 1851, as amended by the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act, 1918, in relation to recognizances to be of good behaviour and to keep the peace shall apply to every recognizance entered into under this Section before a District Justice outside the Police District of the Dublin Metropolis.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is introduced because it might be found desirable, in certain cases, to release persons by <Col N="170" /> entering into recognizances.  As the Bill stood there was no power to take such recognizances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Before passing from this amendment, I would like to understand a little more as to what it implies. The arguments that have been used in regard to this Bill have been that it is not desirable to bring a prisoner before a Court; that a Court shall not be responsible for sentencing a prisoner for detention without trial, and that the Minister, in view of the powers that he seeks, should have the right to detain such a person.  Now, on a rather summary reading, I gather that the proposal is to allow such a person to be free on condition that he enters into recognizances.  It seems to me that that raises a question as to a trial, and suggests, at least, some kind of a judicial consideration of the case. If the question of release, on entering into recognizances, is to be dealt with before a District Justice, or if the Minister may require as a condition of release that such a person should enter into recognizances, that seems to raise a question of guilt or innocence, and alters the general application of the Bill in so far as it touches the requirement of bail.</P>
      <P>It seems, further, to be cutting across the principle enunciated by the Minister in defending this Bill, that the responsibility for detention should remain with him, and that when he is satisfied that a reasonable suspicion surrounds a person that he should have the right to detain such a person for not more than twelve months.  Now he asks for powers to release, provided that the suspected person will enter into bail.  I suggest that that requires a little more elucidation and more defence before the Dáil agrees to it&mdash; certainly more justification before the Dáil agrees to it, and I invite the Minister to enlarge upon his proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Though I doubt very much whether Deputy Johnson will believe the assertion, the amendment is put in in the interests of the detained person.  It has frequently happened that people have been arrested on a very definite suspicion of acts of aggression of one kind or another against their neighbours, and <Col N="171" /> had been detained, and it would be very useful in the future to have power to bring a detained person of that kind before a District Justice and get him to enter into recognizances, thus enabling him to be released.  Now, I could give specific cases, and I will give one specific case, not mentioning names.  I have in mind a case where a farm of seventy or eighty acres is in the ownership of two girls, and a combination of two or three individuals, having absolutely no claim whatever to the property in law, or what might be considered equity, simply take advantage of what they consider to be the helpless position of the real owners to harass them in every way and render, so far as they possibly could effect it, the property absolutely no use to them.  Operations of that kind are not carried on in the open or in the light of day.  They are carried on furtively and by night, and the people responsible in that case, the people who beyond all question were responsible in that case, were interned.  It would not have been possible to furnish full legal proof of guilt against them, or against any one of them.  Taking that case as a type, it would be useful if we had power to release persons of that kind on their undertaking to enter into recognizances and to refrain from outrage or molestation of their neighbours in the future.  That is what is provided for.  Deputy Johnson seems to think that the conception is wrong of putting a person under bail where guilt has not been proved.  That view bespeaks a short memory on the part of the Deputy.  It was the commonest thing to see people brought before a court, charged, the case not proved, and bound to the peace, although, admittedly, in view of the presiding magistrate or judge, satisfactory evidence was not furnished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they got a chance, to defend themselves.  If there is a general feeling amongst Deputies that this provision is wrong.  I am prepared to leave it out from the Bill, but I ask Deputies to remember that if it is omitted it will react against those who <Col N="172" /> are detained.  It will mean that if you have no provision to accept recognizances from detained persons, if you are not able to accept their guarantee, or the guarantee of sureties for them, you will not release them, and the period of their detention is likely to be longer.  That is the view of the Department, and I think it is a view which Deputies will readily understand.  There may be a misunderstanding.  It may be thought that sureties would be estreated on the same suspicion as led to the original arrest.  That, of course, could not be the case.  The bails would be estreated only on a future conviction.  In other words, going back to that agrarian case which I quoted as a type and which is not hypothetical, if those prisoners were released on entering into recognizances before a District Justice the bails could only be estreated in the event of a future conviction for an outrage or molestation of the owners in law and equity of the property concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the proposition in this amendment may well act for the benefit of the detained person, but I think it is well that the Dáil should have had the explanation which the Minister has given as to the meaning of this section and as to its intention. I think it would have been well if we had had it on the introduction of the section.  While admitting that it might well act for the benefit of the prisoners in fact that it might well be a means by which the Minister can go back upon his original decision to intern a person with a certain amount of grace, without hurting the appearances, it nevertheless shows how difficult a situation one gets into when trying to defend the proposition in the Bill that persons may be detained for twelve months merely on the suspicion, I repeat, of the Minister. The contention has been all the time that magistrates, courts and judges were not to be made responsible for the act of the Executive in such a matter; it was a temporary Bill to deal with extraordinary circumstances, and the Executive Council should be made bear the responsibility for detention. Now the proposal is to require bail to be entered into on behalf of the person <Col N="173" /> detained, and, when such bail has been entered into, release may be granted. I submit that that is bringing forward something approximating to a court, that the reasonable ground for suspicion on which the detention was originally justified is being changed to a reasonable ground for suspicion that such a person is capable of doing something which is illegal, and that other persons are going to bear some responsibility for the future good conduct of that particular citizen.  It is quite common knowledge, as the Minister says, that persons may be brought to trial, and, even where guilt has not been proved, that such person may be bound to enter into recognizances.</P>
      <P>Even in such cases the prisoner always has an opportunity of proving before a court that he should not be even bound over, that there is not the slightest shadow of justification for his detention, and that fact alone makes a difference between the Proposition in the Bill and the example which the Minister has quoted.  I shall not oppose the insertion of this new section, but I am glad that I have drawn from the Minister at least some explanation as to why it was introduced and what it means, and I think it would have been better had we had that explanation on its introduction.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Johnson's remarks, I may say that the meaning of that amendment was so obvious to me that I did not think it required explanation.  I had a case in point a few days ago in connection with one of these prisoners, quite a young man, whose father had died since he was in prison.  The father left him a valuable farm, and the young man's uncle, who is acting as executor, came to me and said that he was satisfied, if he was released, he would be prepared to guarantee that in future he would not be a danger to the State, and he was prepared to enter into recognizances. I am quite certain that that is one of the cases that might be dealt with under this particular amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" />&ldquo;In Section 7, page 4, line 38, after the word `Superintendent' to add the words `who shall have power to delegate his powers under this Act to any member of a police force under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think, possibly, an apology is due for the putting down of an amendment on the Report Stage by a private member, but the fact is, that the question of delegation of power by a responsible authority under the Bill did not come before the Dáil until the Committee Stage.  It was not until the Committee Stage was reached that the Minister for Home Affairs informed us that the responsible authority, such as a superintendent in the police force or a commandant in the Army, would be at liberty to delegate his powers to an inferior officer.  It seems to me that that delegation requires definition.  I was of opinion that under this delegation, authorised in the Bill, a subordinate officer would be liable to prosecution for illegal arrest or false imprisonment.  I put down this amendment stating to whom the superintendent can delegate his powers to.  I think the Minister will agree that I have not made the delegation too narrow, as I have left it to any policeman.  I do not believe that any policeman is a danger to the public. He wears a uniform and is unarmed, and, if he is a member of the C.I.D., he will, as the Minister informs us, carry a card which he will produce on demand.  I think that the delegation proposed in this amendment will safeguard the individual from the risk of prosecution.  It cannot limit the operations of the Act, and I hope that the Government will see their way to accept it, even if only for the sake of safeguarding their subordinates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I made some inquiries as to the practice under the Public Safety Act which now exists and which expires on the 1st of next month.  I found almost invariably that when arrests were made under that Act in the past they were made by the responsible officer in person, and that the actual physical act of arrest was performed by the responsible officer named in that Act.  It seems to <Col N="175" /> me that cases might well arise in which it would be necessary to safeguard his right to delegate to an agent or subordinate the duty of arresting, and, consequently, I was unable to meet the suggestion made on the Committee Stage on this matter.  As to the proposal at present before the Dáil, I consider that Deputy Cooper's amendment is useful, and I would ask merely that the Deputy would agree to an alteration in the wording, and that after the word &ldquo;Superintendent&rdquo; he would add the words &ldquo;or any member of a police force thereto authorised by him.&rdquo; The wording of the amendment that is on the Order Paper is, in fact, too broad and might to some minds suggest that he could even delegate his primary responsibility for the arrest, delegate his full powers under the Act, whereas all that is stated is that he should have power to delegate the power of arrest of a particular person while the responsibility rests with him.  I would ask the Deputy to agree to that alteration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I am quite prepared to accept the alteration suggested.  The Minister knows that private members are at a disadvantage in drafting amendments, and I am not disposed to insist on the Wording.  His suggestion meets my point, and I am prepared to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to know whether this means a general authorisation; in other words, whether the fact that a man is a member of a police force is to be deemed that he is always acting under the authority of a responsible officer and that, therefore, arrest and detention by such a person would be deemed to be arrest and detention by a responsible officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the authorisation is to be specific in relation to a particular case and particular persons, the power that you are giving is very much greater than the Power which was proposed in the first draft of the Bill.  It is one thing to say that a responsible officer not below the rank of Superintendent may make an arrest and may detain a person for a week without bringing him before a Court.  It is another thing to say to an ordinary policeman that he may arrest <Col N="176" /> and detain for a week without bringing a person before a Court.  Unless the delegation of authority is specific to a named person, the power that you are giving to the policeman is a very great extension of that which was originally proposed.  If there is to be such power it should be to arrest, and a police officer to-day has that power.  But the power to detain for a week is an enlargement of such powers as will exist on the 1st February, unless this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>To enlarge those powers to the extent that any general authorisation to a policeman from a Superintendent would enable that policeman to arrest and detain for a week is beyond the original intention of the Bill and, I hope, will not be conceded.  I would very much rather have the Bill without the amendment, so that the only person who is to be authorised to use these extraordinary powers would be a Superintendent and that if any person below the rank of a Superintendent were to try to exercise such extraordinary powers outside the ordinary law, then that person would be liable to answer for any offence.  If there is to be an amendment in this respect, then I submit that the only amendment that should be acceptable, that should even be considered, should be that it would require the delegation of authority to be in writing and to have reference to a specific occasion.</P>

      <P>Deputies, in considering the representations urged by Deputy Johnson, should consider also the practical difficulties in their application. The Superintendents' area, Deputies are probably aware, is extremely large, and this could very easily happen: Take one of the smallest areas. There is a Chief Superintendent resident in Naas.  Let us suppose that an arrest under this Bill is necessary or highly advisable in the Athy district on a particular day, and that on that day the Superintendent's presence in Naas is necessary in order to give evidence in a particular case to appear in Court to prosecute a prisoner.  It would be necessary for him to authorise some agent or subordinate to perform the arrest in Athy. If Deputy Johnson would prefer after <Col N="177" /> the word &ldquo;Superintendent&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or any member of a police force particularly authorised by him&rdquo; to avoid the suggestion of a general authorisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid this amendment will not be as fortunate as the last.  In this as well I have tried to meet the Government's point of view as far as I can. This amendment gives power of delegation to a military officer not below the rank of Commandant.  I have tried to meet the case that the Minister made in the Committee Stage.  He instanced a case of a wanted man being in a particularly crowded place.  I think the instances he gave were a fair and a circus.  He said it would not be possible to give specific authority to every soldier in the party who would surround that spot to arrest the wanted man.  This amendment provides for that, because if any party of men is detailed for the duty of arresting any man, Battalion Orders to proceed to such and such a place to arrest various people wanted in itself gives every member of the party the necessary authority.  In addition I propose that the necessary authority can be given to everybody not below the rank of sergeant-major.  When it comes to giving private soldiers the power of indiscriminate arrest, you are really opening a very wide door indeed. We do not pay a private soldier 17/6 a week to have the qualities of a Fouché or of a Sherlock Holmes.  He is not trained for that work and he may exercise the light in a manner injurious to the public, particularly if, as some of them sometimes do, he has taken a little too much Drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again there is every possibility that <Col N="179" /> a zealous man might mistake the identity of a perfectly harmless individual for somebody he believed to be wanted. It will be within the recollection of the Dáil that before the truce, I think, Dr. Gregg, the Archbishop of Dublin, was arrested by some Auxiliaries, who were under the impression that he was Mr. de Valera.  In the event of Mr. de Valera escaping from Arbour Hill I am afraid that, if the Bill is left as it stands, Dr. Gregg would lead a somewhat chequered existence and it might even be unsafe for him to go abroad in public unless disguised. Soldiers are not paid or trained to arrest a man casually or on suspicion and their power of doing so should be limited as far as possible.  I have heard it suggested that if a soldier gets into a tram and finds himself opposite a man who is wanted, that he ought to be able to arrest him there and then. Really the suggestion that any soldier is to arrest anybody, in any place, does not belong to the world.  It belongs to Mexico as we see it in the cinema.  That is the only parallel that I am aware of. I would say to the Minister that you cannot legislate for exceptional cases like this.  Possibly in one instance a man might escape because the soldier happened to be below the rank of sergeant-major, although he was perfectly certain that he knew the man and might have arrested him.  That is an individual particular instance in which legislation becomes powerless.  Either the man will override the law and arrest him or he will let him go.  But the likelihood of that happening is so remote that I really do not.  think the Bill will suffer if the amendment is adopted.</P>

You can see in the Bill-and I give credit to the Minister for it; both Ministers&mdash;that there is a distinct movement away from the military authority over the civil life of the country as compared with the last Bill.  Consequently, no one below the rank of Commandant is to come within the definition of &ldquo;responsible officer.&rdquo; Now it <Col N="180" /> is &ldquo;responsible officers&rdquo; only who are to have power to arrest and detain for a week.  Deputy Cooper's amendment would allow a Captain, a Lieutenant, and any other officer not below the rank of Sergeant-Major.  I say that is going back upon the intentions of the Bill and is inviting Commandants to make policemen of soldiers who are not qualified.  It is not desirable that they should become qualified to act as policemen, because they are not trained to act as policemen, and Deputy Bryan Cooper's arguments to that effect, the irresponsible actions of the private are only to a somewhat less degree applicable to the sergeant-major, still less, perhaps, and only still less, to the Commandant, although the Commandant is a responsible officer under the terms of the Bill.  But Deputy Bryan Cooper would suggest that the sergeant-major may be such a responsible officer, capable of making an arrest in a train-car, and I submit that that is not the duty that should be thrust upon a soldier, and that if such a duty is to be imposed upon anybody, it should be confined to officers of higher rank, and as few of them as possible.  I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Cooper that one cannot legislate for exceptional cases, and to warn him that it is impossible to legislate in such a way as to avoid the extremely hypothetical cases which he put in the course of his arguments on this Bill.

      <P>Being arrested in a tram, because soldiers are left with power by the Minister under the Bill. Well, everyone knows that soldiers are not in fact going about, and are not in the future likely to go about, arresting inoffensive, law-abiding citizens, who are not in the least wanted by the State or by the Government.  And so, while I admit that in some of the arguments that have been urged with regard to the Bill, there has been a certain force and, <Col N="181" /> I admit, a certain necessity for safeguarding rights as far as possible, still it is not possible to legislate in such a way as to meet every extravagant hypothetical case that might be advanced here in a spirit of jest or in a spirit of casuistry.  As to soldiers arresting at all, I would certainly wish that a situation existed in the country in which soldiers ought not to arrest, in which it would not be necessary to ask soldiers to make any arrests at all.  But you have not reached that position.  Men are going about armed.  Certain very lawless and very desperate men are still on the loose through the country, and it would not be a fair thing, it would not be a proper thing, to ask members of an unarmed police force to face into a house to arrest these men who are armed to the teeth with lethal weapons of one kind or another.  And because you still have that situation, it is necessary to retain for the military certain powers of arrest, while endeavouring to safeguard these powers against abuse as far as possible.</P>
      <P>While this discussion was proceeding the Minister for Defence Drafted a suggestion which seems to me to meet all reasonable objections that might be urged.  It is to substitute for the amendment: To add after the last word of the particular paragraph, &ldquo;Commandant&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;who may be specifically empowered in any particular case by the Minister for Defence to delegate his powers under this Act to any member of the Military Forces of Saorstát Eireann not below the rank of sergeant.  Save and except in such cases where a military force has been detailed by the order of a person so empowered to arrest any person or persons in which case every member of such force shall be deemed to possess the powers granted by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading that&mdash;and I have given it careful consideration&mdash;I think that it meets reasonable objections that in might be urged.  It confines the power of arrest normally to the Commandant. It goes on then to say that a Commandant may be specifically empowered in a particular case by the Minister for Defence to delegate his <Col N="182" /> powers under the Act to any member of the military forces of Saorstát Eireann not below the rank of sergeant.  He can delegate in a particular case, when be is authorised to do so by the Minister for Defence, down to the rank of sergeant.  And then there is this further modification: &ldquo;Save and except in such cases where a military force has been detailed by the order of a person so empowered to arrest any person or persons, in which case every member of such force shall be deemed to possess the powers granted by the Act.&rdquo; If there is substantial agreement with that I would put it in as an alternative to the Deputy's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>What exactly we desire to secure is that in as much of the country as possible the military forces would occupy their normal position.  This amendment gives us power, in certain parts of the country where we consider that these normal conditions do not exist, to indicate specific areas in which Commandants, and officers who come higher up in authority, will be empowered to delegate to junior officers in such areas&mdash; Captains or Lieutenants, or if they want it to go down to the rank of sergeant&mdash;powers of arrest such as in any area in the country a Commandant would have under this Bill.  Take a case in which powers, which are normally held by a Commandant, have been delegated to a first Lieutenant in, say, some part of West Cork or Kerry. He wants to secure the arrest of specific persons against whom a charge is laid within the terms of this particular Act.  He orders out a military party, places its members in charge of the sergeant, and gives him a specific order to take out the party and arrest a particular person.  The latter portion of this amendment would secure that that military party, as a whole, had <Col N="183" /> power to arrest the person or persons concerned and, if necessary, power to detain until they could hand over such person or persons to their proper superior authorities.</P>
      <P>There is one point with regard to which I am not quite satisfied.  The amendment would read, who may be specifically empowered in any particular case,&rdquo; who may be specifically empowered in the case of any particular officer; that is, judging by the condititions of a particular area, taking the office of commandant, and all rank above that, in the specific case of these officers in that particular area having authority, they would be specifically empowered to delegate that authority. &ldquo;In any particular case&rdquo; does not mean in the case of any particular district, and I would like to assure myself that that covers what I have in mind, and will not give rise at any time to a question as to what it exactly means.</P>

      <P>I take it that it is obvious that this is the kind of amendment that will have to be before us before we can consider it satisfactorily, and the Minister himself appears to desire a little more time to consider the drafting.  I take it that the best manner of dealing with this is either to adjourn the discussion, or introduce such an amendment in the Seanad.  I hope, as a matter of fact, that the Bill will leave the Dáil, in this respect, at any rate, with no amendment, and if, on further consideration, the proposal by the Minister for Defence is found to be desirable, then it should be introduced in the Seanad, and we would have some notice of it.</P>

I suggested a sergeant-major, and the Government say a sergeant.  It is a comparatively minor point.  I think myself that a sergeant of military police may possibly be a fitter person to make an arrest than even a 1st or 2nd Lieutenant in some cases, though I am not going to stand on that.  I am quite prepared <Col N="184" /> to withdraw my amendment, subject to this being taken now or if Deputy Johnson wishes it, to an amendment being introduced in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as I explained on the first Reading, is a very short and Simple Bill, necessitated by circumstances arising out of the events of two or three years ago.  During that period of conflict with the British, when the Statute law of the country was more honoured in the breach than in the observance, a Coroner was appointed <Col N="187" /> for the City of Limerick who had not the statutory qualifications, and a Coroner was also appointed in Westmeath who did not possess the statutory qualifications.  These men have since carried out the duties of Coroner, and it seems highly desirable to validate their appointments.  That is one of two objects of the Bill.  Section 1 of the Bill aims at maintaining the qualification of five years' Justice of the Peace, in the case of any person who was a Justice of the Peace on the 1st January, 1919, and who resigned as between that date and the 6th Dec., 1921.  It is, of course, entirely optional with the County Council to appoint any person who has any of the three qualifications.</P>
      <P>The qualifications prescribed by the Coroners' Act of 1881 are as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The person to be appointed must be a Doctor duly qualified and registered under the Act of 1858, a Barrister or Solicitor of the Supreme Court, or a Justice of the Peace of five years' standing.&rdquo; Now, it is with regard to that latter qualifications&mdash;a Justice of the Peace of five years' standing&mdash;that Section 1 of the Bill deals.  We submit it is desirable to continue that qualification provided that the person was a Justice of the Peace on the 1st Jan., 1919, and resigned as between that and the 6th December, 1921.  There are altogether three specific cases covered by the Bill, the case of the Coroner of Limerick City, the case of the Coroner in Westmeath, and Section 1, which covers one case that has arisen within the last few months dealing with the Coronership of Leix, where a person was appointed who had five years in the past as a Justice of the Peace and who resigned his office some time in 1921.  I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This Court Officers (Temporary Appointments) Bill is introduced mainly as an economy measure, and it simply deals with a practical difficulty that has arisen in the machinery of administration in the country. In certain Court offices vacancies have arisen.  I think there were one or two in connection with clerkships of the Crown and Peace, certain Probate Registrarships in Cork, and a few others here and there through the country.  We have passed here a Bill reorganising the machinery of justice for the country, and that Bill is at present before the Seanad.  It seems undesirable, when the Court machinery of the country is about to undergo considerable changes, to appoint people to these old offices with exactly the same tenure and rights as their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, short of legislation to meet the point, that would be necessary, and this Bill is introduced to enable me, or the Minister for Home Affairs for the time being, to make temporary provision to have the duties attaching to these vacant offices carried out, without giving the person appointed to do the work all the rights and all the vested interests of their predecessors. I think that that is an object which will commend itself to Deputies generally, and I feel that it is unnecessary, in so far as the principle of the Bill, at any rate, is concerned, to elaborate the point.  Certain minor <Col N="189" /> matters may arise on the Committee Stage, but I now ask Deputies to give this Bill a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the evening Deputy Johnson gave notice that he would raise a question on the motion for the adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I would raise, on the motion for the adjournment, with a view to further elucidation, and examination, the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture in reference to the guarantee by the British Government of the bond issues under the Land Act.  It appeared from the statement made by the Minister that some discussions took place on this matter prior to the signing of the Treaty, and that since that time, and, as a matter of fact, quite recently, the British Government made an offer to the Saorstát Government that they would be prepared to guarantee the principal and interest on the bond issues by the Government of the Irish Free State under the Land Act recently passed.  Now, it is very good and very kind, I have no doubt, of the British Government to offer to give the assurance to the landlords, or to any person who may buy land bonds, but I think it is a very much more serious matter, and one that requires some consideration at any rate. It may be easily justified, but it will require some justification, to say that the Free State Government has accepted that guarantee.  As I say, it is very satisfactory, no doubt, to the holders of the Land Bonds, but I doubt very much whether it is so satisfactory to the stability or, shall I say, the independence of the Free State, in doing what amounts, in effect, to this: putting this State into pawn to the extent of the amount of the Land Bonds that may be issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that extent, at any rate, we have said to the British Government: &ldquo;I You are guaranteeing the principal and interest of these bonds, and, consequently, it will be your duty to see that we conduct ourselves properly, so that you will not be called upon to honour that guarantee.&rdquo;  It will be the duty henceforward, if this proposition of the Minister is carried through, of the British Government, for the sake of its taxpayers, to try to ensure that the affairs of the Saorstát will be properly conducted so that they will not be called upon to guarantee both the principal <Col N="199" /> and interest of these bonds.  That obviously means that we are agreeing to that amount of interference.  We are inviting them to make themselves confident of the stability of this State, to keep a watchful eye over our proceeding, to make sure that we do not overrun our financial resources, and, generally, to keep ourselves solvent so that they will not be called upon to pay up.  Now this may be quite a wrong interpretation of what the Minister said, but putting the reference in the King's speech to the British Parliament alongside the explanation, so far as it went, given by the Minister, it seems to me to require further consideration, and ought to have discussion in the Dáil before it is agreed to.</P>
    <P>I think that, unless further satisfactory explanations are given, it may be necessary to ask the Dáil to inform the British Government that we do not desire that they should pass this legislation which they propose to introduce. I do not think that the Dáil should allow to pass without very serious notice the proposition that for securing the landlords or the holders of land bonds the Saorstát is prepared to ask for, or even to accept, the offer of the British Government to guarantee these bonds.  I say that it is putting this State in pawn to the British Government to that extent, and it is doing it by departmental action, without reference to the Oireachtas.  I hope that the matter will be discussed or, at least, that the Minister, even at this stage, will say something to remove the impression that has been created by the reference in the King's speech in the British Parliament, and by his own statement this afternoon, which was taken on short notice.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson referred to the impression which has been created first by the reference in the King's speech, but it would be more correct if he referred to an impression which he himself wished to create.  Even though I <Col N="200" /> say that, I will go on to say that I agree with practically every word which the Deputy has just stated, and I am rather glad that this question has been raised now so as to give me an opportunity of allaying the fears of the very large number of the people in this country who are ready to smell a rat at the very first opportunity.  The Deputy states that this is an attempt to come to an arrangement with the British Government behind the backs of the Dáil.  It is not.  He also laboured the point that it would be desirable that this Dáil should be the particular body to decide the very serious questions that arise in any financial transaction with England or any other country.  I agree with every word of that.  I reiterate what the Deputy has said.  It is absolutely essential that this Dáil should be the body to say whether it is good business for us to accept any offer, financial or otherwise, made by England, France, Germany, or any other country.  I agree with the Deputy that very important issues are raised in all these matters, and that they should not be decided by departmental officials or by Ministers or by would-be experts of any kind.</P>
      <P>These questions of high policy are to be decided, and should be decided, by this Dáil, and this question that we are debating now&mdash;whether we should accept the offer made by the British Government to guarantee the land bonds&mdash;and all the issues which that offer raises, as well as all the issues raised by Deputy Johnson&mdash;and issues, perhaps, which he has not raised&mdash;will, I hope, be discussed and decided, with the full knowledge of all the circumstances, by this Dáil at the first suitable opportunity.  I hope that that will allay the fears which the Deputy professes to have.  I suggest to the Deputy that in the circumstances and in view of what I have just said, the proper time to debate all these issues is when the matter comes formally before us, when we make a proposal which we will recommend to the Dáil, and when the question has to be decided, yes or no.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  An offer was made by the British Government, and, so far as I am concerned, and so far as this Government is concerned, they have accepted that offer, subject, of course, to the approval of the Dáil, just as the offer was made by the.  British Government subject to the approval of the British Parliament.  I have to reiterate here again a fact which Deputies seem constantly, either deliberately or otherwise, to forget, namely, that we are an independent country, but that England is another, and that when an English Government makes an offer of that sort it Must make it subject to Parliament, just as we can only accept subject to the consent of Parliament.  That position is perfectly clear.  Let us talk business, and this is a business matter.  If business is to be done with an English, French, or German Government, someone must make an offer, and someone must accept.  Once it is well understood that both offer and acceptance are subject entirely to the consent of Parliament, what is wrong?  Where is the danger?  Is it the Deputy's case that the English.  Prime Minister came to us and said: &ldquo;Look here, during the Treaty discussions we acknowledged our obligations for land purchase, and if you think it is good business we will guarantee the land bonds.&rdquo;  We could not prevent them from saying that, and personally I would be sorry to prevent them, but we are entitled to consider that, if we think it good business subject to the Dáil.  This business is being discussed here.  It will be necessary to have legislation introduced into each House.  The English Parliament can discuss this freely and independently, and we also can discuss it freely and independently.  If the difficulty is as to who is to begin, it is childish to take up the time of the Dáil.  I want to meet the Deputy fairly in this matter, and I want to get next him and see what he objects to.  I would like to understand his point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sort of thing. which I object to.  The Deputy knows perfectly well that no member of the Government, not even such an important personage as an External Minister, is able to bind the Parliament of the nation.  It is not good enough for the Deputy to come here and pretend that he thought that I went to England and told the British Government that I was going to accept their guarantee for land bonds which we were about to issue, and that I was not going to allow the Irish Parliament to have a word to say to it.  That is a little bit too thin.  If there are misunderstandings amongst ignorant people throughout the country, the Deputy has gone an extraordinary way about doing what he professes to do, namely, clear them up.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that if an offer is made by the British Government, and accepted by the Irish Government, it is subject to the sanction of both Parliaments.  He knows that perfectly well, and any attempt to pretend now that there was some attempt made here to come to an agreement behind the back of Parliament is not good enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the position should be very clear to the Minister that if it had gone out from this Dáil that we have accepted the offer which has been made, without the further explanation which the Minister has given to us&mdash;that they only accepted subject to ratification by the Dáil&mdash;the effect, of such a statement on this country would have been a bad one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite ready to believe that the Deputy was genuinely afraid that such an impression would get abroad, but from my point of view, I think there is very little danger of that.  I hope that there is enough political education in the country to underStand <Col N="203" /> clear political event of this sort. I do not think that there is any likelihood that such an impression would get abroad but I am willing to give the Deputy credit for thinking that there was some necessity to clear it up.  If there were such danger, I am glad to reiterate that such arrangements must be subject to parliament.  As I have already said, the English Government is the government of an independent country.  It is meeting parliament for the first time, and it is a habit to put in the King's speech reference to legislation which it is intended to introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that that is the reason that reference to this arrangement was inserted in the King's speech.  We will find a suitable time to discuss this question, and that will be when introducing the Bill.  That Bill will be introduced pretty soon, because we are anxious to get ahead with land purchase and to be in a position within the next two months to issue bonds.  I am not prepared to say at present what form the Bill should take, but all these matters <Col N="204" /> will be discussed on that Bill, and Parliament then will, of course, be perfectly free to take into account all the circumstances of the case and to take into account what are the real interests of Ireland in this matter and decide accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no such suggestion. It is obvious, if we agree to accept this guarantee, that it imposes a duty upon us to introduce such a Bill and to let Parliament decide whether it is good business or not.  It is clear that if that is the state of affairs, the time to introduce such a Bill would be before the issue of land bonds.  If Parliament has to decide that issue, it must be decided before issuing those bonds.</P>

      <P>Mr. Winston's account has been received, and is being dealt with.  The claim being for civilian clothes supplied to troops, required a closer investigation than is given to normal claims, and delay was occasioned. It is hoped that a decision will be reached very quickly.</P>

It has been established that Mr. O'Dea did not get delivery of the car, and, therefore, a claim from him does not arise on the commandeering.</P>
