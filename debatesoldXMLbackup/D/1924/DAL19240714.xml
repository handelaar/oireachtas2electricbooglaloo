      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I intimated last week, the matter of the exact position of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill of last year was referred for examination to the Attorney-General.  A doubt was expressed as to whether it was not the duty of the Executive Council at the end of 270 days after that Bill had been sent to the Seanad to submit the Bill for signature to the Governor-General. It was taken, if there were such a duty, that it was a continuing duty.  The Attorney-General has examined the matter and given it a great deal of consideration. He now advises me that the position is that the Executive Council, in accordance with Article 38 of the Constitution, are bound to submit that Bill for signature to the Governor-General and to put it into operation. The Bill was undoubtedly passed by Dáil Eireann, and it was also, in the opinion of the Attorney-General considered by Seanad Eireann, inasmuch as it came before that House in the ordinary way, was discussed by the members of that House, and was the subject of a resolution in the Seanad.  The Attorney-General considers that that fulfils the requirements of Article 38 of the Constitution, and that the Bill was, in fact, considered by Seanad Eireann.  He holds, therefore, that on the expiration of the 270 days mentioned in that Article, the Bill should <Col N="1110" /> have been deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in the form in which it was passed by Dáil Eireann.  It was, therefore, the duty of the Executive Council under Article 41 of the Constitution to present the Bill to the Governor-General for assent, and that duty is a continuing duty, and what has not been done must now be rectified and must be done.  There is one point in Article 38 of the Constitution that might be worth referring to, to avoid any doubts or misunderstandings.  The Article reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every Bill initiated in and passed by Dáil Eireann shall be sent to Seanad Eireann and may, unless it be a money Bill, be amended in Seanad Eireann, and Dáil Eireann shall consider any such amendment; but a Bill passed by Dáil Eireann and considered by Seanad Eireann shall not later than two hundred and seventy days after it shall have been first sent to Seanad Eireann or such longer period as may be agreed upon by the two Houses, be deemed to be passed by both Houses in the form in which it was last passed by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words there, &ldquo;Or such longer period as may be agreed upon by the two Houses,&rdquo; are of some importance in this connection.  The question was specifically put to the Attorney-General as to whether that agreement would have to be come to prior to the expiration of the two hundred and seventy days, and his view is that it would need to be arrived at before the other period had expired, that the agreement between the two Houses prolonging the period could not be arrived at <i>post factum</i>, and that the period had expired. He advises that, once the period has passed in default of agreement prolonging it having been previously arrived at, the Bill is deemed to have been passed, and the only thing remaining to be done is to present it to the Governor-General for signature.  That will be done without delay after the next meeting of the Executive Council. It may be arranged, perhaps, to ensure that sufficient notice will be given to the public and to the licensed trade, <Col N="1111" /> that the Bill will not be submitted for signature to the Governor-General until Saturday next, so that it will be operative law next week.</P>
    <P>That raises the question of our intentions with regard to the current Bill &mdash;the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1924. It seems to me that there is really nothing to be gained by the Dáil giving a day or two days or possibly more to the Committee Stage of this Bill if we do not intend that it shall become law this side of the adjournment.  Therefore, I would not propose to proceed with that Bill, unless the Dáil felt that we ought to proceed with its consideration and take all its stages in the hope that it would become law before the adjournment. Otherwise I would simply leave the Bill as it stands, and take it up when we meet again in October.  I would, on Report, insert an Amendment in the Bill of this year repealing the Bill of 1923.  It is for the Dáil to consider what course we ought to take with regard to this Bill that is at present before the Dáil.  I do not know exactly how the view of the Dáil could be ascertained, or when it could be ascertained better than by a vote on the matter, all the Deputies voting freely. The Deputies when voting should advert to the fact that the alternative is that last year's Bill, or Act as it will shortly be, be operative until such time as it is amended or repealed by the present Bill.  If we leave over the consideration of the present Bill until we meet after the Recess in October, then the Act of last year will be the operative law of the country in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised two questions of very great importance. I am not able quite to understand the reasoning regarding Article 38.  Everything that has been written in the newspapers, and I think what the Minister now said, seems to read this Article in a way quite different from that in which I read it.  The Article says, and it seems the whole consideration, &ldquo;not later than two hundred and seventy days after it shall have been first sent to Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  The Minister speaks as if <Col N="1112" /> it said &ldquo;Not before the two hundred and seventy days&rdquo; had passed.  I simply call attention to that.  I cannot understand the interpretation.  On the question of the Constitutional right, assuming that the Minister's interpretation that &ldquo;not later than&rdquo; means &ldquo;not before&rdquo; is correct, I want to raise, as a precautionary matter, the question of Constitutional equity as distinguished from right.  The Bill was passed by the last Dáil.  There has been a dissolution, and a new Dáil has been declared elected.  I think it would be unwise to create a precedent that would allow this clause in the Constitution to become operative between one elected Dáil and another.  An election may have taken place.  One could conceive that that election might have been decided on that issue.  Discussions may have ranged round the very Bill which was held up by the Seanad.  If, in such a case, a new Dáil is elected, then it seems to me to be essential, to carry out the spirit of the Constitution, that the newly-elected Dáil should declare itself in regard to the previously-passed Bill, and I think that the requirements of the case would be met by a simple resolution desiring that the Executive should put into effect Article 41.  I think it is doubtful wisdom to assume that the body which passed the Act, having been dissolved, the new body elected should have no authority over the Executive Council in the matter of presenting a measure to the Governor-General for signature which has not been passed by the Seanad.  I would urge that consideration be given to this point, and that before the matter is dealt with, if it is to be dealt with in the way the Minister has pointed out, and if that is decided to be the Constitutional requirement, the Dáil should have an opportunity of declaring either yea or nay to the proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's other point respecting the manner in which the Dáil should indicate its wishes in regard to the present Bill, I would like to see the Bill passed.  But I do not see now how it is going to be passed with due consideration.  I suggest that the Minister should again test the feeling of the Dáil by a formal motion. <Col N="1113" /> The dilemma that the Minister seems to seek to place the opponents of the Bill in rather suggests that there is a necessity for testing the feeling of the Dáil on these two matters, and I think that should be done by formal resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>May I reply briefly to the points Deputy Johnson has raised.  As I see it, the Executive Council and the Dáil alike are bound by the Constitution.  The Executive Council, having sought the advice of its legal officer, the Attorney-General, has not, in practice, any real choice about following that advice.  Deputy Johnson seems to suggest that we ought to put up a Motion here that the Dáil advise the Executive Council to comply with that particular Article of the Constitution.  What would be the effect if that Motion were not carried? Does it mean that the Dáil, by Resolution, can over-ride the Constitution? Further, I would remind Deputy Johnson and Deputies generally that it is not a question of what we think ought to be in Article 38 of the Constitution. It is a question of what actually is in Article 38.  We may think that Article 38 ought to have made provision for the case of dissolution, that the words should be contained therein &ldquo;unless there shall be a dissolution in the meantime.&rdquo;  But those words are not in the Article and, on a legal interpretation of the words of the Article, we are advised that we should have at the end of two hundred and seventy days referred the Bill to the Governor-General for assent, and that that is a continuing duty on the Executive Council.  It is a duty which the Executive Council should perform immediately on becoming aware of it. As I say, the two hundred and seventy days expired some time back&mdash;I think towards the end of May.  There has been a period in which we did not advert to a duty that was on us under the Constitution.  A doubt was raised as to what the position was in connection with that Bill, and my duty clearly was to get that doubt resolved without any unnecessary delay.  I referred the point to the Attorney-General, and his advice is as I have stated to the Dáil.  Clearly, the Executive <Col N="1114" /> Council must get that Bill signed and put into operation.  There is a method of challenging that decision, no doubt, but there is really no course open to the Executive Council but the course I have outlined.</P>
      <P>The Deputy used an expression which might create a wrong impression, when he referred to the dilemma in which I was seeking to place the opponents of the present Bill.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that this situation has not arisen through any desire on my part to place the opponents of the current Bill in any dilemma.  It is simply one of these accidents and coincidences which do occasionally arise in life, that while the present Bill was under discussion someone raised the point as to what the exact position of last year's Bill was, in view of the fact that it had been passed by the Dáil and sent to the Seanad, and that more than two hundred and seventy days had expired.  There is no Machiavellianism about the thing, no subtlety and no attempt to spring a mine on anyone.  It is simply that circumstances have arisen creating that dilemma and the Dáil must now say whether they propose to leave over the present Bill until the autumn with the certainty of last year's Bill becoming operative in the meantime, or whether they would prefer to forge ahead with the present Bill with the view, or with the hope of it becoming law before the adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to suggest any Machiavellian propensities or tendencies on the part of the Minister. There is a point in this matter of procedure which, I think, has not been adverted to either by the Minister for Justice or Deputy Johnson and which, I think it desirable should be considered in view of the very elastic interpretation of this Article.  I presume that it is the business of the Executive to arrange the procedure of business in the Seanad as well as in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Under our Standing Orders the Executive Council has power to arrange the order <Col N="1115" /> of their own business here.  I am not sure that they have any such power in the Seanad.  I do not think they have, by Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was sent up from the Dáil to the Seanad last July, about the time that the business of the session was being wound up, and finding themselves unable to deal with the matter, they passed a resolution postponing consideration of this Bill.  A subsequent session comes along and the Minister for Justice has another Bill in preparation.  The Bill that was sent to the Seanad was regarded as moribund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Deputy, as a matter of explanation, that I stated in the Dáil when last year's Bill was under consideration, when it became clear that a great many of its sections had to be sacrificed as ballast, I would go ahead merely with the question of hours and introduce a more comprehensive measure the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to get at is not really affected by the statement of the Minister for Justice. It is this&mdash;that while there was another Bill in contemplation which would override the previous Bill, it would have seemed rather peculiar to have proceeded with that previous Bill in the Seanad, and, therefore, the matter was not proceeded with.  If a contingency such as now emerges had been foreseen, and the Seanad had proceeded with the discussion of the Bill, they would have possibly made certain changes which would have been sent down to the Dáil again.  In any case, the fate of the Bill would not have terminated at the end of two hundred and seventy days, as it did.  The proceedings would have been protracted in the Seanad to a longer period.  It would have been sent down here, and we would have been in the peculiar position of having to decide between the two Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a mistake.  After a Bill has left the Dáil, it does not matter what its fortunes are in the other <Col N="1116" /> House; if the Dáil decides that it will not accept these amendments it becomes law two hundred and seventy days later in the order in which it had left this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pressing the point that it is due to the negligence of the Executive to indicate they wished this Bill proceeded with in the Seanad, that it was allowed to fall practically into the background without further action being taken.  I stress further the point that it is under this curious construction of this particular provision in the Constitution, he resurrects this Bill and tries to make it law.  I want to make this further point regarding this Bill.  I do not wish to set myself against the considered judgment of the Attorney-General, but I do wish to have some grounds indicated upon which he bases the decision that because there was no agreement as to the length of time prior to the 270 days, therefore that agreement could be dispensed with. This provision expressly indicates that some such agreement in regard to the period must be secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I think that that is a fair reading of that&mdash;&ldquo;or such longer period as may be agreed upon by the two Houses.&rdquo;  The Minister himself, I think, admits that there has been no agreement as to the time and how the Attorney-General, eminent though he may be in his profession, can read into that, that the agreement can be dispensed with, I do not know. I would like to have some ground upon which to base that conclusion.  It may be a matter for amusement to the Ministerial benches, but still the poor unenlightened back-benchers would like to be informed on the matter.  They have to consult their legal advisers and they would like to have transmitted the grounds upon which they were convinced that this was a true reading of the clause.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy contend that after the two hundred and seventy days have elapsed that the two Houses can come to an agreement to prolong the period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1117" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I am not quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because I am not quite clear myself that I want to get the thing made clear. The Constitution prescribes that &ldquo;not later than two hundred and seventy days after a Bill shall have been first sent to Seanad Eireann, or such longer period as may agreed upon by the two Houses, be deemed to be passed by both Houses in the form in which it was last passed by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  The ordinary procedure is that the Bill goes from Dáil Eireann to the Seanad and any day after the two hundred and seventy days, if no agreement has been reached, the Bill becomes law in the form in which it left us.  Does the Deputy contend that after that time an agreement may be reached to prolong the period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.  That is not my contention.  My contention is that when that provision has not been complied with after two hundred and seventy days&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Which provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>That the Bill is deemed to be passed by both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>But that provision is automatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if that is automatic the Executive have not put it into operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of Article 41&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>And that to extricate them from that position there must be an agreement between the two Houses. There are so many legal experts here that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting question.  I only want to get the exact problem stated, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>If I can understand the English language at all, or if they have any meaning at all, the words &ldquo;or such longer period as may be agreed upon between the two Houses&rdquo; mean that if there be an extension of time there must be an agreement between <Col N="1118" /> the two Houses.  There has been an extension of time and there is no provision in this Article that there is, and that that agreement, that extension of time, can be regarded as legalised, or that the provision has not become null and void so far as this particular Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different things.  A Bill is deemed to be passed by both Houses. That is one thing.  The Bill is not then law.  It has to be presented for signature. When it has been signed it becomes law.  What is contended here appears to be this, that after two hundred and seventy days this Bill is deemed to be passed by the two Houses, and after that period, therefore, they can do nothing more with it. They cannot come to any agreement. They can come to an agreement while the two hundred and seventy days are running.  After the two hundred and seventy days have run they cannot make an agreement about something which has passed from them.  That seems to me to be the Attorney-General's opinion, as given by the Minister.  This is a very interesting question, and I am not objecting to discussion. The question has been raised as to whether we could advise the Executive Council to carry out Article 41 of the Constitution.  It would raise a very interesting point of order as to whether a Motion advising the Executive Council to carry out an Article of the Constitution which on the face of it appears to be mandatory, could be accepted at all.  The position that we are in is that the Bill is deemed to be passed, and as far as we are concerned the position the Executive Council are in is that they are compelled by the Constitution to present it for signature, and that even if we did not want them to do it they could not agree not to do so; they would find themselves compelled to do it.  I think that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is a very interesting and difficult point, and, I am afraid, likely to be dangerous. The Executive Council has failed for so many days, according to the Minister's statement, and I am more or less obliged to recognise its validity, <Col N="1119" /> having re-read the article, to carry out the requirements of the Constitution. Will they be any greater culprits if they continue in that path of wrong-doing for a few more days?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that at the next meeting of the Executive Council the necessary order would be obtained with regard to referring the Bill to the Governor-General for his signature, and that probably the Bill would not be signed until Saturday, or the Act would not be operative law until next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really trying to play upon words.

That would be a very serious and very difficult position.  I would like to know whether arrangements have been made, for instance, or is it intended that there shall be regulations made regarding a Referendum, because this is distinctly a position which invites the operation of this Referendum Article, whether by the action of the Dáil or by the action of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that we should go on with the present Bill. The Minister for Justice pointed out that he would give us two days during this week and in those two days we might be able to put the Bill through. That would do away with all the legal arguments that may be put forward, and all the doubts as to whether the Bill of last year would be proper law at all.  I would ask the Minister for Justice if he would give us these two days.  He practically told us about ten minutes ago that he would do so, and that would mean repealing that terrible Act of last year.  Bad as the one we have now is we will settle it in two days.  I would like him to give us Wednesday and Thursday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned I will give the Deputy six months with a light heart.  What I meant was that there is really nothing gained if we give two or three days to the Committee Stage of this Bill, and leave it at that.  It would be better that we would have the adjournment and take up the Bill in October, when we meet again.  Therefore, I would not propose to take up the consideration of this Bill again this Session unless it was the wish of the Dáil that we should proceed with it, with a view to putting it through all its stages, and with a view to its becoming law before the adjournment.  It is simply that there is no use keeping Deputies here and postponing the adjournment merely for the sake of concluding the Committee Stage of the Bill.  If the Dáil wishes to make the Bill law this side of the adjournment we will take it up, forge ahead with it, and send it to the Seanad in the hope that they would consent to it.</P>

      <P>This question has been sprung upon most of us since we came into the House, and I think that the fairest way would be to adjourn it, to take it as the first business to-morrow, and take a decision there and then as to whether we would proceed with this Bill or let the Bill that was passed last year become law.  There are many Deputies I know who have an interest in this, and who are not here to-day, and who have had no notice of this.  I think it would be very sensible to let it come up first to-morrow, and we need not waste much time.  We could proceed with the present Bill or let it hang over until October.</P>

Although I am prepared to vote upon it, I think a responsibility of that kind should be laid on the eighty-three members who attended at the Committee Stage.  I am prepared to support the suggestion of Deputy Hughes with the qualification that it should be taken on Wednesday so that members will have time to get here by then.  I think everybody who supported the Second Reading would, to be consistent, be anxious to see the Bill go through.  I hope that the Minister will not decide to spring the motion upon the House, although I believe he would be justified in doing so in view of his statement on Friday and the fact that it is on the Order Paper.  I think if we were to proceed with the Bill and give it final consideration the Seanad would do the same as they did previously, turn down the Bill and leave us another two hundred and seventy days before it could be dealt with.</P>

      <P>Surely there is responsibility on the Executive Council in this matter in allowing two hundred and seventy days to run without raising the matter in the Seanad.  As I am told&mdash;I was not a member of the Dáil at the time&mdash;it was taken up on the last day of last Session, and was not rejected, but postponed by the Seanad. In the interval the matter has not been raised in the Seanad, and can they be taken as having rejected a measure which was not brought up?  I think it is an important point constitutionally, because whatever decision is come to it is obviously going to bind procedure in future, and if it is going to be the procedure in future that if a Bill goes through this House and gets no decision in the Seanad, it automatically become law at the end of two hundred and seventy days.  That seems to me to be a very dangerous position.</P>

      <P>On the matter of this year's Bill, which it is proposed to discuss whether we take it further on Thursday, if the general opinion of the House can be sensed in any way I think we can be fairly satisfied generally that the House will not proceed with the Bill.  If it comes up on Thursday and there is a decision not to proceed with it at present, I support the idea that the Bill of last year becomes law.  We would then be up against the difficulty of which Deputy Johnson speaks, that this Bill is coming into law in peculiar circumstances, and there may be a feeling in the House that the Bill of last year would not get their approval if it passed through the House.  You may have, incorrectly or wrongly, an impression in the country that this Bill of last year which is to come into law, is a kind of illegal and wrong thing, and you might have a movement in the country to oppose it. I think that it is quite possible that we <Col N="1124" /> might get into difficulties in the country owing to a movement to oppose the Bill which would come into law under present circumstances.  In order to safeguard a position like that, if we decide on Thursday not to proceed with the present Bill, the Minister has not got the opinion of the Dáil with reference to last year's Bill.  He could then put forward a Motion to repeal last year's Bill.  I make this suggestion, not to have last year's Bill repealed, because I would not be in favour of repealing it, but in order to get the opinion of the House that it is right that last year's Bill should stand. I suggest that the Minister would put forward to the Dáil a Motion on these lines, say, on Thursday, if he comes to sense in the meantime that the decision of the House will be not to proceed with the present Bill.</P>

      <P>There is an important consideration that has not been dealt with.  The articles of the Constitution lays the duty on the Executive Council to lay before the Governor-General for his signature, a measure as soon as it has been passed or deemed to have been passed.  Consequently, at the expiration of nine months that became, under the Constitution, the duty of the Executive. That has not been done.  Suppose to rectify the omission the Bill is now signed, signed say, as the Minister mentioned, on Saturday next.  It then becomes statute law.  Now, in that way between Saturday, and the coming into law of the present measure, every judge on the bench from a District Justice upwards, will be obliged if counsel acts upon the law to treat it as a law, notwithstanding any intention on our part here to rectify, to modify, or to repeal it altogether.  I would suggest with all respect that the easier way in view of the difficulty that has arisen through mere oversight, even with a guilty conscience, the <i>mens rea</i>, is to let the matter remain.  No harm has been done, and as Deputy Johnson said by way of incidental remark, no penalty is incurred.</P>

      <P>On this matter I am not thinking of this Bill, but of other Bills being introduced by the Dáil and being sent to the Seanad.  The Seanad is to be an elected Chamber, but the Seanad is subordinate.  The Dáil is supreme as far as legislation is concerned, but supposing a dissolution takes place, and the country decides definitely on that Bill, and declares that the Dáil is not competent and worthy of confidence. Notwithstanding that I think the Minister's interpretation is right.  At first I thought it was wrong.  The procedure is that the Dáil has passed into law a certain measure the country disapproves of, and has elected a new Dáil to supplant the old one.  There, I think, the obvious procedure is the one outlined by Deputy Mulcahy that the new Dáil must repeal the Bill.  I think that is the position.</P>

In the present case, the Seanad did not make any change in the Bill.  I suggest that was the fault of the Seanad.  It <Col N="1126" /> did not exercise the rights it had.  The Seanad had an opportunity and failed to exercise the opportunity.  I do not see any failure on the Executive Council in that respect.</P>

These two amendments provide that if a director of an amalgamated or absorbed company is appointed to be a member of the railway tribunal then he shall be entitled to compensation for the loss of his office as such director, but the proviso makes it clear that his salary as a member of the railway tribunal must be taken into account so that he does not get paid for both.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment which the Minister agrees to, and as far as I am concerned I have not any serious objection except in so far as the principle of the Bill is concerned. Under the Bill the directors of the companies may be remunerated; I do not think it is &ldquo;shall be.&rdquo;  I think it is a case of &ldquo;may&rdquo; subject to the shareholders agreeing that their services have merited the payment, which will be made out of the funds of the amalgamated company.  This seems to me to imply that a directorship is a pensionable job.  Now, the principal exception I have to that is, I think the clause in the Bill has operated&mdash;I would not like to say exactly &ldquo;operated&rdquo;&mdash; but we assume for instance that no such <Col N="1128" /> clause or provision has been made in the Bill.  I rather think the attitude I have taken up in this House would have been considerably strengthened; in other words, that the intention of the Executive, not necessary deliberate, is in the nature of a bribe.</P>
      <P>I feel that the matter of remuneration to the directors is one as between the shareholders and the directors themselves, and the introduction of any such provision as this is, in my judgement, objectionable.  The amendment, that if one of the directors is put on the tribunal his remuneration from the shareholders shall be taken into consideration, seems to me to recognise the extraordinary change that the Bill puts into operation.  It is not for me to say that the directors who are being remunerated are not entirely worthy of that remuneration, or that the remuneration they are going to get is in any way excessive, but I do say, whatever the effect may be, that it is wrong in principle and practice to recognise it in this way in the Bill.  The same thing has operated in this Bill in connection with the employees.  Rightly and properly the Labour Party in the Dáil has striven to get the best arrangement possible for the employees, but in so far as this is a <i>quid pro quo</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to understand where Deputy Hewat's argument is leading us.  Deputy Hewat, as well as the Minister, I am sure, realises that there are no powers given to the tribunal in the Bill which can prevent the shareholders of any of the absorbed or amalgamated companies from giving to their directors by private arrangement anything which they think fit.  But I think it is quite right and proper, if the director of a railway <Col N="1129" /> company becomes a member of the railway tribunal, that the compensation so given should be taken into consideration, in the same way as any person pensioned under Article X. of the Treaty will be treated if he returns to the service of the State.  It is quite possible that the shareholders, provided a good bargain is made on the transfer, may decide to give five or ten years' fees to the directors, and there is nothing in the Bill under which the Government, or the tribunal, could interfere with the wish of the shareholders if they so decided.</P>

    <P>Amendments 7 and 8 go together. They deal with Section 12, which has reference to the employees of the Irish Railway Clearing House.

I am inclined to think it was the overbearing eloquence of the members of the Seanad, who were not tied, as I anticipated, by the Party machine, in the same way as Deputies here are tied.  At any rate, I recognise that my eloquence is not equal to that of the members of the Seanad, who are interested in this matter. In any case, this as well as several other amendments, are welcomed from this side of the House as they will confer the same privileges on the staff of the Railway Clearing House as have been conferred on the servants, or direct employees, of the amalgamating companies.  Whether they are due to the generosity of the Minister, or to pressure, or the eloquence of Senators, I do not know.</P>

This is an amendment over which a certain amount of heat was generated in the Seanad, and on account of which I suffered certain misrepresentation.  The real effect of the amendment is to cut out the words &ldquo;or other representatives&rdquo; in line 55 of Section 55, sub-section (1).  It was pointed out that the whole trades union procedure had been, to a certain extent, weakened by the omission of these words.  There were certain objections, that with these words individual agreements might have to be made with men not members of a trades union, and it was eventually decided that the risk of these men coming forward in large numbers was small.

      <P>I think this amendment is somewhat extraordinary; extraordinary in so far as it comes from the Seanad to the Dáil, extraordinary in so far as an amendment of this importance could be slipped into a Bill of this sort; and in my judgment extraordinary that it should have been accepted in this way.  This is a Railways Bill and the amendment proposes to depart <Col N="1133" /> from, I think, the ordinary regulation of trading companies, and to insert a section that Irish shall be a compulsory subject at such examinations. I feel that I am not the proper person to raise the matter in the Dáil.  But I feel that I would like to raise it because of its importance, not necessarily in connection with this Bill, but because it is introducing a proviso that at the examinations for railway clerks, Irish is to be compulsory within a comparatively short time. Really, I do not see why candidates for railway clerkships should be selected for this posture.  I imagine that that is a large national question that would have to be decided on broader lines other than that of a Railways Bill. While still in the incubation stage, this Bill lays it down that a knowledge of Irish is essential for a candidate going forward for examination as a railway clerk.  Why introduce it in this way? Why is it more necessary for a railway clerk to know Irish than it is for a railway porter, or, for that matter, a railway director?  True, it is a relatively easy matter for brilliant students such as we have in the Dáil to absorb a new language readily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I do not know Irish, and I think it would be with great difficulty I could acquire it at my time of life and with all my occupations. At all events it strikes me as out of place in this measure, not that I have any sentiment in the matter.  I think it must be recognised that the addition of a subject like Irish to an examination is very heavy for the mass of the young people of this country.  It means that where in the past one language was sufficient, or was at least considered sufficient, two languages will have to be acquired in the future.  I am not sufficient of an educationalist to discuss that particular point.  I think it is an important point and so large that I submit to the Dáil that it is not right that it should be dealt with piece-meal, as it is dealt with in this Railways Bill. That is my protest and it is confined within the area of what I have said.  I must not be taken in any way as being against the introduction of the Irish language in any shape or form.  I do think, however, that its introduction should be well ordered, and that a provision <Col N="1134" /> of this sort, in such a Bill as this, and within such a short time, may act very unfairly against candidates who have to acquire this knowledge before they go for examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise merely to relieve the mind of Deputy Hewat. He makes this plea because he feels that some wrong is inflicted upon the youth of Ireland in this matter.  I can assure him from the experience of an examiner that there are no grounds for what he fears.  Fully 20 years ago the principle of appointing railway clerks as a result of competitive examinations was put into practice here.  In the beginning, and until now, a knowledge of Irish was included as one of the optional subjecte.  At first some 7, 8 or 9 out of, say, 20, 40 or 50 candidates took the subject and displayed a very indifferent knowledge of it, just as a few occasionally, in some of the examinations that permitted them, took French and presented themselves for French with woeful results.  In recent years the situation is completely changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience is that forty-seven out of fifty-five candidates present in Irish, and go through the requirements of the programme wonderfully well.  It consists in part of a dictation exercise in Irish, and the translation of a difficult piece of English into Irish.  What is now going to happen through the operation of a compulsory clause is that something like seven to ten per cent. of the candidates will be obliged to take the subject.  As regards the rest, compulsion is not required, because they take and have for years taken the subject voluntarily and have qualified in it.  That, I think, ought to relieve the Deputy's mind to a considerable extent.  In recent years the schools are better equipped for training these candidates in Irish.  There is no difficulty whatever in getting lessons regularly in these schools, but there was in the past.  Deputy Hewat's plea would have been well founded, and it would be a plea raised against what would operate unfairly if it had been made twenty or twenty-five years ago.  But it is wholly out of date now.  The idea is <Col N="1135" /> that proficiency in a language is a test not merely of ability, but is also an indication of the type of schooling generally which the candidate has received, and so it has become a practice, and is a wise practice on the part of candidates, to take up all the subjects which their schools provide them with facilities for taking up.  It rarely happens that any of these candidates present a subject of which they have only a smattering.  Even in the case of French, and in Latin, which is a subject in the Midland Great Western programme, I might say that it has not infrequently happened that while candidates did well in Latin, they only did fairly well in French.  In my opening remarks I spoke of French and said that the results in it had been woeful in the extreme as compared with the marks secured by candidates who had taken Irish instead.</P>

      <P>I desire to point out that under this Section two examinations are provided for.  I do not know whether Deputy Professor Magennis is aware of that fact.  There is an outside competitive examination, and there is also what we may call an internal competitive examination.  The outside competitive examination is open to all residents in the Saorstát, but the internal examination is limited to persons in the employment of the amalgamated company, or the children of such persons.</P>

I am anxious to know, in the case of a servant who shows ability in one Department, and desires to be promoted to another Department, whether a proposal of this kind would stop him from graduating in the service, or whether this proposal only applies to applicants who enter the service by open examination. If it only applied in the latter case, there would not be the same objection at all to it, though I do not think it is desirable to make Irish compulsory. The point I want information on is whether this proposal applies to the limited examination?</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy Hewat in a previous debate on this Bill, and if I remember his words rightly he said he agreed that this Bill was a stepping-stone to nationalisation. I am prepared to agree that that is the position.  I am prepared to say that nationalisation would be easier and more beneficial to the community by an immediate step on the part of the Government to nationalise from the thirty-two companies rather than to adopt the methods outlined in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Deputy accepts something I say as being true.  However, if it is, as I believe it is, an easier method to the end I have in view, then I say that if we are to have railway nationalisation, or a nationalised railway system we must make provision by examination that those who enter the clerical grades of the service shall thoroughly understand the Irish language.  That is why <Col N="1137" /> I welcome this amendment, and I welcome it all the more because it has come from the Seanad.  I would have thought, in the ordinary course of events, that Deputy Hewat would agree to any amendment, without question, that would come from the Seanad to a Bill, even a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister will answer the points raised by Deputy Good, whether Irish is going to be a compulsory subject for the examination of any limited number of individuals, say the sons of railway men or others who may enter the clerical service of the future amalgamated company.  The Minister has power, under sub-section (3) to approve or to disapprove of the method and of the number of those who may be allowed to go for what is known as the limited competitive examinations.  I hope that the present Minister, or any Minister who may succeed him, will see that this limited competitive examination will not be used as a back-door method for getting into the railway service.  We had back-door methods, as well as some front-door methods, for getting into the service in the past, and I hope that an end will be put to them.  If there is one thing more than another that I look forward to in connection with this Bill, is is that entrance to the clerical service of the future amalgamated company shall be by open competitive examination. If Deputy Good stands for efficiency and for good business methods he should support in this House, and outside it, the men who enter the public service, the railway service, or indeed any big business concern, by ability alone and not by any other method.</P>

      <P>It was only as the result of years of agitation and of pressure brought to bear on railway shareholders and others that the principle of competitive examination for entrance to the railway service was established.  I would like to impress upon the Minister the necessity of seeing that if Irish is <Col N="1138" /> made compulsory for railway examinations that even those who may be allowed to enter for this limited competitive examination, and I hope the number will be few, will have to take Irish as a compulsory subject.</P>

      <P>As we have gone on with this discussion, I think it well to draw attention to Article 4 of the Constitution, which says that: &ldquo;The national language of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) is the Irish language, but the English language shall be equally recognised as the official language.&rdquo;  In addition to what Deputy Professor Magennis has said with a view to relieving the fears of Deputy Hewat as to the strain that will be put on candidates who have to take Irish for these examinations, I think that when Deputy Hewat sees the results of what has been done in our primary and secondary schools for the national language that he will admit the strain will be very little indeed. It was remarked, I think, during the progress of the discussions on the Education Estimates, that some of the publications with regard to the programme of work that is being done in our primary and secondary schools had not been placed on the Table of the House.  When they have been so placed and when Deputies have had an opportunity of examining them, I think that any fears that Deputy Hewat may have as to the difficulties and the strain imposed on candidates at these examinations by reason of making the national language compulsory, will be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to determine the point raised here.  That will lie for determination elsewhere.  The phrase that Irish shall be a compulsory subject at such examinations is put in at the end of sub-section (1), and it might, in that way, be considered to have application only to open competitive examinations.  I do not think that the point raised that all appointments shall be made by means of open competitive examinations would have the effect of bringing compulsory Irish down immediately to the limit of competitive examinations, because the clause starts with <Col N="1139" /> the words &ldquo;save as hereinafter in this section provided,&rdquo; nor do I think Deputy Davin is right in thinking that the Minister has power to approve of the special regulation, as well as of the proportion of the vacancies to be left to the limited examination.  All the Minister has power to approve is the proportion of the vacancies.  I think that gives the Minister a considerable lever over the companies.</P>
      <P>He may, for instance, if not satisfied that the examination was going to be of a suitable type, limit the proportion to such a small number that it might be entirely useless, and, consequently, although I think the amendment moved in the Seanad intended to apply to all examinations, that was not made clear, but if so intended it might have come better as a new sub-section by itself, or as an introductory remark with regard to the whole examinations.</P>
      <P>I think sub-section (3) as drafted will give the Minister sufficient power to have Irish made compulsory in all examinations, open or limited, for entrance to the clerical service.  With regard to Deputy Hewart's fear, the point has been well stressed by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Magennis regarding how Irish has been made compulsory for most examinations in the country.  I want to stress one other matter, and it is this: that candidates for these examinations are likely to have plenty of time to prepare, because with the cutting down of staffs rendered necessary by this Bill there does not seem to be much hope of vacancies for years to come, and there will be plenty of time for candidates to readjust themselves to the new conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was one over which there was considerable discussion in the Seanad.  As the sub-section left the Dáil, Deputies will see that where an order was about to be made for the acquisition of land the provision was that the Minister <Col N="1141" /> shall give public notice in such manner as he may consider best adapted for informing the persons likely to be affected by the order.  It was moved to amend that by providing that the Minister should give notice to all persons having an interest in the land about to be acquired, but the argument was urged that it was notoriously difficult to trace and it would be almost impossible to provide that nobody was left out, and, consequently, that there might be any amount of legal actions following, piling up afterwards where any power to acquire land was sought.  Reference was made to the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845, and I was asked to incorporate in this Bill the provisions as to notice in the 1845 Act, but when I came to look up that Act I found that there was express provision excluding from Ireland or from the railways in Ireland, the requirement as to notice on the acquisition of land; but under a later Act of 1851 I found the form of words which are pretty well those now in the amendment before us, that is to say, that notice should be published once in the <i>Gazette</i> (now replaced by the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>) and once in each of three successive weeks in some one and the same newspaper circulating in the county or counties in which the land is situate.  That amendment moved to the previous amendment met with the acceptance of the Seanad, and as it does seem to provide for better notice being given to those whose land may be acquired and does not, at the same time, seem to entail the enormous number of objections that might have arisen from the other amendment as moved, I would press the acceptance of this amendment on the Dáil.</P>

And I did say that if the adoption of this proposal seemed to throw an undue burthen on the company, then we might have to seek to limit the scope of the amendment.

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 10 of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, it shall be lawful for the amalgamated company to substitute for the Shareholders' Address Book provided for under that section a card or other index (of a type to be approved by the auditors of the amalgamated company) containing the names and addresses of the several shareholders of the amalgamated company and that section in its application to the amalgamated company shall be read any have effect accordingly, and when such card or other index has been so substituted <Col N="1144" /> Section 34 of the Regulation of Railways Act, 1868, shall cease to apply to the amalgamated company: Provided that the charge made for a copy of such card or other index shall not exceed the sum of £2 10s. 0d.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the said amendment.  This long amendment is actually one which appeared here before the Dáil in the name of Deputy Bryan Cooper, but, owing to his absence when the clause came on, that amendment was passed over.  It was, however, understood that it would be raised in the Seanad. It is a quite acceptable amendment. This amendment relieves the company from the necessity of printing a shareholders' address book, and substitutes for it a card index of the shareholders. They are the only people who have the right to obtain the address book. The printing of the address book put a considerable expense on the company which was not met by the number of copies sold.  In the case of one particular company, the cost of printing a particular address book was something approaching £250, and the revenue from the sale of the copies was £2 10s.  This amendment provides for the preparation of a card or other index containing the names and addresses of the shareholders, a copy of which may be obtained at a cost not exceeding £2 10s.</P>

      <P>This amendment has reference to the Cork City Railways, which, I think, Deputy Johnson sought to include in the Bill on the Committee Stage.  I took objection to it at the time.  I think I did say at the time that there was an obvious wish to include the Cork City Railways with other railways in the list for absorption or amalgamation. But it was not possible to include them at that time.  But since that time a certain arrangement has been made between the Great Southern and Western Railway Company and the Great Western Railway Company of England, and the result of that arrangement is that the Cork City Railways may be included in the Bill.  If I am asked here to state what is the scope of that arrangement I cannot say what it is, but I can say this, that full details of it will appear in the absorption scheme.  It will then be revealed.</P>

      <P>I do not think that this amendment should be allowed to pass in its present form unless the other proposals will also be accepted, such as the proposal to include the Blessington and the Lucan Tramways.  The same arguments apply to them as to the Cork City Railways.  I do not know if the Minister is able to say anything about the possibility of any absorption of these two County Dublin railways. Before we agree with the Seanad amendment in the case of the Cork City Railways, I should like to know what are the possibilities of any absorption of the Lucan and Blessington Railways. It is a pity to allow this Bill to go through without something being done for County Dublin, and I should like to ask the Minister if he can say anything at all about any negotiations that may have taken place in regard to <Col N="1146" /> the Lucan Railway and the Blessington Railway.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that it had been decided to include the Cork City Railways as a result of some agreement that has taken place between the time when the Bill passed the Dáil and the present time.  Has the Minister seen the agreement between the Great Western Railway Company of England and the Great Southern and Western Railway Company in this matter?  And does he consider it necessary, in order to persuade the Dáil that this is a good and proper amendment, that some information as regards the terms of the agreement should be revealed now and not after the Bill has become law?</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson has made a mistake if he thinks that the Cork City Railways were included in any amendment with the Dublin and Blessington or the Dublin and Lucan Railways or Tramways.  As I remember, the Cork City Railways were included in his amendment with the Fishguard and Rosslare line.  In their inclusion there were many objections, and these objections still persist.  But there has been a particular arrangement, the details of which I am not going to enter into here and now&mdash;an arrangement which makes it possible to include the Cork City Railways.  I do not say that there has been an arrangement to take over the Cork City Railways on a particular basis, or on certain terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not answering, and I do not intend to answer the question whether or not I have seen this scheme.  It does not arise.  All I have to say is that here has been a certain arrangement made to include the Cork City Railways under the Bill. How they will be brought in and the terms under which they will be brought in will be defined by the absorption scheme, and that absorption scheme will, if not agreed to, come before the <Col N="1147" /> tribunal.  The Dublin and Lucan line and the Dublin and Blessington line could always have been taken in if there was not some obstacle in the way of their being taken in.  But it was not thought advisable to take them in.  The object of the Bill was not to gather in all the bankrupt concerns and to load them on to the amalgamated undertakings. The idea was to get amalgamated all the transport undertakings where economy seemed likely to be affected as the result of the amalgamation. The Dublin and Lucan and the Dublin and Blessington undertakings did not come under these conditions, and have not yet made their way into the Bill.  If certain arrangements are arrived at afterwards, there is power under Section 60 to take them in.  I do not suppose that it is the intention of the Deputy to include the Dublin and Blessington or the Dublin and Lucan lines.  All I am asking the Dáil to do is to agree to the inclusion of the Cork City Railways and to insert the words &ldquo;Cork City Railways&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;Cork and Muskerry Light Railways Company, Limited.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I submit that it is not fair&mdash;I should not like to say that the Minister is unfair&mdash;to say that certain information will be revealed after the terms of this Bill have gone beyond any hope of redemption.  If the Minister has information at his disposal I submit that the right and proper time to give that information to the Dáil is now, if he wishes the Dáil to accept, without any further opposition, the amendment which he has moved.  He does not give any good reasons to the Dáil to justify his refusal. I must come to the conclusion that the Minister has seen the preliminary scheme.  It may be that, with the great deal of other work that he has to do, he has not at the moment time himself to dive into this scheme, hidden in some cupboard in the Government offices.  To that extent he has assumed for the time being the place of the particular tribunal, or of the work that that tribunal at a later stage will have to perform.  Perhaps he has at his disposal the names of the hidden geniuses who will appear in the near future as <Col N="1148" /> the members of this tribunal, and perhaps this will be the proper occasion&mdash; I do not think I can press for this&mdash; for him to announce the names of the supermen, as Deputy Hewat would call them, who are to control the destinies of the Irish railways in the future.</P>

The Schedule still has reference to people who were on the 3rd day of April, 1924, officers or servants of any of the amalgamating or absorbed companies for a period of five years, but this amendment provides for those who were less than a period of five years, that to such officers or servants a gratuity may be given, and the gratuity is set out in the end of the amendment.</P>

It is one of those things which may not cost much, but which might cost a whole lot; but I think it is against the practice of the Ministry to give us any information of that sort.  They generally tell us they have not got it, or something of that sort, or that it is not their business to provide it, but perhaps he could give us some approximation as to what it might cost.</P>

      <P>I thought until now that Deputy Hewat was a business man, but if he read the Bill rightly how could he ask the Minister to give the amount that would be involved in the acceptance of this amendment, when the Minister himself, and perhaps the future directors of the amalgamated company, do not know the number of men who would be declared redundant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister can give it, but I fail to see how he can get it for the reasons I have given.  I tried when a similar amendment was moved in the Committee Stage in the Dáil to have this done, seeing that Deputy Hewat had already voted for a similar provision for the superannuation of officers who had retired from the Local Government Department on the same basis as is now proposed in the case of railway officials.  That was accepted in the Dáil in the case of redundant officers with service under five years.  It may be news to Deputy Hewat to know that arrangements have been made for one company, provided these arrangements are ratified by the shareholders, that the directors <Col N="1150" /> of this company will get a retiring allowance, or pension, if you like, based on a salary of five years.  I fail to see why Deputy Hewat should object to giving the same concession to any members of the staff of the company who may be retired as a result of the creation of this new amalgamated company. However, as I pointed out, the same thing had been accepted by the Minister for Local Government in the Bill introduced, giving the same terms to the Local Government officials who might be declared redundant under that Bill.  There is every reason for this amendment, and I congratulate the Minister that as a result either of the pressure put on him by the Seanad, or of his own wisdom, he has brought forward this amendment.  I am sure Deputy Hewat will not oppose it now.</P>

      <P>This amendment has reference to one of the most difficult points with which we had to deal in this Schedule.  It will be remembered that, as at first brought forward, <Col N="1152" /> the amendment went much further than the intention.  The intention was to exclude from the provisions of the Schedule officials who had received promotion since the Government warning went out with regard to a likely amalgamation or a grouping scheme. It was then pointed out that it did exclude men who had received promotion in the ordinary way.  I think Deputy O'Connell brought up that at first, and I introduced an amendment on the Report Stage, which made it have reference to the word promotion, and not increase of pay.  I thought that amendment would have met the case.  But Senator O'Farrell raised the further point that as it then stood the section would cut out from the provision of the Schedule any official who received promotion in the ordinary way in this period, and this amendment is now put in to protect the cases of those mentioned.  The amendment, it is felt, and it was argued, and is still believed will meet all the cases raised either here or in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 2, page 3, lines 36 and 43, after the word &ldquo;cow-keepers&rdquo; in each case to add the words &ldquo;or the business of manufacturing butter from cream which has been separated by means of centrifugal force at the place of production of the milk and delivered at the place of manufacture in a fresh condition and which complies with special regulations to be made by the Minister in regard to this method of manufacture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there are several amendments down dealing with this matter.  I suppose we will have to deal with them as we come to them. My object in putting down this amendment is to allow a certain class of <Col N="1158" /> butter-manufacturing business in this country to be included in the category of creameries and to allow them to use the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; in connection with the product which they manufacture. The matter was very fully discussed at the Special Committee and I do not know if it is necessary to go into all the questions which we went into at that Committee.  I have given the matter a good deal of thought both then and since, and I am still inclined to think that it would be to the advantage of the creamery business of this country if such a class of factory were included in the category.  I refer to factories where the milk, which is separated at the farms by means of hand separators, is brought in and pasteurised. Sometimes the cream is actually mixed with the milk and I think should be mixed with the milk. It is separated and then manufactured into butter.  As the Bill stands at present, according to the definition clause, such factories would not be entitled to label their product &ldquo;creamery butter&rdquo; and it would have to go to the outside market labelled as &ldquo;factory butter.&rdquo;  It is well known that factory butter, on the average, commands a much lower price than creamery butter.  I think it may be said that factory butter is something like £1 per cwt. lower in price than creamery butter.  There is, as least, one business of that kind carried on in this country and that business has been producing as good a product as any creamery in the country.  It will inflict the gravest possible hardship on that business if they are not permitted to use the word &ldquo;creamery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another important aspect of the question and that is the future of the Irish dairy business.  What would be the tendency in the development of that business?  I am inclined to think that if such businesses are forbidden to use the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; in regard to their product, it will have the effect of curtailing what I believe will be their natural development.  There are many parts of the country where the ordinary creamery business cannot be carried on.  The reason for that is obvious.  The supply of milk available is not sufficient to warrant the establishment <Col N="1159" /> of an ordinary creamery. There is a certain minimum supply required and except that minimum supply is available within reasonable distance of a creamery, such a creamery on the ordinary lines of milk-gathering cannot be established.  I think it would be a mistake to hinder or put any obstacles in the way of establishing what I consider to be the next best thing&mdash;that is creameries where the cream is manufactured into butter from the cream gathered from farms.  I do acknowledge that such butter runs the chance of not being quite as good as butter manufactured in the creameries as they are at present but I do think that, with proper regulation and strict regulation and with the cream collected daily from the farmers&mdash;with such regulations by the Department and with strict regulations by the factories themselves with regard pasteurisation and re-separation of the cream, commingled with a certain quantity of new milk, butter of a very high quality could be made in those factories. The point I want to emphasise most is, that if you prohibit by the Act those creameries from calling their product &ldquo;creamery butter&rdquo; you will injure them so badly that the whole tendency of development in that direction will be checked or stopped altogether, with the result that you will crystallise the present system of making butter on the farms.  I am not an advocate of maintaining or crystallising that system, because I do not think you can make satisfactory butter on the farm as a regular thing.  I do know that excellent butter can be made on the farm, but I do know, too, that very bad butter is often made on a farm.  It is well known that when that farm butter goes into the shops and is put on the counter it appears to be fresh and in excellent condition, but in the course of a week that butter is quite unfit for human consumption.  I think we should, where farmers cannot establish creameries, give them the chance of establishing the next best thing.  The next best thing, in my opinion, is the cream-gathering factory.  I think we ought to give those factories the right to apply the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; to their products.</P>

      <P>It may shorten discussion if I state what we propose to do in connection with the points that Deputy Heffernan has dealt with.  There are two sides to every question.  Unfortunately, as I am in charge of the Bill, I must weigh up the advantages and disadvantages and decide whether the balance is with the advantages or the disadvantages.  Deputy Heffernan is in a different position.  He can afford to treat of only one side of the case and leave it at that.  We all realise the case for the particular type of institution which he mentioned, namely, an institution that gathers cream and makes butter out of it. There is a strong case on the one side, but the question is: Is there a stronger case on the other?  I do not intend to state that now.  We debated that in the Special Committee, and probably everybody here who is interested in the subject knows the merits of the case.  Deputy Heffernan has an amendment, No. 14, in which he provides for a special register for cream-gathering institutions, and I take it that what he is definitely standing for now is that every cream-gathering institution should have the right to the use of the term &ldquo;creamery butter&rdquo;<i>in saecula saeculorum.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the provision we have inserted to meet this case is as follows. We are establishing an additional register, and we call the creameries which are registered in it manufacturing exporters, so that each particular institution need not be under the necessity of submitting to the indignity of calling themselves butter factories; they can call themselves by a separate name, namely, manufacturing exporters.  We have provision for that in the amendment, and, in addition, in <Col N="1161" /> amendment No. 53 there is the following provision:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may if and when during three years from the passing of this Act the special circumstances of the case justify him in so doing, grant to the registered proprietor of any particular premises registered in the register of manufacturing exporters a licence to use the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; in relation to such premises, and any such licence may be granted subject to such conditions and for such time (not extending beyond three years from the passing of this Act) and may be revoked as and when the Minister thinks proper.</P>
      <P>That is to say, there is power in the Bill to allow any premises registered in the register of manufacturing exporters to use the term &ldquo;creamery butter&rdquo; in connection with the butter which they produce, and the difference between Deputy Heffernan and myself is that we only take that power for three years, and he apparently wants to introduce it into the Bill and to have it until such time as the Dáil thinks of a different method.  I do not intend to go into the merits of the case.  We have discussed them at great length in Committee, and there is no occasion to discuss them again. I do point out that that gets over the most important hardship.  It enables a particular institution to use the term &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; for three years: that is to say, to use the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; for such a time as is adequate to earn the national brand, and consequently establish themselves.  That was the real grievance, that if we pass this Bill suddenly they have to refrain from using the term &ldquo;creamery.&rdquo;  They would immediately begin to lose a certain amount of money because they would not be able to use that term, and great hardship would be caused thereby.  This enables us to allow them to use the term for three years, and at the end of this time we will be better judges of possible developments than we are now.  Meanwhile, there is no harm done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, there are four alternatives before us. I think that perhaps the best thing <Col N="1162" /> would be to discuss the origin of this amendment.  I appreciate the Minister's idea, and the objection I see to it is that it gives the Ministry the power to grant the use of the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; to the lowest cream-gathering businesses.  I was rather inclined to take the other view of it: that it should not be the case of the Ministry having the power and the right to grant the use of the word &ldquo;creamery,&rdquo; that these businesses should have the right to use the word &ldquo;creamery,&rdquo; on their products, provided they met with regulations and requirements.  The objection I see to this is, that it may be said that the Ministry has shown favour.  I do not believe that they do so, but it may be said that they would show favour and that they would grant the right to use the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; here that they would not grant in another place.  My idea is that if one place can come up to the Minister's requirements and be entitled to use the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; I do not see why other places should not be able to come up to the Minister's requirements also.  I have an alternative amendment which establishes a fourth classification, but it is only an alternative to be used if my first is turned down.  I am not very definitely bound to these amendments. I may say that I have not given a great deal of thought to them, and have some doubt about them, but I think it better to allow these people the use of the word &ldquo;creamery,&rdquo; provided they comply with the regulations.  I do not want to press the matter too hard, but I would like to hear the view of some other Deputies on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that, whether, fortunately or otherwise, I am on the side of the Minister on this occasion.  I take it that the idea in the mind of the Minister in trying to hedge round the term &ldquo;creamery butter&rdquo; with certain safeguards is to secure that it shall stand for a very high standard of quality, and he defines a certain process to secure that, that is to say, in the creameries which are defined as such in the Bill milk is delivered daily straight from the cow, whereas in the cases of the cream-gathering stations the cream may have been kept <Col N="1163" /> over a number of days on the premises of the farmer who separated the milk, and, as Deputy Heffernan pointed out, there have been circumstances where the butter manufactured on such premises has not been up to a high standard, a standard that would justify something even less than a standard of creamery butter.  The cream may be separated in a house which may be clean or unclean; in a separator which is clean or unclean, or stored in a place which is similarly situated, and there would be a very, very serious difference in the circumstances affecting the gathering of such cream from the circumstances where the creamery butter was a result of daily supplies of material fresh from the cow.  The Minister has indicated that he has taken certain powers under this Bill to grant licences to such cream-gathering stations to use the term &ldquo;creamery.&rdquo;  I hope that he will be very cautious.  I have had put before me within the past week or so the circumstances of the particular institution that Deputy Heffernan has in mind, and possibly it would be a great hardship to them if they were deprived of the use of the word &ldquo;creamery.&rdquo; But the question is: does that term stand for a certain quality of butter made under particular circumstances, and does this institution to which Deputy Heffernan refers comply with these conditions?  It is not the immediate result, the quality that is established as a result of the immediate examination, but all the other things that enter into and make for a certain definition as to what &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; is. I think that the Minister is right in his attitude on this amendment.  I have considerable doubts as to whether he is right in his idea which is expressed in amendment 53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were in Committee I moved an amendment with a view to having this matter discussed, and I stated then that I was in doubt as to the merits of the proposition that cream gathered from houses and sent to a creamery should be considered within the limits of the term &ldquo;creamery&rdquo;; that the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; should not be applied to an institution <Col N="1164" /> which gathers cream and makes butter therefrom.  I was in doubt then.  I am not so much in doubt now.  I am convinced that at the present stage it would be undesirable to allow freedom to creameries to gather cream from the suppliers for the purpose of mixing with whole milk or with other cream, and making butter therefrom and allowing it to be called &ldquo;creamery butter.&rdquo;  We must have in mind all the time that creamery butter is a name, and the term &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; commands a certain goodwill.  The object of the Bill is to increase the value of that goodwill, and it is intended to impose stricter limitations upon creameries and to prevent the use of the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; unless the butter is made under specified conditions. Now, I am convinced that at the present stage in the development of the butter-making and the milk-producing industry in this country that there is a certain risk attaching to allowing the cream-gathering practice to develop, and the use of the term &ldquo;creamery butter&rdquo; allowed to such institution.  Notwithstanding that I believe that we should look forward to a time when the farming practices will have improved and when the practice of separating milk in the farm, provided that farm is well equipped and has a clean dairy, may be a development we should encourage rather than discourage. I do not think that time has arrived, and, in my opinion, the Minister's proposition is the best way to meet the possibilities of that future development, and yet to safeguard the immediate interests of the creamery system. While saying that I am inclined to think the Minister should alter the terms of his own proposition.  I am not sure that three years is long enough, because the value of the national brand as a marketable proposition will not have established itself by then, and such creameries as are at present using the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; as applied to butter, although they are gathering cream at the farmhouses, will not have been able to replace the national brand, at least the value of the national brand will not have been able to replace the loss of value attached to the deprivation of the use of the word <Col N="1165" />&ldquo;cremery.&rdquo;  I suggest that is a possibility&mdash;that within three years the value of the national brand will not have increased the value of the butter sufficiently to meet the loss which would be occasioned by a well-conducted cream-gathering factory if it were obliged to renounce the use of the word &ldquo;creamery.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of three years.  I am inclined to think five years would be better, provided the Minister has the power to revoke.  The Minister will see when I am finished that it is not a matter of three or five years, provided he has not only the power to revoke, but the power to extend, if within three years it has been found there has been such an improvement in the conduct of farmhouses and dairying generally&mdash; that the farmhouses which are separating their own milk would be able to pass any test, and that, therefore, the cream gathered for use in the creamery would justify the continued use of the word &ldquo;creamery.&rdquo;  We should not insist on the revocation of such licences at the end of that time.  I suggest we should retain for the Minister under the Bill not merely the power to revoke, but also the power to extend the period of those licences.  It may be that the tendency in the country will be towards home-separating, and, notwithstanding the arguments that have been used now, and the arguments that we heard in Committee, I believe if it were found practicable it would be a beneficial thing for cream to be separated in the farmhouse.  It would not be entirely beneficial to the marketing-value of the butter, but I think it would be beneficial to the country, to the homes of the farmers, and their labourers.  I think you would have a better chance of having a bigger supply of milk for home consumption. In a general way it is a desirable tendency, and if it could be effected under hygienic conditions and with efficient and cleanly work on the farm we should not utterly destroy it.  Consequently I suggest to the Minister <Col N="1166" /> that while I think his proposition meets the immediate needs, we should still retain the power to extend the period beyond three years, and perhaps to consider even fixing five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions, so far as this matter is concerned, two distinct questions.  One is what I may call, if the phrase does not offend anyone, the vested interests of those who are already using the word &ldquo;creamery.&rdquo;  Undoubtedly they will be very hard hit in their trade before the national brand establishes itself, and, therefore, that may be regarded, if they are capable of fulfilling the conditions, as a reasonable and equitable substitute for the use of the word &ldquo;creamery.&rdquo;  The other is the question of future development.  As Deputy Johnson stated, future development may be on the lines of gathering cream and making butter.  So far as these two problems are concerned, and taking, as we must take, the present position of our knowledge in the matter, I must say that the Minister's proposed amendments meet the case much more safely than the amendment which we are now discussing.  So far as the term &ldquo;use&rdquo; is concerned, I must say that under Amendment No. 51 I did think that the term of use was generous.  I was rather surprised to see the Minister so readily grant three years.  Three years gives first of all, an opportunity for the national brand to establish itself&mdash;a fair principle, it seems to me, if it is going to establish itself, and, secondly, a principle for the Minister who is then in office to consider on what lines development is likely to take place.  After three years it should not be difficult for some satisfactory development to take place along the lines that it is sought to legislate for in Amendment No. 1, namely, cream-gathering institutions. It should be possible to amend that by legislation rather than by means of the experiment fancied by Deputy Johnson. Against the actual amendment on the Order Paper, I think this is rather dangerous. Deputy Heffernan says that he sees no reason why, on the average, these institutions should not produce satisfactory butter.  On the average <Col N="1167" /> they will, but that is not the aim of the Bill.  The aim of the Bill is to secure butter that is uniformly good.  I suggest to Deputy Heffernan that it would not be well to press this particular amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not desirous of pressing the amendment too far; but there are certain obstacles which I see involved in the Minister's intentions.  Deputy Johnson has made the matter a little bit easier, and I think that the Minister should consider his suggestion.  I am not concerned so much with vested interests, but I am concerned with future developments. I think the result of this would be to stop future developments, as people will not establish these cream-gathering institutions or factories if they are afraid that at the end of three years the right to use them will be taken away.  It will simply stop all development along these lines.  It is well known to the Minister, and probably to many Deputies, that some of the best butter coming into the London market is made on this system.  I believe that a large portion of New Zealand butter is made on this system, and it is made under conditions which would not be as good as ours.  A great deal of the cream is gathering for long periods, and is made into butter, having been specially treated by having acidity removed.  If my suggestion were adopted, the cream would be gathered in a fresh condition, and, that being so, I see no reason why the butter made in these factories should not be as good as that made in other creameries;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I do not want to stand too hard by my amendment, but I think the Minister might meet it in another way by extending the time.  I do not think that the developments which Deputy Johnson suggests in regard to farmhouses are feasible, as I do not believe that first-class butter can be made in farmhouses, as it would require pasteurisation, and I do not believe that you can have that on the farms.  I would suggest that the Minister should reconsider his amendment and proceed along the lines suggested by Deputy Johnson.  I admit <Col N="1168" /> that I feel inclined to argue a bit against myself, because I do see difficulties about it.  Some factories might not make a good quality of butter, but that might be got over by the enforcement of stringent regulations.</P>

      <P>I am not in the same position as Deputies Johnson, Heffernan and O'Sullivan.  Deputy Heffernan stated that the three years' limit would prevent new creameries of that kind springing up.  I was trying to obviate an immediate hardship with regard to existing institutions.  If you consider Deputy Heffernan's suggestion it might mean that a number of creameries, which are fully fledged and quite orthodox, might collect a little cream and say that they are entitled to do it.  It might mean, and it is thought very likely, that there will be no more new cream-gathering institutions springing up, but that orthodox creameries will collect cream and say that they are entitled to do it.  They will say, &ldquo;If so-and-so who are registered manufacturers and exporters have a right to make butter because they collect 20 per cent. milk and 80 per cent cream, why should we not have all the advantages of a creamery, considering that we collect 90 per cent. milk and 10 per cent. cream?&rdquo;  I do not contemplate that within three years any new institutions of that kind will spring up.  There are one or two existing institutions, and I want to give them fair play for three years, and give the Department of Agriculture a chance of considering the matter for that period in the light of changing conditions and the new experience which we will get as a result of this Bill.  From that point of view I would be against Deputy Johnson's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will, I think, confirm what I say, when I say that I have rather contemplated the possibility, if not under this Bill, under some future Bill, that he will take powers to examine farmhouses and the places where the milk is produced.  If that were done, then I say it would be quite a desirable development.  My only doubt in the matter as to the merit of this cream-gathering system arises <Col N="1169" /> from the fact that I know that the conditions in many farmhouses at present are not very satisfactory, but if one could ensure, before granting any licence, that the conditions are such as to warrant certificates of good care and good methods, I say that then it would be a desirable procedure to adopt for the good health of the country to encourage the cream-gathering system rather than the mere centralising system. I would hope that within three years we would arrive at a stage where the Minister would be bold enough to examine the methods of milk production in the farmhouses and the facilities for separating.</P>

      <P>I am not at one with the Deputy there.  It reduces itself to this.  We all agree that the immediate development of that system, namely, that existing creameries should start gathering cream is bad.  We all agree that it would be bad to do injustice to existing institutions.  Thirdly, it is agreed that during the next three years we should watch the developments of farmhouses with regard to this Bill, and if the developments are such as to justify us in this expense, this particular provision would be considered. We are in a totally different position now, inasmuch as we will have the Dáil sitting here always.  Formerly three Dairy Bills went to the British Parliament and were crowded out. There was not time to consider them. It is always easier to deal with those matters by legislation than by a contentious order.</P>

      <P>In Section 3 (a), page 4, to delete all from the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 33 to the word &ldquo;produce&rdquo; in line 36, inclusive, and to add at the end of the section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(f)  save as hereinafter excepted, the premises if registered in any of the registers kept in pursuance of this Act shall be equipped with such plant and machinery as are required in respect of those premises by or under Part III, of this Act, and if not so registered shall be provided, <Col N="1173" /> with such plant and machinery or such appliances and such utensils as are requisite for the manufacture of dairy produce of the desscription manufactured therein: Provided always that this paragraph shall not apply to premises which comply with all the following conditions, that is to say, the premises are not registered in any of the registers kept in pursuance of this Act and are situate on a farm and dairy produce is manufactured therein only from the milk of cows belonging to the occupier of the farm.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better explain this.  The words to be deleted are: &ldquo;And shall be provided with such plant and machinery, or such appliances, and such utensils as are requisite for the manufacture of such dairy produce.&rdquo;  Hence with regard to all premises, registered or unregistered, that is to say premises such as farmhouses where butter is produced for sale, all the sub-sections (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) apply&mdash;Deputy Heffernan will notice that &ldquo;the premises shall be provided with an adequate supply of pure water&rdquo; is to apply still even to farm-houses&mdash;subject to the amendment which I will read now:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Save as hereinafter excepted, the premises if registered in any of the registers kept in pursuance of this Act shall be equipped with such plant and machinery as are required in respect of those premises by or under Part III. of this Act, and if not so registered shall be provided with such plant and machinery or such appliances and such utensils as are requisite for the manufacture of dairy produce of the description manufactured therein: Provided always that this paragraph shall not apply to premises which comply with all the following conditions, that is to say, the premises are not registered in any of the registers kept in pursuance of this Act and are situate on a farm and dairy produce is manufactured therein only from <Col N="1174" /> the milk of cows belonging to the occupier of the farm.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That excepts from the sub-section as to machinery simply small farms, and still includes premises, such as small butter factories, that are not exporting butter, but making butter for internal trade.  But it does definitely exclude small farms from the machinery sub-section, sub-section (a).  It does not include the big farm making 56lbs. of butter in the day.  I do not believe there is such a place in Ireland.  To be able to do that you would want to keep about 150 cows.  In the event of some individual farmer doing that sort of thing, he has to register.  It excludes particular farmers from the machinery sub-section, and the next amendment deals with the water supply.</P>

It appeared clear to the Committee, when one spoke of inspection of plant and machinery in a farm-house which was producing butter for its own use, or for a little local sale, so long as it was not exporting, that it was asking altogether too much to expect that that farm-house should comply with all the conditions which would be required in respect to plant, machinery and utensils. It was suggested that there are farmers and dairymaids who make butter without any utensils or machinery, except their fingers and hands and cold water or even a bottle.

I never had any idea we were such a well-regulated country until I read this Order under the Public Health Acts.  The most stringent regulations apply to anybody who sells milk to anyone, with special reference to creameries. These regulations are the law of the land.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Heffernan raised two points in regard to this section. One was with regard to the machinery and the other was in regard to the difficulty of asking a private farmer to have an adequate supply of pure water.  On consideration I drafted this amendment, which I commend to him. That does not mean that a farmer has to lay pipes, but for the purposes of making butter, he must be in the position to supply good and wholesome water.  The reason I use the words &ldquo;good and wholesome&rdquo; is that I copied them from the section which refers to the supply of water for public purposes.  The Deputy was afraid that the farmer who had not a spring well in the yard could not make butter. Clearly that is not the intention.  All it sets out to do is that, if butter is made for sale, a supply of pure water must be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not, but all the lawyers agree that if you have a section stating that the premises are to be supplied with an adequate supply of good and wholesome water for making butter, it means that you will have to get, wherever it is to be found, sufficient water to enable you to make butter properly.  No one can force you to sink a spring well in the yard.  That is the difficulty that was in the Deputy's mind.</P>

The water from a well may be very pure and very good to-day but without any indication, so far as appearance goes, it may <Col N="1178" /> be very dangerous to-morrow.  Certain percolations take place.  I would like to know from the Minister if any test is required to ensure, where a large quantity of water is drawn from a well that the butter is not affected.  How can the farmer detect if the water is not all right?</P>

      <P>Learning by experience. If a farmer makes bad butter and we discover it, we trace it to the source, the well, to find out what is wrong.  No legislation that was ever passed can provide for every difficulty.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to raise a difficulty about this matter, but I am not quite sure that the Minister's amendment will fulfil a useful purpose. How are you going to find out that the water is not good and wholesome? There are many farmhouses where water is not available on the farm, and the only method of getting it is by hauling it long distances in a barrel.  An inspector may come to the farm-house and find the barrel empty, and that there is no water supply there. I think this should be left out of the Bill altogether.  As it stands it serves no useful purpose and may cause difficulty and trouble if there was a finicky inspector about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A finicky inspector would have to prove his case if we had to take proceedings.  If a finicky inspector got up and swore that he went into a farm-house and found there was no water, and if the owner of the premises was in a position to prove there was a well within 200 yards; that he was not making butter at the time; that he was able to get water whenever he required it; and if the inspector was unable to contradict him, how could there be any difficulty?  Does the Deputy mean to suggest that butter could be made without water?  If you require good and wholesome water for making butter then it had better be put into the Bill.  That is all we have said. I agree that there is no difference between this provision and the provision that was in it.  I am merely pointing out that this provision does not force a man to sink a pump at immense expense in his own yard.  All it compels him to do is to bring the water from <Col N="1179" /> the nearest well.  The Deputy must know that a lot of the bad butter is made because there is not sufficient pure water, and because people are too lazy to bring sufficient pure water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to allow this amendment to pass without saying something on it.  I must say that the information available before the Special Committee on this matter was rather meagre.  Since the Committee Stage of the Bill was taken, I have been making inquiries with regard to the detrimental effect of goat's milk, and the information I have received has not confirmed me in the idea that I entertained that there is any great harm, if any at all, in using goats' milk.  Of course, I am taking a line now opposite to the line I took on this matter when we were on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I think it is a good thing, when one finds that one's information is not quite correct, to change one's viewpoint. I have actually heard that in certain cases goats' milk is a good <Col N="1186" /> thing&mdash;I mean using it in milk which is made into butter.  I know of one particular place where excellent butter is made, and I have been acquainted of a fact in connection with it which I did not know before.  I am informed that goat's milk is used in fairly large quantities in butter-making in that particular place, and I know for a fact that the butter made in that creamery is of very good quality indeed.  It has been stated to me also that there is a real advantage in using goat's milk in the making of butter in this respect, that the melting heat of goats' milk is higher than that in cows' milk, and that, therefore, in the summer the butter made from a mixed supply of goats' milk and cows' milk does not melt as quickly as butter made from cows' milk purely.  The fact that there is a certain mixture of goats' milk with the cows' milk tends to keep the butter in a sounder condition in the summer time.  I would like to say, however, that that is a matter on which technical expert advice will need to be taken, especially the advice of those who are closely acquainted with the manufacture of butter.  I would like to be assured that the Minister has got the best expert advice on this matter before deciding finally to incorporate it in the Bill.  The reason I would like an assurance on that is this: that a provision of that kind may have a very serious effect indeed on the milk supply to a certain creamery that I know of.  I can say this, that some of the best butter manufactured in Ireland comes from that particular creamery.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Heffernan will agree that his attitude now is not very far different from my attitude on this question at the beginning.  We are both in agreement on this, that you can make just as good and as tasty a butter from goat's milk.  And there is, perhaps, something to be said for allowing small suppliers if that is so&mdash; and my information leads me to believe that it is so&mdash;to eke out their supplies with goats' milk.  On the other hand, there is at least one big difference, a difference in colour, if there is a large percentage of goats' milk used.  And in a Bill <Col N="1187" /> aiming at uniformity, for the sake of appearance, at least, we shall have to accept the amendment as it stands. It will not prevent some goats' milk getting into the creamery.  That is a thing possibly I should not say.  Weighing one thing against another, the amendment should stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I moved an amendment on the Committee Stage to insert the words &ldquo;cows' milk.&rdquo;  I did it entirely on my own volition, with a view to getting a definition.  I did not know myself anything at all about the deleterious or beneficial effects of goats' milk on butter, but I considered it necessary that there should be a definition of what milk was.  For practical purposes, the only question is whether goats' milk should be allowed to be used.  Deputy Heffernan says that it is entirely a matter for experts, for those who know the effect of goats' milk upon butter, upon the keeping qualities of butter, and upon its general qualities as regards flavour, texture and the like.  And I suggest that it is the Minister who will have to provide us with the expert advice in the absence of anything very definite to the contrary from Deputy Heffernan or Deputy Hogan, unless Deputy Duffy knows something about it.  It seems to me that it is entirely a matter for expert guidance.  I believe that it is desirable that there should be a definition as to whether we are to exclude or include goats' milk; and if the Minister is satisfied that butter made from an admixture of goats' milk is lower in quality than butter made wholly from cows' milk, then I think the amendment should stand.  If he is not so satisfied I would leave the matter open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson is right.  It is my business to act as the conduit pipe through which expert knowledge comes.  My information is that, other things being equal, butter made from goats' milk is just as good and just as tasty as butter made from cows' milk.  There seems to be only one big difference, that is to say, that butter made from goats' milk is much whiter than butter made from cows' <Col N="1188" /> milk.  That is a difference, and a considerable difference.  That is the data Other things being equal, it is just as good and just as sweet.  There is only one difference, and that is the colour. In practice, in this country only a very very small percentage of goats' milk will be mixed with the cows' milk, and the admixture will make no radical difference at all.  But there is a possibility of development.  If a very much bigger percentage of goats' milk were supplied to creameries, you might reach a time&mdash;I think it is most unlikely&mdash;when fifty per cent. of the milk supplied to creameries would be cows' milk and fifty per cent. goats' milk. If that occurred, you would get a butter which would be very much different in colour from the ordinary creamery butter and butter for which the price would be paid in England. That is an unlikely contingency.  Perhaps Deputy Patrick Hogan and Deputy Heffernan are better judges than I am as to the possibility of such a contingency.  Then there is the question: Is it likely that goats' milk will be as clean as cows' milk?  I am no particular judge of that.  Any Deputy is as good a judge of it as I am.  Is it likely that the conditions surrounding the goats' milk will be as good as those surrounding the cows' milk?  Goats' milk is supplied from very very much smaller houses and poorer classes of houses than the cows' milk.  I am not saying that that is an argument one way or another.  Deputies who know about the matter can say whether it is likely that that milk would be dirtier.  I do not think that a tubercular goat has yet existed.  From that point of view, the goats' milk would be cleaner.  But is it likely to be cleaner from other points of view?  I went into all these considerations, and I had them before me when the Bill was drafted in its original form, and that is the reason we did not insert anything about goats' milk.  We left that subject open, particularly because we knew that, in practice, the percentage of goats' milk used would be extremely small, and would not make any difference whatever; and we took it for granted that no future developments would be likely to disturb that state of <Col N="1189" /> affairs.  We recognised the difficulties of administering any provisions we might put in.  Goats' milk can be used with cows' milk and it can hardly ever be detected; and it was for that reason that we inserted the provision in the amendment and that we press it in the form of making it an offence for anyone to supply goats' milk and making it an offence for anyone knowingly to accept goats' milk.  I leave the matter to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I imagine, in the great majority of cases, goats are milked in the open.  That is so much in favour of the cleanliness.  In the second place, there is a small proportion of butter made from goats' milk, and I think it is claimed that a good many people would be discommoded and damaged if we insert this amendment. There is another argument advanced&mdash; that if there was an increase in the proportion of goats' milk used the quality of the butter might deteriorate. If that day comes, then the Minister has power to remove the national brand. But, on the whole, I think the Minister's argument is decidedly in favour of leaving out the restriction.</P>

      <P>Considering the point that the Minister has made, is it wise to increase offences from the point of view of public policy? The only question, apparently, that there may be any difficulty about is the want of colour.  The expert advice is that, as regards flavour and otherwise, you can get as good butter from goats' milk as from cows' milk.  If you pass this amendment, you are in this position: a number of people will be incommoded, and, what is still worse, you will have defined in the Act an offence which can be evaded.  I think, from the point of view of public policy, it would be better not to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>To insert immediately before Section 18, page 14, a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The following regulations shall apply to all premises registered in the register of manufacturing exporters, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  All butter manufactured on <Col N="1191" /> the premises shall be made from cream which has been separated from milk on the premises or has been supplied from other premises subject to such conditions as may be prescribed;</P>
    <P>(b)  all matters relating to the manufacture of butter on the premises shall be under the control of a duly qualified manager, and the prescribed particulars of all appointments of such managers shall be notified to the Minister in the prescribed manner;</P>
    <P>(c)  every butter-maker on the premises and every person carrying out tests of milk or cream on the premises for the purpose of determining the percentage of butter-fat therein shall be duly qualified and the prescribed particulars of all appointments of such butter-makers and persons shall be notified to the Minister in the prescribed manner.</P>
    <P>(d)  butter containing water in excess of sixteen per cent. or any noxious colouring matter or any preservative other than salt of a prescribed description, shall not be packed for export, or exported, or consigned for export, in or from the premises.</P>
    <P>(e)  butter containing water in excess of sixteen per cent. or any noxious colouring matter, or any preservative other than salt of a prescribed description, shall not be packed for sale or sold, or offered or consigned for sale on or from the premises, except to a butter-factory in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
    <P>(f)  if any regulation under this Act is in force requiring the premises to be equipped with efficient plant for pasteurising milk, or cream, or both milk and cream, all milk, cream, or milk and cream (as the case may require) used for the manufacture of butter upon the premises shall be pasteurised;</P>
    <P>(g)  all butter exported from the premises and also every package or wrapper containing the butter shall before it leaves the premises be marked with the marks (if any) prescribed by regulations made under this Act;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> (h)  all butter packed on the premises shall be packed only in such manner and in such packages or wrappers as shall be prescribed by regulations made under this Act;</P>
    <P>(i)  no margarine or milk-blended butter, and no oil or fat capable of being used in the adulteration of butter shall be brought on to the premises;</P>
    <P>(j)  save as hereinafter mentioned no butter other than butter obtained directly from other premises registered in the register of manufacturing exporters shall be brought on to the premises.</P>
    <P>(2) If the Minister is satisfied, on the application of the registered proprietor or duly qualified manager of any premises registered in the register of manufacturing exporters, that owing to a temporary decrease in the quantity of milk or cream available at the premises sufficient butter cannot be manufactured on the premises or obtained from other premises similarly registered to meet the immediate requirements of the business of the premises as normally carried on, the Minister may by licence issued by him to the registered proprietor of the premises authorise the bringing on to the premises of butter of such description, in such quantities, during such periods, and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the licence.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section a person shall be deemed to be duly qualified for a position only if he either possesses a certificate issued by the Minister of qualification for such position generally or has satisfied the Minister that he is qualified for the particular position.</P>

      <P>It would be well if Deputies compared these regulations with the regulations in regard to creameries. These are the regulations for the manufacturing exporters, and they are practically the same.  Possibly the best thing would be for the Deputies to compare them with the regulations in regard to the creameries in Section 16. The amendment deals with manufacturing exporters.  We want to avoid butter being produced; let us say, in a <Col N="1193" /> creamery or in the premises of a manufacturing exporter, and then sent somewhere else, perhaps to a factory to be blended, and then brought to the manufacturing exporter's premises.  These are the regulations <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, that apply to creameries, and you will agree that they should not be less stringent.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister with regard to (c), &ldquo;every butter-maker on the premises and every person carrying out tests of milk or cream on the premises for the purpose of determining the percentage of butter-fat therein, shall be duly qualified, and the prescribed particulars of all appointments of such butter-makers and persons shall be notified to the Minister in the prescribed manner.&rdquo;  I would like to know from the Minister is it absolutely necessary that the creamery should have the consent of the Department before a butter-maker is appointed, and that the Department must be satisfied with her qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to get the consent of the Department before a butter-maker is appointed, but it will be necessary that the butter-maker who is appointed shall have the general qualifications prescribed in the Bill, and that is one of the most important provisions.  Probably the greatest safeguard to the national brand is the bettering of the general standard of the qualification of the managers and butter-makers, and other technical people in the creameries.  That is essential. That is an integral portion of the whole scheme, and I think the Deputy will agree with me that inefficient officers of that sort are a very considerable cause of the present not exactly satisfactory position of the creameries. The man, after all, counts for everything, and no matter what regulations you make about creameries, and no matter how we inspect them, no creamery will produce the sort of butter which it should produce consistently unless the officers who are actually dealing with the technical work there, the managers and the butter-makers, are up to the prescribed standard of <Col N="1194" /> technical competence.  It is not intended at all that the Department would have a veto on the appointment of A.B. instead of C.D., but it is definitely intended, and it is at the root of the whole scheme, that the Department shall say to all creameries in general: &ldquo;You must have butter-makers and managers whose qualifications are so and so and such and such.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course it will be the business of the people who are making regulations, in the beginning, at any rate, to see that the regulations are not prepared in any narrow spirit; that, for instance, the regulations are not prepared from the point of view that a man with a degree or an associateship, or something like that, is the only person who is to be regarded as competent.  We are all aware that there are other evidences of competence than mere degrees or the mere passing of examinations.  Everything has to be weighed up.  The Deputy may be afraid that in the beginning, as a result of stringent or rather narrow-minded regulations by the Department, good men, or tip-top men, will be ruled out because they have not certain degrees which are in fashion now.  The regulations will not be made from that point of view.  The regulations will be made from the point of view that the sort of manager or butter-maker you have in the creamery who knows his business will be acceptable, and that we are not going to depend solely on degrees.  Full consideration will be given to the man's previous experience, and especially to successful experience in creameries.</P>

      <P>According to this, it will be all in the hands of the <Col N="1195" /> Department.  Their qualifications would be some training in one of the schools. I want to find out whether it would be open to a butter-maker under this rule to go from one creamery to another creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Department made a regulation that nobody could be a butter-maker who had not got a doctorate of science, then you would be ruling out a great many butter-makers in the country.  The Department could say that no one shall be a butter-maker in a creamery unless he is a barrister-at-law.  The provision is wide enough to enable them to say that.  If Deputy Hogan assumes that the Department are going to make regulations of that sort, then he is perfectly sound in his criticism.  He would be also perfectly sound if he suggested that it should not be left to any Department to make any regulations they like.  But if you agree that, especially at the beginning, you cannot tie yourself to degrees or examinations and that you cannot rule out past experience as butter-maker or manager in a creamery, then you cannot put anything more definite in the amendment. Supposing we had technical education in this country for a long period and that we had examinations for butter-makers which were generally accepted as sound, so that a person who went through this course and who passed the requisite examination would be unquestionably efficient as a butter-maker&mdash;if you had the thing standardised like that, it would be easy to make this more definite.  But you have not it standardised, and it is for that particular reason that it would be a hardship to prescribe certain examinations or courses and rule out first-class butter-makers who got their experience by hard work in creameries for eight or ten years.  It is that very thing which forces us to leave the matter in this position, and I do not see how you can improve on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister if his own argument and the argument of Deputy Hogan is not allied to the proposition for a Dairy <Col N="1196" /> Council.  This is quite distinctly the kind of thing that should be administered by a body in charge of the industry. If one takes the analogy of the medical register and the register of various other professional bodies, you see that it is not the Minister who decides what should be the degree of competence, but an organisation within the profession.  I would suggest the Minister should bear in mind when making any regulations under this section the necessity for allying with himself a council representative of the trade which could prescribe with more expert knowledge and with the probability of creating greater confidence such qualifications as are necessary. Perhaps when we come to the discussion of his proposed Consultative Committee he might be inclined to enlarge the scope and power of that Committee in view of what he has said in respect of these qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the Minister with regard to this matter, but there is one point I would like to draw his attention to.  A certificate has been issued by a certain association in this country and has been accepted by a great many creameries as a certificate of qualification. That is the Creamery Managers' Association certificate.  They have issued a certificate to men who went forward for examination and satisfied them that they were qualified.  It is possible, as this amendment stands, for a man who has got such a certificate&mdash; and I believe the examination is pretty stringent&mdash;to be disqualified by the Ministry.  I would suggest that the Minister should add to his amendment something to the effect that men who already hold these certificates should not be subject to disqualification.  I might mention that the people who hold that certificate are very proud of it, and it is maintained that they are generally accepted as better qualified than all others, even those certified by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Johnson expects me to argue the question as to whether the council should be administrative or advisory <Col N="1197" /> on this particular matter.  As he said himself, we will tackle that later on. Of course, it would be contemplated that in regard to regulations like this the advice of the Consultative Council would be sought and would get full consideration.  That, of course, is the intention.  With regard to the certificate Deputy Heffernan mentioned, it would be an extraordinary thing to make an exception of that particular qualification and to insert it in the Bill.  The Department of Agriculture have courses and there are courses at the College of Science and in other places.  I dare say there are various certificates connected with butter-makers and creamery managers, and it would be an extraordinary thing to pick out this particular qualification and to insert it in the Bill.  I do not think we could do that.  I certainly could not do it at this stage.  In fairness, we would have to insert all the other qualifications which, on the face of them, are equally good.  I do not see the necessity of going through all these qualifications and picking out the qualifications we think we would accept. Besides, the implication, on the face of it, is that we will not give any chance at all to people who have not got these certificates and that first-class butter-makers who are so recognised by everybody and whose experience shows clearly that they must be well qualified, will be ruled out.</P>
      <P>This is a proposal to which several objections could be taken.  The first would be that we should not take out one qualification at the expense of three or four qualifications and insert it in a statute; secondly, it would be very troublesome, and a little bit dangerous at the present stage to put in various qualifications without further consideration; and, thirdly, it would put the amendment out of perspective, because we propose to give weight, especially at the beginning, to experience and proved competence in existing creameries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the amendment, as it stands, state that if a man already possesses the certificate of the Ministry&mdash;by that I presume is meant the certificate of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;he is by right of that qualified?  I take that to mean that <Col N="1198" /> any certificate issued by the Department of Agriculture will be regarded as a certificate of qualification.  I am not aware that there has been any other certificate of qualification except the certificate of the Creamery Managers' Association.  I do not think that there are three or four alternative certificates. If there are, I am willing to withdraw my objection because I see that you cannot pick out one from three or four.  But if you are going to accept the Certificate of the Department of Agriculture or the College of Science as a definite certificate of qualification, without any further enquiry into the man's competency, I think we should also accept the other certificate which has been in use, and which is recognised as a certificate of adequate qualification in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

Surely it means that the Department of Agriculture will go over all the qualifications, and may decide that the particular examination that Deputy Heffernan has referred to, or any examination of the Department, or any other examination is sufficient evidence of competency.  They will then issue one certificate to cover all.  But this is a totally different certificate. It would be the same sort of certificate if it was a creamery managers' examination or the Department's examination. The point is, this is to be a totally new certificate, based on new data.</P>

      <P>In regard to sub-section (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 25, which deals with butter containing water in excess of 16 per cent., I would like to ask if the Minister would accept a verbal amendment that instead of the butter being allowed to <Col N="1199" /> be sold to a butter factory in the Free State, it would be allowed to be sold as creamery butter, with a brand to the effect that it contained over 16 per cent. of moisture.  There are cases where an accident would occur in a creamery, where the brine-pipe might burst, and there would be an excess of water in the butter.  In such a case there would be a big loss to the creamery if a half-ton of creamery butter would have to be consigned to a factory.  The creamery would only have the option of reworking that with freshly-churned butter.</P>

      <P>In the Committee Stage of the Bill I had an amendment down, to the corresponding section of the Bill as drafted, to the effect that while such licence is current no butter bearing the national mark shall be exported from such premises.  The Minister gave an assurance that something of that kind would be incorporated by way of an amendment in the Bill.  I notice there is no amendment of that kind down.  I see that the Minister takes power by regulation.  He can, by regulation, provide that a creamery cannot export butter bearing the mark <Col N="1200" /> when that creamery is buying butter which does not come from a creamery. I was rather definite on the matter at the time at the Committee, and I would like to hear the Minister's views on it now and if he intends to do anything about it.  The point is that while a creamery is allowed to take in butter under licence during the period when the milk supply in short, that that creamery should not be allowed to export any butter bearing the national mark. My idea is that there should be no butter exported with the national mark which is below the standard.  It sometimes would happen that a creamery which has got the national mark would in order to keep the supply going during the winter, send out butter which would not turn out afterwards to be up to the standard required owing to the fact that the butter came from a factory or had not been made from pasteurised cream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather an important thing and I will give it my consideration. You may have a creamery with the national brand and in a certain season it is short of butter and has to go to another creamery to get supplies in order to meet its customers. I suggest to Deputy Heffernan that his proposal would be going rather too far at this stage, particularly without being able to see all the possibilities. While experience might prove that he was quite right and that it was a safe thing to withdraw the national brand during that period experience might prove that it was a hardship for which there was no great justification.  If the Deputy was right we would, I think, have power under the regulation to meet the case.  I did not give that particular point as much consideration as I intended.  I think the best way out of it is to say that I will meet it on Report.</P>

      <P>(1)  The following regulations shall apply to all premises registered in the register of manufacturing exporters, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  all butter manufactured on the premises shall be made from cream which has been separated from milk on the premises or has been supplied from other premises subject to such conditions as may be prescribed;</P>
      <P>(b)  all matters relating to the manufacture of butter on the premises shall be under the control of a duly qualified manager, and the prescribed particulars of all appointments of such managers shall be notified to the Minister in the prescribed manner;</P>

      <P>(d)  butter containing water in excess of sixteen per cent. or any noxious colouring matter or any preservative other than salt of a prescribed description, shall not be packed for export, or exported, or consigned for export, in or from the premises;</P>
      <P>(e)  butter containing water in excess of sixteen per cent. or any noxious colouring matter, or any preservative other than salt of a prescribed description, shall not be packed for sale or sold, or offered or consigned for sale on or from the premises, except to a butter-factory in Saorstát Eireann;</P>

    <P>(f)  if any regulation under this Act is in force requiring the premises to be equipped with efficient plant for pasteurising milk, or cream, or both milk and cream, all milk, cream, or milk and cream (as the case may require) used <Col N="1204" /> for the manufacture of butter upon the premises shall be pasteurised;</P>

    <P>(2)  If the Minister is satisfied, on the application of the registered proprietor or duly qualified manager of any premises registered in the register of manufacturing exporters, that owing to a temporary decrease in the quantity of milk of cream available at the premises sufficient butter cannot be manufactured on the premises or obtained from other premises similarly registered to meet the immediate requirements of the business of the premises as normally carried on, the Minister may by licence issued by him to the registered proprietor of the premises authorise the bringing on to the premises of butter of such description, in such quantities, during such periods, and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the licence.</P>

If the Minister deprives himself of power to cancel the registration in a case of contravention, unless he can prove that it was contravention by the registered proprietor, he is leaving it open for the registered proprietor to hide behind his manager or any assistant.  I do not think any hardship would accrue by leaving the section as it stands, inasmuch as it is within the power of the Minister to decide whether the registered proprietor has incurred liability by omission to carry on his business properly.  It seems to me that the section is better as it left Committee than with this amendment, because it is a limiting one and it would impose upon the Minister the responsibility of proving that the registered proprietor was the person who contravened the regulations.</P>

      <P>I think it is introducing something of an entirely new feature into the Bill, something that stands out unique in itself, because it means a definite interference with the commercial aspect of the operation, and not merely the administration of the dairy to produce butter under certain conditions.  In the second place, it is an unbalanced kind of thing.  For instance, when there is a rising market for butter and at a certain stage there is a very high advance, if the producer fulfils his contract he loses.  I am not saying that he should not fulfil it.  Supposing, on the other hand, a man is buying on a falling market and when it gets low he refuses to carry out his part of the contract, what remedy is there for the producer?  I say this is not a matter which should come within this Bill.  In a breach of contract the aggrieved party has the ordinary course of law at his disposal and should not figure in a Bill of this nature that has, or should have nothing whatever to do with a commercial transaction between producer and customer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the Minister in regard to this matter.  I think it is very necessary to have this provision, not so much because of the sanctity of contracts but I think it is an important matter for the trade.  I think that the Deputy's argument that two wrongs make a right is hardly an argument that can be accepted by this House; it is our business to see our men keep their contracts, and on this very fact of keeping their contracts depend the advantages to be gained under this Bill and the advantages to be gained in the market.  It has been stated, and I believe it is a fact, that a great deal of harm has been done to the Irish butter trade in the past by the breaking of contracts by creameries sending out butter. They send butter on perhaps a wire from a dealer in England; and the creamery manager sees his way to make a considerable amount by breaking that contract and he breaks it.  I do recognise that the dealer in butter has the option of taking ordinary legal proceedings against him but as a <Col N="1211" /> matter of actual practice they very rarely do this; they think the expense and the worry and trouble would be more than the money at stake would be worth, but the actual harm done to the Irish trade by this breaking of contracts is very considerable.  Naturally I recognise that this is a very drastic step, but this drastic step has been made necessary by the actions of some of the less reputable owners and managers of creameries, and we cannot punish the good managers and the reputable managers for the default of the bad ones.  On that account despite the fact that it is a very drastic amendment I wish to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it must not be or need not be said that the business ethics propounded by Deputy Milroy are in fact backed by him, that because there is a fear that purchasers may refuse to accept goods which they have purchased, the way to meet that is to refuse to supply goods which were sold when the market was in your favour. I think that Deputy Milroy made a good point when he suggested that the amendment went rather beyond the general purport of the Bill, more beyond it even than my amendment which was ruled out, but I hope it will be passed especially after Deputy Milroy's speech because the effect which Deputy Milroy's speech would have if broadcasted in the butter market in England and we refused to pass this amendment, would be very damaging to the reputation of the Irish Creamery Trade.  I think the right safeguard against such a misuse being made of Deputy Milroy's unintended advocacy of foul ethics would be to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly am astonished that such a construction should be put upon what I said by the two Deputies who have just spoken.  I did not suggest that the non-carrying out of contracts should be regarded as legitimate trade operations on this side because people on the other side indulge in a similar breach of contract undoubtedly.  What I do contend is that the morality of trade transactions is not the purpose of this Bill, but the production of butter under proper conditions and to secure that the <Col N="1212" /> quality of the butter shall reach a high standard.  I think there is no question that that amendment is entirely irrelevant to the purpose and the intention of the Bill and has reference to more matters of ordinary civil law than to matters of development of the butter industry.  With all due respect to the contentions and the arguments of Deputy Johnson, I persist in my opinion that the way to deal with swindlers in the butter trade or in any other trade is not by the particular methods suggested here but through the ordinary civil law.</P>

      <P>When one looks at this clause, of course in view of future legislation, one is not surprised that a peculiar attitude of mind is adopted in connection with the legislation.  The only excuse for putting this clause into the Bill is that, as Deputy Milroy has said or inferred, there has been a lot of swindling in the butter trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right, as I have maintained on several occasions, to say that this class of legislation is novel, to say the least of it.  What should happen in a big trade like the butter trade is that the members of the trade itself should protect its reputation. What happens in this amendment is that the Minister for Agriculture will necessarily have to take on judicial powers to decide on ordinary simple questions of contract and whether a man is guilty of breach of contract.  You cannot decide that point without knowing all the facts and being conversant with the facts of the contract itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know in business that there are various questions arising in dispute in connection with contracts, questions so difficult and delicate that it takes a very long lawsuit to decide who is right.  All the procedure in the future in connection with this trade is apparently going to be centred in the Minister for Agriculture, to decide whether the contract was made, whether <Col N="1213" /> it was valid, and who is right and who is wrong.  That seems to me to be rather unusual in connection with a Bill which seeks to regulate a very intricate business like the butter trade. It is true that it would seem desirable that in connection with the reputation of the brand people who get a licence would not only be supervised in connection with the management of their concern but might also be supervised in connection with their code of honesty.  I do not think that the Minister intends it as such, but I think the clause goes a great deal further than he thinks and would probably lead to more lawsuits in the future than if he leaves it out.  I say and I ask the House to say that the proper method to control such an industry is by people themselves recognising that if any particular member of their association or body runs crooked in a business where you depend on reputation for your export and sale, he endangers not alone his own reputation but that of all the trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.K. HOGAN (Limerick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the amendment because one reading it would believe that a lot of contracts were broken in regard to the butter trade, whereas we, who are familiar with the creamery system in the South, know that these contracts were not broken through the managers but through the wretched postal facilities. You have a butter merchant asked for a quotation in Limerick and his letter is not delivered for three days.  The Minister in this amendment insinuates that a big share of the creameries take advantage of a rise in butter and do not sell at their contract price and that on the other side of the water there is no such thing as broken contracts.  That is not a fact. In the Bill you cannot appoint a butter-maker or manager without notifying the Department.  The amendment is altogether too drastic and I will vote against it.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister ought to make it compulsory to see that his department will be in possession of the actual facts in connection with the contract for butter and that <Col N="1214" /> copies and all particulars relating to it shall be forwarded to his department. Otherwise, as Deputy Hewat says, this department is not merely going to be a Department of Agriculture but is going to enter into some of the preserves of the Attorney-General's department.  I do not think that that is desirable.  The Minister for Agriculture is sufficiently mixed up with various Bills already and to inflict on him the duty of giving judgment in legal matters would make his office impossible.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat pointed out that the right method of dealing with the faulty member of an industry is for the industry to take in hands the punishment or pillorying of such member.  Here again we see that Deputy Hewat from his own experience leads to the conclusion that there must be a dairy council which will have to manage such proceedings.  As I can see it the Minister will be head of the dairy council and it will be his authority that will control the industry, and upon which it will act.  It seems to me that one would have to leave it to the authority to say whether the fault had been proved.  In every well organised trade or professional guild there is machinery established for deciding whether the fault has been a venial one and to take whatever steps are necessary.  I will support this on the assumption that that kind of trade or industrial organisation will follow before the Bill actually leaves the Oireachtas.  I think it would perhaps be difficult to leave all this authority in the hands of a single bureaucrat in Merrion Street.  I would rather have him definitely assisted in the administration of this Act by an authority representing the trade as a whole.</P>

      <P>I rather support Deputy Johnson's view with a slight change.  I believe that this amendment is necessary but I feel that the Ministry has arbitrary power under this clause.  I would suggest to the Minister that in cases of cancelling the registration of creameries that the Ministry <Col N="1215" /> should not be the final court of appeal, and that there should be some other court to go to.  I suggest that the arbitrator who is appointed under Part I might also be appointed to act under this section.  I can see Deputy Hewat's point that there may be doubt as to whether a contract is broken or not and as to who is responsible.  The Minister has to take upon himself the duty of deciding whether the creamery was responsible or not.  I think that the Bill as it stands without the power of appeal to an arbitrator is rather drastic.  I suggest to the Minister that he should include something in the nature of an appeal.</P>

We have Deputy Hewat, an ardent free trader, and an out and out supporter of absolute freedom of trade, joined with Deputy Milroy, a great protectionist and supporter of interference in trade. Deputy Milroy protesting against this undue interference with trade is a most extraordinary reversion of form.</P>

      <P>Reversion of public form.  There is no use reiterating difficulties where there are no difficulties. There is no use in raising difficulties that are not there.  First of all, I am to constitute judge and jury, and every single case of breach of contract in the creamery business has to come before me.  That is what we mean by this amendment.  According to Deputies the meaning of the amendment is, first, that the Minister for Agriculture is to try every single case of breach of contract in the dairying industry; number 2, that, according to Deputy Hogan, all the Irish creameries and creamery managers are dishonest, and that all the English creameries are not dishonest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately we have not yet power to legislate for England, but there is a good time coming.  This <Col N="1216" /> is an unfortunate amendment, and is supposed to mean all those things.  Let us read it with some amount of moderation. All the amendment means is, first, that it is injurious, and every Deputy in the Farmers' Benches knows that as regards the egg and butter trade the very constant breach of contract with our customers on the other side is doing the whole trade a tremendous amount of harm.  It is doing us great harm.  Things are improving, and the people are beginning to realise that honesty is the best policy.  I can assure Deputy Milroy that it is not as an apostle that I am bringing forward this amendment.  It is not to improve the creamery managers but to improve their business.  With regard to the administration, what happens is this.  The creamery would be, perhaps, convicted twice or three times.  Surely we would have to take that into consideration, and without this amendment we could not.  If a creamery were convicted two or three times, surely even Deputy Hewat would not object to take that into consideration when considering the question of allowing them to be registered as creameries or of cancelling their application for registration. Surely that should be taken into consideration. That is one of the purposes of this amendment.  Secondly, supposing those breaches of contract are not denied.  In a great many places what happens amounts to an actual cynical admission of breach of contract.  There is no intention of setting up the Department of Agriculture as a judicial body to try all cases of breach of contract between a creamery on this side and the customers in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is that our creamery and egg trade has suffered an amount of damage by reason of the fact that contracts are not kept with the other side. All that should be taken into account, not only by judges administering the ordinary civil law, but also by the Minister for Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture, when considering the giving of the national brand or allowing registration.  As I said before, we are not out to improve anybody's morals.  This is inserted from the point of view of good business.  The argument that this is an undue interference with trade and the other arguments <Col N="1217" /> of Deputy Hewat are all arguments against every other clause of the Bill.  This Bill is an interference with trade.  If one's economic belief is that no interference in trade is allowable, then Deputy Hewat's contention is sound, but very few hold that view as sound nowadays.  This Bill has received the blessing of conservative Governments like those of Canada, Denmark and New Zealand, which are not suspected of radical economies.</P>

      <P>The Minister against this amendment used arguments that seem to me to conflict and lost sight of the fact that he is dealing with an Act of Parliament.  He said the interpretation surely is not that we are going to do this or that.  We do not know what he is to do except as far as the clause of the Bill is concerned, and if this clause is going to occasion any actions at law the judge will not take into consideration any of the Minister's arguments.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to be very simple.  Do you think a man is going to have his licence taken away wrongly without having an action against someone?  Who is going to be judge as to whether it is rightly or wrongly?  Do not think that this clause is simply got over by the Minister saying we are not dealing with morality or with this or that.  You cannot interpret a clause in an Act of Parliament. The clause is there, and what you say is that the Minister for Agriculture is going to take all the powers to decide whether the man has broken his contract or not, or in that matter whether he has done right or wrong.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Hewat is opposing the whole section or only the amendment. He has wakened up to the effect of the amendment, but the section gives power to the Minister to cancel registration for several reasons, one of <Col N="1218" /> which is that the registration was procured by fraud.  Does Deputy Hewat object to the Minister acting as the judge in that case, or that the premises have ceased to be eligible for registration? Does the Deputy allege that the Minister should not be the judge in that case?  Or that there has been any other contravention of the Act or regulations made under the Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>True, but I am pointing out the effect of what the Deputy says is an argument against the use of the powers that the Minister will have under the section as a whole. The objection seems to be that it is imposing upon the Minister the right to decide matters of fact.  That objection, if it is valid, applies to all these other provisions which allow the Minister to cancel registration.  The case for cancelling registration, I think, is sound in view of the fact that the complaints have been very widespread and these registrations would be registrations of premises from which butter may be exported.  I agree that it is considerable power and authority to place in the hands of the Ministry; but I think that the case that is being made, the evil that has been wrought to the trade, the reputation of the trade owing to failure to market according to promise, is nearly as great, I was going to say, as the failure to supply a consistent quality of butter. That may be too strong a statement, but at least it has added to the disrepute which the Irish creamery trade has occasionally got itself into.  There may be good reason for putting in certain provisos as to the extent of the Minister's power, whether there should be any appeal, or whether he should be convinced by the judgment of a court that there had been a breach. But to argue the right of the Minister, or, as I should say, the head of the Industrial Council, to cancel registration is to argue against the authority that is embodied right through this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>We had considerable discussion on what the amendment deals with on the Committee Stage.  As the section stands, I think there are very considerable objections to the second, third and fourth lines of it. I think this gives power to the Minister to prescribe the nature and general character of the plant and machinery. It gives that power without any appeal from his decision, and we have to consider in dealing with matters of this kind the contingencies likely to arise. One premises may have what is prescribed to day as essential plant and machinery, and, for all practical purposes, it would be quite efficient for some years to come in producing the required article.  In a couple of years or so some new machinery might come along, and the officials of the Department might insist that that new machinery would be the kind necessary to instal in the creamery or premises. I think there should be some appeal from that decision so that it could be shown by the parties concerned and responsible, that the installation of the newer plant was unnecessary because the old plant was quite efficient to produce the requisite article, and that the installation of the newer plant would impose upon the concern a heavier burden than it could bear.  There should be an opportunity for the parties concerned to make that clear.  And there should be some way whereby the owners of the premises would have a right to appeal against any order made in this section if necessary.  I am not proposing to delete the section, but <Col N="1223" /> simply to show that there should be a right of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection in the special Committee was confined solely to the point that the Minister would have the power to prescribe the machinery of A instead of the machinery of B, or if you like, that he would have the power to say that the plant sold by the Dairy Company should be put in instead of the plant sold by the I.A.W.S.  That was the only objection taken in the Special Committee to powers that the Minister should have to prescribe the machinery and the variation of the machinery set out in the schedule.  There was no other objection raised and it was pointed out that it would be grossly unfair if the Minister could say: &ldquo;You must get in this particular machinery belonging to this particular company instead of some other machinery by some other company.&rdquo;  Now, here is the amendment: &ldquo;The Minister may by order make regulations prescribing the nature and general character of the plant and machinery.&rdquo;  That at least meets that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore it is agreed by Deputy Milroy that this amendment meets the particular point put up in Committee, and before leaving that point I would refer Deputies to the latter portion of Section 1.  &ldquo;And may also require or authorise any particular premises registered in any of the registers aforesaid to be equipped with efficient plant or machinery of any particular nature or character.&rdquo;  Deputies need not be afraid of the word &ldquo;particular&rdquo; there because, remember, it is only of a particular nature or character. It may be necessary to prescribe a particular type of machinery for purposes required by manufacturing exporters, which would not be necessary for creameries.  That may be necessary.  The only danger that is suggested is that we may prescribe the machinery of some particular company. <Col N="1224" /> I think we serve all the purposes we want to serve, and obviate that danger by saying &ldquo;equipped with efficient plant or machinery of a particular nature or character.&rdquo;  That is all I have got to say on the point raised in Committee. But the point Deputy Milroy makes does more.  It is necessary to prescribe machinery and equipment and plant.  If that is so and it is agreed, Deputies must realise that times change and we may learn as we go along that what may be the prescribed machinery and up-to-date machinery, and machinery doing its particular work in a particular manner now, may be absolutely out of date in, say, 10 years time.  You may have creameries, or a minority of creameries, in 10 or 15 years, working on machinery that was up to date now but out of date then, and that is the reason that a particular butter from one may not be up to the mark or standard of other creameries which are keeping ahead of the times.  So you must take these general powers to prescribe even a variation of the machinery prescribed in the schedule.  Otherwise there would be no point at all in taking powers to prescribe machinery. We would have to do what Deputy Hewat wants and leave it to the creameries themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has quite unconsciously missed my point.  I am not contending, in any way, that he should not, have power to order that old machinery be discarded. I simply want to have some provision made for a person or persons who have machinery which is fairly well up-to-date, or, say, as well up-to-date as machinery as a Ford car is in comparison with the Rolls-Royce. You can get quite comfortably carried in a Ford car, although some people prefer a Rolls-Royce.  If a person fond of Rolls-Royce cars had the power to prescribe cars for Ministers of the Free State he would prescribe Rolls-Royce cars for them, whereas they might only be able to afford Ford cars.  I just want to guard the owners of these premises or factories against the whims and caprice of officials who think one particular class of machinery is the right kind and that that and nothing else must be utilised.  There should be a <Col N="1225" /> provision by which, in the event of such a contingency, if the owners are likely to be the victim of such caprice, they should have an opportunity of appealing to a higher authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess my sympathies are with Deputy Milroy in this. I think the amendment goes into unnecessary detail.  The Minister simply desires to have power to make regulations altering the first and second schedules in a general way prescribing the nature and general character of the plant and machinery, and he can do that by adding a couple of words finishing with the word &ldquo;equipped.&rdquo;&ldquo;The Minister may by order from time to time make regulations or very the regulations prescribing the nature and general character of the plant and machinery mentioned in the first and second Schedules, and may also require or authorise any particular premises to be equipped.&rdquo;  It seems to me that is quite enough.  If you go beyond that you are suggesting that you may want to insist upon a certain character of machinery which in the fancy of the Minister&mdash;unless he is bound to follow the expert advice of the Dairy Council&mdash;or his advisers is requisite to produce high-grade butter.  I contend that an examination of the product is really the best test as to whether the machinery is efficient, and I do not think that we should go much further in standardising the equipment of the creamery.  In the First and Second Schedules you have indicated generally the kind of machinery that is required in creameries and on the premises of manufacturing exporters.</P>

      <P>In the first part of the proposed new section you have the words &ldquo;in addition to or substitution for all or any of the plant and machinery mentioned in the First or Second Schedules,&rdquo; and then the section goes on, &ldquo;and may also require or authorise any particular premises registered in any of the registers aforesaid.&rdquo;  You deal there with premises which presumably must have satisfied the requirements <Col N="1226" /> of the Act, of having the plant and machinery set out in the Schedule.  Then you say that in any premises you may order the creamery to substitute for that machinery certain other machinery.  I do not think that is desirable.  I think that if you take general powers to very the regulations they should apply to all creameries and not to one, and that the section as it is submitted is quite enough and is fairly extensive in itself. The power to prescribe that any premises, which may mean any single creamery, shall substitute for the machinery it already has in conformity with the Act certain other machinery is, I suggest, placing in the hands of the Minister a certain power to differentiate between one creamery and another, and I think that is quite unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I am a little bit confused myself about this amendment. I think the wording of it is not very clear, and I find it difficult to understand it.  I think that a simplification of the wording of the amendment would be required before it would be suitable from my point of view.  I was largely responsible for the insertion of this amendment by the Minister, because I had an amendment down on the original stage of the Bill.  The intention of my amendment was this, that the machinery prescribed in the Schedule should be mandatory on the creamery. The creamery should have that at least, but my intention was that the Minister should have power to prescribe such additional machinery as might be required. The amendment as it stands now does not meet with my intention.  The Minister is taking power to vary the general type or character of the machinery.  I agree with Deputy Milroy in regard to the point he raised about an arbitrator.  I think that there should be some sort of a court of appeal in regard to this section if it is to remain as amended. I am sorry that the Minister did not carry this matter of having an arbitrator further than Part 1 of the Bill. I think that if the Minister is to take such drastic powers as are proposed in this new section that there should be someone between him and the creamery, and that he should not be the <Col N="1227" /> final arbitrator in the matter.  I think someone should be appointed to whom an appeal could be made.  Perhaps the Minister could suggest some change which would simplify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly my difficulty, that I cannot suggest a change unless I know exactly the particular point on which the Deputy is in disagreement with me.  I am not asking the Deputy to put his objection in any form of words, but I would like to know what his intention is.  Is it the intention to leave out everything from the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo;?  The intention of the section is perfectly clear.  I see Deputy Johnson's point, though I do not think there is much in it.  The words in the new section are &ldquo;equipped in addition to or substitution for all or any of the plant and machinery mentioned in the First or Second Schedule as the case may be.&rdquo;  I could not make it any clearer than it is there.  It possibly could be made clearer, but I do not see how it could be done.  The idea is that we may prescribe the nature and general character of the plant and machinery.  I think it is agreed that it is necessary to take such power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I read sub-section (2) to mean that if it is thought desirable at any time to extend either of these Schedules the Minister may have power to extend the Schedule, but in such a case that will apply to all the creameries, and the power given will be in general terms such as we find in the Schedule.  The first sub-section seems to me to be much more specific in regard to the character of the plant and of the machinery, and in regard to <Col N="1228" /> the establishment generally when a change is to take place after a substitution order has been made.  I think that sub-section (2) does all that is required to be done.  It does not give an opportunity to discriminate between one creamery and another or between one type of plant and another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>You would have to add these words at the beginning of the section.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that Sub-section (2) does cover the point, only he said he had in mind the case of where an order is made for certain plant to be put into one creamery that it should be put into all, and that such a regulation should apply not to one creamery but to all creameries.  I think it would have to be even more elastic than that. Take the case of a creamery with five or six separating stations.  They would have a pasteurising plant in the central creamery, but they would have no such plant in the separating stations. We might find it necessary to prescribe a pasteurising plant for a separating station and the question would arise then: Should we order that a pasteurising plant should be installed in each of the separating stations as well as the one in the central creamery? I would accept Section 2 with the addition of the necessary words.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I think the Deputy's point is this, that he wants to know whether, where machinery or plant is to be put into a creamery, we should pass an Act of Parliament to extend the Schedules.  That is not the idea.  The idea clearly under the sub-section is that we should have power to add any additional machinery to the machinery already specified in the Schedules.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know this: if the Minister instructs an inspector to go down to a certain creamery and the inspector reports in a certain way regarding that creamery, and recommends that an order be sent to that particular creamery to instal certain plant and machinery, does this amendment cover that without any reference to the Schedule?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Milroy's point and Deputy Johnson's point are much the same, and are also the same as the point that I want to make.  I see what Deputy Milroy is coming at.  He does not want to have certain machinery specified for a certain particular creamery.  He wants, to ensure by having specified machinery in the Schedule, that only general specifications can be made. Then the additions made will be applicable to all creameries.  I see more or less eye to eye with him in that regard.  I think that was Deputy Johnson's point, too. <Col N="1230" /> But I think Deputy Milroy's point is not possible, because it would not be possible to add to the Schedule of a passed Act.  As I was responsible for the original amendment which brought about this, I would say that the first part of sub-section (2) as far as the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; would, as far as I see, meet my requirements.  But I am not satisfied with the latter portion of it.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) of amendment No. 35.  I am talking of the amendment, not of the Bill.  What I am trying to secure is that according to the Schedule there should be a minimum amount of machinery prescribed for the use of all creameries and that the Minister should have power to prescribe other additional machinery of a general character, but that he should not have power to prescribe additional machinery of a general character for a particular creamery, and that it should be for all creameries in general.  I do not think his point is very sound, that creameries differ with regard to their requirements.</P>

What I have an obojection against is prescribing general <Col N="1231" /> additional machinery for one creamery as against another.  I only want to give the Minister power to prescribe the absolute minimum plant.  Of course, I understand that creamery managers should have power to get additional plant if they wish, but they should have a minimum plant prescribed for them; and I think it would be in the interests of the Minister not to prescribe anything but the absolutely essential plant.  It is not my intention to give the Minister power to prescribe all kinds of fancy plant which he considers necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy suggest by way of amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that the Minister take the first lines of sub-section (1): &ldquo;The Minister may by order make regulations prescribing the nature and general character of the plant and machinery with which all or any premises registered in any specified register kept in pursuance of this Act (other than the register of non-manufacturing exporters) are to be equipped&rdquo;; and then go down to sub-section (2): &ldquo;All premises registered in any of the registers aforesaid shall be equipped with the plant and machinery specified in the appropriate schedule to this Act with such (if any) additions thereto or substitutes therefor as may for the time being be prescribed, required or authorised under this section.&rdquo;  That would ensure that any orders that are made would be general.  It would mean that where we have registered creameries or manufacturing exporters under the Act, we have made general orders as regards them, because they have complied with either the one schedule or the other as passed.  Then if there is any change to be made in the schedules let that change be made applicable to all creameries or to all manufacturing exporters as the case may be, and be of a general character.  It seems to me that that would satisfy what was suggested by Deputy Heffernan and would satisfy what the Minister has indicated as his intention and would obviate the faults that I think Deputy Milroy has pointed out.  The arbitrator would not fit in with this scheme at all because <Col N="1232" /> the arbitrator has to deal with a case in which a particular place is under observation and has been inspected and a complaint has been made.  But where a general order is given altering the schedules, it will not be a matter for the arbitrator.  But, as I suggest to Deputy Milroy and to the Minister, here again you have a case for the authority of an Industrial Council to operate.  The Guild idea comes in every time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    <P>(2)  Any inspector shall be entitled at all reasonable times to enter upon any premises to which any regulations made under this section apply and to inspect all instruments and appliances used in such premises for sampling and testing milk or cream for the purpose of determining the quantity of butter-fat or <Col N="1235" /> other prescribed constituent contained therein, and to inspect and take copies of or extracts from all or any records kept on such premises in pursuance of such regulations, and to observe all or any of the process of sampling and testing milk and cream for the purposes aforesaid on such premises, and to test any samples which having been already tested have been retained on the premises.</P>

With reference to sub-section (e) the present time for retaining samples on the premises after they have been tested is fourteen days.  Sub-section (f) was to meet a suggestion that glass-ware and other vessels used in the creameries should be of a standard pattern.  These were all amendments suggested by Deputies.</P>

      <P>I would oppose the second amendment, and I am not too enthusiastic about the first, because I think it, like a good many other provisions in the Bill, will result simply in the creation of a lot of superfluous officials.  What is suggested here would be a very good thing if it were practicable, but the manager of a creamery, if he wishes to show a wrong test, and <Col N="1237" /> is a dishonest person, could easily evade this without being even detected by adding a little cream to the sample he takes, even if it is afterwards inspected by the Department's inspector. There is really no guarantee of protection for the farmer.  The only sure guarantee for the farmer would be that simultaneously with the delivery of his milk to the creameries he should take a sample for himself and forward it to the Government laboratory for examination.</P>

I do not suggest anything in the nature of compulsion.</P>

I would like to change my amendment if Ceann Comhairle would accept it.  I only wish to <Col N="1238" /> make Clause (a) of Sub-section 1 and Clause (e) of Sub-section 1 compulsory, that is that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in regard to these two clauses and &ldquo;may&rdquo; in regard to the remaining clauses.</P>

      <P>The farmers suggested this amendment, but not for the reasons Deputy Milroy stated here&mdash;for the purpose of getting a genuine test for the farmers.  They did not suggest want of confidence in the managers of the creameries.  That was not the idea of the farmers in suggesting this at all, but that there should be a uniform price paid for butter fat relative to the test.  We found some of the creameries, according to different proprietors, were paying higher prices, and others were paying lower.  That is why the Farmers' Deputies in Committee suggested this proposal, and not for the purpose of safeguarding themselves against the managers, and suggesting that the managers would not give them a genuine test, for I think they are giving them a genuine test.  Neither is there any fraud known in connection with lowering the average price of milk, and raising the average price of butter fat.  If this amendment is passed, it will make all creameries pay on the true, genuine average test of the creamery for butter fat.</P>

It would impose upon the Minister the duty of issuing those regulations the day after the Bill becomes law, and that, of course, is quite impossible.  The very fact that the Minister has put in this permissive clause in the Bill indicates his mind in the matter.  It then becomes a matter for the creameries and the farmers to press upon the Minister the necessity for an early regulation of this character.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  There shall be paid to the Minister by the person applying for the registration of any premises in any register kept in pursuance of this Act the fee specified in the Third Schedule to this Act, and the payment of such fee shall be a condition <Col N="1241" /> precedent to the registration of the premises.</P>
    <P>(2)  There shall be paid to the Minister in every year by the registered proprietor of every premises registered in the register of creameries or the register of manufacturing exporters or the register of non-manufacturing exporters the fee (in this Act called the annual fee) specified in the Third Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  The first annual fee to be paid by the registered proprietor of any of the premises mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section shall be payable before registration of the premises, and shall be calculated on the quantity of butter, estimated in the prescribed manner, which would normally be exported from such premises during the period between the completion of the registration and the end of the calendar year then current, and the payment of such fee shall be a condition precedent to the registration of such premises.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every subsequent annual fee shall be payable before the 17th day of March in the year in respect of which the fee is payable, and shall be calculated on the quantity of butter, estimated in the prescribed manner, which would normally be exported from the registered premises in that year.</P>
    <P>(5)  As soon as may be after the end of each year, the total amount of butter exported during that year from every premises registered in the register of creameries or the register of manufacturing exporters or the register of non-manufacturing exporters shall be ascertained in the prescribed manner, and the amount of the annual fee actually payable for that year shall be calculated, and such adjustment as may be necessary between the fee so ascertained to be payable and the fee actually paid shall be made by means of (as the case may require)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  repayment to the registered proprietor or allowance against any annual fee subsequently payable by such registered proprietor; or</P>
    <P>(b)  payment by the registered proprietor or addition to any <Col N="1242" /> annual fee subsequently payable by such registered proprietor.</P>
    <P>(6)  Every registered proprietor of premises registered in the register of creameries or the register of manufacturing exporters or the register of non-manufacturing exporters shall make for the purposes of this section such returns, to such persons, at such times, and in such forms as shall be prescribed.</P>
    <P>(7)  If any registered proprietor by whom an annual fee is payable in respect of his registered premises under this section shall fail to pay such annual fee or any sum added to such annual fee by way of adjustment under this section, before the 17th day of March, in the year in respect of which the same is payable under this section, the registration of such registered premises shall be cancelled by virtue of this section as on and from such 17th day of March.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where the registration of any registered premises is cancelled pursuant to this section, and the fee, the non-payment of which caused such cancellation, is paid within three months after such cancellation, the Minister may restore such premises to the register as on and from the date on which such fee is so paid.</P>
    <P>(9)  In this section the expression &ldquo;registered proprietor&rdquo; shall be construed as referring to the registered proprietor for the time being, save that where the premises shall have ceased to be registered the said expression shall be construed as referring to the person who was the registered proprietor immediately before the cesser of registration.</P>

It is due on the 31st December, and is to be paid before the 17th March following. That is more convenient for the creameries when they audit their accounts.

      <P>I would like to have some assurance from those who are familiar with the business methods of the creameries whether it is reasonable to expect that creameries will have available, after the close of the calendar year, funds which would make it not too heavy a drain to pay this fee.  I am inclined to think that some of the smaller creameries do not retain balances of any size after paying out their supplies.  I still have the idea that I had at the Committee Stage, that creameries would probably prefer to pay something monthly or quarterly during the actual selling season.  I would like just to have an assurance before passing from that, that the creamery practice would allow them to pay a sum of, say, £20, £30, £40, or £50 without an undue strain at the end of the calendar year.</P>

      <P>These creameries get their accounts audited up to the 31st December.  Trade is good up to September or October, and if they have any <Col N="1245" /> money at all I should say they would have more money at the end of the year than for the first four months of the following year.  I do not think it would be any great advantage to any of these creameries to be allowed pay monthly or quarterly.  They keep their accounts fairly well, and they know that this fee is due at the end of every year.  They get their accounts audited every year, and they must be absolutely certain that they must meet this fee.  It is not too much to expect them to make arrangements to put aside the small percentage they would pay quarterly as they go along.  Besides, look at the amount of extra work and extra book-keeping it would entail if it is to be paid every month or quarter.  Would it be worth it?</P>
