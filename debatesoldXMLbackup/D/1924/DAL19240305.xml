    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <P>It is not anticipated that the entire sum of £3,277,700, estimated to meet the cost of Old Age Pensions for the financial year 1923-24, will be required.  The savings on the expenditure on Old Age Pensions, as compared with the estimate for the year 1923-24, will, it is anticipated, be slightly over £100,000.  The reduced expenditure is due to a number of <Col N="1641" /> causes, such as the reinvestigation of old pensions with consequential reduction or disqualification, and to the fact that the number of pensioners, who have died, has been in excess of the number of new pensions accruing during the year.</P>

      <P>Twelve months ago the Ministry took over from the Congested Districts Board a considerable number of sail and motor fishing boats, and one steam fishing vessel.  Of these boats, a few had been built during 1919-20-21, and have never been to sea owing to the failure of the fishing; the remainder had been taken up by the Board from loan borrowers who had failed to pay their instalments and were neglecting the boats and motor engines.</P>
      <P>The boats on our hands, which were built in 1919-20, cost considerably more than can now be got for them, and I am in correspondence with the Minister for Finance regarding the selling price of one boat, which it is desired to sell at considerably lower than the cost.</P>
      <P>I am quite alive to the fact that fishing boats &mdash; especially when fitted with motor engines &mdash; deteriorate rapidly when not in use, and efforts are being made to dispose of the boats to suitable fishermen, but owing to the low demand for fishing boats at present and to the difficulty which fishermen experience in obtaining satisfactory sureties for a large loan, there has not been any sale so far.</P>

    <Title>CENSORSHIP OF FILMS ACT, 1923.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Theatre and Cinema Association (Ireland) and the Kinematograph Renters' Society of Great Britain and Ireland, Ltd., have recently endeavoured by a carefully-prepared and extensive publicity campaign to create the impression in the public mind that they have been badly treated in the matter of the arrangements made for the censoring of films under the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, I think it right to give the Dáil and the public the fullest possible information on the matter.</P>
      <P>I should first like to recall that the Censorship of Films Act was passed as a social measure in response to a very definite public demand.  In view of the financial burdens of the State, it was taken as axiomatic that the cost of censorship should not be borne out of public funds, and that, therefore, any necessary expenses would have to be raised by way of fee charged for the censorship service.  On the other hand, it was agreed that no profit to the State should be made out of such fees, and the Act was framed accordingly.</P>
      <P>Censorship involved an official censor and necessary staff, an office for the censor with suitable furniture, lighting, heating, etc., premises for projecting apparatus (complying with Statutory regulations), and the usual operators for working such apparatus.</P>
      <P>As a preliminary step and before a decision had been taken as to the particular arrangement best suited to meet the requirements of the case, inquiries were made as to the footage of films which would have to be censored each week.  It will be understood that this was an important factor in estimating the fees which would have to be charged, the greater the footage the less would be the fee per foot of film censored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, before the Bill became law (viz., in June last) both renters and exhibitors sent deputations to the Department <Col N="1654" /> to convey their apprehension that the cost of censorship, if to be borne by the trade, would be a prohibitive burden.</P>
    <P>The renters, when asked for an estimate of the footage per week, gave estimates varying from 150,000 feet per week to 400,000.  The exhibitors, on the other hand, ridiculed this estimate, and expressed the opinion that 50,000 feet per week would be nearer the mark.  The renters based their estimate on the footage of films handled by individual firms, the exhibitors based their calculation on the films exhibited in an average week by &ldquo;first-run&rdquo; picture theatres in Dublin. The expression &ldquo;first-run Picture Theatres&rdquo; is technical to the trade.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that renters and exhibitors could not agree as to the quantity of film which would require censorship, it was a difficult matter to estimate what fee per foot of film censored would be required.</P>
    <P>The exhibitors thought that it would be necessary to charge between ½d. and 1d. per foot, and that this would be too great a burden.  They added that if the fees could be restricted to ¼d. per foot, their opposition would cease, and when they were informed that it was hoped to pay the expenses of censorship with a fee of one-fifth of a penny per foot, they appeared to be quite satisfied, but still sceptical as to the possibility.</P>
    <P>It is to be added that both renters and exhibitors at these interviews, represented that it would be a great facility to the trade if films could be censored in bond, so that import duty would not have to be paid on films rejected by the Censor.</P>
    <P>As a result of all this, the Department felt that their headline should be a fee of one-fifth of a penny per foot and facilities for censoring in bond, if that course proved to be practicable.</P>
    <P>It was in this atmosphere that the Department met Messrs. McConnell, Hartley, Ltd., in July, to consider an offer made by them to provide facilities for censorship.  They explained that they proposed to set up a bonded film store, in premises known as the Dame Street Picture House, and that they were in communication with the Revenue <Col N="1655" /> Commissioners.  They inquired whether, if they succeeded in obtaining the approval of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department would be prepared to consider utilising the premises for Censorship.  The answer they got was that if they secured the approval of the Revenue Commissioners as a bonded store, a concrete proposal from them as to facilities for censorship would be considered.</P>
    <P>In giving this answer the Department, mindful of the suggestion of the Kinema trade that censoring in bond would be welcomed, felt that if the Revenue Commissioners passed the premises as bonded stores it was a practical proposition to consider the using of the premises for censorship also, provided agreement could be reached as to terms.</P>
    <P>At this stage some Revenue statistics of films imported became available, and after making due allowance for the admittedly low imports in April it was clear that it would not be safe to estimate for a higher weekly footage than 50,000, this being, in fact, the estimate given by the Exhibitors' Association. No grounds could be found for the extravagant estimate of the renters' representatives. This low footage tended to make the Department conclude that a fee of one-fifth of a penny per foot would be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>On the 25th July the Revenue Commissioners notified the Department that provisional approval for a bonded film warehouse had been given to the Dame Street premises.  On the 30th July Mr. McConnell wrote saying that his firm would grant the use of the theatre in the Bonded Store, Dame Street, for censorship purposes on the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Projecting Films, length up to 500 feet, at the rate of 7/6 per reel.</P>
    <P>Projecting Films over 500 feet and up to 1,000 feet, at the rate of 12/6 per reel.</P>
    <P>3, 5 and 7 reel films and over based at the rate of 12/6 per reel.</P>
    <P>The said prices to include all the necessary work entailed in showing the films such as operator's time, light, winding and rewinding, one or two offices for the Censor and his staff on <Col N="1656" /> the premises in a suitable position, with all necessary office furniture, fittings, heating, lighting, and lavatory accommodation. This offer was rejected.  A fresh offer of 10/- flat per 1,000 feet (lesser lengths to be charged pro rata) was favourably considered and submitted to the Minister for Finance for sanction.  Sanction was obtained, and in September Messrs. McConnell, Hartley, Limited, were informed that their terms were accepted for one year, subject to the plans of the proposed premises meeting with the Department's approval.</P>
    <P>That ended the matter, and it was only a question of awaiting the completion of the premises for the censorship to begin.  The arrangements made ensured that the total cost of censorship could be kept down to one-fifth of a penny per foot of film censored (and even one-tenth of a penny per foot in cases of Topical Travel, Interest and Educational Films).</P>
    <P>In view of the sceptical and pessimistic attitude of the trade as to cost and their desire that censorship in bond should be possible, the Department felt that in all the circumstances a businesslike transaction had been made, and as the contract was limited to a year, so that at the end of that time benefit could be taken of experience gained, no apprehension was felt that there could be any serious dissatisfaction amongst the members of the Kinema trade.  It was also felt that in view of the structural alterations made by the proprietors of the Dame Street Picture House a year was not an unduly long time for the contract.</P>
    <P>It was always intended, and is still intended, to make other arrangements if experience shows that the censorship can be carried out at less expense.  No profit for the State can be made under the terms of the Act, and there is no intention to pay outside firms a higher price than is necessary for services rendered.  I should like to add that the arrangements made were regarded in the nature of renting premises, and one does not usually seek tenders for services of that kind.  Also the pessimistic attitude of the trade about the censorship precluded the Department <Col N="1657" /> from thinking that the trade themselves might possibly be prepared to set up a bonded store with censorship facilities at a lower cost than that obtained from the Dame Street Picture House proprietors.</P>
    <P>The agitation on the part of the Kinema trade against the arrangements made did not begin until the 21st December.  This agitation is directed both against the charges for censoring and the charges for bonding.  As regards the latter, I have no responsibility, and I do not propose to enter into that aspect of the case.  As regards the censorship, I have outlined the position.  I think it will be agreed that the Department's position is a proper one, irrespective of whether other cheaper arrangements could now, with the information gained, be made.</P>
    <P>In recent communications the Kinema trade estimate the footage at 100,000 per week, i.e., the renters have considerably reduced their original estimate and the exhibitors have doubled theirs.  The revenue statistics for the six months ending 30th September last indicate an average of 62,000 per week, thus vindicating the cautious attitude adopted by the Department and indicating that the exhibitors' original estimate of 50,000 was a better approximation than their present polemic figure of 100,000.</P>
    <P>In matters such as the fees for the Censor's certificate for the pictures originally passed by the Dublin Corporation Board of Censors, and for pictures viewed elsewhere than Dame Street before the premises were ready, I have granted concessions to the trade in response to their representations, and I am unable, in the events which have happened, to do any more.  I repeat that as regards charges for bonding I have no responsibility, and I think the Revenue Commissioners' duties are confined to seeing that films in bond are properly secured, the charge for services to the trade being a private matter.</P>
    <P>I have, however, arranged that no person shall be forced to bond there; in other words, that films will be admitted for censorship though not bonded in the Dame Street store.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> If there are any outstanding difficulties in the matter of films bonded elsewhere being admitted in bond to the Dame Street premises for censorship, I presume that the Revenue Commissioners will be prepared to consider the granting of any facilities possible.</P>
    <P>From this summary the Dáil will understood that the Kinema trade, by their general attitude, did not give much assistance when the arrangements for censorship were first being made. One can, of course, understand their general reluctance to accept the idea that censorship should pay for itself even though a National censorship was bound to be a benefit to the trade, the Dáil as the medium for criticism of the kind of pictures shown in the country being substituted in effect for numerous local agitations of varying degrees against pictures of a doubtful character. But one thing is perfectly clear, that when arrangements for the censorship were being made, the exhibitors, who ultimately, from the purely trade point of view, feel the charge for censorship, were satisfied that the expenses would amount to at least ½d. per foot and indicated that they would not complain if fees were restricted to ¼d. per foot.  The fees are now fixed at one-fifth of a penny per foot for the larger films, and one-tenth of a penny per foot for the smaller topical films. If these charges are unnecessarily high, the Kinema trade have only themselves to blame by leading the Department to believe that ½d. per foot was the minimum practically possible, and that ¼d. per foot would be accepted without complaint.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, if experience proves that lower fees will suffice, or cheaper arrangements for censorship can be made, the contract with the Irish Bonded Film Store, Limited, will not be renewed at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, nobody will, through the operation of the Censorship of Films Act, be compelled to bond his films in the Bonded Film Store, Dame Street, if he wishes to bond elsewhere.  The question of bonding is a matter for arrangement between the Revenue Commissioners and the trade, and it is unfair and misleading to mix <Col N="1659" /> up the question of the charges for bonding with those for censorship.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there was a general public demand for censorship, and the public must have censorship.  I am equally convinced that the State, in present circumstances, could not be expected to bear the cost of censorship, and, whilst experience may lead to a change in the present arrangements, I think it is clear that the course taken by the Department as an experiment is not deserving of censure.  A more helpful attitude on the part of the trade in the beginning would have been better for everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. K. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be necessary, by way of explanation of this measure, to survey briefly the substance of the existing law in the matters dealt with by the Bill.  The substance of the existing law on the matters dealt with by the Bill is this, that the duty of preparing printed lists of all persons who are qualified to be jurors is imposed by Statute (Juries (Ireland) Act, 1871, Section 8) on the local authorities in each county who, in turn, are set in motion by a demand, called a Precept, which is issued by the local Clerk of the Crown and Peace.  The routine runs as follows: ... within one week after the first day of July in each year the Clerk of the Crown and Peace issues his precept, formerly to the Clerk of each Poor Law Union, but now to the Secretary of the County Council, requiring him to submit to him, not later than the first of August, alphabetical lists of the jurors in each barony in the county. By the first day of August, therefore, the Clerk of the Crown and Peace receives from the Clerks of the Unions, or the County Secretary, lists of persons qualified and liable to serve as jurors, a separate list for each barony, and each list in alphabetical order of surnames.</P>
      <P>From these general lists the Clerk of the Crown and Peace picks out the Special Jurors and makes separate lists of Special Jurors, each barony being still kept in a separate list.  This is required by Statute to be done not later than 15th August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next step is the revision of these lists.  This is done by the County Court Judge, save in Dublin County and Dublin City, where (by way of relieving the Recorder) it is done by Revising Barristers&mdash;one for the City and one for the County.  This revision takes place between the eighth of September and the twenty-fifth of October.  The rate collectors are required to attend: there is generally no argument or discussion: the judge is told that A.B., whose name <Col N="1661" /> appears on the list, is dead or deaf or seventy years old, he immediately strikes off the name.  In the County Dublin revision, names are struck off at the rate of about five hundred per day, or about one hundred per hour, which shows the mechanical nature of the work.</P>
    <P>The next step is that in each county the several revised lists for the baronies are consolidated by the Clerk of the Crown and Peace into one alphabetical list for the county: this is &ldquo;the general jurors book&rdquo; for the county: it has to be handed by the Clerk of the Crown and Peace to the Under-Sheriff not later than the first day of January, and is the source from which the Under-Sheriff obtains all jury panels during the following year.  A separate book of Special Jurors is also prepared in the same way and handed to the Under-Sheriff.</P>
    <P>The law for all this will be found in the Juries (Ireland) Act, 1871.</P>
    <P>Summarising the procedure, for ready reference, the &ldquo;calendar&rdquo; runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1st July.&mdash;Clerk of the Crown and Peace issues Precept.</P>
    <P>1st July to 1st August.&mdash;The rate collectors and County Council Secretaries prepare alphabetical lists of jurors for each barony.</P>
    <P>1st August.&mdash;Said lists (alphabetical per barony) are delivered to the Clerk of the Crown and Peace.</P>
    <P>1st August to 15th August.&mdash;Clerk of the Crown and Peace prepares lists of Special Jurors (alphabetical, per barony).</P>
    <P>8th September to 25th October.&mdash;Revision of lists by County Court Judges.</P>
    <P>25th October to 1st January.&mdash;The Clerk of the Crown and Peace prepares the two Jury Books, General and Special, from the revised lists and hands the books to Under-Sheriff.</P>
    <P>The entire expenses of all this procedure, including the printing, are defrayed by the local authorities, out of rates.</P>
    <P>The above system, that is, the existing system, is in itself satisfactory, and there would be no reason to interfere with it but for the fact that it is running side by side with another system, <Col N="1662" /> viz., the preparation of lists of electors, and that it is desirable to amalgamate the two systems, so far as possible, in the interests of efficiency and economy. The point is that the Electors' Lists and the Jurors' Lists are to a great extent lists of the same persons, or, to be more precise, the Electors' Lists include the name of almost every juror.</P>
    <P>It, therefore, occurred to the Ministries concerned: &ldquo;Why not have only one list&mdash;the Electors' List&mdash;distinguishing the jurors by some special mark?&rdquo;  It happened at the time when this proposal was being considered (Autumn, 1923), that printing tenders were being invited by the Stationery Office, for Electors' Lists, to cover a period of five years.  It was, therefore, necessary either to take a decision immediately or to postpone the reform, and the consequent economy, for five years.  The former alternative was adopted&mdash;that is, it was assumed that the present Bill would be enacted within a few months, and the printing work was ordered on the more economical basis of a single consolidated list of voters and jurors.</P>
    <P>By departmental action, therefore, taken in anticipation of legislation the necessary information has already been obtained for the current year by the more economical method of adding to the Electors Lists a Jurors Column showing whether each elector was an ordinary Juror, a Special Juror, or not a Juror at all, and in the Electoral Lists now just completed the Jurors Column has been added and filled in.</P>
    <P>The present Bill was therefore initiated as a very short Bill, the only object of which was to give retrospective sanction to the consolidation of the Jurors Lists with the Electors Lists. While the Bill was being drafted, however, representations were made to me that much more extensive changes were desirable in the jury system and a conference took place in January last, at which the whole jury system was discussed, and subsequently the Executive Council came to the following conclusions&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Conference in January last consisted of the Draftsman, <Col N="1663" /> the Under-Sheriff for the City of Dublin, a representative of the Ministry of Local Government and myself. As a result of that conference certain general conclusions were reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There was no representative of the Jurors.  Following that conference certain general conclusions were arrived at as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  That the introduction of a Bill reforming the Jury System generally was necessary, but might, and should, stand over for at least some months, and must certainly await the enactment of the Courts of Justice Bill.</P>
      <P>(b)  That the present Bill should be introduced immediately and should in general be limited to the change in method as regards the preparation of Jurors' Lists but with the following additions:</P>
      <P>(c)  That a few points not necessarily arising out of the change in method mentioned at (b) above were of such urgency and importance that they should be included in the present Bill by way of anticipation of the future general reform.  These points were, mainly, exemption of women jurors on application, abolition of the revision by County Courts in favour of revision by the Clerk of the Crown and Peace (with an appeal to the District Justice) and some other matters which will be made clear in explanations which I propose to give of the various Sections.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill directs that the Register of Electors shall also show whether each Elector is a Special Juror, an ordinary Juror, or not a Juror at all.  This is done in practice by means of the &ldquo;Jurors' Column,&rdquo; to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>Section 1 (2) imposes specifically upon the registration officer (who is the Clerk of the Crown and Peace) the duty of seeing that the Electors' Lists distinguish between ordinary jurors, special jurors, and persons who are not jurors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 (3) directs that the law as regards entering claims and objections in the electors lists shall apply also to the jurors column of the list ... e.g., if A.B's. name appears in the Electors' <Col N="1664" /> Lists marked &ldquo;juror&rdquo; and if he is not in fact entitled to be a juror, the objection is to be made in the same way as an objection to his being registered as an elector.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (4) directs that in the lists of objections, etc., to voters, it shall appear which of the said voters are also jurors.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (5) provides that jurors shall not be marked in university electoral lists.  This follows from the fact that neither residence nor ownership of premises is necessary for University voting qualification.  If University voters are jurors, as they frequently are, they are jurors, not in the University but in some County and in virtue of premises in such County.</P>
    <P>Section 2.&mdash;This Section is inserted to meet the case of a man who has more than one property qualification.  Suppose that A.B. has two houses in two different parts of the County Dublin, and that the rateable value of the first house is over, but the rateable value of the second house is under, the rateable value necessary for a juryman.  From the electoral point of view it is immaterial to A.B. whether he is registered in respect of the first house or in respect of the second house, but from the jury point of view it is vital, because if he is registered in respect of the second house only, then he will escape jury service altogether.  This section makes that impossible, and the result of the section may be expressed more simply, if somewhat less accurately, thus: &ldquo;A man shall be registered as an elector, in the place where he has jury qualifications rather than in any other place.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 3.&mdash;This section has been inserted in order to get rid of the unwilling woman juror.  In this country the number of women who desire to serve on juries is very small, and in practice the insertion of women's names in the Jury Book leads to nothing but trouble; the women do not turn up, or they get themselves excused, or they are objected to.  The meaning of sub-section (1) is that any woman who does not want to serve may get her name struck off the Lists on application, so that the name will not go into the Jury Book at all.  Sub-section (2) <Col N="1665" /> was added in order to prevent an improper use being made of the privilege granted by sub-section (1).  What was feared was that a man would have his premises rated in his wife's name; he would then not be liable for jury service, and she, although liable, would get her name struck off under sub-section (1).  Sub-section (2), however, makes one of the pair liable.</P>
    <P>Section 4 declares that no person shall be a juror who is not an elector. No case is actually known where a person who is a juror is not an elector, because if a person has a juror's property qualification he is almost of necessity a Local Government elector, but it was thought better to have a definite provision if the case should arise.  It will be seen that in the new system the list is primarily an electors' list, the electors who are also jurors being specially marked.  If, by any chance, somebody who was not registered as an elector should claim to be a juror, and prove his claim and insist on it, the registration officer would be rather embarrassed but for the present section.</P>
    <P>Section 5, sub-section (1).&mdash;This is to the effect that if a person disagrees with the registration officer's views as to his jury liability, he may appeal to the District Justice (not to the County Court Judge).  Moreover, he may appeal to the District Justice without going to the registration officer at all (as the last three lines of the sub-section will show).  Thus if a man who lives within a few yards of Swords Courthouse has been wrongly registered as a juryman he need not come to Dublin for relief; he can go into the District Court and get his name struck off there.</P>
    <P>Section 5, sub-section (2) fixes a time for appeals to the District Court. The date (26th April) is fixed, as being a month later than the last date (26th March), on which objections to claimants may be sent to the registration officer under the Electoral Act, 1923, First Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 5, sub-section (3) and sub-section (4) require no explanation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 makes the necessary changes as regards the time at which and the form and manner in which the <Col N="1666" /> Jurors' Lists are to be requisitioned and supplied in future.  It amounts, in the result, to this, that the &ldquo;Jurors' Precept&rdquo; will direct that the Electors' Lists shall indicate also the position, as regards jury service liability of each elector.</P>
    <P>Section 7 alters the date on which the Jury Book is prepared and comes into force.  The point is that the Jury Book should be as fresh as possible: the materials for its compilation will now be ready in mid-summer, and there is no reason to delay its coming into force until the 1st January following (which was the old date).</P>
    <P>Section 8, sub-section (1) charges the expenses of the execution of this Act upon the Poor Rate of the county. This gets rid of an anomaly arising out of a judicial interpretation of the existing law, which set up an unreasonable incidence of those charges as between the county and urban districts within the county.  The result of this sub-section, taken together with sub-section 12 of the Electoral Act, is to make the whole expense of the joint register payable primarily as a county-at-large charge.  Section 8, sub-section (2) is a Local Government reform.  In future, the salaries of the officials in question will be fixed as inclusive salaries.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is a somewhat technical section dealing with the necessary readjustment as between the State Exchequer and the Local Authority arising out of the fact that the separate Jurors' Lists (now the combined Lists) are slightly increased.</P>
    <P>The object of the section is to secure that the State shall have a share of the resulting economy, and the fractions have been carefully computed to that end.</P>
    <P>I think that it would be a difficult task to go into the fractions here by way of verbal explanation.  If I am pressed on the matter I would circulate something to Deputies between this stage and the Committee stage.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for speedy solution of any unexpected administrative difficulties.  The sub-section refers to the like provision in the Electoral Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>I think the remaining Sections scarcely call for any detailed comment</P>

      <P>On Wednesday, 27th February, the First Reading of this Bill was agreed to, on the strength of certain promises made by the Minister that it was an economy measure really and was intended to deal to some extent with matters that had been already dealt with in anticipation by departmental action.  Some other matters of minor importance were also to be dealt with in the Bill.  Now we learn, having received the Bill, and having heard the explanation given, that it is really a comprehensive reform Bill.  On the strength of the statement on the First Reading, I confess that I did not take particular notice of this Bill.  I noted this morning that Section 3 tries to undo what a generation of agitation accomplished only within the last three or four years.  It is rather surprising that we should have this in a formal Bill which is just intended to effect certain economies.  It seems to me, from the cursory reading which I have been able to give it, confirmed by the statement of the Minister, that the Bill is designed to allow any person who cares too little for his responsibilities as a citizen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>His or her responsibilities as a citizen&mdash;to evade them, because I gather that any person who can find a way of being objected to has his or her name deleted from the Register and will also be free from responsibility to serve as a juror.  Whether that is the intention or not in regard to men, it is quite definitely, and, shall I say of malice aforethought, provided for in the case of women.  I am rather expecting that there will be quite a vigorous agitation in the country. in view of the attempt to release women from their responsibilities as citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us have participated in demands that women should be given rights on the same terms as they have been given to men, in regard to citizenship generally, and those rights have been embodied in our Constitution.  But there is a corollary; those rights involve responsibilities, and I am not going at this early stage in the history of the new State, to say that having got rights <Col N="1668" /> we are going to release citizens from their responsibilities.  I submit that if women are going to claim, and do claim, the right to participate in Government, through elections, they have also the right to bear some of the responsibility and should not be allowed, except in clearly defined circumstances, to evade their responsibilities as jurors.</P>
    <P>I should be very much surprised if the women themselves who have actively promoted agitation for rights as citizens will not equally vehemently oppose any suggestion that they should be released of their responsibilities. But one of the consequences, I think, of Section 3, will be that a married woman who has home responsibility, but whose husband does not wish to be on the Register, will be obliged to attend as a juror, whereas the woman of means, with a certain amount of freedom and, perhaps, a better knowledge of the world, one part of the world, at any rate, will quite easily be allowed to evade any responsibilities at all.  I object to this kind of sex disqualification. I will ask the Dáil, if it intends to agree to this proposition, to say that similar privileges should be allowed to men, and I claim equal rights for men and women in this matter.  I am not going to agree to this method of giving special privileges to one sex, especially to the sex which has only recently achieved rights, of which these responsibilities are the counter-part.  It seems to me that the provision regarding University representation, or rather the University Electors' List, again invite the University voter to find a way of evading his responsibility as a juror, simply by arranging that his name shall not be placed upon the voters' lists.  We may as well recognise the fact, that a very great number of citizens would be very glad to exchange their rights as electors for their responsibilities as jurors.  If they can buy off their responsibilities as jurors by getting their names struck off the electors' lists, they will think it is very cheap indeed.  I certainly do not think that the Bill is justified in the present state without a very great deal of consideration. It goes very much further than the promise on the First Reading.  I suggest that it is really a Bill that <Col N="1669" /> ought not to pass until the Courts of Justice Bill has become law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words with regard to Clause 3.  During the last Dáil, and during the last year, I had a considerable number of petitions sent forward to me from various nursing institutions throughout the country.  In the end I brought all these together, and placed them in the hands of the Attorney-General, with a promise from him that when the Jurors' Bill would come to be dealt with, that he would endeavour to carry out, as far as he could, the wishes of these nurses. Perhaps I am going farther than what the Attorney-General said on that occasion. At all events, he promised he would look into the matter very carefully. Those resolutions were apparently unanimously in favour of the exclusion of nurses from these duties. Everyone will see that it would be impossible for nurses engaged in their avocations to take up duty as jurors. I see by Section 3, that the nurses can be relieved of these duties by sending a demand or a letter asking that their names be removed from the Jurors' list. What I had hoped would be done, was that the nurses would be dealt with in the same way as the other professions that are not asked to serve as jurors.  I should have preferred that they should have been excluded as nurses, rather than that they should have the trouble of writing individually, asking to be excluded. Deputy Johnson has raised another point or two, and in these I could not agree with him at all.  I am perfectly satisfied, as far as women are concerned, that it is only fair to give them the chance of not serving if they do not wish to serve as jurors.  I have supported, as strongly as he has, the claims of women for equal treatment with men.  But when it comes to a question of this kind, I would be in favour of letting the women have a say in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard to the University electors, I would say that I am sure that no University elector wishes to evade the duty placed upon him as a citizen to serve as a juror.  If there is anything in the clause that Deputy Johnson has referred to that would give a University elector an opportunity of evading his <Col N="1670" /> or her duty as a citizen I think that should be amended.  At all events we have not considered the matter fully yet.  I do not know whether it will be necessary for me to bring forward an amendment in the Committee Stage with regard to the exclusion of nurses. Perhaps the Minister for Home Affairs will give it his attention in the meantime. From the documents that I have received it seems to be the unanimous wish of the nurses to escape this service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Johnson, in his criticism of Clause 3, raises a very important matter for consideration. I think that Clause 3 will stand.  While Deputy Johnson rightly says that we have recently given rights to women beyond what they experienced before, I think it is rather a terrifying thing to saddle them as a whole class with responsibilities in this matter of juries, which possibly at a later stage they would be prepared to face better than they are at present, but which, we must recognise to-day, is rather a dreadful ordeal for women as a whole.  To be called upon to go to a court crowded with men of all sorts, and to sit on a jury, must be a very trying ordeal to women as we know them.  I hope Deputy Johnson will consider that giving them rights which they have acquired, and which they can properly exercise in voting for the various services of the State, will be rights which, if we saddle them with the responsibility of sitting on juries, will take away to a large extent what they have already gained, by saddling them with something that most average women think a very repugnant duty. There are plenty of women who will not mind serving on juries, and possibly would resent being taken off the jury list.  In this particular case it is only allowing a loop-hole for rather timid women to evade an obligation which I do not think it is for the good of the State to call upon them to perform, nor is it good that they should be subjected to a very unpleasant task of this nature.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson suggested that it would be open under the Bill to both men and women to evade jury service.  I would like to be shown where the loop-hole is through which men can escape, and I will undertake to lock it.  University electors do not escape jury service, because in general they will have a Local Government vote, which will bring them in as jurors under the provisions of the Bill. There remains then this controversial question, which the Deputy has raised, as to whether or not women ought to be enabled to secure exemption from jury service if they wish.  We are not depriving any woman of her rights. We are not depriving any woman of her responsibility.  What we are doing is, we are enabling women who feel such a positive dislike to serving in that capacity, to secure exemption.  We are putting on them the positive act of applying for such exemption.  We think that the exemption should be granted to women who feel that particular service distasteful, and it can well be understood that many women would likely feel jury service distasteful.</P>

If the Deputy will put down an amendment embodying his point of view we could get the feeling of the Dáil on the matter at the Committee Stage.  I think the arguments for and against the proposal are probably perfectly obvious to every Deputy.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Sir James Craig, that is a matter that could be dealt with under a later and more comprehensive measure which it is proposed to introduce after the passing of the Courts of Justice Bill.  This Bill was largely confined simply to the machinery of the jury service.  I think the provisions <Col N="1672" /> contained in Section 3 ought to be sufficient, for the present at any rate, to meet the object desired.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it be an instruction to the special Committee on Wireless Broadcasting that the Press be admitted to future sittings of the Committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This motion provides that the deliberations of the Committee on Broadcasting be henceforth open to the Press and, through the Press, to the public.  Already we have met the public clamour to a pretty large extent by deciding to publish the evidence given before this Committee up to a certain point.  I think that decision is all to the good.  I said on a former occasion I believe it will disillusion many people in regard to their conclusion under this particular heading, but at the same time I am quite satisfied that the matter has assumed such a serious rôle in the public mind that anything in the nature of withholding their entire demand for the expeditious publication of the evidence is open to misconstruction.</P>

      <P>Now while the majority of the people in this community of ours are prepared to concede to men holding responsible positions the virtue of honesty, I must say there is a small and active element which seems to thrive on the prospect of petty scandal.  I suppose we do not differ from most people in this respect, but nevertheless we have to recognise that that element is there, that it is active, and as long as it gets any material <Col N="1674" /> whatever to feed its soul on it will readily grasp it.  I fear that our failure to admit the Press on the occasion of this Committee's sittings is rather an incentive to people of that type of mind.</P>
      <P>There is, of course a further aspect. The more decent element of the community have been roused to the importance of Broadcasting as a medium of social life, if you like, and because of that fact they are naturally anxious to know what is doing and what the immediate future of Broadcasting is, or is likely to be.  One can scarcely blame these people if they express a natural desire to be permitted to follow the fortunes of this discussion.  I think they are entitled to that because of the fact that their curiosity has been aroused.  I do not think anybody desires to deprive them of the luxury of reading these matter-of-fact reports; but, nevertheless, I feel it is our duty to say here and now that as far as we are concerned we are prepared to facilitate, rather than to hinder them. I do not wish to occupy the time of the Dáil on this matter except merely to say that my own feeling is this.  We ought at once to decide to make these sittings of the Committee public, and to give the public anything that they derive from these discussions.  I beg formally to move the motion standing in my name.</P>

      <P>I think it would be well if we understood exactly what it is that is intended here.  The motion is: &ldquo;That it be an instruction to the Special Committee on Wireless Broadcasting that the Press be admitted to future sittings of the Committee.&rdquo; Does that mean that every sitting of the Committee, including those at which they will be discussing the nature of the Report, and deliberating upon the evidence received, will be open to the Press?  Is that the intention, and will that be the effect?  I think it will be the effect if this motion is passed, and I suggest that it would be an unfortunate decision of the Dáil to give an instruction that the Committee shall in the consideration of its Report conduct <Col N="1675" /> its discussions in the presence of the Press.  That is the effect of this motion if it is carried, and I just think it well to draw the attention of the House to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a very fair point to raise.  If the effect will be as Deputy Johnson has stated, I may say that is not what was in my mind, because I take it that Committees generally do not admit the Press to their proceedings after the evidence has been taken, and that it is not the rule to include the Press when the Committee resolves itself into private sitting to determine what is to be the outcome of its proceedings.  That certainly has not been my desire, at any time, and it certainly was not my desire in moving this motion, and if it should be the case and if it should appear possible to depart from what one considers to be the settled policy in regard to this matter because of this motion I may say, at any rate, that my position in the matter is quite clear.  If there are special Committees and special meetings of Committees at which evidence is not being taken, if there are sittings for the purpose of deciding the Committee's attitude in regard to past evidence&mdash;evidence already taken, or to hear corrections or correcting points from those who gave evidence in the past, I do not think that the Press has any particular claim to be there for the simple reason that the whole matter is contained in the Official Report.  My sole desire in this matter is that in the future evidence&mdash;I will emphasise the word &ldquo;evidence&rdquo;&mdash;that in the future taking of evidence the Press be admitted.  I would not consider the private sittings of the Committee as taking evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult not to have sympathy with the Postmaster-General in this matter.  He, as is indicated, has suffered more, perhaps, than any other individual concerned at the hands of those who circulate calumnies, and it is obviously natural on his part that he should require henceforth that all evidence should be taken in the presence of the Press, so that the machinery and engines of calumniation should, if not actually reduced to silence, at least find their work more of an inventive nature and more open to criticism on the part of the general public. I have thought of the Postmaster-General in this matter as he would appear to the political cartoonist.  He is a sort of King Lear, biding the pelting of the pitiless storm&mdash;the whistling of broadcasting inferior reception instruments undergoing tuning up, so that the oscillations produce new noises for every listener-in, and the inscription underneath would be that pathetic line of the play: &ldquo;I am a man more sinned against than sinning.&rdquo;  But might I suggest to the Postmaster-General that the proper time for him to have brought this motion before the House was long ago when he, as a witness, was called more than once before the Committee, at first to give original evidence and later rebutting evidence. He knew very well how valuable it would be in his conception of the value of publicity.  This motion comes when the Committee has ceased to take evidence. In its amended form, if it is put to the Dáil, it is an abortion, a dead letter; it is of no effect.  The last meeting of the Committee to take evidence is over, and the Committee is now preparing its report so that the motion, as amended, simply means that you do nothing, and that you are called upon to do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Postmaster-General has himself revised the script of his evidence for the final form of publication.  Copies are sent out to all the witnesses to give them an opportunity of correcting the grammar and of making what are called verbal alterations, not, of course, of <Col N="1677" /> mending their hand, so that the Postmaster-General, of all men, ought to have been aware of the advanced stage reached in the proceedings of the Committee. A malicious-minded person might suggest reasons for this twelfth hour resolution, but I do not propose to play that role on this occasion.  The Postmaster-General has forgotten in some of his remarks&mdash;it is obvious in making them that he had forgotten&mdash; that there was no resolution or determination, as I have already explained, on the part of the Committee to exclude the Press.  The Press did not come to the meetings of this Special Committee. We have been comparatively silent upon this matter hitherto.  There was one newspaper that did make application to the Committee, but it was not for the presence of a representative to hear the evidence and report it faithfully to the public; it was in the nature of an overture to a member of the Committee that he should disclose, prematurely, the report that the Committee would make to enable his paper to have a &ldquo;scoop,&rdquo; as it is called in journalistic phraseology. That was the sole application made to the Committee on the part of the Press until the twelfth day of the proceedings, and had they been admitted on that day&mdash;and it is only fair to Deputy Johnson to say that he was one of the two who voted for their admission&mdash;but had the Press been admitted on that day it would have had the effect of giving to the public the answering evidence of A without hearing the evidence to which it was an answer as given by B on a previous or earlier occasion.  The Committee, by a majority, more than a two-thirds majority, decided that in the interests of the public it would be better that as no Press representatives had been present hitherto that the Press should remain away until the end.  That was not predetermined opposition to the Press; it was not due to any desire to curb the Press or limit its privileges or interfere in any way with the great service it renders to the public through the publicity, such as it is, which it affords.</P>
    <P>We have been accused of breaking all the laws, and the Ceann Comhairle has been accused of being a co-partner in our guilt.  The Postmaster-General is <Col N="1678" /> evidently one of those who believe that under the Constitution, Article 25, the Press must be admitted.  Article 25 of the Constitution lays it down that the meetings of each House of the Oireachtas shall be public, and they are public so long as the official notetakers are present. The highest and the best form of publicity is provided for all the proceedings of the Oireachtas, and the same form of excellent publicity was provided for at our proceedings by the presence of the official notetakers.  The official notetakers attend the Dáil and give a verbatim report of our proceedings. They do not pick and choose. They report every word that is spoken; even surreptitious asides that I have been weak enough to indulge in occasionally I find recorded permanently in the pages of these most faithful official reports.  That is the publicity that is called for in the Constitution, and that publicity is uniformly provided.  A verbatim report is published and is available to the whole world at large. Similarly, we had publicity of that sort, too, and it now happens in the sequel that most of the evidence we took in the absence of the Press will be forthcoming for the public to read and study.  I say advisedly that the evidence we took in the absence of the Press, because we did not consider its absence up to the twelfth day.  These important sittings which might have provided such spicey and sensational items that they would call forth striking captions in the newspapers, took place, almost all of them, before the twelfth day&mdash;not all of them&mdash;and the Press was not present, not because we determined they should not be present, but because they determined themselves that they should not be present.  They did not want to be there, and did not ask to be there, but one paper had sufficient interest to want to know the result before anyone else could be aware of it.  Further than that, that newspaper interest did not extend.  What good purpose does the Postmaster-General think he will serve by bringing forward this resolution now?  It helps to fill the public mind with the idea that something is being kept back.  I do not accuse him of having that as his motive, but that is how it will appear.  It will appear <Col N="1679" /> that this inveterately villainous committee has been forced by the Postmaster-General, into whose administration it was inquiring, to come into the light of day.  I could write the leading article on the subject myself with the utmost ease.  I would invite the Dáil to say that this motion comes too late as a direction to the Committee.  It was never necessary, never really or genuinely necessary, and coming now it is absolutely unnecessary, because too late.</P>

      <P>I would support the last speaker in asking the Postmaster-General, in the first place, not to press this motion, and if he does, in asking the Dáil not to pass it.  I lay stress, not perhaps quite so much as the last speaker did, on the probable uselessness of the motion, in view of the stage which the Committee has reached in its proceedings, just because it is fairly possible that an occasion may arise when some witness would be asked to come again in order to supplement some evidence that he may have given before.  I think the last speaker drew attention in a very striking way to the fact that making a change at this stage of the proceedings of the Committee would be a very undesirable thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will the Postmaster-General gain by it?  Already every guarantee has been given that ultimately everything put in evidence will be made public.  All that he could possibly secure would be that a more or less intelligible account of some supplementary evidence would appear in the Press before it appeared in the final report of the Committee's proceedings.  I submit that is not an advantage sufficient to justify the Dáil in passing this motion.  I do not want to go into the general question as to whether the Committee were or were not right on technical grounds in the decision to which they came.  I hope that that point will be gone into by the Committee on Standing Orders, and that for future Committees it will be made perfectly clear what procedure ought to be adopted in such investigations. But the proper time to raise this was when it come before us some two or three weeks ago, when the general <Col N="1680" /> question of the Committee's action in excluding the Press at that stage of their proceedings was before the Dáil, and when, I think, the Ceann Comhairle ruled that the Committee were in order in taking that step.  It is not a wise thing to prejudge that question now by the Dáil passing this resolution, which would indicate that, unless the Dáil did pass such a resolution, any future Committees may proceed in a different way.  I think the resolution is quite unnecessary, that it will gain nothing, and that it will be a disadvantage to make a change in the procedure of the Committee at this very late stage in its work.</P>

      <P>I would also appeal to the Postmaster-General not to press this motion to a division, because, as Deputies Magennis and Thrift have explained, the Committee is now at the stage of its proceedings when it is considering the question of the Report that is to be presented to the Dáil, and it is doubtful if it will be necessary to call any further witnesses.  The newspaper people described the members of our Committee as so many Mussolini, but I think they were the real Mussolini, because they showed their strength by keeping away from the Committee until the twelfth day of its proceedings. Had they been allowed in at that stage they would not have been able to give the public a clear and a proper report of what had taken place there.  The members of the Committee stood for the widest publicity all along, and it was their desire to secure that that publicity should be as fair and impartial to all parties concerned as possible, and that no injustice should be done to any person whose name was mentioned during the proceedings of the Committee.  As has been explained already, no useful purpose would be served by passing such a motion as this at the present late stage.  I would again appeal to the Postmaster-General not to press the motion.</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised by the line which has been taken by the last two or three speakers on this matter.  They seem to question the wisdom of the Postmaster-General in bringing forward this motion.  I think that it is not a matter for us to decide whether or not the Postmaster-General was wise in bringing forward the resolution, but the motion being before us, the question for us to decide is the wisdom of rejecting it or adopting it.  I can see no possible reason why the resolution could not be adopted, and why the Press could not be admitted to further sittings if they want to come.  I do see many reasons why it would be unwise for the Dáil to reject the motion.  I have not the slightest doubt whatsoever, if the motion was rejected, that that fact would be used by outsiders to make a lot of capital out of the action taken by the Dáil and to say, wrongly, of course, that there is something to hide.</P>
      <P>The members who have opposed this motion are all members of the Committee, and undoubtedly conclusions&mdash; wrong conclusions&mdash;will be drawn.  As against that, what is to be lost by admitting the Press?  I cannot see, in spite of the eloquent speeches of the last three Deputies who have spoken, that there is any serious objection to allowing the Press in.  The last Deputy who spoke, I think, said that no good purpose would be served by admitting them at this stage.  I would say, as against that, that no good purpose will be served by rejecting the resolution.  I therefore suggest that the Dáil would be extremely unwise, in the circumstances as they exist now, to reject this resolution of the Postmaster-General. Whether the Postmaster-General was wise in bringing it forward is altogether another matter, and one that we have not to decide on.</P>

      <P>May I remind the Dáil, at this stage, that the people outside have got absolutely sick of this discussion about wireless.  I do think that this motion of the Postmaster-General ought to be passed without any comments at all, because the people have got so absolutely sick of the whole thing, that they will not take the trouble to read anything that is put <Col N="1682" /> into the papers about the matter.  We ought to realise that this country, at the present moment, is practically in a state of chaos, and we ought to try and do something for the people who are suffering, and stop all this cant about wireless.</P>

      <P>I only want to say that at the time my motion was put down, I had no intimation that no further evidence was to be taken.  In fact, I am rather inclined to think that evidence has been taken in the interval, and we are not perfectly sure just yet that no further evidence will be taken.  One Deputy has said that it may be still necessary to bring back a witness or two.  Deputy Magennis wants to know why, at the outset of the Committee's deliberations, I failed to request that those proceedings be conducted in public.  I must say that I realise more fully than any one else that I made a very grave mistake, from my own point of view, in not so requesting.  I have myself to blame for that, though, of course, the Committee had the option of getting this evidence produced to the public.  I am prepared, at any rate, to shoulder my own responsibility for that failure and, had I an opportunity of covering the same ground again, I most certainly would insist, at the outset of the proceedings, that the whole thing should be done in the light of day.  I have learned a lesson from that.  In view of the fact that the evidence is practically concluded, I do not see any great reason for pressing this motion. I do not want to score any point on it. But at the time I put down this motion &mdash;I want to make this clear&mdash;it appeared to me that the taking of evidence would go on for a considerable time.  I do not want to score a point on the matter, and if the members of the Committee, who have been very fair to everybody, think that no good purpose would be served by pressing the motion, I am in favour of withdrawing it.</P>

You were good enough on that occasion to consider the matter and to rule that it was quite in the discretion of the Committee to do as it had done.

In the meantime, I have given a good deal of consideration to <Col N="1684" /> the views he put forward.  Deputy Johnson urged the insertion of certain words, making it clear that offences dealt with under that paragraph would be confined to those having as their object and motive the destruction of the State fabric.  The difficulty about meeting that view is the difficulty of proving motive in the case of a particular offence.  It is sometimes, comparatively often, an easy thing to prove that a particular offence has, in fact, been committed by a particular person, but to go beyond that and prove the intent with which the person committed that offence is difficult.  The truism runs &ldquo;The devil himself knows not the mind of man.&rdquo;  To meet the Deputy in his views would involve getting inside the head of the criminal and knowing exactly the purpose and ultimate object which was aimed at in the commission of the offence.  Still, there was force and point in the objections urged, and I would be willing to go to this extent to meet them&mdash;I would transfer that paragraph to Part 2 of the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I want to express the opinion that the penalties laid down for the commission of offences as defined in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Schedule might be looked upon as extreme, in view of the fact that lack of supervision on the part of the military authorities may result in the commission of those offences.  I have noticed upon several occasions that people who are being demobilised from the army and ordinary civilians have been wearing uniform which is termed under this part of the Schedule &ldquo;Government property.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If any lack of supervision on the part of the military authorities is the cause of civilians being in possession of Government property, I think it is a hardship that the Minister should come forward in a Bill such as this defining certain penalties for the commission of offences due to lack of supervision on the part of the military authorities.  I am informed, for instance, that the ordinary officer or member of the army on being demobilised is asked to surrender one uniform and one revolver. I am reliably informed that in many cases the officer or ordinary soldier in the service has at his disposal more than one uniform and more than one revolver.  And if a revolver or any other equipment which he may be in possession of as a result of his service in the National Army may remain in his possession, then I think it is a hardship under a Bill of this kind to impose penalties.  I think there should be a greater amount of supervision on the part of the military authorities so that when officers or members of the army are demobilised it will be seen that none of those articles are in their possession, which might result in penalties being inflicted on them for being in possession of these arms.</P>

      <P>I just raise a point on paragraph 8.  &ldquo;Unlawfully interfering with or preventing the lawful occupation, use, or enjoyment of any land or premises.&rdquo;  I suggest that the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in the first line should be &ldquo;and.&rdquo;  It would mean that the interference would go with preventing unlawful occupation.  Otherwise it may mean that one offence is unlawful interfering with, and the other offence is preventing the lawful occupation, whereas, I take it that what is meant is the unlawful interference with and preventing.</P>

      <P>The effect of the change suggested by the Deputy would be simply to make one offence of it. Paraphrased, it would amount to this: &ldquo;Unlawfully interfering with to the extent of completely preventing the use and enjoyment,&rdquo; and so on.  Whereas our intention is to deal here with two distinct offences.  &ldquo;Unlawfully interfering with property,&rdquo; and then the offence of &ldquo;preventing the lawful occupation, use, or enjoyment of land and premises.&rdquo;  If the Deputy's change were accepted in that form, it would mean that no interference, short of an interference so great as to prevent the lawful occupation and use of the property, could be dealt with under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>True, but unfortunately interfering is a very elastic term, and unless it is connected up with some positive act, if it were attempting to prevent, for instance it would be more definite.  Unless the term &ldquo;interfering&rdquo; has relation to some positive act it may well be used unfairly and leave too wide a discretion.  I take it that the intention is that interference will be the object, that object being to prevent lawful occupation.  The other reading might require, as I think it will require, the word &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; to be inserted after &ldquo;or.&rdquo;  Then it would mean unlawfully interfering with or unlawfully preventing.  I rather suggest that the word &ldquo;interfering&rdquo; is too elastic a <Col N="1687" /> term and may mean thought, suggestion, or letter-writing, or one-hundred-and-one methods which might be interpreted as interference.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to raise another question with the object of trying to find out what the Minister has in his mind in Sections 10 and 11.  I hope I will not be accused of trying to assist or to excuse illicit distillation.  What I want to know from the Minister is whether the purpose of putting these two Sections in the Bill is to protect the Revenue, or is it to prevent the sale of bad, illicitly distilled, spirits?  If it is not to protect the Revenue, I take it that the Minister's object would be served, provided the shebeens and the illicit stills only dispose of good quality poteen.  I am told by those who are experienced that some illicit stills can turn out quite a good quality spirits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave these accusations to Deputy Gorey.  Deputy Good has probably been informed that some very good poteen could be obtained in certain parts.  I have heard some members of the Dáil say so, at any rate.  I am curious to know what the Minister has in his mind.  If it is to ensure that good poteen be sold, and not bad, then I think the Section should be differently worded.  But I think it is with the object of trying to save the Revenue that these two paragraphs are inserted.  It is quite a nice point, I agree, but it is important in that we should understand what the object of our legislation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not in mind primarily the protection of the Revenue. I take it, if legislation for the protection of the Revenue is considered necessary, it will be introduced by <Col N="1688" /> another Minister.  The practice of illicit distillation, as carried on in the country, is a social evil.  Our line of approach to the question is that it constitutes a grave social evil in many counties; that it is a factor towards crime, and that degradation of young people of both sexes follows on the practice of illicit distillation.  That is our angle of approach.  We have the evidence of clergymen, doctors, magistrates, and police officers from many areas, that there is no power the Dáil could possibly give that would be too drastic to combat this particular evil. Having regard to its results in different areas, it is beyond question a factor tending towards insanity and degeneracy, and it is destroying and degrading the youth of those areas.  It is from that angle the matter is approached by my Department, and not primarily, or even largely, from the angle of protecting the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have had from the Minister the statement that his object in including this paragraph is primarily and largely a social one, and for the purpose of preventing the possibility of the consumption of spirits, either of good or bad quality, because it is a great social evil.  The object of my question was rather to draw out that statement, because it seems to me to involve the necessity for a very strict control of the use of intoxicating liquor, whether illicit or licit. It is because of the evil effects of non-regulated consumption, that there is a call for such a measure as is proposed. Perhaps the Minister will agree with me when I say that the evil is only a degree less when it is controlled than when it is uncontrolled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would be in substantial agreement with the Deputy. The thing to remember about illicit distillation is this: Poteen is made by the people themselves in large quantities. The over-head charges of its manufacture would not be large.  It is presumably manufactured at night in out-of-the-way places, and it leads there and then, in the very act of manufacture, to drunkenness and degradation. Then it is not under any kind of judicious control afterwards.  It is presumably <Col N="1689" /> hidden round in yards and houses and premises of one kind and another, and is freely available to people in large quantities and at small expense, if any.  The result is, it is probably consumed in a raw, immature condition, and in quantities which really would be beyond the reach of the people if they had to pay for the ordinary distilled whiskey in the shops. It leads to crime and insanity and degradation. If the Deputy wants to provoke an opinion from me that all drink does that, the abuse of any alcoholic drink does lead to very bad results; but because this kind of drink is removed from any judicious or proper control, it naturally leads to those results in excelsis.  That is as much as I would be prepared to say on that point.</P>

I have not gone into the question of how frequently the general purpose of the amendment is achieved in further amendments, but inasmuch as it affects the entire scope of the Bill, and the other amendments are really incident to sections, I imagine that now is as good a time to deal with the essential matter contained in the amendment as any other time.

      <P>I would suggest that to deal with such a matter as is dealt with by Deputy Figgis in an amendment to a definition clause, might cause difficulties that we do not anticipate. I do not know at the moment what the effect of carrying Deputy Figgis's amendment might have on, say, sub-section 2 of Section 5.  It would raise a question whether we exempt certain pensions from the scope of the Bill and <Col N="1691" /> from the revision, and I am afraid the adoption of the amendment might cause them to be revised.</P>

      <P>On the whole I think it would be better to accomplish what is desired by the methods proposed in amendment &ldquo;9&rdquo; and other amendments.  If that involves any amendment of the definition section that amendment could be made later. The second part of Deputy Figgis's amendment&mdash;to add certain words at the end of the paragraph&mdash;is better covered in amendment No. 2, which, I think, excludes blind persons altogether from the operation of this bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in moving this amendment is this.  It has already been elicited that a good deal of the economy that the Minister for Finance is anxious to obtain has already been achieved and, therefore, there is no necessity to widen his original intention.  The original intention of the Minister, announced last November, is indicated by the wider scope of the Bill now before us.  In moving this amendment I wish to make it quite clear that the words used by several of us on Second Reading, myself included, were taken up by the Minister and responded to when he made the statement that Old Age Pensions were not the first things that he as Minister of Finance turned his attention to when he desired certain economy.  That, of course, is true.  One accepts that very fully, but the words that Old Age Pensions were the first to be turned to were used rather, if one may say so, as a rhetorical expression, meaning that old age persons should any how have been the very last to which any State should turn when seeking for economy. We are not the only nation at the present moment seeking to effect very drastic economy.  A neighbouring nation is also doing the same at the present moment, and it is the unanimous wish of all parties, irrespective of party loves and allegiances, that wherever economies may be effected the Old Age Pension should not be touched. Last November the Minister indicated that Old Age Pensions were to be cut by 10 per cent. and that there would be certain further economies that might in the future be effected, and it is in answer to that that I brought forward and base this amendment.  If there are to be any further economies that can be <Col N="1693" /> effected or should be effected, these economies should be searched out in the first instance before Old Age Pensions should be touched or tampered with. In November the Minister for Finance stated that he expected to achieve a 10 per cent. cut, and on the figures given in the last estimate that would have yielded, on his statement, an economy of round about £300,000.  Under the Bill he told us, on Second Reading, the economies to be effected would amount to £500,000.  That is considerably widening the scope of his original intention. I must come back now to that original intention.  I say that his original intention, when first undertaken, was that this cut would effect an economy not higher than £300,000.  In answer to a question put to him to-day as to what was the amount already economised, he admitted that these economies amounted to £100,000, and that that had been effected by the tightening up of administration.  I venture to say that if administration were still further to be tightened up in the coming year that £100,000 could be increased to a larger figure still.  However, here is the fact.  In November, 1923, he tells us that after searching and seeing what economies that could be effected, he desires to save in fixing Old Age Pensions an economy of £300,000, and now, in the month of March, 1924, he informs us that, irrespective of any such cut, £100,000 has already been effected, so he is left, according to his original intention of last November, with the necessity of only a further economy of £200,000 to be effected.  I have not the figures before me; the figures perhaps would be difficult to work out, even with the information available to the Minister with all the resources of his Department at his command.  How far less can they be available to an independent Deputy having no such Department to which to turn.  But I venture to say that a very great portion of the remaining £200,000 could be saved by making the Bill applicable not to persons over 75 years but between 70 and 75 years of age. The purpose of my amendment is this, and I do urge the Minister to consider it carefully, and I am sure he will, that the present rates should prevail for all <Col N="1694" /> persons up to and over the age of 75 that the new rates intimated in this Bill should apply only to persons between 70 and 75; that the effect, as has already been pointed by you, sir, that if any persons in the future passing from what I may call the interim period of 70 to 75 shall pass back to the scale of rates now prevailing.</P>

I have been looking to see if the Chief Ministerial Whip had been present in the House, and I regret to see that he is not, because last Sunday he made a speech in the County Dublin, I do not know whether it was with the approval of the Minister for Finance or not, stating that at some time in the future it was the desire of the Minister not to decrease the pension from ten shillings, but to increase it to twenty shillings.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that the Chief Whip is here now. That course, however, is to be postponed for the future.  Anticipating this millenium that is going to come in the future, we should at least diminish the present blow for those who are over seventy-five years.  I speak with some feeling in the matter, because I know something of the conditions in the extreme West, and I do know a number of cases of persons who are wholly dependent upon their old-age pension, and who, as they get older and older, are thrown more upon their old-age pension, because they are not able to till the tiny patches of fields that they could have done at an earlier time.  I therefore move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Figgis moved this amendment in the definition Section, because I am afraid it is liable to lead to a certain amount of confusion, and it would have been just as easy to have moved a series of amendments, if necessary, which would have dealt with all the points he wishes to cover.  As it is, I do not really know what the total effect of the amendment would be if passed.  I do see, however, that it would mean a certain stringency which is not meant to be applied to existing holders of pensions.  This would be applied to them if they exceeded seventy-five years of age, and it would have the effect, in regard to one class, that a person seventy-five years of age, would be treated worse than the person under seventy-five.  I would suggest to the Dáil that, from the point of view of clarity in legislation, they should refuse to accept this amendment moved, as it is, to a Definition Section. There has so far been no differentiation in the Old Age Pensions Act between old age pensioners of different ages.  The view taken was that a person who had reached the age of seventy years should have a pension, and should have no more of a pension when he got to eighty or ninety years of age. There was a flat pension for all persons over 70 years, and I do not think we should begin now making a difference between people who are seventy-five and people who are seventy.  There are questions of health involved, and it might very well be that people who are something under seventy-five would be a great deal worse off in reality than persons a little over seventy-five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, if you not merely exempt people over 75 from the cut, but also from the revision of means, it would involve a very great difference in cases that were otherwise exactly similar. For instance, in the case of a person who was only a month under the age, and in the case of another person who was a month over the age, a man might be just a month under seventy-five and another man might be a month over that age, and if both were persons with a certain amount of private means, that is to say, more than the lowest figure on the scale, the figure entitling to a full pension, there might be perhaps <Col N="1696" /> a difference of three or four shillings as between these two cases, which I suggest would be an anomalous situation, and which would cause a feeling that it is not desirable to create.  Deputy Figgis went into a number of matters which had been raised here from time to time, both on the original discussion in November, and on the Second Reading.  We have tightened up the administration as far as possible, but I do not want to pursue the line of tightening up administration too much.  There are many people who say that it might be desirable to relax administration just a little in this matter, in the proof of age, for instance. I think you could do a great deal of damage by tightening your administration too much.  You might make it too harsh, and refuse even to allow the pensioner the benefit of the doubt, and you might get too much inhumanity by too much tightness in your administration.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the figure £300,000 to be on the safe side.  The reason why we introduced a revision of means scale was to allow of an economy considerably greater than £300,000, as we do not want to be holding over the heads of the old age pensioners the prospect of a further reduction if the cost of living figure, say, were to go down by another fifteen or twenty points.  We do not wish to deal with this matter any further as regards effecting economies: that no matter how great a difficulty we might have to effect a Budget balance, no matter what stress we might be put to to get down to a figure of expenditure that it would be necessary for us to get down to, that still we would be in a position which would enable us not to have to touch the old age pensions any further.  What we have been prepared to do in that matter and what we have done, even if it means very great hardship and very great dislocation, is to drop a service or get rid of items of expenditure in order to cut down our expenses rather than to touch the old age pensions any further.  If we had merely effected a cut of a shilling and had done nothing more, I, for my part, would not feel able to say that we would not interfere any further with the old age pensions.  If the Bill is passed in the form in which <Col N="1697" /> it is put up, including both the cut and the revision of means, I feel that I can rightly say that no matter what else we may have to do we will do nothing more in the matter of the old age pensions, and that was why we revised the means. I would suggest that we could, on subsequent amendments, discuss the application of the cut for the persons who are over seventy-five, and the revision of the means scale in the case of people over seventy-five, and that we should not adopt what is brought forward here as an amendment to a definition section.</P>

      <P>So far as the principle of moving amendments to a definition clause is concerned, I am bound to say I appreciate fully the line of argument the Minister took and I think that it is particularly desirable that amendments to definition clauses should not be moved.  It is not with any desire of laying any unction to my soul that I say there are seven amendments to this definition clause, and I am only one sinner amongst the seven. I move the amendment primarily with a view to getting a decision on the fundamental point.  How that is to be achieved, whether by change of wording in the definition clause or by moving addenda to various other clauses as they occur throughout the Bill, is a matter on which I am quite indifferent.  I notice there are amendments to various clauses throughout the Bill.  I had been asked by one Deputy, who has returned here, to move an amendment on his behalf.  I do not want this point to be put aside on a technicality as to whether the amendment should or should not be moved in the present place.  The intention it is sought to achieve is much more important than the form of words by which it is sought to achieve it.  I am quite prepared not to press my amendment if, when we come to amendments 9, 10, or 11, the debate will not be prejudiced by the fact that I am withdrawing this amendment now, and the matter will not be regarded as in the nature of a <i>chose jugée.</i></P>

      <P>One thing strikes me about the moving of amendments to definition clauses, that in the <Col N="1698" /> case of Bills which begin with a definition section one could forestall all amendments by moving amendments to the definition clauses.  If this amendment were voted on and defeated, it would raise a point as to whether certain other amendments on the paper are in order.  For my own part, I would prefer that this amendment should not be decided upon now, so that no point would arise which might prevent numbers 9, 10, and 11 from being moved.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 23, to delete the words &ldquo;and in either case includes&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;but does not include.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment we have been considering, but which has been withdrawn, does not seem to have regard to the fact that Section I of the Act of 1920 is a Blind Person's Act, which gives the pension to blind persons at the age of 50.  I have not heard any good reason adduced, so far, by the Minister for making this Bill apply to blind persons, and I think there are very good reasons why they should be excepted.  It was thought when the Blind Persons Bill was passed&mdash;the Act of 1920&mdash;that those who would be eligible for the pension at the age of 70 who were sighted would come into pensions at the age of 50 if they were blind.  The purpose of the amendment is to secure that no change shall take place in respect of the age as affecting blind persons.  No figures have been really adduced by the Minister to tell us what the effect of the Bill in respect of blind persons would be, but I gather that there were in 1911 only 3,054 totally blind persons in the whole of the country over the age of 55.  There would be somewhat more than that over the age of 50.  How many more we cannot <Col N="1699" /> find out and have not been told. But I imagine that there is a considerably less than 3,000, if we are to take the 26 Counties; possibly there are not more than a couple of thousand.</P>

      <P>Might I intervene to give the figures the Deputy requires? The number for the Saorstát is 3,513.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to maintain 3,500 people in receipt of their present pensions, instead of reducing them by 1s. and subjecting them to such other, shall I say, &ldquo;de-benefits,&rdquo; as are proposed in the Bill.  I think blind persons in Ireland particularly have reason for special consideration.  They have not the opportunities of earning a livelihood or of being supported by institutional treatment, and have not the opportunities of earning a living that they have in Scotland or in England. We have an extra obligation to them because of our failure to provide the treatment which even the law insists should be provided.  Section 2 of this Blind Persons Act imposes obligations on the County Councils with regard to institutional treatment which have never been put into operation, and the County Councils have not been obliged by the Local Government Authority to put them into operation.  In fact, the Government has allowed the County Councils to disobey the law in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of this same Act requires that County Councils shall make provision for the welfare of the blind in their districts.  That is a compulsory Section, and it seems to me that that alone gives one good reason why we should not disable still further the blind in Ireland.  The blind man or woman at 50, who has not an income and who is not able to earn a living, is in a very much worse plight in Ireland than a similar person in any other country.  We have made it more or less an obligation that they should become beggars on the roads and that they should be forced to solicit charity and alms&mdash;sometimes not so much charity. I think we might at least show a little leniency in respect of the blind in this matter, and not deprive them of the <Col N="1700" /> 1/- in the case of the 10/- pensioners. As a matter of fact, they should be exempted from this Act altogether, leaving them in the position they have been in up to now, which was not as good a position as they should have been placed in. Even as it was, the Government did not enforce the provisions of that Act. I would ask the Minister to give a little consideration to this case, and to allow an amendment to be passed which would save the blind from this penalisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount involved in this matter would not be large; but heretofore, the blind person has been treated in all respects in the same way as the old age pensioner, except in the matter of age.  It would create a certain amount of difficulty, and would cause a certain amount of extra work and trouble in offices if you made any differentiation.  The machine moves a good deal better if you have the same scales of pension and the same scales of means for both old persons and blind persons.  I do not think that it could be contended, really, that the blind person who is fairly able-bodied, is more in need of money than the absolutely helpless old person.  I agree that something should be done to provide training for the blind and to assist them in doing such work as blind persons can do, but I do not think that the blind person who is helpless through blindness, is really any greater object of charity than the sighted person&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;who is helpless through age and infirmity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, certain difficulties would arise owing to the fact that the Blind Persons Act is a recent Act.  There are a number of blind persons who are aged, perhaps, seventy-three or seventy-four, who got their pensions, not under the Blind Persons Act, but under the Old Age Pensions Act.  There is nothing to distinguish them as blind persons. They got the pension because of their age.  They would be cut and have their means reviewed, while younger blind persons, if this amendment were adopted, would not suffer the cut, but would have their pensions remain at the present level.  That is a difficulty against it.  On the whole, I think while <Col N="1701" /> you can make out a case for any particular class of people, we should let the situation remain as it is at present: that there should be a flat pension for old persons, and that the people who are blind should be on the same scale as persons over seventy years of age.  It is a question really of requirements, and we should not be influenced by the pity that even a blind person who is not in any way in want of money or want of comforts that money can bring, must excite.  I think we are prone to be led away by that feeling of compassion which really has nothing to do with the question of the amount of money involved.  We pity even the wealthy blind person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether any member of the Dáil is prepared to support this suggestion or amendment, which would make some exception in the case of the blind.  I can quite understand the attitude of the Minister.  He is naturally voicing the views of the people of his office who look upon rows of figures, dates and amounts in a severely logical manner. They tell you that blindness of itself is an affliction and should excite pity, whether the blind is old or young or rich or poor, and no matter how the blindness may have been caused&mdash; but they remain severely logical and adamant.  I ask the Dáil to consider the humanities of this case, and to think of these 3,500 people in the position they are in.  They must be people who are not in receipt of an income of ten shillings per week.  Most of them are not in receipt of any income at all, except such as they are able to obtain by indiscriminate asking for alms or by charity, or through the support of their friends.  They are particularly helpless.  They usually require somebody to accompany them, and that in itself is an extra charge upon their pension.  They are more helpless than the man of seventy who has his sight.  In very many cases it means the keeping of two people because of helplessness, and special care has to be taken and special expense has to be incurred in looking after the blind man or woman.  The Minister says, of course, that the pensioner over seventy who is blind and <Col N="1702" /> has received his pension on account of the Old Age Pensions Acts prior to 1920, would be placed in a disadvantageous position.</P>
      <P>I think the Dáil could find ways and means of altering this Bill before it finishes with it, to bring even those people into the better position that the blind would be placed in if my amendment were accepted.  I suggest that it is not good enough for the Minister to put forward as an objection in a matter of this kind that it would cause extra trouble in the office.  If that is the attitude of the Minister in regard to these things, I think it ought not to be allowed to weigh with the Dáil too much.  Let us remember that he is speaking now from the official standpoint, that it is a nuisance to have to make discriminations.  It is very much easier to have automatic work in the office; the bureau will do its work very much more simply and easily if we do not make exceptions.  That is naturally the official attitude in the matter and particularly the attitude that the Minister for Finance may be expected to adopt.</P>
      <P>It is not the attitude that the Dáil should adopt.  We are supposed to be in touch with the people of the country and to express the views of the people of the country on matters of this kind, and to bring, in opposition to the bureau, some of the feelings and thoughts of humanity.  I submit that in this case the Dáil would be failing to respond to the desires of the country, whatever they may say about old age pensions as a whole, we should be failing to respond to that desire if we bring the penalties that this Bill involves upon the aged, who also happen to be blind.  I will ask the Dáil to express itself in this matter, and to agree with me that this Bill should not include blind persons who have come in under the Act of 1920, from 50 years upwards.</P>

      <P>I am going to support Deputy Johnson in his amendment. He has made out a very good case.  I do not think he even went far enough.  I think there are no more helpless beings in God's earth than the blind, because they not only require someone to look after them, and to prepare <Col N="1703" /> their food, but they cannot go out to get sticks to keep up their fire, and if they have any intelligence they require someone to let them know what is being done in the Dáil here, and to keep up their interest in public affairs.  One of the saddest things is to see these people in the streets and roads and lanes in the country begging for sustenance.  I have no justification, perhaps, for saying it, but I have been told that a great many people were put upon these lists who did not deserve to be upon them. As far as the actual blind were concerned, I think the Dáil would be acting in the case of humanity in continuing to give as large a pension as they could.  For this reason I support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson justly chided the Dáil for not having expressed itself, but he covered the case so well that he left very little for others to say.  He is in the habit of expressing himself very completely on behalf of a silent party, and no one must complain if he expresses himself on behalf of silent Deputies outside his own Party.  Nevertheless, there is one point which he did not make, and I draw attention to it now.  We are talking about economy.  What is the value of the economy that is effected if Deputy Johnson's amendment is defeated? What will be the extra expense incurred by the State through Deputy Johnson's amendment being adopted?  A difference of £9,000 per annum on the figures given by the Minister himself.  The thing, from a monetary point of view, is absurd. From every other point of view, from every right human point of view, Deputy Johnson's case is complete.  I shall support it if he presses the matter to a vote, as I hope he will.  It is perfectly true, as Deputy Sir James Craig has said, that certain persons are being put in receipt of this blind person's pension who are not entitled to it.  There is, unfortunately, in this, as in other matters, a certain conspiracy to defraud the State.  These are the kind of cases to which I have referred so frequently, and recently, when I spoke of tighter administration.  By all means see that no one who is not <Col N="1704" /> entitled to receive it, does receive this pension.  But having done that, for the sake of £9,000, do not inflict this hardship upon persons who are blind and helpless, and who, only since the passing of this 1920 Act, received the benefit which they were entitled to receive from the community long before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am under a certain amount of difficulty in this matter, because I may say my heart is with Deputy Johnson, and my head is with the Minister for Finance.  I think that that principle will be the difficulty underlying a fair consideration of this Bill. Deputy Johnson makes a case for the blind.  Surely none of us will, in any way, take away from his arguments. Blind people are very specially to be pitied, but what in essence does this claim amount to?  The Minister for Finance has come along, and he has based his cut on the old age pension first of all on the necessity of the needs of the country.  He has also pointed out that the present old age pensioner in receipt of 10s. a week, which was put in operation some years ago, is no worse off at 9s. a week to-day than he was then at 10s. a week.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I say he is in no worse position at 9s. to-day than he was then, when it was put into operation on 10s. That is to say when the pension was increased to 10s. the cost of living was so much higher than it is now that 9s. is more than equivalent to the 10s. he was then paid.  Now, another argument, and a very proper argument, is that the amount of money involved in this question of the consideration of the blind is not large.  It is not large.  But cannot you logically carry your argument right through the Bill on that basis and make exceptions in various directions, which will, as far as the administration of the Act is concerned, do away with any economy altogether?  In other words, none of us like this question of cutting the old age pensions.  I do not think the Minister for Finance brought it forward with any great pleasure, and he said so.  He brought it forward as a matter of necessity.  But to differentiate between different classes of persons in connection with old age pensions and <Col N="1705" /> blind pensions is going to open up a vista of administration which is going to make the administration of the Bill even very much more difficult than at present.  Rather I would put it to the Dáil that the amount of money that is going to be saved, should be put aside, so as to help the blind people to be better able to take care of themselves and to learn trades and to be put in a position that if a man or woman gets blind he or she may be in a position of being self-supporting, and not have them coming under this at all.  I would rather see three times the amount of money spent in that direction than in this way of making exceptions to them as a class of individuals that are different from their neighbours in any way. I appeal to the Dáil, much against my will, not to accept Deputy Johnson's amendment on this ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Johnson was in need of the present of Deputy Hewat's heart or what use he will make of it.  But I congratulate the Minister on being presented with Deputy Hewat's head.  I hope he will keep it very carefully and will consult it when framing his Budget. I must say in this case both my heart and head go to Deputy Johnson, who does not want them.  He certainly does not need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has made a case: the saving to be effected is so small and the position of the blind is so exceptional.  You cannot compare a man or woman of seventy or seventyone, who can read their papers and smoke their pipes and have a minor enjoyment of life, and sometimes perhaps do a little work, to a person to whom all is darkness.  I cannot help feeling that for the sake of saving £9,000 we may be doing an injustice greater than we really intend.  The Minister in framing the Bill budgeted for a margin.  He mentioned something like 10 per cent.  He has realised more than that, and possibly out of that margin he might be able to meet the case of the blind.  If the Minister is prepared to accept, with Deputy Hewat's head, the suggestion that he should spend three times the figure&mdash; £27,000 or £30,000&mdash;on ameliorative lines, and is prepared to give a pledge <Col N="1706" /> to that effect, I will vote with him against the amendment; but, if not, I will support Deputy Johnson.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Hewat's head and Deputy Hewat's suggestions very much.  The position is that blind persons were put on the same level as the aged, when the Blind Persons Act was introduced.  Everything that can be said in favour of giving people who are blind more than those who were merely old, could be said, even if this Bill were not being introduced.  It is an argument that these reductions do not affect in any way.  I would say, apart from the compassion one must feel for the blind, that bed-ridden, infirm persons of seventy years are in need of any money that can be given to them, just as persons who are blind.  The helplessness is as great, and, perhaps, in matters of food and other comforts, the need might be greater.  I feel that anything that can be done by the State in the way of providing facilities for tending the blind, so that they may be able to work and help to support themselves and to have the happiness and interest they would get from being able to work, would be very sympathetically considered.  I would not say that three times the amount now to be saved should be spent in that direction.  I have no hesitation, however, in saying that if a practical scheme were put up I would certainly agree to the expenditure of the £9,000 that has been mentioned here, on some system of training for the blind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The expression of the Minister's willingness to support something in the way of assisting the blind to earn their living in some manner better than they are able to do, is very acceptable.  Of course, the provision of such a scheme rests with another Department, and judging by the conduct of that Department in the matter of the Blind Persons Act, we have not much to hope for in that direction. So I am not going to urge the Dáil, in view of the promise that something might be done in future in that respect, to take that promise in exchange for the <Col N="1707" /> suggestions in the amendment.  When that promise has been fulfilled and something of practical value is done, then of course we might willingly consider the alteration of the Bill in bringing the blind into the same position as the rest of the community.  But let us wait until that has become effective, and not exchange something tangible for something which may arise in future.  At present the position is that the blind will receive their present pension.  We are now asked to alter that.  I ask the Dáil not to agree to any alteration, and I propose to go to a division.</P>

We hope, in any circumstances, if a proposal were put before him for the benefit of any section of the citizens, he would give it his beneficent attention.  It did not require his protestations on this occasion to give us that assurance.  He mentioned an argument here, the validity of which I question.  He stated it had hitherto been the principle that there should be no differentiation between persons who were old and persons who, in addition to being old, were also blind.  There has been a differentiation.  It is perfectly true there has been no difference in regard to the money they should receive, but there has been a difference in regard to the age at which they begin to receive the money.  There has been that difference, and it is only an extension of something that prevails at the moment.  If that difference be carried into this Bill, if this Bill becomes an Act, and those of old age have their pensions dropped, those who are of age and are blind shall not have the same treatment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting down this motion is in order to try to find out exactly what the mind of the Local Government Department is in its relation to the various Councils in the State.  In the first place they seem to be affected by an over-dose of the now prevalent disease called &ldquo;economy.&rdquo; The policy which the Local Government Department in its present frame of mind is following is indiscriminate economy, and an economy which is not going to achieve what perhaps the the Minister has in his mind.  The Local Government Department is pursuing a policy which to my mind is not in conformity with what the people considered they would get from a native Parliament.  Recently circulars have been sent out to the various Councils in the State, calling upon them to practise the most rigid economy in all their Departments. They did not point out at the beginning what economy could be effected, and I am sure it will be news to the members of this House to know that the present unhappy state that some of the Councils in the State find themselves in to-day is due to the policy of the Local Government Department.  I speak with first-hand knowledge of my own native county, and the Local Government <Col N="1711" /> Department owes the County Wexford to-day the sum of £52,000.  It is very hard on a Council which has been harassed like the Wexford County Council has been, for some four or five years past, to try to exist and to carry out its ordinary functions, when the Department I have mentioned is keeping back the huge sum of £52,000.  In consequence of that money being withheld, the Council has had to borrow a sum equal to it, for which they have to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent.  I do not think it is a very wise policy of the Government to withhold from a Council in Ireland a huge sum of money like that, and to sanction an overdraft from the bank on which they have to pay 5 per cent. interest, and in the same voice to call upon them to economise.  Now, various representations have been made to the Minister in order to try to get from him the rights which that Council are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Under the old <i>régime,</i> so far as I know, these grants were paid regularly. Sometime recently a deputation waited upon the Minister.  Of course he was very sympathetic and told us he would do all he could; he was very courteous and all the rest, but he seemed to be tied down by the Treasury to a certain policy.  He told us that the reason for the grants being withheld was because it was anticipated that the annuities would not be paid during the coming year.  To my mind that is not a policy or an attitude that any responsible Government should take up.  So far as I know, and I think the Minister will agree, the annuities in the County Wexford have been paid very well.  As a matter of fact, in the exact words of the Minister concerned, up to December last they had been paid extremely well in the County Wexford.  Now I am sure the Dáil will forgive me for dealing with the County Wexford, but as I have first-hand knowledge of that county I think it is well that I should use it in support of my arguments in favour of this motion, because I feel pretty certain that the same condition of affairs prevails in other counties in the State.  What I object to is that these grants are withheld, as the Minister says, in anticipation of farmers not <Col N="1712" /> paying their annuities during the coming year.  That, as I have said, is not a policy or an attitude that any Government should take up.</P>
    <P>It appears to be the policy of the Government that if certain counties in the Free State do not pay their annuities at all and that other counties pay up in full, that the counties that are paying up and discharging their liabilities are to be subject to the same treatment as the counties that do not pay at all.  There is another aspect of the situation that I wish to refer to. Recently the President told the Dáil that the Local Government Department were about to release one-and-a-quarter millions of money in order to relieve unemployment and to reconstruct roads in Ireland.  He told us that a motion which had been moved here was tantamount to a vote of censure upon the Government because the Deputy who moved the motion had in his mind that the unemployed in the Free State had been neglected.  We thought at that time that the Minister would permit Councils to expend this money at the rate of wages that prevailed in the particular areas, and we were rather surprised that circulars were sent broadcast to the Councils operating in the Free State area stipulating that a certain wage should be paid which, to my mind, was a disgraceful wage, and should not be suggested by anybody taking upon themselves the responsibilities of the Government of a country.</P>
    <P>I put down a question about a fortnight ago asking the Minister for Local Government where he derived his authority to fix the wage suggested in the circular, and he told me that he derived such authority from Parts 2 and 3 of the Roads Act.  So far as I can see, the only place that he could derive that authority is under Section 4, Sub-section (8) of that Act, which states: &ldquo;Advances to County Councils may be made by way of loan or grant, or partly one way or partly another on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Board think fit.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that that particular Section does not bear the interpretation that he puts on it, and I suggest that if Hansard were looked up during the period in which that Act was going through the British House <Col N="1713" /> of Commons it will be found that no such statement was made, that such conditions should apply, or that would enable the Minister to take the inference that he has taken from that particular Section.  There is a stipulation in that grant that ex-National soldiers should get first preference.  So far as I am concerned, I think it is pretty generally known that I have been on the side of the Government in the last conflict.  I have never hidden that, and I do not want to do so now, but I do think that discretion ought to be left to the various Councils in Ireland to deal with unemployment in their area as the position warrants they should deal with it.  There are men in the Free State to-day who have been idle for the last three or four years.  Some of them made application to be taken into the Army, but they were not taken for some reason or another.  I do not think it is the right thing for the Government to prevent these people from working and earning a livelihood if they are willing to do so, and I suggest that they withdraw this clause. The Councils of Ireland, so far as I know, though there may be some exceptions, are fully alive to what they owe to the National Army for what it did during the recent struggle.  The wages suggested by the Minister may, I think, be taken at an average of 28s. per week.  How anybody with any sense of responsibility or with any knowledge of the price of food stuffs in this country at present could expect a man to keep a wife and family on 28s. a week is beyond my comprehension.</P>
    <P>I am sure if the Minister goes into the matter he will find that it was absolutely impossible for that man to do so.  To go back to the question of the National Army men, I do not think that it is fair that these men should be used&mdash;I do not say that they are deliberately used&mdash;to cut down the wages of their fellow men, because if the Councils in Ireland can get National soldiers to work for 28s. a week at making roads, it follows as night the day that there will be a general reduction in that particular period and that the private employer is going to take advantage of the situation created <Col N="1714" /> by men working at 28s. per week.  I want to know is it the considered policy of the Local Government Department to make that a medium for cutting down employees' wages.  They may say that it is not their intention, and that these particular conditions only apply to the grant of 1¼ millions. I have a recollection of a County Council meeting at Wexford.  When this particular grant and the conditions attaching to it came up for consideration an employer rose to his feet and proposed that the wages for County Council work should be at the rate of 28s. a week, a reduction of 18s. on the present wage in that county.  That man, I suggest, was prompted to do so by the conditions attaching to the grant which the Government proposed to pay to County Councils.  I would appeal to the Minister for Local Government to revise and reconsider his decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>The members on these benches are as anxious for economy as any other body, but we are asking you not to start economy again on the bottom dog and not have the same spectacle as we have had by the cutting down of old age pensions. All economies are starting at the wrong end.  I believe that there should be a general enquiry into the whole question of Local Government before you start an indiscriminate policy of economy and an attack on the workers' wages.  You certainly have an advantage, and you are using it over the unfortunate man who has been idle for the past three or four years.  I do not think it is fair when you find a man on the verge of starvation to use him as a medium to cut down the wages of his fellow man.  It is not a proper position to put a soldier in, a man who has given his best in order that his country might live.  There is another matter in connection with Local Government administration to which I would like to refer. The Department, as I said before, have sent circulars round calling on Councils to practise the most rigid economy. During the war between England and this country the County Councils were instructed by the Local Government Department of Dáil Eireann, which, I am glad to say, practically all the Councils now in the Free State area, recognised <Col N="1715" /> and obeyed to do certain things in connection with rate collection.  They were told to disregard the treasurer whom they had up to that time, and were told to appoint trustees and to instruct the rate collectors to lodge their collections with those trustees.  That was in direct conflict with the terms of their appointment.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Department were certainly alive to that situation, but they persisted in their instructions, which I considered right instructions, for that particular time.  I have raised this matter before, but I do not think that there is any harm in raising it again.  In County Wexford there were 21 rate collectors, 17 of whom refused to obey the instructions that had been sent from the Local Government Department through the County Council, with the result that the County Council had to discharge them by express instructions from the Local Government Department.  The County Council had then to appoint new rate collectors, who duly took up their positions, but most of them found themselves in prison before six months were at an end.  What was the surprise of the County Council to find that last year the Ministry set up a tribunal in order to pay these men who had disobeyed the Council and the nation in a very critical period!  I have no objection to giving them remuneration if they think they are entitled to remuneration, but I object to the local Councils being called upon to pay the burden of such remuneration.</P>
    <P>The Councils which took this particular action were acting in the interests of the nation at the behest and direction of the Government, and I think that this is a matter that ought to be taken up by the Government, and that the remuneration should be paid by the Government, and should be adjusted in the same way as the other financial arrangements will be adjusted between the two countries.  There is also another aspect of the situation.  It is in connection with the collection of rates at the present time.  There are rate collectors in certain counties who have done their duty as well as it is possible to do it under the conditions prevailing.  A certain amount of rates <Col N="1716" /> is outstanding, and the Government insist that those rate collectors should proceed to obtain decrees against the defaulters.</P>
    <P>In a great many cases rate collectors hold decrees against defaulters for full amounts.  They have had to lodge a certain amount of money to get those decrees. Those decrees have been given in the Courts for a considerable time, yet there is no sign whatever of the decrees being executed.  That may be a matter for the Minister for Home Affairs, but, in the first instance, it is a matter for the Minister for Local Government to bring pressure on the Minister for Home Affairs in order that the various Councils of Ireland may operate as they should.  The real grievance is that the Government will not allow County Councils to pay rate collectors until the decrees are executed.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw the attention of the Dáil to the question of amalgamation.  This is a matter which was approached very hastily.  The various Councils in the Free State obeyed the Government at the critical time without due regard to the aged poor and the sick.  It was pointed out to the Councils by the Local Government Department at that particular time that certain economies would be effected, and that the brand of pauperism would be lifted from the people.  I was doubtful then that that would happen, and I am doubtful now that it will.  I remember being called to Dublin, accompanied by Dr. Ryan, T.D., Seamus Doyle, T.D., and Sean Etchingham, T.D., to interview the President, who was then Minister for Local Government.  We were evenly divided on the question of amalgamation, not on the broad principle of amalgamation, but on some of its details. Two of us were in favour of cottage or district hospitals, and two against.  The President tried to reconcile the two positions in his usual manner, and gave certain promises.  Those promises, up to now, have not been fulfilled. He promised that in view of what we considered to be the faults of the scheme, he would institute an inquiry inside of twelve months if amalgamation did not work satisfactorily. As far as I know that promise has been brought to the minds of the Ministry <Col N="1717" /> on two different occasions within the past twelve months, and nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest that the question of amalgamation should be gone into thoroughly and examined, with a view to finding out if the necessary economies have been fulfilled, and if the sick and infirm are getting the attention they deserve.  Personally, I do not think they are.  In view of the fact that all those schemes were rushed, I do not think it was carried out even as satisfactorily as the Minister himself thought it would have been, under the conditions which prevailed.  There is another matter, and that is the question of the proposed abolition of District Councils.  I do not know if I am in order on this, in view of the fact that the Government have not declared their policy, but I do know that a deputation from the various District Councils in the Free State has waited on the Minister for Local Government in view of certain rumours that were abroad, that he was about to abolish District Councils. He made a reply which prompted them to believe that he was going to abolish District Councils.  I wonder has he considered the effect that that will have on the administration of the various counties?</P>
    <P>As far as I know, County Councils at the present time have already too much to do, and if District Councils are to be abolished it is going to mean that the County Councils will have to stay in session constantly.  It is a retrograde step.  Even the newspapers in the country say that, and God knows they are bad enough.  I would ask the Minister for Local Government to reconsider his decision in the matter.  I do not think that the people will be represented as they should be if the District Councils are to be abolished. There are many little things which get attention from the District Councils about which the County Councils have no time to bother.  In conclusion, let me say that I think the Local Government Department are taking too much notice of the ramblings of the Press on the question of economy.  I think that the pretext upon which the Local Government Department demands an inquiry nowadays is not sufficient to warrant that there should be an inquiry. <Col N="1718" /> I do hope I am wrong in thinking that it is the considered policy of the Government to send Commissioners to the various areas to administer local affairs.  That would be a retrograde step and should not be listened to for a moment by the present occupants of the Ministry.  If the British Government had suggested anything similar two or three years ago I could imagine our President holding up his hands in holy horror and using it as a foundation for a magnificent speech.  I would ask the Ministry to reconsider its whole policy and to take the country into its confidence as to what it is going to do, especially in regard to the wages question and the undue interference between public boards and their employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second the motion put forward by Deputy Corish. It gives me no pleasure to make any charge against the Ministry of Local Government.  Rather I wish that I were able to support their policy in the country, but unfortunately their action in almost every case prevents me from doing so.  Deputy Corish referred to road workers' wages under the grants. I was one of a deputation which waited on the Minister on the 14th February last.  I put it forward to him that 35s. weekly would be a fair wage for a man on those grants.  I could not get him to go any further than 30s.  On last Monday week my County Council were almost unanimous, with one dissentient, in asking the Minister to sanction a flat rate of 35s. for the county.  We considered that that rate would be something reasonable for men who were demobilised and who did not get that particular training as workers, which they would have but for the unfortunate conditions prevailing in the country for the last two years.  Instead of that we are offered 30s.  During the interview we had with the Minister he admitted that it was more or less of a dole rather than a grant given for work in return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submitted to him then, and I submit to him now, that we want a return in work for the money expended on these roads.  If we are to pay a fair wage it is not fair to throw a number of demobilised soldiers on to the country <Col N="1719" /> and ask them to work for a wage which means the cutting down of the wages of the permanent workers.  I think it is a deliberate insult to the manhood of these men to use them as wage breakers.  It is nothing less.  I am sure the demobilised men will look upon it as an insult, and I hope that when the next Election comes they will show their disapproval of it.  There is one matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister, as we are speaking of the roads, and that is the work of the assistant-surveyors. I think that the Minister should see to it that these officials should give at least 200 days to direct road supervision in the year.  I know cases where these men, although officials, do not do any work for the Councils, and I say that they should be made to do it.  They get out through the loophole of being part-time officers.  What is the consequence? The reports they send in to the County Surveyor, and through him to the Councils, are nothing short of disgraceful.  I say that paying out money to such men on the part of the Ministry is disgraceful.  If we try to do anything we are up against these officials.  Another matter that the Ministry should see to is that the salaries of Secretaries of County Councils should be reduced to something like a reasonable amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to the dismissals by Sealed Orders of officials because of their political opinions, and I would ask him to withdraw these Sealed Orders and allow these officials to resume their duties, that is, if the county or other councils affected will allow them to do so.  I think if we are to return to normal conditions these little pin-pricks from authorities in <Col N="1720" /> Dublin should cease and people should be allowed to get back to something like normal conditions and get on with the work of the country that we are talking so much about.  Unreasonable interference by the Minister and his Department is causing a good deal of intense feeling among public bodies. They feel that the Ministry has no confidence in them, and consequently they have no confidence in the Ministry.  I think that in local matters the Minister should be guided by the men who have local knowledge, and not by officials in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The amalgamation of Unions scheme is another matter which does not seem to have the approval of the people that the Minister would lead us to believe it has.  The policy of closing hospitals serving large populations in extensive rural areas is causing great dissatisfaction, not among the Labour Party only, but among the farmers.  I attended a meeting about a fortnight ago at which members of the Farmers' Union were present, and it surprised me to observe their hostility against this Ministry.  Patients are conveyed long distances to the County Hospitals and are in danger of dying before they arrive there.  Believing this to be cynical and barbarous treatment, I would suggest to the Minister that he should dovetail a clause dealing with this matter into the Old Age Pensions Bill and change the title to &ldquo;The Old Age Prevention Bill,&rdquo; because it seems to me that there is a genuine intention on the part of the Government to try to get rid of the old people so that they will not be a burden on the country. Yes, you may laugh at that, but it means old age prevention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that I would like to call the Minister's attention to is National Health Insurance.  Complaints are general that benefits are not paid promptly, that people who are sick do not receive anything until they are able to walk about again, and possibly a person may be dead before his relatives receive any payment.  If this Act is to be of any use to the people for whom it was intended, I think the Minister should instruct his inspectors to watch this matter and to make the societies pay promptly.  Deputy Corish has referred <Col N="1721" /> to the abolition of District Councils.  Resolutions have been passed by about 100 of these Councils protesting against their abolition, and I think the Minister would be well advised not to go too far in this matter. If you take away representation from what we call the plain people, I do not think that democracy will be very much benefited by it, so that I think that matter requires very careful consideration by the Minister.  He will hear more about it later on.  I have been speaking about the National Health Insurance.  I would ask the Minister to pay special attention through his inspectors to those societies which are deliberately, I might say, withholding benefits from the sick poor.</P>

I do not see why he should be altogether influenced by officials in Dublin.  Confidence begets confidence, and vice versa, and if we are to have Government of the people, by the people, and for the people, I think he should give some consideration to the opinions of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an attack upon the administration of the County Tirconaill and the Local Government Department last Thursday at the County Executive meeting of the Farmers' Union, held in Ballybofey, and it might be said that I was showing the white feather or the white flag if I did not repeat what I said then, in the presence of the Minister.  Personally, I have nothing to say to the Minister, because in my opinion he would endeavour to administer his Department fairly and reasonably, but of course I have not an intimate acquaintance with all that goes on inside Government departments.  I am of opinion that the officials in the Local Government Department take <Col N="1722" /> upon themselves certain action which they have no right to take, and place the responsibility upon the Minister. With regard to the fiscal administration of Tirconaill, I referred to a report of the Inspector of Lunatics regarding an inquiry that was held into the administration of Tirconaill Mental Hospital on the 9th of October last. That report, according to a letter I have from the Secretary of the Local Government Department, was sent down to the Mental Hospital Committee on the 15th November.  It was considered at a special meeting of the Mental Hospital Committee, held in Letterkenny on the 21st November, behind closed doors.  Not a single word was mentioned in the newspaper report of that meeting about that report which was sent down for the Committee's consideration. There was no publication of it until the 19th December.  I obtained a copy of it from the Local Government Minister's Department, and had it published in the local paper, <i>The Derry Journal.</i>  I do not desire to use harsh or unmannerly language with regard to members of the Committee, but will content myself with saying that they did not publish that report.</P>

      <P>With regard to this report which was sent on for consideration, we heard nothing about it until it was published in the newspapers, and in my opinion the Minister for Local Government should have insisted on the publication of that report.  Deputy Corish has referred to the amalgamation of Unions.  We were led to believe that in the County of Tirconaill 50 per cent. would have been saved in the cost of the maintenance of paupers, when brought into the County Home. In my opinion, instead of saving 50 per cent., the cost of maintenance in the Home has increased, and the county <Col N="1723" /> has been saddled with an additional £6,000 or £7,000 to pay the pensions of officials who were scrapped.  That was an ill-considered scheme, and one that was rushed regardless of the cost and comfort of the patients.  They received more kindness and better treatment when in the workhouses.  They are now herded in one central institution.  I know something about the discipline of the place, but my own opinion is that the comfort of the poor would have been better attended to if they had been left in the Unions.</P>
      <P>The entire administration of the county I represent requires very close supervision by the Local Government Department.  The County Council for the past two or three years has been neglecting the affairs and fiscal administration of the county in a very marked and improper way.  I do not think I am offering any insult when I say that they are a body who should be scrapped or asked to resign.  I ask the Minister for Local Government to institute an inquiry similar to the inquiries proceeding in Clare and Waterford.

I endorse everything said by Deputy Corish and the Deputy who seconded the motion, that the District Councils should not be abolished because their members are direct representatives of the people.  I ask the Minister for Local Government how in a vast county like Tirconaill, a County Council elected under the new Bill, could look after the immense amount of business to be transacted by them, and do it in an effective way.  It would be absolutely impossible for them to do so in Tirconaill, the second largest county in Ireland.</P>

Tirconaill will be quite sufficient for me, and more than I will be able to administer.  I would ask the Minister for Local Government to institute an inquiry into the entire administration of Tirconaill.  Another matter I would wish to draw attention to is that the Secretary of the County Council of Tirconaill has recently resigned, and the present County Council has undertaken to fill the appointment. In my opinion the appointment of a gentleman to that position should be deferred until the new County Council has been elected under the new Bill.  I do not think the gentlemen forming the County Council have any right to take the responsibility of filling an important position such as a Secretaryship. That appointment should be deferred until the people of the entire county get an opportunity of pronouncing on how they discharged the duties for which they were responsible for the last three or four years.</P>

      <P>The policy of the Minister for Local Government seems to be to uproot and destroy local government in the true sense.  Every week his Department is in conflict with some <Col N="1725" /> local authority.  Anybody who has any practical experience in the working of local authorities will certainly admit that since they were elected in 1920 they have gone through very strenuous times, and if they failed to administer wisely I think it was due to the circumstances of the time, and to the nature of the conflict.  I suggest it was not possible to do everything that public authorities might have been expected to do in normal circumstances, but the Ministry of Local Government seem to be inclined to treat every public body in the same way.  I would like to deal with one particular aspect of this situation&mdash;the amalgamation of workhouses&mdash;and I would like to say here and now that that is a policy that was never agreed to by the people, and a policy that the people never got any opportunity of pronouncing on as to whether they agreed with it or not.  It was got up, if I might say so, as a political stunt during the war between the British and this country.  It went out on the cry of economy, because it was felt, I suggest, that it was necessary to offer some sop to the ratepayers, so that they would continue to give their allegiance to the public bodies who had changed over from the English Local Government Board to the Dáil Local Government Department.  The cry of economy went out, but I submit there has been no real economy.  There may have been economy, but it has been at the expense of the poor.  The North Tipperary County Council, of which I think the Minister will admit he has some personal knowledge, is a Council that has come through the last two or three years very creditably.  We find that at the present time they are in a position to say, what I think very few other Co. Councils in the Saorstát can say, that they have all their rates collected.  They are a very conservative body.  They took up this question of amalgamation, and they formed a scheme which was submitted to the Minister.  He turned down their scheme. He would not agree to it.  A scheme was again submitted.  The Minister varied the scheme which was made by the County Council.  He said to them: &ldquo;This is a scheme which you will have to agree to; your scheme is <Col N="1726" /> wrong.&rdquo;  The people of the neighbourhood, the people who have an intimate knowledge of local conditions, are the people whose schemes and advice are turned down as being of no value.</P>
      <P>I witnessed a spectacle about a fortnight ago that I hope I will not see again.  That was the spectacle of old people being brought in open motor-lorries, in the middle of February, a distance of 30 miles; their beds and property were taken from the workhouse to the County Home.  I saw these old people, from 50 to 90 years of age, people who had been bedridden for over ten years, some of them, taken in those open motor-lorries a distance of 30 miles through the country on a raw February day.  That is what amalgamation has meant to the poor people.  There is no real economy at all in it.  The Minister's scheme is now in operation in Tipperary, and it is working out in the way that I have described. The Guardians are being scrapped, those people who had an intimate knowledge of the local conditions, people who were able to distinguish between real and fictitious want. They have been supplanted by a few persons who had not an intimate knowledge of the local conditions and who are not in a position to know the really needy people from the people who were mere spongers looking for outdoor relief.  The result is that there is a lot of hardship being caused to the people who are in real need of relief.  I suggest to the Minister that when the local supervision is removed and when the people who have local intimate knowledge are scrapped, and others, paid officials, put in their places, that that is not going to make for efficiency or economy.  I believe that it will lead to more corruption and more graft.  I submit that one corrupt official is far more dangerous than 10 or 20 corrupt Guardians.</P>

      <P>I think that the motion raised by Deputy Corish serves a very useful purpose in giving an opportunity to the Deputies of this Assembly to discuss this question of Local Government.  I think it is one of the most important debates that was raised in the Dáil since I came into it. I must preface my remarks by saying that if the motion is meant as a vote of <Col N="1727" /> censure on the new Minister for Local Government, that I am not a party to it.  I think that the Minister has made, during his short time in office, a very brave attempt against immense difficulties. He has had to face a very difficult situation and to cope with it so far as local administration is concerned. It is very sad to sit here in this Assembly, which is the National Assembly of our country, and to hear a debate like this.  Now this Local Government Act of 1898 was a thorough and complete Act.  It was not a half measure.  It conferred full and complete control on the people of this country to administer their local affairs, just the same as in England and Scotland.  It completely disestablished the old ascendancy class from its position of power, and made the people masters of all the finances in local affairs in Ireland.  That was a big change.  How did it work?  It worked well up to a certain time.  The Deputies will remember that one of the strongest arguments with the party that was in power in this country in the past, and it was used by them in the British House of Commons, was the efficient working of the Local Government Act in Ireland.  On many and many occasions attempts were made to criticise local administration, but in all cases they failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Local Government Department, over which an Irish Minister now presides, was at one time presided over by an English Minister.  And this Local Government Department, like every other Department, made its reports as to the working of the various public bodies.  The time is short, and I will not delay the Dáil by making a long speech, but I wish to quote a few words from the lips of a great Irishman. I am sure no matter how the Deputies here may differ as to his policy, they will all respect anything that fell from the lips of so talented and exalted an Irishman.  I refer to the late John Redmond, the Chairman of the Irish Party.  Speaking in Ennis on the 17th November, 1907, Mr. Redmond dealt with the successful working of the Local Government system in Ireland.  He said: &ldquo;I want today to address myself to one argument <Col N="1728" /> and to one argument alone, on this question of Home Rule.  I want today, if you will bear with me, to answer fully the lying accusation made recently against the Irish people by Arthur Balfour.&rdquo;  It was Arthur Balfour's brother, Gerald Balfour, that introduced this Local Government Act and had charge of it in 1898.  Every time there is a report as to the working of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, the cause of the dissatisfaction is due to the fact that there is something wrong.  After that Act was passed, what was the report issued?  The Tories were in office from the passing of the Act up to a few years before 1907.  The following report was issued in 1900:&mdash;&ldquo;The predictions that the administration of a complete system of local government would inevitably break down, have not been verified.  On the contrary, the County and District Councils, with a few exceptions, have properly discharged the duties devolving upon them.&rdquo;  That was published by the Local Government Department under the British regime.  In 1901 it was stated:&mdash;&ldquo;Their duties have been satisfactorily and creditably discharged by the Councils and their officials throughout Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;not in one part of Ireland, but throughout all Ireland.  It was also stated that the rates for the year were lower than those for the preceding year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know there is a great deal of dissatisfaction throughout the country regarding high rates.  How did those rates accumulate?  I differ with the Deputies on the Labour Benches on some of the points raised.  I have always had the greatest sympathy with Labour, but at present it must be recognised that the farmers, who are the largest contributors to the public purse, and who form the bulk of the population, are having a bad time.  The Minister for Agriculture, in his speech in a Dublin constituency last night, stated that some farmers and their sons had not as much as £1 a week for their wages.  I was for several years a member of the County Council of Westmeath, and some time ago I asked the Secretary what were the roads, that were maintained at £13,000 a year, now costing?  He told me that the cost was now £40,000.  A lot of money could be saved in local administration.  The direct labour system may be all right in regard to some roads, but in my opinion, it was unwise to do away with <Col N="1730" /> the contract system.  To my knowledge numbers of small farmers used to make by-roads by the contract system, and in this respect roads that used to cost £12 and £14 are now costing £60 and £70.  That is one instance in which a lot of money is lost in local administration.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of Deputies to assist in every way the Minister who is in charge of the Department.  He is making a good effort to discharge his duties.  He is a young Minister, and he ought to get every possible assistance So far as I and the Deputies who are associated with me are concerned, we will give him every help. Quite recently he sent a letter to one of the Deputies of the Dáil touching upon the rate of wages they should pay in County Westmeath out of the grants given to the County Council.  The Minister said he did not object to a rate of 32/- a week.  The rate they were actually paying was 45/-, the highest in the Saorstát.  When the County Council met down there, a body of men entered the Council Chamber, and they kicked tables, chairs and everything upside down.  Is that fair, or is that constitutional Government?</P>

I have had communications relative to extravagant matters of local administration in my county, and I am sure other Deputies have had similar complaints in regard to their counties.  Deputy Corish suggests there should be investigations in every Department.  I think that is only fair.  I think the salaries of some County Council Secretaries are too high.

A lot of rates are outstanding, and people are not inclined to pay because of the bad times.  Many feel like saying, &ldquo;Let things go to blazes; we cannot be much worse.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Cha saoilim go bhfuil a thuilleadh le rádh ins an diospoireacht seo.  Níl agamfhéin acht cupla focal a rádh.  Deputy Corish has said that £52,000 has been withheld from Wexford.  £68,000 has been withheld from Tirconaill.  I assume things balance themselves fairly well all round as between counties, and that when the Farmer Deputies and those who are so anxious for an Election come into authority, there will be a fairly decent nest egg to rely upon, in the shape of those savings that accumulated <Col N="1732" /> during the time they had no responsibility.</P>
      <P>I then come to the question of unemployment and the fixing of the rate of wages under the grant.  Deputy Corish suggests that if this were left to the Councils and to the local bodies it would be more satisfactory.  I have some very grave misgivings on that question.  I am a member of the County Council of Tirconaill and at the last meeting of that body, under which the wages are 26s. per week, it was actually carried by a majority of 22 to 3 that the hours, instead of being 48, should be 54.  If Deputy Corish is prepared to rely upon public bodies like that, I am very much surprised.  I, for my part, in my sympathy with labour, as with other bodies, am strongly of opinion that nothing beyond 48 hours should be sanctioned by any Ministry or should be accepted from any local body in the administration of this grant.  As to the question whether the Local Government Department has authority to ordain hours of labour, I feel that the whole safety of the labour cause, and indeed of the economic condition, lies in the central authority having that power.  I believe they should have that power and should exercise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the question of economy, we heard a great deal upon that phase from those who, having irresponsibility at the present time hope to have responsibility later on.  When they arrive at the stage&mdash;if they ever do&mdash;when they have responsibility, I only hope the economy they prognosticate and which they use for propaganda will be acted up to and that they will see that the nation is brought into the position that they say they can bring it into. We, in our way, are doing the best we can for economy.  We certainly are trying to put things on a proper basis. The Minister for Local Government is himself one of the men who are strongest in their determination to bring the nation through the present crisis and put it on a basis of economy in every feature so far as it is possible to do so.  I have heard from Deputy Corish a good deal about the difficulties at Wexford.  I appreciate these difficulties. They are not confined to Wexford. They are common to every county.  As regards the amalgamation question, it has been contended that it <Col N="1733" /> was hastily conceived and that owing to the exigencies of the conditions that obtained, the schemes overlooked the convenience of the aged poor.  I feel that if economy is going to be made effective at all, it is absolutely necessary that centralisation should take place.</P>
    <P>Under the old conditions, things were absolutely evtravagant in these places, and the number of officials who had to be paid, subsidised and kept in every way swamped all the rates that were contributed for that purpose and left the aged poor only a small consideration in the matter.  It was all a question of officials; the poor were overlooked altogether.  It is possible in this amalgamation scheme to secure that the poor shall have advantage of the rate and that the expenditure on officials will be minimised.  Under the old conditions the expenditure was extravagant so far as officialdom was concerned. For that purpose alone I am firmly convinced that the policy of the Local Government Department in trying to curtail official expenditure is a wise one and one that will bear fruit for the country.  in the initial stages, difficulties will arise, but they will pass away.  They can be reconciled not only with the requirements of the aged poor, but with the economic conditions that we hope to establish and stabilise in the country.  We cannot expect everything to be done at once.  &ldquo;Rome was not built in a day.&rdquo;  These things can be dealt with by wise administration.  Unquestionably at the present time there are difficulties, but they can be overcome. As regards the question of the County Councils and the abolition of the District Councils, I believe what is wanted in this country is more efficient local administration and less parochial jobbery.  It is my opinion that the tendency and trend of District Council operations have developed to such a stage that unfortunately jobbery applies to these bodies to a certain extent. They have no view beyond a certain parochialism, and they do the best they can to further their ideas with regard to individuals and all these things in the parochial areas.  I think that if efficient administration in local areas can be secured by some other means, that local interests in that division will be equally <Col N="1734" /> well served, and that these agencies can be brought into such a state that we will not have the same questions arising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
