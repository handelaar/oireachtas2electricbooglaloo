      <P>, replying&mdash;I am not yet in a position to fix a date for the introduction of this Bill.  It is, however, in preparation.  If there is a general desire among Deputies for the circulation of the letter sent to the Railway Companies by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the subject of staff appointments, I will arrange to have it done.  But it appears to me to be quite unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The claim of the Tipperary North Riding County Council in respect <Col N="84" /> of Grants formerly withheld by the British Government was settled in September, 1922, subject to minor adjustments, by a payment of £32,876.  This amount did not include Estate Duty Grant for 1921-22, and half of the Agricultural Grant for the same year, as these monies were retained in the Guarantee Fund in connection with charges under the Land Acts.  Of the total amount of Estate Duty Grant for 1922-23, a sum of £75,417 approximately had to be retained in the Guarantee Fund for the same purposes, and, similarly, the first half of the current year's Agricultural Grant, amounting to approximately £299,505.  The share of the Tipperary North Riding County Council of the balance of the Estate Duty Grant for 1922-23 available for immediate distribution is 835, and this amount will be paid in the course of the coming week.  It is hoped also to be able to release the Agricultural Grant for the second half of the current year before the end of the current financial year.</P>

    <P>A considerable amount of the arrears indicated above (£31,831 9s. 5d.) was paid after the close of the election.  It is understood that the County Council instructed the collectors to concentrate on the collection of the arrears, and a large amount as then forthcoming. Writs were obtained in a number of cases and handed to the Sheriff.  The amount outstanding has, in consequence, been reduced to £18,479 1s. 1d. I am informed that the County Solicitor has been, and is at present, actively engaged in prosecuting in certain cases in each collection district, and that all possible steps are being taken to collect the arrears.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask is the Minister aware that the Dublin County Council are threatening proceedings against people who are only in arrears for one year's rates, while they fail to collect £18,000 of previous years arrears, and will he instruct them to proceed first against people who owe arrears for more than two years instead of against those who owe only one year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be very inadvisable, from the point of view of policy, to give such a guarantee, because it would encourage people not to pay the current year's rates until the others were paid up.  I could not give that undertaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. J. Burke) MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. J. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Mr. J. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the Second Reading of the Local Government (Collection of Rates) Bill. When I was introducing this Bill I referred to the fact that many local authorities were in a very serious financial condition.  Many County Councils are working on heavy overdrafts.  For example, in Cork the amount is £150,000; Leitrim, £76,000, and Tirconaill, £60,000.  The total amount of overdrafts obtained by local authorities is something like one million pounds. This financial situation is largely the result of the very large amount of arrears of rates still outstanding, amounting <Col N="94" /> to something like three million pounds.  If vital local services are to be continued, it is absolutely essential that these arrears should be recovered without delay, and it is for this purpose that we are bringing forward this Bill. The Bill proposes to expedite the collection of rates, by strengthening the law and extending the powers of executive officers, and by providing additional or alternative machinery, namely, by making use of the Post Office where necessary for the collection of the rates.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides, in those cases where the Post Office has been substituted for rate collectors, for the performance of the other functions of the rate collectors by the Civic Guard, and it also makes other provisions of a more or less machinery character.  As a result of the general demoralisation in the country, owing to the last few years of turmoil, there has grown up a general indifference on the part of ratepayers to meet their obligations, and it has accordingly been found necessary to introduce very drastic measures in order to bring defaulting ratepayers to a sense of their responsibilities.  At the present time rate collectors have two remedies for the collection of the rates. First of all, they can distrain and sell goods under their warrants and, secondly, they can proceed in a Civil Bill court.  The first remedy is encumbered by restrictive statutory provisions, and has been practically in abeyance for the last few years, owing to the danger of distraining without military protection. and to the reluctance of rate collectors to look for such protection, and also owing to the large number of young and inexperienced rate collectors who were appointed during the last few years.  When summary proceedings are taken, and a warrant of distress is issued by the District Justice, it is practically impossible to have it executed as the Civic Guard are unable to act, and District Justices and rate collectors find it impossible to get any other person to act as special bailiff, owing to the low statutory fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second power of the rate collectors, namely, to proceed in a Civil Bill court, that remedy is too tedious and too costly to be effective. <Col N="95" /> The power of the rate collector not being adequate to deal with the situation, we have been accordingly thrown back on the sheriff.  As the law stands the District Justice cannot direct warrants to sheriffs for execution without their consent and, even if he could, their powers are not sufficiently wide to deal in the drastic manner required with defaulters.  This Bill, accordingly, proposes to give power to the Minister for Local Government to issue warrants to under-sheriffs to levy, by seizure, and to sell goods for a period of twelve months in respect of arrears of rates due up to the 31st of March, 1924.  The Bill includes the provision of Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1923, and extends that section to include the seizure of all goods found on the rateable property. The rate collectors had this latter power under their warrants.  This clause can only be enforced in these districts where a Minister has publicly declared the provision to be in operation. The Bill also secures to a rate collector the same speedy remedy for recovering arrears of rates after the full amount of his warrant is lodged as he had before.  As the law stands at present, the rate collector may be obliged to go to very considerable trouble and to incur considerable expense in recovering these sums, as he is obliged to proceed in a county or a higher court.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to give power to a tribunal independent of the local authority, namely, the District Justice, to amend the rate book at the request of the local authority, but it restricts his jurisdiction to inserting the name of the individual who should have been rated.  There is also a provision in the Bill for serving certain notices by post which, in the ordinary course of events would require to be served by hand. This is necessary owing to the fact that the speed with which this Act can be enforced is the essence of the whole Bill, and also because of the fact that in those districts where the Post Office is being employed instead of the rate collector, there is no other medium for serving these summonses.  The provision with regard to collecting the rates through the Post Office is, frankly, experimental, and has been decided on at <Col N="96" /> the request of several local authorities. At the moment it is only intended to apply these provisions in those counties where the ordinary system of rate collecting has broken down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister for Local Government, in his introductory speech, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, one would have thought that his Department was functioning with such efficiency and on such a model system that it leaves nothing to be desired, and that it was only the dose of original sin which is responsible for the decay of the civic spirit among the ratepayers that called for the necessity for this Bill.  To those of us who are conversant with the state of affairs in the country and with the situation in our constituencies, the Ministers statement is the most complete and the most convincing and the most abject exposure of the impotence, the futility, and, in very truth I can say, the incompetence of the past and the present local Government administration that ever before was uttered in a representative assembly. The Minister has advanced no rational argument, no serious plea, why the Dáil should proceed further with the consideration of this Bill.  One would at least have expected that the Minister would have demonstrated that the existing statutory powers and law applicable to rate collection were insufficient. He has not done so.  A little closer acquaintance, a little study of the nature of the authority vested in every local Council, in every rate collector, would have convinced him that there was no necessity for the extraordinary powers he seeks&mdash;that they are uncalled for, and that they are superfluous.  It is an axiomatic constitutional principle that unnecessary penal legislation should not be enacted, that its need should prove to be imperative and that its powers and mode of operation should be clearly and accurately defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill before the Dáil these maxims are ignored; perhaps I might say, with greater truth, they have never been called to mind by the originators of this measure, and I may say they are unknown to them.  What, I ask, is the need for this Bill?  Surely <Col N="97" /> we are entitled to know.  A Bill which serves no useful purpose, as far as extension of power goes, should not be passed unless it is a measure of coercion for coercion sake, and I ask the Dáil not to pass this Bill until it is clearly proved that the existing powers have been tried and have broken down in the country.  The Minister has remained silent as to the causes of the ratepayers' refusal to honour their statutory obligations.  I propose to enlighten him.  The refusal can arise only from three things.  First, unwillingness to pay; second, inability to pay, and, third, a deep sense of grievance. With regard to the first class of persons, they excite no sympathy, and were they the only persons to be affected by the Bill we might applaud the measure and we would rejoice to see it in operation, because we desire to see every person bearing his just share in the common burden and because we want to see service equal for all.  But this class represents but a very small fraction of the community.</P>
    <P>When we come to deal with the other two classes&mdash;men not in the position to pay, or men pushed almost to the wall with oppressive exactions &mdash;we come upon the situation which calls for the strongest objection and condemnation of the Bill.  Here, again, lack of recognition of elementary constitutional principles can be seen. You must redress ere you coerce.  In any line of this Bill there is nothing to foreshadow that the grievous burdens of the ratepayers would be redressed, that their causes of complaint would be removed, that the Augean stable of corruption would be cleansed. Neither has there been anything in the recent policy of the Ministry to countenance the seeds of hope that purity, that efficiency, that economy in civic administration, will be restored. Yet the Minister has not hesitated to come seeking for extraordinary powers to collect rates, and for what end?</P>

      <P>I have asked to what purpose is this Bill introduced? Is it to maintain universally in this country profligacy, extravagance, waste and worse to bolster up and to give, as it were, artificial respiration to the horrible system I have named?  If the Minister was in earnest about restoring decent conditions, he would at least, concurrently with the introduction of the Bill, bring in a large and generous measure of amelioration, a considered system of reform, aimed at an efficient public service, functioning at a cost compatible with the capacity to pay of the ratepayers, which would impose no grievous burdens and to whose up-keep the people would make a ready response and render the Bill before the Dáil unnecessary.  In the absence of the ameliorative measure I have indicated, which should precede, preferably for a considerable period, the introduction of this Bill, so that its saving graces&mdash;and I speak in the literal sense&mdash;could be the more readily discerned, I say this Bill is nothing short of being immoral.  There is nothing to indicate, no reason to hope that the money wrung by the Under-Sheriffs will not be wantonly and wickedly wasted, with the undisguised sanction and blessing of the Local Government Ministry, in fancy dress schemes all over the place.  I have spoken of fancy dress schemes, and I speak with due deliberation.  Some years back there as foisted on the shoulders of the ratepayers a new fad known as amalgamation of Union Schemes.  This fad served a treble service. (1) Pseudo-philanthropy as a reform by burning incense, as it were, at the shrine in worshipping the fetish of pauperism.  (2) It was a concession to the spirit of revolution by an innovation in the name of an equality which sought to obliterate the name &ldquo;pauper,&rdquo; and by an inverse process of operation, secured its end by reducing the ratepayers to the level of the paupers.  (3) To the wastrels of the Transport Union, who manned the local councils, it offered a golden opportunity <Col N="99" /> of advancing the Union's principle of something for nothing, by the grant of inflated and excessive pensions and gratuities to disbanded officials.</P>

      <P>Let us consider what some of the effects of the operation of this Bill will be in connection with the arrears of rates.  What would be the effect of it in my own constituency in regard to the rates for 1920-21? At that time you had rate collectors appointed without statutory authority or sanction, and who had given no fidelity bonds.  The people being then unsophisticated patriots, under the spell, I suppose of the political altruists, paid with a grace never known before, and I doubt if it has been equalled since. What has happened to a very large portion of this money?  It has been stated that some of it, at least, has been misapplied&mdash;I will not use any stronger term&mdash;and there is at least £14,000 outstanding. Last summer, under pressure, the Local Government Department thought to have this money collected, but it was found that ratepayers could produce documentary evidence of payment although they had been returned to the Cóunty Council as defaulters. Can any inspector now come <Col N="100" /> along and report these men as defaulters to the Ministry Can the Minister send down sheriffs and bailiffs to men who have already paid?  This is one of the dangers, and one of the reasons why I am strongly opposed to the Bill. It may be said that it is quite easy to find those parties who collected the rates.  I doubt it.  Some of them are their re-appearance on their tombstones. Others of them are in another hemisphere.  Some of them are still on the hill-tops.  A few of them have even joined the National Army, and are endeavouring to force respect down other peoples throats for the rights of property and of their neighbours.  How are you going to deal with such a situation? When you have caught these men, let us see how they will evade you and throw you off.  There is one particular case which is so good that I honestly cannot refrain from telling the Dáil how the misapplication of the rates was accounted for.  This rate collector said he hid the rate books and the rates in the hay.  His cows broke in, and they eat not alone the hay, but the rate books.</P>

The ratepayers who paid this money to unauthorised collectors can be made the victims of this Bill.  Has the Minister any alternative to offer, or any suggestion to make, by which these men who can produce documentary evidence of the payment of rates in these years will not be called upon to pay a second time, and that the bailiffs and sheriffs will not descend once more upon them? That constitutes my principal objection <Col N="101" /> to this Bill, together with the system of extravagance which it is sought to bolster up.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot adorn my arguments with the wealth of metaphor with which the previous speaker has delighted the Dáil; but there is just one point in the Bill that I would like to call attention to I am in entire sympathy with the object of the Bill; but I am afraid the Bill will not be effective in particular parts of the country, and that is in the urban areas.  The main purport of the Bill, as far as I can see is the power given to the sheriff to levy any goods found on the premises on which the rate was struck, so that a man could not escape the consequences of not paying his rates by claiming that the goods belonged to his wife, or that they were in the name of his child, and so on.  That is an excellent provision in the country, where a man stays in his farm and the goods at stake remain on it.  But in the towns a man who wishes to escape paying his rates will simply move to some other premises, and the Bill gives no power to seize his goods if he has removed them to another house.  They must he seized in respect of the house named in the warrant and on which the rates are leviable.  Once a man moves you will not be able to get at him.  I hope before the Committee Stage that the Minister will take that into account and see if it is possible to meet it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the remarks of Deputy Cooper, I do not know if it is possible for the Minister to amend the Bill in the direction the Deputy spoke of.  I suggest that if the Minister refers to an old Act which had application to Dublin alone, he will find, I think, that it imposed upon the owners of such property, as Deputy Cooper speaks of the liability of paying the rates.  While we are asked to support a Bill for facilitating the collection of rates, we hear of action being taken by local authorities to throw upon the rate collectors the task of collecting urban rates from hundreds of small occupiers, instead of as hitherto calling upon the landlord to <Col N="102" /> pay.  That is not facilitating the collection of rates by any means, rather the contrary.  I would urge upon the Minister that he should consider either in this Bill, or in a future Bill, the possibility or the desirability of making it an obligation that for small rated property, in urban areas at any rate, the responsibility for paying the rates should be upon the landlord or owner of the property, and not upon the tenants.  In that way the rates are much more likely to be collected easily and cheaply and the local authority is much more likely to get the rate that has been levied.  I hope the Minister will frown on the efforts of local authorities that he may be aware of, who are trying to impose upon rate collectors the responsibility of collecting rates from scores, and perhaps hundreds, of householders and occupiers in place of, as hitherto, collecting them from the owner of the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'MAHONY Mr. O'MAHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the suggestion of Deputy Johnson that the responsibility of collecting from small rated holdings in urban areas ought to be transferred to the landlord.  As a matter of fact, I asked a question in the Dáil on that point sometime ago, and the reply I got from the Minister for Local Government was that the matter was under consideration. Undoubtedly that would be a more effective method of collecting the rates.  The occupiers of these small holdings find that half-yearly demands for rates are more than their resources are capable of meeting.  If the rate was merged in the rent, and if there was a weekly or monthly collection, as is usual in cases of the kind, it would not be felt by the occupier of the premises.  It would be a matter of convenience to the occupier, and would result in greater revenue for the local bodies.  It has these two points to recommend it, and, after all, it is only adopting the system that was in force until the Act of 1898 came into being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the general purpose of the Bill, after all, in a sense, you have nearly all the authority claimed in this Bill under the existing law if it were <Col N="103" /> fully exercised.  Where is the hardship in asking ratepayers, many of whom are in a better position to pay rates than some of those who have paid, to discharge their duty to the community?  The man who declines to pay his rates simply transfers the responsibility to his neighbour, because if the budget is not balanced this year the adverse balance will have to be brought forward.  The result is that men and women who pay will have to pay not only their own share, but also the share of those who shirked their responsibility,. One of the encouragements to the Irregular element in the community at the last election was that if they were able to carry through, rates and rents might be repudiated. A great deal of the arrears accumulated as a result of a too ready adoption of such a policy.  Only a few days ago a statement appeared from a certain County Council in Ireland pointing out that owing to the fact that annuities had not been paid in the county, a sum of £60,000 had been stopped out of local grants.  That £60,000 will have to be paid by the ratepayers to accommodate that section of the community that repudiated these annuities.  In the same way, if ratepayers were permitted to repudiate their liability to local bodies, then the deficit will have been transferred to those who are already bearing the burden of not only their own rates, but the arrears that accumulated from other years.</P>
    <P>Let us see to what extent is this a penal proposal.  As the law stands, the rate collector is bound to lodge the amount of his warrant before he can close his books.  Does Deputy Hogan propose that the rate collector who is compelled by law, as it exists, to lodge the full amount of his warrant, should do so to benefit the unaccommodating ratepayers in the community and that he should have no means to recover it? He has the means under the existing law, but it has proved in a sense ineffective. An enormous accumulation of arrears exists at present, and it is only when people realise that the law for the common good is going to be put into active operation, that you will find these people discharging their liabilities to local bodies.  I do not anticipate <Col N="104" /> that you will have as much trouble as is predicted by Deputy Hogan. When the people find that they are going to be made pay the visits of the Sheriff will be like angels' visits&mdash;very few, and far between.</P>

      <P>Their visits will be angelic in their infrequency.  To my mind, the Bill is simply strengthening a provision that the law already gives. It is only making a common demand on every member of the community. I am certain that when effect is given to the Bill, people who hitherto have repudiated legal and honest obligations, that their neighbours have discharged, will be found, with very few-exceptions, prepared to discharge them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two matters that I want to touch on briefly in regard to this Bill.  One of these could hardly have been mentioned in the Bill itself, but I expected to have heard something about it in the Minister's speech commending the Bill.  The other is an omission from the body of the Bill that I think is somewhat noteworthy.  It is, of course. within the Minister's knowledge that a great deal of the withholding of rates &mdash;I am not standing in any defence of that&mdash;is caused by dissatisfaction with existing County Councils.  It is right that these rates should be collected. I am in entire favour as we all must be, of having every method taken in order that the rates shall be brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to understand some of the causes that prompt the withholding of rates.  I had occasion, as the Minister will recollect, to introduce a deputation to his Department, and the statement was made there by members of that deputation that if they could see some prospect of more satisfactory County Councils in the near future, the causes of their recalcitrancy would very largely be removed.  Therefore I expected, when the Minister brought forward this measure, and stated that it was necessary that these rates should <Col N="105" /> be collected and most stringent methods taken to enforce collection, he would at least have accompanied that statement by some promise that at a near date these bodies, which have ceased to be a reflection of the public mind, if they ever were, should be removed and others introduced that would be more nearly representative of the people for whom they claim and exercise administration. When we hear ratepayers from different counties stating that the county councils are partial in their administration, expensive in their administration, and other complaints of the same kind, then it is surely time that we should recognise the fact that if we were to have a new set of county councils, in whom the people of this country had a more perfect confidence, several of the causes of the withholding of the rates would be removed.  I urge that upon the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The second matter to which I wish to refer, is that I had expected to hear from the Minister some reason why the public Bodies Order, that prevailed up to about the year 1918 and since then has been allowed to remain a dead letter, and what is likely to be done to see that it is enforced in the future, and also why there is not a provision that some such Order should be reinstituted. Under that Order, it will be recollected, the rate collectors had to close their accounts twice a year, at the end of September and March, I think; and, if they did not close their accounts at these periods, then no claim for poundage would be recognised.  If such a provision were introduced in the Bill a very important stimulus would be provided to rate collectors.  I was moved and touched by the allusion to Deputy Connor Hogan's rate collector, who gave a very luxuriant excuse as to why his rates were not collected.  No such excuse would be provided if a provision were put in force in this Bill that rate collectors were to be compelled to do what they once were compelled to do namely, to close their accounts at certain periods, and, if their accounts were not then closed, no poundage would be allowed.  I believe that these two matters are worthy of the attention of Ministers.  The first is that new <Col N="106" /> county councils should be created at the earliest moment which would reflect the public mind and carry public confidence.  The second matter is that a stimulus should be provided to the rate collectors themselves requiring them to close their accounts at certain periods, or they would have no claim for poundage.  If that were done I believe that a large portion of the problem, with which the Bill proposes to deal, would be greatly simplified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can see this Bill should have been introduced at least twelve months ago.  There are a very large number of people who have taken advantage of the times since the year 1920.  Some refuse to pay their rates on political grounds, more say that there is not sufficient law to comPel them to pay, while others again say: &ldquo;Why should we pay when the Government may be kicked out tomorrow, and when the new Government comes in there will be the same demand?&rdquo;  If the rates had been paid in a regular manner it would have gone a good way in relieving the thousands of people 'who are now walking the streets or going to the Labour Exchanges. For the first fifteen minutes of Deputy Hogan's speech I found it hard to know whether he was in support of the Bill or whether he was opposed to it.  I maintain that there are three classes of people who are not paying&mdash;those who refuse to pay, those who call afford to pay, and those who require extreme measures to be taken to compel them to pay.  There are big landlords in the different towns who own a large number of small holdings and who used to pay the rates on them. I can mention a towns, in fact two or three towns, in my own constituency where small holders have been taken to court and decrees given against them for rates which they never paid before.  I wonder was Deputy O'Mahony serious in suggesting that the few bits of furniture which they have scraped together should be seized?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'MAHONY Mr. O'MAHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>I never made such a statements.  On the contrary, the tenor of my remarks was in the other direction&mdash;to relieve these people.  In poor cases where the amount of asset <Col N="107" /> is very small, even if a decree is given the rates are not collected.  I never made the suggestion attributed to me by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rule when a Deputy sits on the Government benches. one takes it for granted that he will support all the extreme measures which the Government introduces.  The small holders in urban areas are not, in my opinion, able to Pay rates.  One of the reasons is that the people have been unemployed for six or eight months. I certainly agree that these rates should be paid by the landlords. There has already been carried in the Dáil an Increase of Rents Act.  The landlords have increased the rents and thev make the occupying tenants pay the rates.  That is not fair to small holders.  I certainly will encourage the collection of rates from those people who refuse to pay, and I may say that every member of the Farmers' Union here and every Independent member will agree that this Bill should not in any way hamper, punish, or persecute, the genuine citizens of the Saorstát who have paid rates.  I maintain that this Bill is introduced for the purpose of collecting the rates from those people who refused to pay since 1920 In County Westmeath at present the County Council has an overdraft of £40,000, and the County Council of Longford is practically in the same position.  Those county Councils would not have those overdrafts if the rates had been collected.  I know that there are a large number of people who cannot afford to pay, but those who can afford are the people who will not pay I support the Bill, and the sooner it comes into operation the better will I like it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, to my mind, did not use any extravagant language.  I am sorry I cannot agree with?  it the attitude of the Deputy on my own benches on all points.  When you try and find out what is behind the Deputy's mind who made the speech, you will realise the position of the ratepayer in the country.  The Minister said that the rates had not been collected owing to the disorder.  He gave us to understand <Col N="108" /> in his speech that that is the only cause of the rates being uncollected in the country districts.  He knows that is not the only cause.  The disorder in the country is not the cause, and the Minister would have gone a better way had he stated all the causes that were in his mind.  One reason why rates have not been paid was that the ratepayer in the country had against him the economic position.  The trade arteries of the country were shut up, and because of this the ratepayer was unable to pay.  The Government of this country did nothing to keep them open. The State is not discharging its liability to the ratepayer, and I make a present of that to the Minister and the Government.  At the moment, we have numerous and extraordinary charges on the rate-paying public.  The rates now represent much more than the rents in many districts, and very much more than the annuities.  There are huge rates levied in certain counties in the Free State because of the maladministraltion in the counties.  Deputation after deputation has come to the Minister on this head, and pointed out where maladministration took place in those counties, and where it is taking place still.  That is one of the reasons why rates have not been paid, and why they cannot be collected.  The maladministration has been responsible for it in local bodies&mdash;district councils and county councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter what they are.  If the Deputy on my left would cease to interrupt, I think we would get on a little better.  Arrears of rates are returned ill other counties as irrecoverable.  Why?  There is more than a suspicion in counties of which I am aware, that those rates returned as irrecoverable could be recovered, and were irrecoverable because rate collectors and the county councils did not make a serious attempt to recover them from some of those people.  We saw in Clare where an influential body of the ratepayers offered the Minister to pay their rates on demand Provided that a serious attempt was made to collected all outstanding arrears.  That attempt was not made, and those arrears were put <Col N="109" /> down as irrecoverable, and it was only because of maladministration, and because some of the people owing rates were friends of the rate collectors and administrators that they were not paid. No serious attempt was made by the county councils to collect them.  That is one of the serious causes of this discontent in the counties, and the Minister knows it.  The game has not been played as it should have been played.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mahony has referred, I think, to the fact that the ratepayers want to shift their liability to fellow-ratepayers, His description is pretty accurate. There are such men in the community, and this Bill has now to deal with that class.  Every county has its defaulters in annuities and that default is borne by the ratepayer until such time as the annuities are paid up by the defaulting annuitant.  Grants will be curtailed by the amount the annuities are in arrears. When the Government go seriously about it and make every man pay his rates and annuities, then we will have confidence and clean administration, and the rate-paying public will have confidence in the local County Councils and the Government.  Until the Minister puts his house in order, and until all the ratepayers pay their share, there is no use in talking of the big and little man.  If you begin on the poor man, you start a bad principle.  You can make a case for A.B.C., but where are you going to draw the line?  Why not make a case for D.E., and all rest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say it is a principal in administration to make the distinction that and-So cannot pay.  It breeds a want-of confidence, and when you breed a want of confidences in the rate-paying public then you have sown the seeds, and you need not be surprised at the crop you will reap.  I suggest to the Minister to put his louse in order, and to see that these arrears are collected from everybody without discrimination, and if the local bodies will not do it, I suggest to the Minister that it should be done from headquarters.  If that is done, there won Id be no necessity for this Bill.  The rate-paying public who can do so will pay, provided they have confidence in the purity of the administration.  To my mind, the <Col N="110" /> Bill is all right, and the measures contained in it are all right, provided that the administration is right.  The sooner we see that there is a square deal all round and everybody paying their liability, the better it will be for the State.</P>
    <P>I also suggest to the Minister one thing, and it has perhaps something to recommend it.  The local elections have been postponed time after time; the Present County Councils are still functioning; there will be a new rate struck immediately.  I suggest that no new rate be struck until new County Councils are elected that the people will have confidence in.  A rate struck by some of the County Councils at present will lead to trouble and chaos.  I am anticipating the view of another Deputy on this matter, because he wanted to raise it, and will do so in another form; but I suggest to the Minister that he should be very careful about the present County Councils striking rates.  Deputy Hogan has used a good deal of flowery language.  I have not much flowery language to use, but I am trying to get down to hard facts. I say to the Minister that if he wants to have confidence in his measure he should see that the County Councils should do their duty fairly and squarely, and that no one section has to Pay for the rest, as they have been doing in several counties.</P>

      <P>I desire to say that so far as I Personally am concerned I am in agreement with the main Provisions of this Bill, and to that extent I agree with Deputy Gorey, and disagree with Deputy Hogan.  Deputy Darrell Figgis has stated, and Deputy Gorey has rather supported him in that view, that the reason why the people in certain counties have not paid their rates is because of the alleged non-representative character of the County Councils concerned.  As far as I know, those who compose the county councils were selected, or nominated the national organisations in existence at the time when these men were appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of Personal explanation.  If the Deputy is referring to my speech, I want to say that several county councils that I know of are all right.  There are only a few, <Col N="111" /> five or six, perhaps, in the saorstát, that my remarks apply to.  They do not apply to the general body of the county councils a all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted to laboure was this, that if the farmers, or the people whom Deputy Gorey is so much interested in and claims to speak on behalf of, have not got representation on the county councils at present it is due to the fact that they did not share in the national organisation, or the sacrifices that were being made by those organisation when these councils were selected.  I have yet to be told, even in the case to which Deputy Gorey referred, where these county councils do not actually represent the ratepayers.  It is a fact, at any rate in the cases that I have in mind, that the people who have not and who will not pay the rates up to the present are, strange to say, many of those whom Deputy Gorey claims to speak on behalf of.  In the constituency that I represent, strange as it may seem, the farmers dominate the county councils&mdash; both in Leix and Offaly&mdash;and any bad administration that may exist in that area&mdash;and it certainly does exist&mdash;is and must be due to the people Deputy Gorey speaks on behalf of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with statements made by Deputy Gorey in giving qualified support to this Bill.  I, and my other colleagues representing that constituency, have received urgent notices this week that Home Help cannot be paid from last month in one area in the constituency on account of the non-payment of rates and annuities in that area.  There is no use in ignoring the true facts in regard to the position arising out of that situation. <Col N="112" /> About two years ago a section of the People in the district, claiming to speak on behalf of the farmers of that area, advised, straightforwardly advised, their followers not to pay rates.  What they had in mind was this.  They did not want to be responsible for the upkeep of the main roads of the area, and they were not in agreement with what they considered to be the existing high rate of wages for the road workers, and giving the advice to their followers not to pay rates was influenced -by the consideration that their action would help to reduce the rates of wages of the road workers, and throw on to the Government the direct responsibility for the upkeep of the main roads.  That is partly responsible for the position that exists in my constituency.</P>
      <P>It is quite true, however, to state that the people who are mainly responsible for giving that advice, in the recent election supported the party that was out against the authority of the existing Government.  As far as I can learn, and as far as my information from the officials in the County Council in the area goes, the people who have actually paid the rates are the people who are least able to pay, and the people who have not paid, from documents I have seen, in one county in the constituency at any rate, are the big people who have money lying in the ban6 or invested in British War Loan.  I will give every possible support to the Minister in enforcing the terms of this Bill, and in compelling that particular class to pay all the rates that have been properly struck by the Councils properly elected, or whom they had a share in electing.  With these few words, I wish to say that I heartily support the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to attempt to follow Deputy Hogan through the rhetorical and metaphysical maze which he endeavoured to get the Dáil to follow him through.  I think it is a sufficient answer to him to mention the fact that Clare is the worst county in Ireland from the point of view of arrears of rates.  That should be a sufficient answer, and it is also, perhaps, an explanation of his attitude.  Deputy Cooper has raised the point of the inapplicability of the Bill to certain urban <Col N="113" /> areas.  He has referred to the danger of People leaving their houses when the rates have become due, and in that way escaping their obligations.  I will take that matter into consideration, but I really do not think there is much danger to be feared in that respect, because while it is quite an easy thing to leave a house at present it is a very difficult thing to get into another.  I think if people leave their houses to escape their obligations they will have to go into tents.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has raised the point of the advisability of making the landlord in all cases liable for rates.  That would undoubtedly simplify the matter from the point of view of the rate collector, and it would considerably facilitate us, but it involves a principle which I think we should rather discountenance, because our policy at present is to try and encourage a civic spirit, as much as possible, and develop it in all classes of society, and there is nothing that develops that spirit so much as the obligation to pay rates. When a man has to pay rates himself be naturally looks to see that the money he pays is expended in the most businesslike manner possible.  For that reason, I think it would be inadvisable to entertain that suggestion.  Deputy Figgis has raised two points, but I think the Deputy will agree with me that it would be very inadvisable for the Government to bargain with anybody on what basis they were to fulfil their legal obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is as broad as it is long, I suppose.  Deputy Gorey has supported Deputy Figgis in taking up the attitude that he would like some statement as to when local elections would be held, and that it would stimulate people to pay rates if we could undertake that the elections would be coming on pretty soon.  As Deputies <Col N="114" /> are aware, a new register is being compiled, and I think it would give considerable dissatisfaction if we had an election on the old register, and it would probably lead to an outcry for another election when the next register would be compiled, so that I do not think it would be advisable to promise an election until the new register is ready, which will probably be next June.  Deputy Gorey has also supported, to some extent, Deputy Hogan's attitude in condemning the Government.  He has also complained that I did not state all the reasons why the position of rate collection is not all that it should be at present, but I think I gave as a reason the general turmoil in the country.  I think that included all the reasons that Deputy Gorey afterwards stated, including, to some extent.  maladministration in various counties.  So far as my Department is concerned, we have done everything in our power to prevent that maladministration, and I do not think Deputy Hogan has anything to complain of.  He complained to me some time ago about the condition of affairs in Co. Clare, and I agreed immediately to hold a sworn inquiry.  I sent down a man to conduct that inquiry, and he is holding it at the present moment.  I do not think Deputy Hogan could ask for more.  I do not think there has been much opposition shown to this Bill, and I hope it will pass through the next stages with the same expedition.</P>

    <Title>DAIL IN COMMITTEE. - FISHERIES BILL, 1923.</Title>
    <P>Amendment from the Seanad: To insert immediately after Section 8 a new Section, as follows.&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No penalty inflicted under this Act shall be reduced or remitted save on the recommendation of the Judge or Justice who imposes such penalty, and any recommendation for such reduction or remission shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I move that the Dáil does not agree with the Seanad in its amendment to the Fisheries Bill.  This is the first time in the history of the Oireachtas that a situation of this kind has occurred, and I think the proper procedure might be that if I get the agreement of the Dáil in rejecting this amendment a Committee might be formed from the different parties in the Dáil to draw up a reason and send it to the Seanad. The reason for opposing this amendment is not so much strictly a Fishery Departmental reason.  It is on general grounds.  If this amendment were accepted it would do away with all possibility of redress in a case where there was an obvious miscarriage of justice, and miscarriages of justice, of course, are not unknown.  The second portion of the amendment also deprives even the judge who tries the case from reviewing his decision.  It says &ldquo;Recommendation for remission shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed.&rdquo;  Supposing new facts come to light, he cannot then come forward in the light of these new facts and make a recommendation for the reduction of the fine imposed, or for the remission.  That is <Col N="116" /> the chief reason for opposition to the amendment.  The other, a pretty important reason, is that the amendment would operate to limit the existing constitutional powers for varying or remitting the penalties imposed for offences under the Act.  Actually, from the fishery point of view, the amendment, in the light of what has been agreed to, is particularly useless.  If you just note the figures in this case you will appreciate this.  Penalties were imposed for fishery offences in the year 1923 in 87 cases.  These were all the penalties imposed that year.  The District Justices who imposed these penalties recommended that they should be reduced in 73 out of the 87 cases.  In 14 cases no reduction was recommended. In accordance with the usual procedure, these recommendations were sent to my Department, and we agreed with the District Justices in their recommendations in 42 cases.  The District Justices recommended that there should be reductions in 73 cases, and the Fishery Department agreed to reductions in 42 cases and opposed reductions or remissions, recommended by the District Justices, in 31 cases.  Reductions were actually made by the Government in 64 cases.  From the fishery point of view, therefore, in spite of any suggestions to the contrary there is no reason for the amendment. It is not going to improve the Bill.  I am not going to say it would injure it.  The real reason for the objection to the amendment on the general principle is that it prevents the redressing of injury which has occurred or taken place through a miscarriage of justice.  Therefore, if my suggestion is adopted, I should like to see appointed a small Committee of the Dáil; representing the different parties, with the Attorney-General and myself, and that Committee would draft a statement setting forth our objections to this amendment, and our reasons for not accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I, for one, would strongly disapprove of any suggestion such as that made by the Minister, and for the reason that the amendment made by the Seanad is a very right and proper amendment.  The point was raised in the Dáil when the <Col N="117" /> Bill was originally before it, and the Minister is quite correct in saying that it does raise a question of the very first importance to the State.</P>
      <P>That question is that the Judiciary and the Executive should be kept apart from one another, and that the Executive should have no right whatever, except in exceptional methods and in the very highest of cases, but not in the ordinary course of administration, to review, change, alter, or in any way amend the decisions come to by the Judiciary.  That is the principle.  The Minister has said that if the Seanad's amendment were to be carried there would be no redress in obvious cases of a miscarriage of justice.  If I understand the Constitution correctly, and if I understand the procedure which should be adopted not only in this country, but in practically every country, it is that if there is a miscarriage of justice, and if there is an obvious case for remedying any such miscarriage of justice, the remedy should be sought from a higher court rather than from the court responsible for such miscarriage of justice.  It should not be within the power of the Executive to interpose over a minor court's decisions and vary them at its own will. The Minister has stated that new facts might come to life.  He referred to the words of the Seanad's amendment in which it is stated: &ldquo;Any recommendation for such reduction or remission shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I correctly understand the meaning of this sentence, in its relation to the Bill, it is because the Bill is of the kind that it permits the interposition of the Minister.  If there is to be any remission or any change it shall only be by the District Justice at the time.  I would have much preferred that if new facts were to come to light, they should be reviewed by a higher court than the District Justice's court, a higher court in the judicial sense.  I would not prefer that the Executive should be made a higher court.  There are limitations inherent in the Bill to the principle that underlies the amendment.  But this amendment does aim at achieving a very right and proper principle, and I believe it is an amendment that should be passed by the Dáil.  In arguing <Col N="118" /> against it, the Minister gave certain statistics.  I have not had the advantage of reflecting on those statistics, but as he read them out one very remarkable fact was rivetted upon my attention.  He says that in a certain year, I believe it was 1923, there were 87 penalties imposed.  In respect of 73 of these 87, recommendations were made for remission or reductions.  Of these 73, the Minister only agreed to 42.  Then he went on to add that in that year 64 reductions were made.</P>

      <P>That is hardly the point I put to the Minister. He stated that 73 recommendations for reduction or remission were made and that only 42 of these were agreed to by his Department.  He went on to add that in the same year 64 reductions were actually made.  These are the facts that he stated.  If there were 64 reductions made of 73 recommended, there are only 42 made on the recommendations of the District Justices in question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well, that will all the better.  If no reductions were made, apart from the recommendations of the District Justices, then that is what the Seanad seeks to achieve.  If the Seanad seeks to achieve, and put in the form of an Act, what was hitherto the practice, it is excellent and it should be placed in the Act itself.  But the main point made, as I understand the amendment, is that no review should be made by he Executive of the decisions or of any penalty imposed by the District <Col N="119" /> Justice without the recommendations of that particular District Justice.  If there is to be a review, if these matters are to be carried to Appeal, then they should be carried to a higher court in the Judiciary, and not taken directly to the Minister as an Executive Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Figgis in his remarks seems scarcely to appreciate the procedure that is adopted when petitions are entered in regard to sentences passed by judges or magistrates. There is a routine.  The petition or the representation that is made is invariably sent for comment to the judge or magistrate who tried the case, and this comment is invariably acted upon.  There is a factor that the Deputy quite definitely ignored, and it is this: it is by no means an uncommon thing for a judge or magistrate, hearing a case, to pass sentence, adverting rather to its effect upon the public mind than that the sentence would be fully served by the person upon whom it was passed.  A particular offence is committed and it may be rife in a particular area, and the judge trying the case.  adverting to that fact, would impose a particularly severe and stringent penalty, being quite prepared to consider any petition or representation that would be made to him at a later date and to advise the Executive to remit, or partially remit, the fine or sentence of imprisonment as the case might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is quite a common thing, and judges and magistrates, in reply to petitions that have been forwarded them.  have frequently stated to my Department that they were glad the petitions had been sent, as they recognised at the time of the trial that there were mitigating circumstances, but having regard to the effect on the public mind, they considered it necessary to impose an exemplary sentence.  The Seanad amendment, which the Deputy eloquently supports, rules out the possibility of that: no sentence passed by a District Justice can be altered save on representations made by the District Justice at the time.  It is always possible that new facts, facts that were not put in in evidence at the trial, will be brought forward and substantiated by special representation to the Executive. <Col N="120" /> When that happens these representations are sent to the judge or magistrate who tried the case.  He then takes cognisance of these fresh facts which were not before him at the trial, and he sends his advice to the Executive.  Invariably the Executive acts on this advice. The amendment suggested by the Seanad excludes the possibility of that, and I submit it is not a good, wise or humane thing to exclude that possibility.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Home Affairs told us that representations sent up in the form which the Seanad seeks to prevent are invariably sent to the magistrate for his comments. The Minister did not make clear why the magistrate cannot make his comments at the time of the passing of the sentence.  He said that sometimes magistrates imposed exemplary sentences, having regard to their effect locally. The sentence is given apparently because of its effect opinion I was not entirely convinced by the Minister's reference to new facts coming up, because anybody who has experience as a magistrate knows the nature of the new facts brought up. They are not facts, as a rule, bearing on the offence; they are facts referring to the extreme poverty of the man's family or the great respectability of his uncle or his grandfather, and they bring in what is a curse&mdash;the curse of canvassing.  In the old, days magistrates used to be canvassed, and at the <Col N="122" /> present time I have no doubt members of the Dáil will receive numerous appeals from all quarters of their constituencies. I will do the Minister justice by saying that I do not think he will give way in the slightest to any of those representations; but we must remember that we are not dealing only with the present Minister.  We are laying down the framework of government for the future, and we must have regard to any and every Minister who may be attached to future Governments.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Fisheries gave us very enlightening figures, from which it seems to me that even now matters outside the view of the Fisheries Department enter into consideration. From the figures given us it appears that whereas the Fisheries Department recommended the remission of 42 sentences, actually 64 were remitted; that is, 22 were remitted by the Minister for Home Affairs against the advice of the Minister for Fisheries.</P>

      <P>Yes, certainly, but that shows that the Fishery Department's view is not the only view that is taken into consideration.  It is not suggested that the Seanad went outside its province in suggesting this amendment. I believe the amendment would improve the Bill because it will get rid of this uncertainty and the curse of canvassing.  It will tend to do away with the appeal: &ldquo;Will you write to the and tell him that I am a poor man?&rdquo;  and other appeals of that sort.  Anything that tends to put justice under the control of the Executive, or even remissions, is bad.  I entirely endorse what Deputy Figgis has said If it is desired, let there be greater facilities for allowing new facts to be-brought up on appeal, but I urge the Minister to accept the Seanad's amendment, which seems to me to strengthen the Bill.</P>

It is that it might be well, on the appointment of <Col N="123" /> Ministries to communicate the facts as to the constitution of such Ministries to the Seanad.  I refer particularly to the matter that will be found in Column 280 of the Official Seanad Report.

      <P>The fact is that this Bill does not contain any provision in regard to the appeals to the Executive, and that it does not contain any reference to any power, in any person, to remit, or vary, a sentence, and it is a remarkable fact, because this amendment by the Seanad is not an amendment of anything in the Bill at all.  It is an attempt by the Seanad to effect a constitutional position outside the Bill as regards the remission of sentences and penalties.  It is an attempt by the Seanad to cut in upon what is recognised, I think, in most countries, namely, that there must be some constitutional authority in the Executive to intervene where wrong is done or where a miscarriage of justice has taken place.</P>

      <P>One's experience will call up cases where, if no such power of remission existed, very grave miscarriage would have been perpetuated, The Judge may, in a particular case, convict or impose penalties that if allowed to stand, may be a grave miscarriage, and he himself may be a most obstinate man.  It is not so very long ago since a Judge in this country was put up to try criminal cases for which lie was quite unfitted by temperament and nature, and in several instances, though he himself would have doggedly adhered to the results of these trials, and would have himself advised against any remission, in several cases, in the interests of justice, it was essential that the penalty <Col N="124" /> imposed by him should be relieved and that something in the nature of a pardon for what really were, not offences at all had to be brought in to relieve persons from gross injustice.  Now this amendment of the Seanad is not properly an amendment of this Bill; it is an attempt by way of amendment to this Bill to amend the constitutional position as regards the over-riding authority to relief where a miscarriage may have occurred.  This is particularly important in the case of a Bill. where the minimum penalties, some of them severe, are imposed.  The principle of a minimum penalty is not an agreeable one, and nothing but exceptional circumstances would justify, in the present day, people accepting it at all.  It is thought, and it is believed, and I accept the position in relation to Fishery Laws, that minimum penalties are necessary, at any rate for a period, to ensure their rigid enforcement, but if we have minimum penalties it is all the more important we should have some means of relief against miscarriage of justice or injustice.</P>
      <P>If that power of relief is to be cut into in that way that the Justice alone is to decide whether the remission is to occur, and that he is alone to decide it on the spot when he is imposing a minimum penalty, created by Statute, then I think the position becomes a very Serious one, and one the Dáil should not assent to.  As both Ministers concerned have stated, it would be an unheard-of thing to touch a penalty imposed without reference to the tribunal that imposed it, but to say that it is not to be touched unless the tribunal assents, and assents on the spot, is a principle I suggest that the Dáil should not agree to; and the Dáil should realise that if it were to assent to that, it would be assenting to an invasion of the Constitution and to a principle outside the Bill, and to something that is not really an amendment of the Bill at all.</P>

      <P>We have heard the phrase pretty often that doctors differ and patients die, but in this case unless the Dáil and the Seanad come to an agreement in connection with this Bill the result will be that tens of thousands of fish will die.  The present time is the <Col N="125" /> height of the spawning season, and by the time this matter is settled or decided the spawning season will be over and the fish will have been destroyed. Therefore, I wish to support the Minister for Fisheries, and I hope the Seanad will see its way to withdraw its opposition in the order that fish in the rivers at the present time and the spawning hanging up of the Bill will cost the country a very large amount in the few remaining fish that will be allowed to return to the lakes and rivers, and, therefore, I hope that this matter may be decided, in order to give the authorities concerned some chance of prosecuting the offenders, because at the present time, owing to the hanging up of this Bill, prosecutions cannot take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusion from Deputy Shaw's argument is: Accept this motion from the Seanad, and then the Bill will become law almost at once, but apparently, notwithstanding that argument, he is approving of the motion of the Minister for Fisheries. I am without any enthusiasm, and it is really with reluctance that I give support to the motion; but I cannot refrain from Saying that I think the amendment would not have been passed in the Seanad probably had the Minister for Fisheries, accepted the very wise and very sound argument that we adduced from these benches against a minimum penalty.  It is all the consequence of his refusal to accept that wise advice.  The fact remains that the amendment will prevent a miscarriage of justice being remedied, because there does not exist the machinery for an easy and cheap appeal to a high legal or judicial authority, such as Deputy Figgis would like to replace a political Minister, and I think we have to bear in mind that the men who will, for a time at any rate, be administering the Act will be men who have not had a very long experience on the Judicial Bench, and may not infrequently do injustice, and I think there ought to be some means of remedying injustice that may come about in that way.  I do not want to impose upon the offender the necessity for going <Col N="126" /> through all kinds of legal procedure to arrive at a Court of Appeal when the injustice can be remedied.  While saying that, I agree most heartily with the intention of Deputy Figgis to do something to prevent Executive interference with the Judiciary, and that is why I say I am not very enthusiastic in supporting the motion of the Minister for Porting the motion of the minister for mind, arises from the embodiment in the Bill of this principle of minimum penalties, and I think that the Minister would have had more success if he had not tried to embody what apparently is generally accepted as an evil principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour at any great length what are possibly only apparent contradictions between the arguments put forward by the Minister for Home Affairs and the Attorney-General, although I think there is some, matter of moment in that contradiction, because the Minister for Home Affairs stated that the base of appeal would be that the original penalty might have been imposed with a view to influencing public opinion, and, therefore, for that reason there might be some good ground for varying or amending it, whereas the Attorney-General stated that the good reason would be that there had been a miscarriage of Justice owing to certain facts that had later been brought forward.  These arguments are not entirely on all fours The Minister for Home Affairs did use one sentence which, I think, helped very largely to clear the case, and to state the case exactly as I would like to have it stated myself, and it is this that really gives point to the question of new facts, being brought forward since the penalty was imposed.  He used this sentence, a very significant sentence because of the use of one word in it.  He said: &ldquo;New facts may have later been substantiated.&rdquo;  He did not say that new facts may later have been brought forward, or that they should have been argued, but that they were substantiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I say that there should be no sentence varied until such facts are substantiated, but surely the right place to substantiate facts is a court of law. <Col N="127" /> I think that the practice, not only in regard to matters of this kind but everywhere, is a bad practice of allowing appeals from a court of law to the Executive.  The Attorney-General replies and say there might have been a grave miscarriage of justice in which there Was a clear case for the Executive to intervene to stop such a miscarriage. I frankly admit that, but only when an appeal has first been carried to a higher court.  That is the right method of appeal surely with a possible miscarriage of justice; that there should be an appeal, in the first place, in order that new facts may be brought forward, and should be substantiated, and if in the upshot, as a result of all the legal procedure available, there still appears to be a grave miscarriage of justice, due to whatever cause, then the Executive should step in, but the Executive should not step in the moment the lowest court of this State has given a sentence without an appeal to any higher court.  That is the object that, I understand, the proposer of this amendment in the Seanad sought to have achieved, as I have read his arguments in the other Chamber, but owing to the limitations of the Bill, the amendment itself has necessarily been limited to this extent: that when a penalty has been imposed, the person who first heard the case argued on its merits without any personal appeal whatever, is the only person who should be authorised to make recommendations. That, we are told, is the practice.</P>
    <P>The only difference then is that any recommendation for such a reduction or remission shall be made at the same time as the penalty is imposed.  There is nothing stated here that that recommendation should be made publicly when the sentence is given, although I myself would carry it to that extreme if my own view of the case were to be accepted.  But that is not how the amendment reads.  There could be a chance for a recommendation to be made but made by a judge after hearing the facts before him and if any new facts are brought forward then these new facts should be taken to another court of law, and a re-trial of the case should be heard.</P>

I feel, however, that if the Government had paid attention to the recommendations made here on the Committee Stage of this Bill in regard to minimum penalties, that third point would hardly have arisen, and if it did &amp;rise it would not have been of the importance which it has now assumed. It is all very fine having an academic discussion on the lines taken by Deputy Figgis with regard to this matter, but I think we should deal with the facts that are liable to occur down in the country, and should deal with the possible miscarriages of justice which may take place under this Bill as it stands.  As to the points made by some Deputies, speaking about local circumstances, and of the fact that local influences would be brought to bear and recommendations made with regard to a man's character, his relatives, his ability to pay and matters of that kind, I am rather inclined to think that these matters are arguments in favour of having this power of remission retained, and possibly of having applications made by other people besides the District Justices, because I think that local circumstances should be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalties in most cases under this Bill are of a mandatory character and, therefore, I think it is of great importance that a man's ability to pay should be taken into account when dealing with a remission of fines.  To one man, the imposition of a fine of £10 would be a matter of no importance, while in the case of another it might be beyond his ability altogether to pay a fine of £10.  These are facts which could hardly be known to the District Justice at the time of the trial, and if he allows that time to pass without making a recommendation, you may have a comparatively poor man in the position of being fined a sum which he is not able to pay, especially when be cannot obtain any redress without resorting to a most expensive system of appeal.  On that account, I think it is very advisable that power should be retained by which ordinary people can still make recommendations to the Minister and recommendations <Col N="129" /> to the, Executive for a remission of fines.  I would not have taken up this attitude with regard to the matter if the minimum penalty hall not been retained in the Bill, and I think if the Minister had taken the advice given him in that regard, the state of affairs which has now arisen would not exist.</P>

      <P>There is no special provision in our Standing Orders for such a Committee, but in another place when a House disagrees with an amendment to a Bill sent down from another House, the procedure is that a Committee is appointed there and then&mdash;it is really only a formal matter&mdash;to draw up and send to the other House the reason.  It need not be done unless there is substantial agreement on the reason.  I hope Deputies <Col N="131" /> are clear that it is not a Committee for the purpose of drawing up a reasoned statement for the Seanad, but merely to be responsible for a statement to be sent to the Seanad, consisting of one or two sentences&mdash;rather a formal matter&mdash;the point being that the Clerk who sends the message has no authority to send anything but a statement of what the Dáil had done. That is to say, the Clerk, when sending a message to the Seanad, would say: &ldquo;Dáil Eireann has disagreed with this amendment.&rdquo;  He has not authority to say: &ldquo;For the following reason,&rdquo; unless some members of the Dáil are appointed who will say: &ldquo;This is the message we suggest to send to the Seanad,&rdquo; and that it is agreed to.  If Deputies are not clear about that particular procedure, it would be better to assign no reason, and let the Minister, when he goes to the Seanad, explain the reason.  I wish to put it to the Dáil that it is not advisable that we should appoint a Committee to go into the matter and frame a statement.  That is not the idea at all.  I think that unless agreement is got here for a Committee formally to Make a statement it would be better simply to send the decision.</P>

      <P>In connection with the amendment passed in the Seanad to this particular Bill, the Local Government Electors Registration Bill&mdash;I desire to point out to the Dáil that the amendment in my judgment is outside the scope of the Bill. The Bill is one relating to the preparation of the register, of Local Government Electors.  It deals with the preparation of a register of people who are qualified to vote and with the setting up of machinery.  The Bill does not touch the qualification to vote.  It enacts in Section 3 that a certain Section of the Representation of the People Act shall not apply.  That is merely a change of date but it still leaves six months residence essential for a vote.  The date before which a person must have resided in a place is merely altered so that this amendment, which deals with the qualifications of voters, seems to me to be outside the scope of the Bill.  As the matter is one that concerns the relations of the Dáil and the Seanad, I merely state my opinion and leave it to the Dáil to take any action that they think fit.  The amendment will be considered in Committee.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to ask the Dáil to agree with this amendment from the Seanad.  There are administrative difficulties which it is unnecessary to go into.  In fact I am convinced that while the franchise is on an occupation instead of a ratepaying basis it would be impossible to administer the law, as amended by this amendment, equitably.  However that is not the vital point at issue, as the Ceann Comhairle has informed the Dáil he considers the amendment is out of order.  I was under the same impression all along.  When I introduced this Bill in the Dáil I introduced it as a machinery Bill.  It was non-contentious and all Parties agreed to allow it to go through.  It had nothing whatever to do with changing the franchise or with anything of a contentious nature.  If it was contentious when I introduced it I might not have got it through before the Christmas holidays. The Seanad insisted on putting in this <Col N="133" /> amendment which really amounts to initiating legislation.  Under the Constitution the Seanad has power to initiate legislation.  But this amendment changes the whole character of the Bill at a stage which deprives us of our Constitutional right, or of our right according to procedure, of amending or discussing the Bill on four or five Stages.  Instead of that we are allowed only one opportunity of discussing this amendment.  For that reason I think it would be seriously limiting the powers of the Dáil to agree to an amendment of this kind.  After all we must remember that we are creating precedents and we have to be very careful and jealous of our rights.</P>

      <P>I must say that I regret that the Minister did not address himself a little more to the subject matter of the amendment instead of devoting himself entirely to the fact that it was outside the scope of the Bill. I personally regret that it should be necessary for us to disagree with the Seanad and, I think, Ministers pro bably regret it; but, if we are to disagree with them, let us not do it on the ground that they do not understand the rules of order.  That is the only reason the Minister has given: that they have inserted something which was not in order.  That is not the manner in which we are likely to get a favourable settlement.  If we simply send the amendment back to them saying that we consider it outside the scope of the Bill, in colloquial language, their backs will go up at once.  I hope that some member of the Government will give some reasoned statement why this amendment is undesirable and why we should not agree with it, beyond the, mere fact that it is possibly out of order and possibly outside the scope of the Bill The Seanad, after all, are presided over by a high legal authority, and they have decided that it was in order.  Therefore, I should prefer to deal with the actual subject matter of the amendment.  The Minister said there were administrative difficulties.  I think we should have heard what they are. I think we should make a definite case why this proposal&mdash;on which I have no very strong views one way or the other <Col N="134" />&mdash;would be inconvenient.  I hope some member of the Government will give his views on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that it is possible I may be responsible for a certain amount of this discussion, but it is a matter of some importance and not merely a matter of order, that a Bill should go from this Dáil and that an amendment should come back from the Seanad which, had it been proposed in the Dáil, would have been out of order and which Deputies had, therefore, no opportunity of discussing.  Before the President proceeds, I think the matter to be decided is whether the amendment is going to be considered by the Committee.  If it is, then the merits of it can be gone into.  If it is going to be disagreed with, on the ground that it is outside the scope of the Bill, that will not necessitate any discussion of the merits of the amendment.  There are two different things.  One is, that the amendment introduces new legislation and, therefore, is a matter for a new Bill, rather than something to be part of this Bill.  The other is, that the amendment is to be considered and that it is to be considered on its merits.  I would like to hear the President's views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to make just a short explanation of that. Under the old electoral law there were certain restrictions which were removed by a subsequent Act.  We accepted the subsequent Act and one of the provisions of that Act was the fixing of a certain date from which the qualification would run.  In this case, owing to circumstances, it was necessary to fix a qualifying date to regulate the new Act which would make for much more ease and simplicity and save a considerable amount of expense.  The Bill was introduced as being strictly non-contentious and mainly with the view of fixing a date.  That interpretation of the Bill Was before the Dáil.  It was considered as such.  I am positively certain that if the members of the Dáil considered the Bill a Franchise Bill, as such, that many amendments would have been brought forward from at least two sections of the Dáil, and possibly from <Col N="135" /> a third, seeking to make what would be important amendments from the point of view of the Deputies and generally tightening up the law regarding the franchise for Local Government.  The law with regard to the other franchise, I think, is clear.  It is in the Constitution.  But with regard to Local Government it is not, An amendment, such as this is not a fair amendment.  I think the Seanad on reconsidering the matter will at once perceive that it is scarcely fair to characterise Bills differently from the form in which they left the Dáil, considering that they have passed the Dáil in a non-contentious atmosphere, and are for the purpose of providing machinery suitable for the special circumstances of the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure whether the President is arguing in favour of discussing the merits of the amendment or not.  It seems to me that we have to decide whether we ought to discuss the amendment on its merits, or rather try to arrive at an understanding as to the procedure which should be adopted in this matter as a precedent for future occasions when the Dáil may disagree with the Seanad on matters of order of this kind.  I am inclined to think, having this warning, that we ought to take in to consideration at once Standing Orders relating to such a difficulty.  It may arise occasionally, and seems to call for such a body as is defined in connection with disputes on Money Bills.  While I agree that the amendment is really outside the scope of the Bill, we may take it, shall I say, that the Ceann Comhairle has not been strict in his ruling on this occasion and allows the Dáil to deal with the merits of the motion.</P>
      <P>I do that for several reasons.  I think that the whole position regarding disagreements of this kind between the two Houses should be considered more carefully than they could be on short notice and, further, I would like to have the views of the Dáil as to the merits of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think that anybody proposes to discuss the <Col N="136" /> merits, but rather to make it clear that it is in the mind of every member that the Bill, as coming from the Seanad, comes back entirely different in character. It was sent as a non-contentious measure for a particular purpose, but it has come back as a contentious measure, and not for the same purpose exactly.</P>

      <P>I think it is scarcely fair the way Ministers are treated in regard to amendments in the Seanad. We often have amendments thrust into our hands a few minutes before going there.  In this particular case there were two amendments, A. and B. B. was struck out, and my arguments were mainly directed against B., and did not apply so much to A.  The two sections were separated at the time, and Senator Linehan withdrew Section B., and went ahead with Section A. That is, perhaps, partly an explanation of why this has arisen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is the view of the President that we should not discuss the merits of this amendment, but should discuss the question whether the Dáil is going to consider an amendment which the Dáil admits to be outside the scope of the Bill, in such a case, I imagine, no discussion is required, but that, taking it out of your hands, the Dáil decides that it is outside the scope of the Bill.  Therefore it cannot discuss it.  That is what the argument leads to.  That is what <Col N="137" /> the President desires, but I doubt his wisdom.  We rule that the Seanad exceeded its authority.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct that.  There is no question of the authority of the Seanad to-pass legislation, and no question of our authority to introduce a Bill for certain purposes and amend it, and afterwards make it serve a totally different purpose.  We have authority to do that if we like.  We have decided that we will not do such things.  We must, in courtesy to the Seanad, and in accordance with our general practice, either decide to lay the amendment aside, expressing no opinion on it, or to agree with it, or to disagree with it.  What I understood the Minister to move was that we disagree with it, because we consider the amendment as being outside the scope of the Bill.  I do not think that there is any question of limiting the power or authority of the Seanad.  The Seanad has full power and authority to initiate legislation amending any Act, in so far as such Act concerns the qualifications of Local Government voters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my own personal view of this matter. In point of fact, some Deputies approached me with regard to amendments in this particular Bill.  I pointed out, that the Bill was a machinery measure, that we were not concerned with the qualifications of voters, and that if we were to amend it the scope of the discussion would be very wide indeed.  The Deputies in question, agreed with me.  The Bill as it comes back from the Seanad might be argued to be a new Bill, but the difficulty is that we must have some machinery for dealing with the Bill that went up so that it can be passed into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little dubious as to the position.  If a measure is brought into the Dáil with a short title and preamble and is then passed and goes to the Seanad is it competent for the Seanad to treat that as a blank page to write on it anything it wishes? It seems to me the intention, whatever the form of the constitutional relations may be, is that a Bill coming from one house to another must be considered in regard to its intention and purpose, and that the initiating house has the right to say what that intention and purpose is.  If that is the fact and the Seanad introduces into any Bill, entirely different matter, I submit we have a right to say that they have exceeded their authority in regard to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does come forward as a new Bill, and they have not returned the original Bill with amendments to the Dáil.  It is because I feel that raises a very important matter that I think it would have been better for us to have that argued over a joint sitting, or to appoint a joint committee to deal with such matter.  I still think we will be less liable to get into a dispute if such a course as that is taken.  We are practically admitting in this matter that the Seanad may add on to the Fisheries Bill almost a constitutional amendment, to take an extreme case.  We are, I think, rightly contending that the scope of the Bill is defined in the preamble and the title, and that any <Col N="139" /> amendment should be limited to that. It goes into the Seanad, and is taken on the first reading because it has been already passed by the other House. Similarly, if the Seanad introduced a Bill dealing with light railways, and if we were to deal with ocean-going steamships or fisheries, attaching them on to such a Bill, I suggest we would be going outside the limit of our authority.  I consider we would be wiser to consult with the Seanad either in joint meeting or by a Committee on Privleges before we got at loggerheads.  We are raising an issue between the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. The Ceann Comhairle decides, and we agree, that the scope of the Bill precludes consideration of electoral qualifications. The Cathaoirleach says it already includes questions relating to disqualification. Therefore, the amendment is in order.  I think we ought to take an easy course in this matter.  I do not know whether it is very urgent.</P>

There is not yet any disagreement on the particular principle.  I suggest the amendment should here be rejected by the Dáil on the grounds that it is not within the scope of the Bill, and the Bill should be returned to the Seanad.  It may be if any attempt is made to reintroduce an amendment and so alter the Bill that the Cathaoirleach may take that view and there would be no disagreement.  It seems a pity to invoke any big machinery or prepare for a big debate until we know that there is a big disagreement.</P>

A Deputy may move an amendment here which would be ruled out of order, and that amendment might be allowed in another place.  In that case you would have more difficulty, because the two Houses would have adopted different procedure.  While I do not think a joint sitting would help us, a consultation which has proved very efficacious in the past between our Committee on Procedure and their Committee on Standing Orders might, if the Dáil agreed, consider the general question. Whether the Bill can he postponed until then and whether the Dáil would agree to that is another matter.</P>

      <P>I do not think any harm will be done by the Dáil rejecting this amendment.  If there are matters in dispute there ought to be at least agreement on what is in dispute. In this matter I think the Seanad, on reconsideration, will see that this particular amendment to the Bill alters the entire character of it, and that in those matters the same things may occur again.  We will possibly find some means of preventing differences of that sort.  I do not think it is necessary to put up any elaborate machinery to deal with these cases.  The joint sitting will bring out the causes of this disagreement. It was not the intention of the Minister that the Bill should be tinged with that particular colour.  As I understand the case, the Minister for Local Government would prefer not to have the Bill than to have this particular clause in it.  It is a bad principle to allow to grow up.  Ministers may introduce a Bill here as being non-contentious. It goes to the other House; and comes back, altered entirely by an amendment of this sort, which would have been refused in good faith in this <Col N="141" /> House if it were introduced here.  I have no doubt when those matters are understood that some machinery will be arranged to obviate their occurring in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>I do not think that the Minister has any right to consider, especially when he is dealing with two Houses, whether a Bill is contentious or non-cotentious.  That is purely a matter for convenience, and not at all in the same category as the question under discussion.  It is because this is so simple a can that I would prefer a precedent on it so that there would be little risk of very violent collision in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue is a simple one and I believe, with the President, that on reconsideration the Seanad will see the unwisdom of the amendment.  But it is because of the simplicity of the case that I would like a precedent to be set for the future when, on very much more important matters, the Seanad would disagree with the Dáil in regard to the character of a Bill.  If the Ceann Comhairle said, on re-reading the Bill with the amendments sent down by the Seanad, that his first judgment was faulty and he therefore ruled that it was in order to discuss the amendments, then we would be discussing the merits, but if we simply disagree now with this amendment because it is outside the scope of the Bill, we are, in fact, informing the Cathaoirleach that his judgment was wrong; we are telling him that he must re-consider his judgment. He may be a very easy-going gentleman and he may say: &ldquo;I do not mind; please yourselves.&rdquo;  He may be the other way and he may say: &ldquo;I stick to my right in this matter,&rdquo; and the Seanad may also say: &ldquo;We are going to stand by the amendment on its merits.&rdquo;  Then we have 270 days to wait, or a referendum.  The rule regarding references to a Joint Sitting undoubtedly lays it down that the Seanad will be the body which will call for it, but I think that might be agreed to if the view is taken that it is desirable to get over this little difficulty easily, and a Joint Sitting is the only course that I can see that is clearly laid down for us.  It may be a Joint Sitting of a very small House, and it <Col N="142" /> may not be deciding the issue.  It Will rather be discussing it, and, therefore, the path may be made easy.  The Committee on Privileges would only be set up <i>ad hoc.</i>  I do not think it is laid down that we must have such as between the two Houses, and that can only be by agreement with the Seanad, but I imagine it is the line of least resistance, and would, I believe, possibly save very much greater difficulty at a future date.</P>

It is quite evident that there is a considerable difference of opinion, and surely in a matter of this constitutional importance when, as the Minister for Local Government said, we are making precedents, we ought not to decide on the spur of the moment.  If time were given to the leaders of the various parties to meet and talk it over, we <Col N="143" /> should be in a very much stronger position to assert whatever we decide to be our rights, because then the Government will feel that they have behind them the support of every Deputy. Surely that is the position we want to be in.  I would suggest that the President, move to report progress on this matter and give us time to go into it in greater detail and with somewhat less hurried judgment.</P>

A date has been fixed, and it was anticipated that the Bill, from its non-contentious character, from the manner in which it was moved here, from everything in connection with it, would have been passed into law.  Certain action has been taken, and a good deal of public money will have been expended in vain, unless accommodation is afforded to us by the Seanad.  However, I move that we report progress and that we re-consider the matter on Tuesday.</P>

      <NameTxt>An CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion of the adjournment, Deputy wilson has given notice that he will raise the question of the withdrawal by the Land Commission of the Supplementary Notices for the payment of land annuities which has hitherto been the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the old regime it was the custom that those annuitants who did not pay their rents or annuities on the date fixed on the Receivable <Col N="144" /> Order would, in the course of a month or six weeks, receive a second notice from the Solicitor's Department of the Land Commission giving them six days' notice to pay.  The Department of Agriculture has withdrawn this second notice, and no machinery exists at the moment by which the annuity can be paid, except through the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the annuity has not been paid between the dates fixed on the Receivable Order the banks will refuse to accept it, and then the position is that unless it is paid the legal officers of the Government will proceed by writ or otherwise and place the people who are willing to pay, and who, under the old regime, would have had an opportunity of paying on this buff Order, this second Order, in the position of being forced to pay costs.  I do not hold that it is a proper course for anybody to wait for this second notice, but it has been the custom in the past, and if it is the proper thing that annuities must be paid to date before you change the order that has been in existence, I think it would have been proper for the Minister of Agriculture, or whoever is in charge of this department, to have issued a notice saying that, &ldquo;On and from this particular half-year we shall not issue a second Order, and we hereby give you notice, and you will note that the next time you do not pay within the dates specified on your Receivable Order you will be likely to incur legal costs.&rdquo; That is simply the position.  If the second notice is abolished, and an annuitant goes to the bank when he is behind time with his payment, the bank will refuse to accept it.  The result will be that the annuitant will either have to pay through a solicitor, incurring costs, or he will have to go to the post office and remit it to some place, which he has never done before.  If you look at the Receivable Order you will see that it does not specify to whom it is to be paid.  A bank will not accept it, and the question arises: Is be to wait until a solicitor sends him a letter, mulcting him in costs for 30s. or so?  I trust the Minister will instruct the banks, for this time, at any rate, to accept the money and let people understand that in future they must pay within the specified dates on their Receivable <Col N="145" /> Order.  In that way we will get over the difficulty that has arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr GOREY Mr GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to this question I know that the issuing of notices from the Land Commission entails a huge staff.  Probably that is the reason why these notices have been withdrawn. I know it is expensive, but if some form could be devised to replace the old buff Order at less expense, that would meet the situation, and would, I think, satisfy us.  People who have no intention not to pay sometimes neglect to pay.  The average man in the country is not a man of education: he is not a clerk, and he forgets, as most people forget things, that it must be paid on a certain date, and if not he is liable to costs.</P>
      <P>If there could be some simple, inexpensive method by which notice could reach the average annuitant I think we would agree to it.  The present arrangement entails a good deal of hardship and expense on people paying annuities, and that is undesirable especially in the case of people who have always paid and are willing to pay.  Some farmers perhaps are not able to read or write, and they want some form to remind them when these annuities are due.</P>

      <P>There is just one other point on this subject that I would wish some little information on. Two separate forms are being issued, one for what is known as a year's rent, less 25 per cent. on account of compounded rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr GOREY Mr GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr GOREY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr McGOLDRICK Mr McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I know; I am going to deal with that, but I am concerned with this particular thing at the moment.  This first form asks for the payment of a year's rent, less 25 per cent.  Then comes the forms of the annuities which specifies it must be paid to the bank at a certain time. What I want to know is in the case of a tenant who is not getting a year's rent form does this date which is stamped on the annuity apply to his case, and unless he has got the previous form and paid his year's rent <Col N="146" /> will he be held to the date on the annuity form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr GOREY Mr GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>On a further point of order I wish to raise this question now. It is confusing to mention this question of annuities.  It is a question of payment in lieu of rent, and not of annuity at all, It is a mistake to call a payment in lieu of rent an annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGoldrick must be aware of the ruling made here on several occasions, that the only matter that can be raised on the adjournment is a matter of which definite notice has been given. The matter of which notice is given to-day is the question of the withdrawal by the Land Commission of the supplementary notices for the payment of land annuities which has hitherto been the practice.  Deputy McGoldrick on his own showing is raising a different matter.  He promised to come to the matter of which notice has been given, and I will allow him to deal with that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that annuities and payment in lieu of rent represent the same thing in different terms.  I am coming to the withdrawal of notices, but I wish to know first if this date that is stamped means that after that date no further notices will be issued, and that these people will be prosecuted, and the Sheriff sent to collect the annuity without further notice.  I want to know whether that will be done in the case of people who have already paid their year's rent, less 25 per cent.  This matter is quite clear.  There are two things that the notice can apply to.  The notice can apply to a year's rent, as well as interest in lieu of rent, and if the notice is to be withdrawn as regards both these payments, then I think a very serious problem has been reached. I do not think that the Minister can ordain that the notices can be withdrawn. The people are already puzzled and in a quandary, and if they overrun the date on the stamped form they will throw themselves into the arm of the law, and the Minister would send out to collect at the point of the sword, to get What could have been got if their attention had been drawn to it in a <Col N="147" /> regular way, and if the facts were given in another legal form.  I think the withdrawal of the notice is wrong in the existing conditions.  In the past they knew the date on which this interest in lieu of rent should be paid, and they knew what it was for.  Now they do not know whether it is compounded arrears, interest in lieu of rent, or annuity, and I think notice should be conveyed to those people and extreme measures should not be resorted to until they had full opportunity of complying with the terms that the Land Commission requires regarding the payment of these sums of interest in lieu of rent.  They are facing a difficult problem, and they are doing their best in the circumstances. This applies particularly to small holders in congested areas, and it does not so much apply to the large farmer, because he has knowledge of these things.  It is puzzling to honest farmers in congested areas.  Every man with public responsibility finds himself more or less cornered in every place he goes to with regard to the information required on these particular subjects, and they are really in trouble at the moment.  I think the Land Commission authorities, under the direction of the Minister for Agriculture, could simplify the thing very much; they can remove this threatened withdrawal of the notices, and that would give the people an opportunity of complying with the conditions under normal and reasonable circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I have not said any such thing.  I said the notice has been issued <Col N="148" /> in the Press in which it is (distinctly stated that the buff order is abolished, and you must pay your rent through a solicitor.  It does not say where you pay it, but you cannot pay because no bank would take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole of this complaint is unreal, because Deputies do-not take the trouble to find out exactly what the procedure would be.  The burden of the complaint made by Deputy Wilson and Deputy McGoldrick is that the Land Commission ceased to issue the notices which they had always previously issued, and that now the unfortunate tenant purchaser is going to be processed and cannot pay his annuity through the bank.  That is not true. That is not a fact.  If, instead of raising this here as a matter of national importance, the tenant purchaser walked into the bank with his annuity and Receivable Order, he would see it is not a fact.  The whole trouble is that people do not want to pay their annuities.  I do not say that that is true in the case of Deputy Wilson.  or Deputy McGoldrick; but I do say that there is a minority of people who do not want to pay their annuities; and when they see a notice in the paper that the Land Commission is not going to waste good ink or paper in future in sending out notices to them, this matter is raised here.  The fact is that if these people were desirous of paying their annuities, they would walk into any bank in Ireland and they would find that the bank would take their annuities from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a letter from a tenant purchaser who forwarded his cheque on three occasions to the Land Commission.  Now he has been processed for annuities which he has already paid.  He did not get the Receivable Order back.  The State Solicitor, I understand, has held up the Receivable Orders paid last Spring through the courts.  I have had dozens of letters dealing with the annuities.  Four thousand processes were issued last year to the tenants of Limerick for their annuities.  When they paid through the court their Receivable Orders were not sent back and, therefore <Col N="149" /> they were not able to pay the Land Commission.  In one case a man paid by cheque to the Land Commission, yet he has been processed, notwithstanding that the cheques for three instalments had been forwarded but were not cashed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a totally different case.  The complaint of Deputy Nolan is that there are thousands of annuitants in the County Limerick who have not got back their Receivable Orders and hence cannot pay.  That is a totally different matter from the question that Deputy Wilson has raised.  I have a return here before me of arrears of annuities in the Co. Limerick and the amount is £30,000.  Deputy Nolan's explanation of that is that the State Solicitor has held up the Receivable Orders.  I beg leave to doubt that is the true explanation of these arrears.  However, to come to the other point, the gale days are in the months of June and December.  That is for the 1903 and 1909 Acts.  We need not deal with the other cases.  In the months of June and December the tenant-purchasers received their, Receivable Orders, and they are asked to pay their instalments of annuities before the 14th June and the 14th December, respectively.  Now this year, as always, the Land Commission did not ask the banks to refuse to take the money on the 15th June or the 15th December.  As a general rule they allow the banks to receive instalments of Land Purchase annuities up to the month of August in the case of the June annuities, and to the month of March in the case of the December annuity.  That is the procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years ago.  I would like to have the circumstances of the case.  I do know that the Land Commission do not give instructions to <Col N="150" /> the banks on the 15th June and the 15th December to refuse annuities.  I know that they have not given instructions this year, and I know that if Deputy Wilson, or any other Deputy or tenant purchaser in the country who has not his annuity paid goes into the bank and offers his annuity and hands them the Receivable Order, that the bank will receive it.  That is the Way at the present, moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Receivable Order at the moment states specifically that the Bank will accept payment if paid before the 14th of the month, and that they will not accept it afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that.  I have stated that they ask that the money be paid before the 14th, but the procedure is that the bank will not refuse to take annuities until such time as they receive instructions from the Land Commission to refuse annuities. These instructions have not been issued yet They will issue shortly, and it was because we intend to issue these instructions shortly that we published a notice in the Press to the effect that we require all arrears of annuities, interest in lieu of rent, compounded arrears of rent, and any other arrears of payment to be paid in immediately. So that our failure or refusal to send out extra notice makes no difference whatever to the tenant.  If he goes into the bank at the present moment. the bank will receive payment of the half gale on the Receivable Order which the tenant purchaser received in December last.  That is the way at present, and that will remain the case until we issue instructions through the Bank of Ireland to the various banks asking them to refuse to take annuities.  We propose to issue these instructions shortly.  We will give a little longer time, but not much.  At present tenant purchasers have no grievance, and if those who think they have a grievance-would only take the trouble of taking their Receivable Orders into a bank and offering the money, they would find that they would have no grievance because the bank would accept the money.  I take it at present that so long as Deputy Wilson is assured that there is no regulation against anyone <Col N="151" /> who wishes to pay the half gale due in December last, without costs, and to pay it into any bank he wishes, that he is satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that the bank will take the arrears due last-June. But the banks will take the annuity due on the 14th december. The fact that the Land Commission have waived their former procedure of sending out these notices has got nothing to do with the point.  It is merely to save time, money and paper.  At the present moment the Land Commission is, in fact and in practice, a land agent's office for every unpurchased estate in Ireland.  The Collection Department of the Land Commission, is working extremely hard.  The staff is on overtime since last September, and they have, something better to do in clearing the decks for action than in sending out notices to tenant purchasers who have purchased under the 1903 Act.  That is why the sending out of these notices has been discontinued.  It was a waste of stamps and time.</P>
      <P>It is no harm or injury to the tenant purchaser, and he is not prejudiced by the failure to send out these notices.  I have stated that it is the intention of the Land Commission to instruct the banks practically immediately to receive no further annuities.  I want to impress on the Deputies that will be done immediately.  It will be done before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say here that there is growing up a custom, or a habit, to establish a hanging gale in connection with annuities.  A minority of tenant purchasers never pay their annuities until they get three or four notices.  Some Of them never pay until processed.  That is to say, they get, in practice, six months grace because we are not able to get the returns from the banks for some time, and the serving of notices and instructing the solicitors to issue processes takes six months.  All the time the annuities are due.  There is a minority of tenant purchasers who are endeavouring for some time to establish the custom of a hanging gale in connection with Land Purchase annuities. They are the very same minority.  I <Col N="152" /> want to end that once and for all.  I want every Deputy to understand that is a hardship to the ratepayers of the district.  If the June half gale is not paid when it is due, it comes from the Guarantee Fund.  If the December annuity is not paid at the end of January, there is a draw on the Guarantee Fund, and, in fact, the ratepayers of that county area paying for the people who are holding up this money for six months without interest.  That is what is happening.  In the County of Limerick there are thirty thousand pounds in arrears, that is in respect of the a annuity due last June.  Every penny of that is being paid by the ratepayers out of the Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. NOLAN Mr. NOLAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. NOLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, the reason why it is due is that they did not get back their Receivable Orders.  The Receivable Order definitely states on the face of it that the Bank of Ireland will receive, on or before the 14th June, and not after, the amount named in the Receivable Order.  The tenant purchaser cannot lodge it without having the Receivable Order.</P>

      <P>It is quite absurd to say that £30,000 worth of Receivable Orders have been held up in any county.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I gave the Minister notice of four Receivable Orders being held up.  On the 1st of October Receivable Orders were forwarded to those tenants, and they only got credit for payment on the 26th December.  Money was handed to the State Solicitor in April, and it was only credited in December.</P>

      <P>I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that 95 per cent. of the people who owe the £30,000 have their Receivable Orders.  That is a statement which Deputy Nolan can verify.  The same applies to the £83,000 owed in Cork, to the £16,000 owed in Clare, and the £15,000 owed in Galway.  The fact is, annuitants are trying to establish this custom of a hanging half-gale, and to take advantage of the fact that we are unable to get particulars, which would enable us <Col N="153" /> to process them, for at least six, months, and the Guarantee Fund has to make good their default during that period. I take it that everybody is agreed that I state of affairs must be altered.  It is unfair that the ratepayers of any district should be always having to pay for the same defaulters.  That must stop, and stop very quickly, and for that purpose I propose shortly to introduce a Bill giving the-Judicial Commissioner power to make an order without going to Court in cases of that sort; that order, the moment the annuity is in arrear, can be executed immediately. I do not say that we would not give a week, or, a fortnight, or a month's grace, but we must get over this habit by which annuitants can escape payment for at least six months. That is the position at the present moment, and I think that meets the point made by Deputy Wilson.</P>

      <P>The notice read out by Deputy Nolan states that the banks will receive payments before the 14th of June or the 14th December, but the question is, will they receive payment of the annuities after these dates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated before that during the last two years the banks have received this money long after the 14th June and the 14th December. I repeat, however, that that state of affairs will not exist much longer, because the banks will shortly receive instructions to refuse to take the annuities after these dates.</P>

      <P>When that notice has been sent to the banks I would like to know if the Land Commission will simultaneously receive notice to refuse to accept by post annuities after the specified dates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission never received annuities sent by post because they could not keep their accounts if they were to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKENNA Mr. McKENNA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known of several cases where after notice was served on the defaulters, the Land Commission repeatedly accepted the Receivable Order and cheque, for the annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is merely one statement against another.  During the <Col N="154" /> last two years the Land Commission found it difficult to collect the annuities, and in an odd case they may have done what the Deputies state.  The Land Commission, as a rule, never received annuities by post.  As I have stated, they could not keep their accounts if they were to do that, or if there was a rule of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKENNA Mr. McKENNA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that for the last 20 years in the Midlands and other places and under the British regime the practice that I refer to was carried out by the Land Commission. After the notice was served on the defaulter the Receivable Order with a cheque was sent on to the Land Commission; the Receivable Order was stamped in the usual way by the Land Commission and sent back to the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>I would like the Minister to answer this question: when this order is issued to the banks instructing them to refuse to accept annuities after the 14th June and 14th December, will the Land Commission also receive instructions to refuse to accept the annuities after these dates if the tenant sends on the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said there is going to be any instructions to the banks to refuse to receive the annuities after the 14th June or the 14th December.  I said they will receive them long after these dates, and although it is January now the banks are receiving them at present, but before the end of this month instructions will go to the banks to refuse to receive annuities after the dates on which they become due.  After the specified dates, the annuities will only be received through the State Solicitor.</P>
