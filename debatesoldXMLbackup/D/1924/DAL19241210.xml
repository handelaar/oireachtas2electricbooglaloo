      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that Mrs. Ellen Reilly, Deer Park, Castlecomer, mother of Volunteer John Reilly, No. 53292, 25th Battalion, National Army, made application for dependent's allowance in respect of said son, who joined the Army on 4th July, 1922, and has not received any allowance, although it is stated that the son, prior to his enlisting, contributed a sum of sixteen shillings a week to the support of the home; and whether this poor woman will receive her allowance as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (Mr. Peter Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. Reilly's claim was disallowed on the ground that the amount normally contributed by her son, John, to the home was less than the minimum required by regulations, namely 12/- per week, before an allowance might be issued.  Prior to enlistment, John Reilly had been in receipt of 16/- a week and board from his employer.  He lodged at home.  After making a reasonable deduction in respect of clothing, pocket money, and incidental expenses, the net contribution to the home could not have amounted to 12/- per week.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that Sergeant William O'Neill, <Col N="2304" /> Army No. 14348, who attested on February 1st, 1922, and who was discharged as medically unfit on March 14th, 1924, died in Peamount Sanatorium on March 22nd, 1924, of pulmonary tuberculosis, contracted during his six months' internment, in 1921, in Rath Camp, and aggravated by his service in the National Army; further, that his wife, Mrs. Mary Anne O'Neill, The Knox, Naas, who paid all funeral expenses, is now in very straitened circumstances, and whether he will favourably consider the awarding of a pension or gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. P. HUGHES Mr. P. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Sergeant O'Neill's death was not due to a wound or injury.  The question of awarding Mrs. O'Neill a pension or gratuity is, therefore, outside the scope of the Army Pensions Act, 1923.  I regret that her claim had in consequence to be disallowed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether the enquiries regarding the claims for ration <Col N="2305" /> money, marriage allowance, and gratuity on discharge of the Volunteers, employed on the Sewage Farm, Electric Light Station, Pumping Station, and Tractor Service, Curragh Camp, are yet completed, and if he can state when the men concerned may expect payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous to enlistment the men referred to were civilian employees engaged on the maintenance of the services mentioned by the Deputy, under the control of the Office of Public Works.  In October, 1922, it was arranged for their own protection that these men should be attested as soldiers, but should continue their duties under conditions exactly similar to those they were accustomed to. They did, in fact, continue their civil duties and were not called upon to perform any work of a purely military nature.  The express condition of their attestation was that their pay subsequently should not be less than their civil pay.  If military remuneration proved to be less, the difference would be made up by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Commissioners made weekly payments accordingly in nine out of the eleven cases.  Dependents' allowance and marriage allowance were issued as portion of military remuneration in cases in which it was admissible that gratuities on discharge were also granted.  No other allowances were contemplated to be issued. In all the circumstances the claim preferred by the Deputy cannot be acceded to.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be necessary, I am afraid, to take all the time of the Dáil to-day for public business. With reference to Deputy Lyons's Motion, which will be affected by that decision, there will be a Supplementary Estimate to-morrow for the Land Commission, and it may be suitable to raise upon it matters which he proposes to raise on his Motion.  The proposed order of business is to take the Intoxicating Liquor Bill first, and then, for an hour, No. 3, after which the Local Government Bill will be taken.  It will be necessary to sit until 10.30 to-night with the usual adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not referred <Col N="2307" /> to the Standing Orders, but is it a matter which can be decided on sudden motion, or rather intimation, such as the Minister has now made to the effect that it is intended to take the whole time of the House, notwithstanding the fact that a private Member's Motion is on the Order Paper?  That seems to me to be a very unwise precedent to make, because if that can be done, private Members are simply deprived of their rights.  I do not want particularly to plead the cause of Deputy Lyons in this case, but I want to look after the rights of private Members.</P>

      <P>Standing Order 74, dealing with business of private Members says:&mdash;&ldquo;Provided that a Minister may move after Questions on any Wednesday or Friday that on that day specified Ministerial business shall not be interrupted, if under consideration at the time fixed for taking up Motions, or Bills to be moved by private Teachtaí.  Such Motions may be proposed without notice, and shall be decided without amendment.&rdquo;  The Minister, therefore, I take it, is proposing to do that.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that this Motion of Deputy Lyons was down on two or three occasions and postponed and was definitely promised for to-day, does the Standing Order apply, having regard to the fact that a promise has been made, that the Motion will be considered to-day?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he has had any communication with Deputy Lyons, and whether the Deputy has agreed to postpone the Motion, otherwise we would be placed in a very different position from that in which we would be placed if the Deputy had not received notice.  If the latter is the case I shall have to vote against the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision was taken some ten minutes ago, and I have <Col N="2308" /> not had an opportunity of consulting Deputy Lyons.  I have pointed out that the Supplementary Estimate for the Land Commission will be taken to-morrow, and that that should provide a necessary and reasonable opportunity for such matters as the Deputy proposes to raise under his Motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not quite so simple.  This Motion is already in process of discussion.  The Motion was moved and adjourned until to-day. The Motion may be passed by the Dáil, and the question, then, that might otherwise be raised on the Motion providing Estimates would be in quite a different position.  I think that the procedure which the Minister has outlined is quite unfair to the House and, while it may be right, and apparently is in order, that the House should have an opportunity of deciding in favour or against this Motion, it is, at least, unfair to private Members that Ministers should come along and without any communication with anybody indicate that they intend to move such a Motion. If that kind of procedure is to be adopted, there is not much protection for private Members, and it is a precedent that would be a very evil one in respect of the general business of the Dáil.  I do not think that we ought to complicate the question by discussing it in relation to the Estimates to-morrow. I think it is quite unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. P. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are asking the Minister to waive his rights under the Standing Orders. That certainly is clearly the position. We are asked to waive our rights under the Standing Orders.  It is said that it is unfair to invoke the rights which the Standing Order gives.  That, at least, is the position clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. BYRNE Mr. A. BYRNE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that under the Standing Orders the Minister has a perfect right to propose such a motion without notice.  That is quite clear under the Standing Orders.  Deputies are great sticklers for the Standing Orders, and they have them here.  It is quite clear, I repeat again, that there <Col N="2309" /> is such a right within the Standing Orders.  When Deputy Johnson says this thing should not be confused by speaking about the Estimate to-morrow he hardly meets the merits of the case. The Minister is quite entitled to say, to meet the undoubted equities which Deputy Lyons has in the matter, that on the Land Commission Estimate to-morrow there will be afforded opportunity to discuss this question at length. No one here is anxious to shelve this motion.  They are anxious to discuss it.  Speaking as the Minister responsible, I am anxious to discuss it, and to give Deputy Lyons the opportunity to discuss it, and to meet him quite fairly on the question, but we are entitled to point out in the circumstances, in invoking the particular rights we have under the Standing Orders, that Deputy Lyons can raise any question he wants to raise to-morrow.  That meets the merits of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Dáil that this Motion has been adjourned by agreement since Friday.  I fail to see why the Minister should try and get the time of private members. I think I am within my rights in holding that I must get permission to move this motion to-day.  I will not get the opportunity on the Estimates to-morrow that I would get on this Motion.  If Ministers are uneasy in their minds that there may be too many hard things said against the Land Commission, or the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, they can make their minds easy.  If there are hard things to be said, they must be deserved, and if the Minister is such a plucky man as he is alleged to be, he will not oppose this Motion being taken to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">

      <P>The motion must be that the specified Ministerial business shall not be interrupted at the time fixed for taking up motions or Bills to be moved by private Teachtaí.  Is the specified Ministerial business to be discussed the Local Government Bill, or is something else included?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Minister has spoken of Estimates to be taken to-morrow.  I do not know what are the numbers of the Estimates, as they have not yet been circulated. There is a provision to the effect that Supplementary Estimates not included in the annual Estimates may be brought forward on leave given by the Dáil, after motion made by notice.  I do not know whether such motion has been made, or notice given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the Deputy assume notice would not be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to discuss the Motion to-morrow, and notice has not been given to-day, notice cannot be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Dáil to give permission.  The Deputy is raising a difficulty which he may meet to-morrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>What is going to happen Deputy Lyons' Motion if we have the Supplementary Estimates? The Motion cannot be withdrawn without <Col N="2311" /> Deputy Lyons' consent, and it cannot be withdrawn without the consent of the Dáil as a whole.  To avoid having the same discussion twice over, it would probably save time to have the discussion on Deputy Lyons' Motion to-day, and probably the Estimates will pass to-morrow without much discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>As to whether discussion should take place on this Motion, or on the Estimates, it is quite possible that a Deputy can vote for Deputy Lyons' Motion and also for the Estimates.  They are two different matters altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the various points of order, the Motion is &ldquo;that to-day the consideration of the Local Government Bill shall not be interrupted at the time fixed for taking up Motions or Bills moved by private Teachtai,&rdquo; that is, 7 o'clock.  The question that this motion would not apply to an adjourned Motion such as Deputy Lyons's, is a point that has no validity under the Standing Orders.  As to the Estimates, I know nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the real position is, that the Dáil is asked to give power to the Minister to deal with Ministerial business in preference to the business of private Teachtai, and leave it at that, with the prospect that the Dáil will be adjourned some time within the next ten or fifteen days, and possibly Ministerial business will occupy the whole of the time in the meantime.  That proposition has been put to us, and it has been put to us, I suggest, strictly within rights according to the Standing Orders, but with an entire disregard of private Members' convenience.  Deputies have come up from the country to-day specially to discuss this question because it was on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is to be an entire disregard, to put it <Col N="2312" /> bluntly, of Ministerial convenience, which ought to get some consideration as well.  I would ask: is the motion of the Minister for Justice in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly. The motion is before the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the question is put I suggest that Deputy Lyons having withdrawn on Friday, and having the Motion put on for to-day instead, arrangements could now be made that his Motion could come on to-morrow, simultaneously with the Vote, and the matter could be met in that way.  I do not think it is fair that Private Business should be shelved altogether by the action of any Minister or Ministers.  I suggest that, if the substance of Deputy Lyons' Motion can be taken to-morrow in connection with the Vote, it will solve the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. COLOHAN Mr. COLOHAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. COLOHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I think it is very unfair to private members that they should be prevented from bringing in motions before the Dáil.  Now, the motion at present before us in the name of Deputy Lyons was tabled on Tuesday week last.  It was inserted on the Order Paper for Wednesday.  It came on on Friday, and it was to be taken to-day.  Surely it is not fair to treat a private Deputy like that.  This is not the only occasion on which such a thing has occurred. It has occurred several times within the last six months.  I do not think it was the intention of the framers of the Standing Orders that Ministerial business could be used as the pretext for shelving a private member's motion.  I have a matter to bring on, in connection with Deputy Lyons's motion, but if this motion is again adjourned there will be no opportunity of raising the matter until after the Christmas Recess. Therefore, I think we should come to some definite understanding as to when this motion of Deputy Lyons will be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this discussion ranges itself under two heads.  One is the right of the private Member.  We would all like to support the claim made for due consideration for private Members in these motions, but when it comes down to the concrete case of <Col N="2313" /> Deputy Lyons's motion, surely we need not thresh out that broad principle of private members' time.  Seeing that Deputy Lyons has already got an opening opportunity, we need not thresh out this question now.  This Motion was postponed from Friday to be further dealt with.  But at all events we ought to know if the Votes come on to-morrow whether they will be of such a wide nature, as far as the discussion is concerned, that Deputy Lyons could have an opportunity of speaking on his Motion.  Therefore, I think that, in this case, at all events, there is not such a great grievance, considering the urgency of getting on with public business.  On the other hand, I would join with other Deputies in deprecating any encroachment on private members' time as a matter of ordinary procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more time lost now than if this question were raised and definitely dealt with, perhaps.  At the most, one and a-half or two hours would finish this motion this evening. I do not intend to speak very long, as I have already spoken ten minutes, but I do demand my right as a private member in the Dáil and to get the support of the Dáil in this matter; and I think it is up to every member of the Dáil who wishes to retain his rights to vote in favour of this motion being discussed this evening. Neither the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, nor any other Minister, has any right to encroach on private members' privileges in putting forward a motion.  It is all very well to say that the Local Government Bill is important.  This motion is more important <Col N="2314" /> than any Government Bill that has been introduced.  The number of people suffering at the present time owing to the delay by the Land Commission in dealing with estates is very large, and it is only right that an opportunity should be given to discuss the matter, and to ascertain where the delay is in getting on with this work. Therefore, I think it is only right that every member of the Dáil who is out for fair play should support me in this motion, and see that the Ministers do not trample on the rights of private members, especially when the motion that is being brought on may animadvert on these Ministers themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The first two amendments from the Seanad read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 1 (1) the word &ldquo;or,&rdquo; line 22, deleted and after the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; in the same line, the words &ldquo;or St. Patrick's Day,&rdquo; inserted.</P>
      <P>In Section 1 (3) the word &ldquo;or,&rdquo; line 38, deleted and after the word &ldquo;Friday&rdquo; in the same line, the words &ldquo;or St. Patrick's Day&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in those amendments, which really means re-inserting St. Patrick's Day as a day of general closing. To that extent it will leave the Bill in the form in which it was originally introduced in the Dáil.  I am moving the acceptance of these amendments and I hope that the Dáil will reconsider the decision given here when the Bill was last before the House.  I would recall to Deputies that there was a time not very long ago when something approaching the closing of publichouses on St. Patrick's Day was effected.  Not with the help of any statute but simply by pressure of public opinion and with the co-operation and good will of the members of the licensed trade, almost a complete closing on St. Patrick's Day <Col N="2318" /> was effected.  Then, because here and there individual traders defied the public opinion that was so much in evidence at the time and remained open, other traders began to say that when that went on and there was not a complete and uniform closing, they could not afford to be at a disadvantage compared with competitors in their trade, and so the voluntary effort broke down &mdash;broke down, not because of resistance or lack of co-operation on the part of the many, but because of resistance and lack of co-operation on the part of the comparatively few.</P>
    <P>It was proposed then to come to the aid, so to speak, of voluntary effort with a statute, and to give statutory expression to that public opinion which manifested itself in the country on this question, so that there would not be individual backsliders causing a breakdown, as happened in the past.  We know the sources of that public opinion, they were healthy sources.  They came from the Gaelic League, from Sinn Fein, from Labour movements, from all those quarters which represented the varied life of the country at the time. It does seem strange now, when we have the power of legislation in our hands, that there has been some kind of lapse, or some kind of change of heart, which causes the representatives of the people in the Dáil to take a different view.  It is not too much to ask on this National Festival that we should make that much of a gesture to give expression to our feeling that intemperance is a vice and a national evil, and that if it went on in increasing proportions it would be a national menace.</P>
    <P>It would, I believe, be welcomed all over the country, both by men and women electors, if the Dáil were to take a different view on this matter from that which they took on the last occasion.  People say that they deprecate &ldquo;kill-joy&rdquo; legislation, that St. Patrick's Day should be a day of healthy amusement and so on.  I wonder is it seriously argued that there could be no honest, decent, healthy amusement, no real social intercourse without the help of alcoholic beverages. If that is the contention, it should be put in plain language by Deputies arguing <Col N="2319" /> against this amendment&mdash;that they do not believe there can be pleasure and amusement and proper social intercourse without the assistance of stout, whiskey, Bass, and other liquors of that kind.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that licensed traders do not open their houses on that day. People may have drink in their homes, as they may, of course, on any day.  But this simply asks that the publichouses do not sell liquor for consumption on the national festival.  I have very little sympathy with the arguments put forward on the last occasion that this was tyrannical and a hardship and would be resented by the public.  The public has not changed so much in three or four years.  I believe that the public wish to see this provision inserted in the Bill and that it is not from the public at large the pressure on this matter comes.  The Seanad took a healthier and more enlightened view on this matter.</P>

      <P>They have given a proper lead to the Dáil, and they trust the Dáil will take it.  Do not let us be told that there cannot be G.A.A. fixtures through the country, that there cannot be the ordinary functions which mark the festival, unless the public-houses are thrown open, unless people can have unlimited facilities throughout the day for the consumption of drink.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHenrikBeamish" hpid="Mr. BEAMISH Mr. BEAMISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to propose that amendments Nos. 1 and 2 be rejected by the Dáil.  It is very easy for Senators to argue on this question with their cellars full of wines and spirits and plenty of soda water.  The ordinary workman, farmer or labourer with very little money in his pocket cannot afford to order in the drink which is probably enjoyed in Senatorial houses.  It is said that it is a great shame that we should have so much drunkenness.  But the Government have practically done away with drunkenness in Ireland by the high taxation which they have imposed. Consequently we may take it for granted that a pint of porter or a glass of whiskey is about the only thing <Col N="2320" /> that a reasonably well-off worker can indulge in for the benefit of his health. We have been told that there would be great drunkenness if the houses were opened.  We maintain that there would be little or no drunkenness owing to the difficulty of procuring drink at a reasonable price.  I remember calling for a division on my amendment.  I took the risk of asking for a division and was amply rewarded.  The amendment was carried by fifty votes to thirty-two.  You may say that represented the feeling of the whole of Ireland, except 32, who had cellars from which they could help themselves.</P>
      <P>Those who represented the poor people who had no cellars were the fifty.  The Seanad say they wish to lead us in the right direction.  We cannot be over-led in the right direction.  The right direction is probably over-taxation. I do not object there.  I think it might be necessary for us to get money where we can.  In public-houses they do not even serve porter in pint pots now.  They serve it in glasses, so that the unfortunate imbiber of a glass of stout can watch it gradually fading away before his thirst is satisfied.  Intoxication is not going to result from the opening of the houses on St. Patrick's Day, but a little natural thirst is going to be pleasantly assuaged.  I feel perfectly sure that there need be no fear of intoxication amongst the poorer classes.  I plead that the fifty Deputies represent the poorer classes, and for these reasons I move the rejection of the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister are we going to have a free vote on this occasion, just as we had on the last occasion?  I hope we will, and, if so, I take it that there will be no change.  As Deputy Beamish pointed out, it is very hard after such an overwhelming majority voting in favour of opening the houses on St. Patrick's Day to have it overruled by a small number of Senators.  I believe the Seanad is composed of sixty members, out of which twelve voted to close the houses.  The Minister for Justice pointed out that some time ago the majority of the publichouses closed voluntarily on St. Patrick's Day.  On behalf <Col N="2321" /> of that majority I must say that they take it as an insult that the licensed trade must be singled out and be compelled to honour St. Patrick's Day by closing their houses, becoming respectable houses, as it were, for that day. Why not close up every other business? One would think that when a man goes into a publichouse he gets nothing but poison, and that he sees nothing but bad example.  Why not put restrictions on the tobacco shops?  Children are allowed to go into tobacco shops at any age and smoke cigarettes.</P>

      <P>The law is not enforced. It should be enforced, as the doctors say the smoking of cigarettes by children is a very dangerous practice, and that as a result they will not grow up.  It is an abominable practice.  We all know that St. Patrick's Day was a day much sought after for race meetings, football matches, and all other sports, and as the Minister for Justice pointed out a moment ago, he thinks that a big congregation of Irishmen and women coming together in any field can be all teetotallers on that day.  If they had to be teetotallers, instead of praying for St. Patrick, I know what they would be doing.  Why not single out St. Stephen's Day, with all due respect to St. Patrick?  I again repeat that the publicans resent very much the passing of a law to compel them to respect their patron saint.  Drapers, bakers, grocers, farmers going to fairs, and others are not to be disturbed. That is not fair, and for that reason I think this amendment, with all due respect to the twelve Senators&mdash;you would think they were the Twelve Apostles sent down here to tell us that we should swallow everything we said on the last occasion&mdash;is a bad one.  We want to tell the Senators, with all due respect to them, that twelve out of the whole sixty would not warrant sending that back here to us.  I happened to be in the Seanad on that particular occasion. If my memory serves me right I think I heard the Minister for Justice pointing out that there would be a Commission sitting very soon, and that they should wait until then.  Am I right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have neither seen nor heard anything that has passed that should compel the Deputies to vote in favour of these amendments.  The Dáil deleted the clause about St. Patrick's Day in the Bill.  The Seanad may have the best of intentions in proposing this amendment, but I would like to point out to the Dáil and the Seanad that it is not right for any democratic assembly to deny the facilities to one class that they give to another.  By closing the houses on St. Patrick's Day you are depriving of drink only the man who cannot afford to buy a quantity of liquor and keep it in his own house. You are encouraging men, such as the Senators, who can afford to buy large quantities, to turn their own homes into regular drinking dens on St. Patrick's Day by inviting their friends to partake of refreshment in honour of St. Patrick.  You cannot try to convert publicans into saints by having them say &ldquo;St. Patrick, we adore you, and for that purpose we close.&rdquo;  I hope every member will vote with the same open mind as when the Bill was last before the Dáil.  I see no reason why the houses should be closed on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not been proved either in the Dáil or in the Seanad that there were abuses on St. Patrick's Day owing to the publichouses being opened, and I think it is wrong to deprive one section of the community of privileges which you give to another.  I do not say that every <Col N="2323" /> workman in the Saorstát wants to have the public-houses open.  A large number would prefer to see them closed altogether, and I am one of them myself. I would welcome prohibition, but not in a half-hearted manner like this. You know prohibition is not a success in the States.  You have representations from all sections of the community that the time is not yet ripe for such a drastic measure as closing public-houses on St. Patrick's Day.  It is the only day that some people of the middle or poorer class have an opportunity of spending as a holiday, and if they go away to a town on a holiday I do not see why they should be denied the right of refreshing themselves. People with capital can keep cellars in their own houses.  I think that is not fair, and I ask the Dáil to vote against the amendment.  At the very least, I think there are 90 per cent. of the people against the amendment.  You may have people who are so weak that a publichouse acts as a magnet and attracts them into it.  Fortunately, everyone is not like that.  The amendment may have been inserted because some people abuse their privileges.  I hope a free vote will be given, as it was given some time ago, and that this amendment will be rejected even if the Seanad hold up the Bill as they held up the 1923 Bill.  I fail to see why any Deputy who voted before in favour of opening on St. Patrick's Day should now vote against it, as nothing since then has happened to change his mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to vote for these amendments sent down from the Seanad.  When the Bill was before the Dáil some time ago, I had not the opportunity of being here many times, as I was, unfortunately, ill, but I understood from the discussions I listened to that this question of St. Patrick's Day was to be decided by Sunday treatment; that is, to have the opening for two hours&mdash;from the hours of three to five on that day, as against keeping open all day.  It seems that that was not carried, and that when the Bill passed from this House to the Seanad, St. Patrick's Day ranked as an ordinary day and that the ordinary hours <Col N="2324" /> applied to it.  I think that was a mistake. I am not a teetotaller, and could not be classed as such, but I am what is called a very temperate person.  I quite recognise that the licensed trade is a legitimate trade, and that it has rights and should be treated in all fairness, but I think St. Patrick's Day is a day that should be treated in a different way from other days.</P>
      <P>Irishmen, and Irishwomen, all over the world look upon St. Patrick's Day as being for them the greatest day of the year.  It seems to me an extraordinary thing for anyone to hold the view that the only way to celebrate a religious festival is by indulgence in liquor or what is called &ldquo;drowning the shamrock.&rdquo;  That seems to me a most extraordinary thing to have in mind.  However, it seems to be there. As far as I am concerned, if a choice lies between being open all day, and closed all day on St. Patrick's Day, I venture to say that the houses should be closed all day.  For that reason, and also in view of the fact that by and by there will be a commission of inquiry into this question, and into other matters, and that if the commission considers it is an injustice they can make recommendations to have it altered, I propose to vote for these amendments as sent down from the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice in relying for support for the re-insertion of this provision in the Bill, mentioned that a number of organisations had stood over and over again for a definite temperance policy during the last five years, and he included on his list the Irish Labour organisation. Speaking from a personal connection of 18 years with that organisation I cannot find that there ever has been a formal declaration of policy in regard to this particular matter on the part of the Irish Labour Party, and the proof of that lies in the fact that so far as our members in this House are concerned we were left free to vote on every clause of this measure when it was before us, and we are in the same position to-day.  So to that extent the Minister's statement is inaccurate.  I am opposed to the re-insertion of this <Col N="2325" /> provision because I believe first of all there was never any mandate received from the country in either of the elections that have taken place since the signing of the Treaty for revolutionary legislation of this kind.  If the Party which the Minister so ably leads in the House had made up their minds that this was legislation which they as a Party were definitely committed to and if they intended, if returned by the electorate of the country as the Government of the country, to propose such legislation, then the intention of legislating in this way should have been put to the people when they were seeking their votes at the last election.  This matter was not the issue&mdash;and it is a very important issue&mdash;and it was not put before the people by any of the parties who stood at the elections for the three or four Dáils that have sat, and the Minister has no reason to assume that he has a mandate from the country to push forward legislation of this kind.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the position which this country finds itself in to-day is that when a general or a by-election takes place they are asked to vote for this, that, or the other fellow, instead of being asked to vote for this, that, or the other programme of this or that particular fellow.  It seems to me that there will be a most unfortunate mixup in this country until Parties get themselves separated and tell the people of the country that they stand for a definite and progressive policy or programme.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson takes the other view; he is, of course, as free to take his view as I am mine, and perhaps he is right in his view, and I am wrong.  When this particular provision was discussed on the last occasion, Deputy Gorey, in supporting total closing on St. Patrick's Day, referred to the brawls and the murders that used to take place on St. Patrick's Day in former times.  I should like to have from Deputy Gorey some further proof of that.  These statements should not be made without being supported by facts.  I think we are bad enough without painting the picture worse than it is.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="2326" /> If there is anything wrong with the licensing laws&mdash;and there is a good deal wrong with them&mdash;it is the failure of the administration, the failure of the Government, to watch the licensed trade, and to see that the laws in existence are administered in the way they were meant and intended to be carried out.  I listened to a most uninteresting discussion upon this and other amendments in the Seanad.  It was honoured by the presence of one-third of the nominated members and eight of the elected members.  I have looked through the list, and, strange as it may appear, find that when the vote was taken, eight members of the Seanad who voted against this and one or two other important amendments to the Bill, were elected members of the Seanad, whereas out of the twelve who voted for the re-insertion, seven were nominated and five were elected.  I ask the House to bear that in mind in voting again on this particular question. If there is anything to be counted in the power of the Seanad in regard to this particular matter it is in the fact that the elected members of the Seanad, elected by vote of this House, voted to the number of seven or eight against the re-insertion of this provision.  It is a very striking thing that in the discussion that took place in this House and the other on the Licensing Bill, the Dáil was honoured by the highest number of members attending and voting upon this Bill, whereas the Seanad had the smallest attendance it was ever known to have on any Bill.</P>
    <P>There is hardly anything to be said by any Deputy on the matter, more than to discover from Deputies who may speak here to-day, particularly those who spoke for the closing before and who have since changed their minds, any really good reason as to why they changed their minds or the votes they gave on the last occasion.  I am not subject to the influence of any people connected with the trade.  If I had any views upon the matter I would have felt it my duty to put those views before the electors when seeking their votes, but seeing that I did not even know that legislation of this kind was to be introduced, and that I did not indicate any <Col N="2327" /> particular views on the matter, I am not prepared to change the vote I gave on the last occasion, and I hope that those who voted for the deletion of this provision then will vote in the same way now, taking into consideration the small number of people who carried this in the Seanad and the very important factor that the people who voted against it, to the number of eight, were elected members of that House.</P>

      <P>I have often heard the Seanad described as a cooling chamber&mdash;perhaps sometimes not in a complimentary sense&mdash;where cool and deliberate consideration has been given to measures passed by the Dáil.  I hope that the 50 Deputies who voted against this amendment on the last occasion have given this matter cool and deliberate consideration, and I am quite sure that if they have done so they will now vote in favour of it.  Deputy Lyons said that 90 per cent of the electorate are clamouring to have the public-houses open on St. Patrick's Day.  I wonder does he really expect us to take him seriously; does he think that 90 per cent. of the women of Ireland&mdash; I leave out the men&mdash;are clamouring to get facilities for drinking for themselves and for their husbands on St. Patrick's Day, or for their men folk generally?  Deputy Beamish says he spoke on behalf of the poor.  Well, I speak on behalf of the poor also, but from a very different point of view from that which Deputy Beamish has put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the saying: &ldquo;How oft the means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done.&rdquo;  With the public-houses open on St. Patrick's Day, unfortunately we are all weak and prone to temptation, and some of the men cannot resist the temptation, and, I am sorry to say, a very small proportion of the women.  Deputy Beamish also said that the thirty-two Deputies who voted against this amendment on the last occasion had cellars of their own.  I have no cellar of my own, as one of the thirty-two; neither am I as well acquainted as Deputy Lyons, perhaps, is, with the homes of Senators.  I do not think he gave a <Col N="2328" /> true picture of what the homes of Senators would be on a St. Patrick's Day in describing them as drinking dens.</P>
    <P>No argument which has been advanced has convinced me that the publichouses should be opened on St. Patrick's Day; in fact, the arguments of those who have spoken for it have had a very opposite effect on me; they convinced me that all the houses should be kept closed.  We all know that intemperance, unfortunately, is our national vice, and I think there would be no better way that the Dáil, as representing the electors of Ireland, should record that as a mistaken idea than by having the publichouses closed on St. Patrick's Day.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion that we were debating this question I think the Dáil considered carefully everything for and against.  I do not see, because a small percentage of the other House passed this amendment any reason why we should change the view which we then held.  The majority, if not every member of the Dáil, is for temperance, but we object to many of the methods by which the Minister is trying to make the country temperate.  We believe that some of the restrictions in the Bill will be more injurious than helpful.  I had hopes that there was a possibility that the houses could be opened, let us say, from three to five, when industrial and religious processions would be over.  It would be an opportunity for two hours for those people, who are perhaps not in a position to go to the houses of friends or go to other places where they could refresh themselves if they so desired. There are numbers of working people and others who simply go to a licensed house to have a drink, and then go home.  I think that in the interests of temperance it would be infinitely better if the respectable tradesmen, working men, small farmers, and others could go and have their drink or two in that moderation which we hope this country will adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country will only go in for moderation, to my mind, by calm and careful leading, not by force, not by driving the particular vice, which unfortunately has existed for a number of years in Ireland, under the surface. <Col N="2329" /> Under the surface it will be driven by anything in the nature of coercive measures, coercive measures that will not appeal to the minds or to the hearts of the people, and that certainly will not be helpful.  I think for those of us who wish to see Ireland temperate, that is, if we mean good, it would be infinitely better for the father of a family, no matter what his calling in life might be, to meet his friends and have his drink in a hotel, licensed house, or club than to go to his own house where his little children are looking at him, and give an example to these boys and girls. That is where the demoralisation would start.</P>

      <P>What is rather new for him, but what we have been used to elsewhere, is Deputy Johnson's satirical smile.  That does not carry very far.  I am happy to say that it is new with Deputy Johnson, because, as a rule, he is candid, and he is rarely satirical.  I believe that you are not going to help the sobriety of St. Patrick's Day by helping shebeening, which is absolutely damnable in its destruction.  Speaking here before on one occasion of what I know, from those who were connected with the trade, I told the House of cases where dozens and dozens of half pints of whiskey and bottles of stout had been prepared and got out to cottages and were taken away in bags of hay, and it was all used at night in places where girls and boys were coming in, playing cards and dancing, until two and three in the morning.  I say that anything that will bring shebeening back is a crime. I speak of what I know.  I have no interest in the licensed trade.  Some suggestions have been made that certain Deputies are interested in the licensed trade, or the liquor business, or whatever name you may wish to call it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not any connection, directly or indirectly, with the trade, and I do not hold shares in distilleries or breweries.  I wish that others could say the same.  It might help a great deal. It has been suggested by Deputies that St. Patrick's Day should be observed as a holy day, not as a holiday <Col N="2330" /> except for lighter amusement, and they believe that because a man will take a drink or two on that day it is a violation of the day.  Does any Deputy suggest that the man who intends to drink on St. Patrick's Day and who cannot get into a licensed house to have a drink or two will remain without it? Are we not aware that the very intemperate class in Ireland that we want to make a small class will get drink no matter where they will have to go? They will get it under all and every condition, and if they do not get it in the licensed house they will get it elsewhere. We are unfortunately aware that illicit whiskey is distilled and the treatment of those engaged in it has not been sufficiently severe to prevent it.  Sufficient efforts have not been made, and sufficient punishment has not been introduced to deal with these people who are selling this illicit whiskey, depriving men of their senses and sending them to asylums.  This is far more the cause of evil than anything that may be consumed in a proper licensed house.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are certain houses where drinking goes on, on St. Patrick's Day, but these abuses go on on every other day as well.  When these houses are reported for keeping open after hours, why is not the law enforced?  Why has this business been allowed to continue; why are their licences not taken from them?  Of course we will be told that the law is going to regulate all these things, but the law should have prevented it in the past.  If steps were taken to prevent them from selling this very bad drink, and if the law would not allow any whiskey out of bond for at least five years, and if these people who are selling this poisonous stuff were punished, it would go a long way to stamp out the vice of intemperance.  These houses should be closed if they had anything in the nature of dangerous stuff.  I am not aware of any country where the patron saint's day is observed by an absolute closing of all licensed establishments, clubs and hotels.  I am not aware there is any such country, and I think it is a very great reflection on the people of Ireland if it is suggested that we are such an intemperate race, <Col N="2331" /> that we are a race who have such little self-control, that we cannot take a drink on this day without going to excess. People who go to excess on Patrick's Day go to excess on a good many other days just as well.</P>
    <P>We are all unfortunately aware that there is far more drink consumed on Christmas Day, when all the houses are closed, than on Patrick's Day.  We are all aware that there is practically no farmer's or labourer's cottage, as well as the homes of wealthy people, where drink is not consumed on this day.  It is only by teaching the principles of temperance in the schools in the first instance that you will make any headway.  Treat the drunkard who passes along the streets as a leper; simply treat him as he should be treated, the man who goes drunk through your streets, treat him as an outcast.  That would help far more to temperance than to close up all the houses on that day, because you believe your people are so weak and are people of such small minds that they cannot be trusted with a drink or two without bringing themselves to the level of brute beasts.  I hope Deputies will consider this matter carefully, not in a biassed way, or in favour of any class or section. What Deputy Davin says is true, that we were not returned after asking our constituents' views on this matter. It was not put before our constituents, but possibly that might be said of other legislation that may have to be introduced.</P>
    <P>It would be infinitely better if the people who sent us here to represent them were informed that certain measures were to be brought forward, and if they were in a position to give us definite instructions to represent their views on these matters.  I am absolutely convinced that any measure of repression, anything in the nature of coercion on the Irish people in this or any other matter will not go far.  I believe in appealing to them.  I believe in getting them going.  When Father Mathew started his temperance crusade he did not abuse the people.  He did not go in for repressive measures. He practically started the very movement that is the Pioneer movement <Col N="2332" /> to-day, having temperance in the schools and amongst the children. and educating the grown-up people into the necessity of having temperance in the country.  If you compel the people in the country to take refreshment or drink in their homes, you are giving a wretched example to their children, and you are doing far more injury to the children when they are being brought into contact with drink in this way than if a few hundred men in different parts of Ireland were allowed to take drink on Patrick's Day in public-houses.</P>
    <P>As I said before, those who are determined to get a drink on Patrick's Day, or any other day, will get it.  If you had all the powers and the penalties of the existing laws or any other laws they will not prevent these people from drinking.  You cannot stop them from drinking methylated spirits, even with the steps you have taken, because it will take time to hunt and to hound out the people who are engaged in that vice and the people who are making money by trading in it.  I do appeal to the Dáil, having come to a certain conclusion on a certain matter, after careful consideration, that they should not be false to what they believed was right.  As to what other Deputies may say as regards &ldquo;Patrick's Pot&rdquo; and all these things, I do not wish to associate myself with that in any sense.  I do not associate myself with anybody who says that Patrick's Day should be observed as a day of latitude on which people may debase themselves by becoming inordinately drunk.  If anybody would suggest, what some Deputies outside seemed to say, in interpreting the speeches of some Deputies in this House, that that is the view they hold I do not think they meant that that is so, and I certainly object to any such line.  I have given my views according to my conscience and my mind.  It is quite immaterial what anybody thinks of me or my views.  I did not give them on behalf of the licensed trade.  I gave them because I believe in temperance in Ireland, and I believe this is not the way to help the cause of temperance, which should be sacred to the whole of us.</P>

      <P>I had the honour of being reported in the Dáil by Deputy D'Alton as having been sarcastic because I smiled at his suggestion that it was unwise to put temptation in the way of fathers of children, to have to drink their intoxicating liquor at home, before their children on St. Patrick's Day, instead of being able to go out to the tavern for it.  I should say I would smile at any such argument being placed before the Dáil.  I think I seldom heard a more uncandid speech than Deputy D'Alton made.  He will forgive me for saying it.  To profess to be speaking on behalf of temperance and good example to children and the undesirability of allowing children to see their parents drinking at all, and that it is better that parents should be induced to go to publichouses to drink, so that these children may be placed in the way of seeing scores of people drinking in publichouses rather than seeing their fathers drinking in their own homes&mdash;all that being argued in the cause of temperance, is certainly a surprise to me.  Deputy D'Alton says, in opposition to the proposition that publichouses should be closed compulsorily on St. Patrick's Day, that more drink is consumed on Christmas Day than on St. Patrick's Day, and that the publichouses are closed on Christmas Day.  Does he ask the House to believe that he would urge that the public-houses should be closed on Christmas Day in order to reduce drinking facilities and therefore reduce the quantity of drink taken on Christmas Day or Good Friday, though he did not mention Good Friday as a day on which an excessive amount of drink is taken?  To quote Christmas Day against St. Patrick's Day and say that because publichouses are closed on Christmas Day there is more drink taken on Christmas Day and, therefore, public-houses should be left open on St. Patrick's Day, without following on and saying that the publichouses should be open on Christmas Day is uncandid. <Col N="2334" /> Does Deputy D'Alton desire that publichouses should be open on Christmas Day?  He did not move in that direction.</P>

      <P>By way of explanation and, perhaps, in answer to Deputy Johnson, I may say that the fact that publichouses were closed on Christmas Day did not mean that there was less drinking than on St. Patrick's Day. I clearly meant to convey that if you close publichouses absolutely on St. Patrick's Day, instead of opening them for one or two hours, you will not lessen the amount of drink consumed. Again I repeat that there is far less bad example shown to children going to publichouses, where they may see decent men taking a drink, than by their fathers drinking in their own homes with their friends.  I know a number of decent tradesmen who would not take a drink in their own homes lest they give a bad example to their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say to those fathers and workmen, if they are so fearful of the effect of their children seeing drink being taken, they should carry their contentions to a reasonable limit and refuse to take it at all.  If it is something to be ashamed of, and that they dare not let their children see them drinking, they should not take it, and the proposition of the Minister will encourage them in that direction.  Is there not a good deal of cant talked about this?  In the Bill it is proposed that on three days in the year public-houses should be absolutely closed, and the argument runs that the cause of true temperance, which means opportunity to drink in moderation or otherwise, will be better served by only having two days out of 365 on which the publichouses shall be compulsorily closed.  All these needs of the people, all these urgent demands which are placed before us in the cause forsooth of true temperance, are in respect of one day out of 365.  Deputy Lyons professed himself to be in favour of prohibition, but said it was not opportune. This goes one three-hundredth-and-sixty-second part of the way towards total prohibition, and it is a very little way.  Surely we can induce one <Col N="2335" /> Deputy, at any rate, who is not here, Deputy Lyons, to go the one three-hundred-and-sixty-second part of the way towards the ideal which he himself would like to attain.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this question which has not yet been touched upon, and that is the fact that it is only one of three days in the year which the persons engaged as employees in publichouses can be sure of having free.  That is a consideration that might well be touched upon and might be urged strongly as an argument in favour of the proposal of the Seanad, but I merely mention it to pass on.  I do not know whether the views of the publican interests in the Dáil are that the present law upon this matter is preferable to the law which will be contained in this Act, whether they would prefer to live for another nine months under the present law rather than take the new proposals which are embodied in this Bill.  I think I heard Deputy Daly, who professes to speak, and I am sure does speak, on behalf of the licensed trade, lamenting the present law, and I think he must welcome the proposals in the new Bill of the Minister.  I suggest for his earnest consideration that he ought to agree with the Seanad amendment, otherwise there is every probability that he will have the present law hanging round his neck for nine months at any rate.  While supporting the amendment, he may be free of the incubus of the present Act, and enter into the greater spaciousness allowed by the Bill now before us, so there is going to be a very heavy obligation upon Deputy Daly, Deputy Beamish and one or two others in the House.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that Deputy <Col N="2336" /> Daly, Deputy Beamish, and one or two others, will have to answer the very serious question that will be put by their constituents, or the bodies they profess to speak for here, if they insist on their refusal to accept the proposal of the Seanad in this matter, and if they insist that the present enactment that is oppressing them is to be held around their necks for nine months.  Theirs will be the responsibility for that to the publicans of the country, and I would urge them to think very seriously before opposing this Seanad amendment.</P>
      <P>The matter appeals to me in a rather different light.  I have followed the agitations for a good many years in favour of a total closing of public-houses on St. Patrick's Day.  I know a great deal of effort was put into that movement.  I know that a good deal of the history of the last few years of Irish development has been round about the Gaelic revival, the revival of national self-respect and national self-consciousness which developed alongside this movement, and of which this movement was a part.  I believe that to go back upon that by refusing the proposition to close publichouses on St. Patrick's Day is going to be a distinct sign of turning our backs on that great spiritual movement which ran through this country, and roused many of the finer spirits to a better appreciation of what was called for by Irish nationality in the higher sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no use saying that St. Patrick's Day had not been the occasion for a great deal of excessive drinking.  It is only hypocrisy to deny it.  It has got to the stage of the popular ballad, and popular ballads, whatever else they may be, have their sentiments usually rooted in certain facts and practices that are commonly understood and recognised, and the ballads dealing with the celebration of St. Patrick's Day almost always associated the celebration with excessive drinking.  If it is true, as Deputy D'Alton suggests, that no other country celebrates the day of its patron saint by a prohibition of intoxicating liquor, surely it would be a good thing for Ireland to strike a distinctive note in that respect.  Could <Col N="2337" /> not we say: &ldquo;Here is the day Ireland celebrates, a Christian festival, and the day which celebrates national consciousness, and we are going to use it as a day of renunciation in respect of this particular appetite, and we are going to exercise our wits and activities, and express our spirit in some other way than by taking intoxicating liquor&rdquo;?  I say that that action, that gesture, as the phrase goes nowadays, would be a sign of distinctiveness, and because other countries have not done that sort of thing is no reason why we should not strike that note.</P>
    <P>I believe that this particular movement which we are asked now to embody in the law, a popular movement having a great spiritual force behind it, and which became more or less fixed in the minds of many people in many parts of the country, should be embodied in the law and placed on statutory record&mdash;that this country is going to celebrate the day of its patron saint by abstinence from intoxicating liquor so far as the law can ensure it.  We ought to encourage by statute a movement of this kind, having, as I say, its inception in a really spiritual force connected with the national revival, by no means a puritanical movement, though if it were I should not decry it, but one having a desire to strike a new note and to save the people who had got into a somewhat degrading habit of associating St. Patrick's Day with a pagan festival.  I say that we ought to support the Seanad in this amendment, ought to support the movement that succeeded in establishing this idea in the minds of the people, and we ought to set out as far as we can, to bring into effect that St. Patrick's Day shall be celebrated in a different way from that which we are led to believe was the traditional way in which such a feast should be recognised and honoured.</P>
    <P>I hope the Dáil will support the Minister's motion, and I hope the Dáil will see that the last division on this question was a wrong one, that it was not speaking its better mind then, and that the public, particularly the public that thinks on these matters, would desire that it should have done.  Deputy Davin quite honestly, and perhaps <Col N="2338" /> through my fault to some extent, made a mistake, and I want to correct without blaming him.  He said that nothing had been decided in recent years by responsible organisations in the Labour movement in respect of a policy on intoxicating liquor and temperance questions. He asked me a question before he spoke on this matter, and I gave him from memory the best information I could, but I have since found a resolution which was passed in the year 1920 at the annual trades congress.  It was adopted unanimously, and it is to this effect: &ldquo;We deplore the increasing consumption of intoxicating beverages in Ireland, despite the increase in prices, as inevitably leading to deterioration in the national morale, while adding millions a year to the funds at the disposal of the British Government for carrying on their war against this small nation &lsquo;rightly struggling to be free.&rsquo;  We authorise the incoming national executive to co-operate in any well-considered effort towards curtailing the consumption in Ireland of intoxicants, and urge upon &lsquo;the proper authority&rsquo; the necessity for making plans for the utilisation of the distilleries and breweries for other industrial purposes (e.g., the distillation of alcohol for power production).&rdquo;</P>

I quoted the resolution to show that at any rate the Labour movement is not bound to support the views of Deputy Daly and Deputy Beamish, but rather on the contrary, that we should support every well-considered effort, as <Col N="2339" /> this is, to reduce the consumption of alcoholic liquor.</P>

      <P>After the impassioned plea we have heard from Deputy D'Alton for the opening of public-houses on St. Patrick's Day, it may surprise him to know that in very many towns the publichouses have been closed, not altogether voluntarily perhaps, but in obedience to the great wave of public opinion that came up in the country some quarter of a century ago and which was initiated by the Gaelic League.  I have heard no complaint whatever from the public who resort to those towns, or, in fact, from the publicans themselves, as to the effect of this proposal.  As far as the licensed holders whom I have spoken to are concerned, they have not expressed any opposition to the proposal against the opening of publichouses on St. Patrick's Day; they would rather welcome that, because, as they told me, it meant a holiday for themselves and their assistants.  As far as I know there is no demand whatever for the opening of publichouses on St. Patrick's Day.</P>

      <P>I am not entirely impressed by Deputy Johnson's choice of old ballads as material on which to found his argument.  I should have expected from Deputy Johnson&mdash;perhaps we may have them from the Minister&mdash; some statistics that will show us whether there is excessive drinking on St. Patrick's Day, or what are the records of drunkenness on that day as compared, say, with August Bank Holiday, Easter Monday or any other day.  That is one of the factors which nobody has yet touched upon.  I voted with Deputy Beamish on the last occasion when this matter was before the Dáil.  I am still unconvinced by the debate as far as I have heard it.  I do not agree with Deputy Johnson's proposition that the day should be a day of mortification for those of the community who are addicted to intoxicating drink.  I intensely dislike the idea of imposing upon others a restriction which I would not like imposed upon myself.  Deputy Johnson did suggest a wider issue which lies behind the amendment and <Col N="2340" /> which we must consider when discussing it.  It is not only a question of whether publichouses are to be opened on that day or not; it is a question of whether this Bill is to be hung up for nine months.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that this amendment was passed by a very small Seanad.  It is an amendment that was passed on the day previous to the day on which amendment No. 9 was considered, when only twenty Senators were present.  This amendment was passed in a fairly representative, normal Seanad and apparently it was passed with the approbation of a considerable majority.  If we disagree with the Seanad in this amendment, we have to face the prospect that the Seanad may hang up the Bill, and its operation will be postponed for nine months.  It is for every Deputy to ask himself whether or not he desires that. I find myself that it is a very hard matter to decide.  There are many provisions that I consider are in advance of public opinion and are unduly restrictive on the public.  On the other hand, there are many provisions which are valuable and useful provisions, particularly the ones dealing with illicit distillation and methylated spirit.  I confess I should be very sorry to see this measure postponed for nine months. That may happen if we reject the Seanad amendments.  We have, in our own minds, to strike a balance on this matter.  Personally I shall wait to hear the end of the debate in the hope of finding some argument that will, as far as I am concerned, put that balance one way or the other.  Let us not forget that there is a greater issue involved than the mere opening or closing of publichouses on St. Patrick's Day. There is involved the issue whether the Bill is or is not to be hung up for nine months.</P>

      <P>The debate has pretty well followed the course of the previous debate on this subject.  We have had Deputy Daly's humorous speech and Deputy Beamish's rollicking speech, and, generally, the case has been presented that this is a ridiculous proposal, an absurd proposal, a puritanical proposal, and a pure kill-joy. <Col N="2341" /> It has been suggested that the whole thing should be scouted, and that only a few demented Senators could possibly support a proposal that the public-houses should close on St. Patrick's Day.  Deputies appear to be oblivious of the fact that three or four years ago, when we had not the power, or were not in the position to make thoroughly effective the demand, the whole country was crying out for such a provision and such a measure.</P>
      <P>As I reminded Deputies, it was only the backsliding of the few that caused a breakdown, because the licensed traders themselves were well prepared to meet public opinion, and to give way, with goodwill and co-operation, on this particular point.  In a speech punctuated with the popping of corks and the clinking of glasses, Deputy D'Alton told us he was strongly in favour of temperance in Ireland, but he described this provision and the Bill in which it is embodied, as a harsh, tyrannical, coercive measure, calculated to promote shebeening and other vices of that kind. It may surprise some Deputies, and Deputy D'Alton in particular, that many individual members of the licensed trade have described this Bill to me in very different terms.  They described it as an extremely reasonable and moderate measure, every section and sub-section of which met with their approval.  I mention that to show the difference between the rabid temperance advocate and the man who is making his living by the trade.</P>

      <P>They referred to the Bill as it was in the Dáil and before it went to the Seanad.  They referred to the Bill, with the exception, certainly, of structural separation.  That was the exception.  Any licensed trader who spoke to me excepted that, and said that otherwise it was a reasonable and moderate measure.  I do not like to be putting particular arguments to the Dáil as a whole.  There are times when you wish you could speak to Deputy Beamish or Deputy Daly apart&mdash;have a word in their ear, so to speak.  I <Col N="2342" /> despair of either of those Deputies reacting to the arguments based on national sentiment or anything of that kind, and I come down then to harder stuff.  This is a question of a particular space of eight or ten hours in a year. As against that there is the prospect of this Bill being hung up for 270 days, with a loss in trade to the publican if that happens.  That would mean, at the rate of half an hour a day, 135 hours, or otherwise 10 days of 13 hours. They give away that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By a two to one majority&mdash;by 18 votes to 9, this particular amendment was inserted in the Seanad.  Now, that is a matter which Deputy Daly and others will perhaps consider.  If the Dáil were to accept one of these amendments, I might have a case for going and pleading to the Seanad for a compromise and for asking that they would give way with regard to that.  I have no hope that if both of these amendments are rejected I will be able to induce the Seanad to do other than to suspend the Bill, which will mean that the existing measure, with its 9.30 p.m. closing hour, will be in operation for nine months.  I was asked by Deputy Cooper to give statistics; to compare for him St. Patrick's Day with the August Bank Holiday, or Easter Monday.  I am not in a position to do it, but I query that that is the comparison that we ought to make.  If we are to take it that on August Bank Holiday or on Easter Monday there is an exceptional amount of abuse and an exceptional amount of <Col N="2343" /> intoxication, are we to say that it is only proper and reasonable that there should be the same exceptional amount of intoxication on St. Patrick's Day?</P>

      <P>Does he suggest that it was quite like any other day? It is just a question of the difference in viewpoint.  If we take the view that sobriety is a national virtue that we should aim at, and that, perhaps, is not at the moment a striking characteristic of our people, would it be any harm to mark our sense of that, and our appreciation of that, by signalising the national festival by the closing of public-houses? Are we to ignore entirely the effect of that on the peoples' minds, both the minds of our own people, and the minds of people who come into the country?  Is it nothing that a stranger would have to say: &ldquo;Here is a people, and the moment it regained its native institutions, it availed of its legislature and administrative powers to mark its national festival by a temperance gesture so that its people would note the effect of that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The psychological effect of that gesture would be that you would have the people striving to fit themselves for their newly-won responsibility, by striving at sobriety, by striving at self-respect, by striving after that self-control and hardness of fibre which must manifest itself, if we are to make anything of the freedom to which we have won out.  We must be indeed a soft people if we are to regard it as a tyranny, as a coercive measure, as a tremendous hardship, that we should have to spend one day, and that day the day of our national saint, without pouring stout and whiskey down our throats.  A soft people indeed!  The hardship of it!  The tyranny of it!  It reminded me of the man in the Abbey play who went around talking about his &ldquo;sufferin's&rdquo; and showing his wounds.  Look at our sufferings if for <Col N="2344" /> one eight hours out of the 365 days we have to walk past a public-house without turning in!  It will be worse than Cromwell!  Better we had been exterminated by one of the many conquering and rampaging generals who came across to us from time to time, than that we should live to see the day when we should spend a national festival without a little drop!!!  What about all the enthusiasm of four or five years ago?  Is it because we did not succeed in winning out to the fulness of our claim that we ought to bury all our ideals, all our aspirations, and all the sentiments of those days and say that we are going to go back to the pot, and that we like to revel and carouse and get drunk, and that we regard it as an unwarrantable restriction on our liberty if we are not allowed to do that on the national festival as well as on any other day.  Deputies should realise that on this matter at any rate the Seanad has shown better national sense, better national inspiration, and better wisdom than the Dáil showed when it took the last vote on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of personal explanation I would like to say, as Deputy Johnson has used my name very freely, that I closed my publichouse ever since that regulation was brought in by the Gaelic League on the matter of St. Patrick's Day.  Now, what I do complain of, and what I did complain of, is that the publicans should be compelled to close while every other business is allowed to carry on.  Every other trade of every kind is allowed to carry on.  There will be plenty of drink got on St. Patrick's Day, and I agree with Deputy D'Alton when he says that it will be got without the supervision of the Gárda, and this will be a greater danger than if it were sold in the publichouse, where the Gárda would supervise.  I do not, for the sake of these twelve hours, as the Minister for Justice has suggested, stand up here to oppose this amendment.  I am not looking for those twelve hours, nor are those I represent looking for those twelve hours.  I do suggest, however, that the people were not told at the <Col N="2345" /> general election that any measure of this kind was going to be brought in by the Government.  If the people were told that, and if some of us stood for it, we would not be here.  I hold that St. Patrick's Day should not be made an issue at any election.  Everybody should be made behave himself on St. Patrick's Day, and if people misconduct themselves it is not the publican who should be blamed for it.  I know, as a matter of fact, that the publicans do already close their houses on St. Patrick's Day.  The majority of them do.  I ask why should the publican be singled out, why should the peasants of <Col N="2346" /> Ireland, especially the young people of Ireland, be told that they are not fit to walk into a street in Ireland on St. Patrick's Day if there happens to be a publichouse in that street?  It is an insult to the Irish people.</P>

    <P>Amendment 3.&mdash;In Section 8 (1) the words &ldquo;and before it is consumed&rdquo; deleted in lines 47-48.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in this amendment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This was an amendment inserted at my request in the Seanad to meet an objection which was urged by a Senator to the Bill as it stood.  The Senator had an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of Section 8 the words: &ldquo;provided that when the in toxicating liquor is consumed before it is paid for without the consent of the licence holder he shall not be guilty of an offence under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained that the amendment could <Col N="2347" /> not be accepted, and it was withdrawn. There was a suggestion then that some such words as these should be added:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that no licence holder shall be convicted of any offence under the section if he satisfies the court that the supplying on credit took place without his privity or consent,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and I undertook to consider the matter and see what amendment could be made.  I was afraid the wording suggested would provide a form of defence to the licence holder which, in practice, would render the section nugatory.  It would be hard to get a conviction even where an offence had, in fact, been committed.  I say that the deletion of the words &ldquo;and before it is consumed&rdquo; will meet the point sufficiently, without making the section difficult of application in practice.  The section will then prescribe that the liquor must be paid for at the time at which it is supplied.  The time of supply is a sufficiently broad term to give the licence holder a fair chance of complying with the section.  If the defence is that the consumer departed without paying, it will be for him to convince the court of that.  I have no doubt that, in practice, the court will be able to form a judgment as to whether the licence holder was guilty of an offence or not.  The amendment will prevent the hardship complained of, that it would be necessary to demand payment before the consumer's glass was actually filled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to agree with the amendment, but, at the same time, the spirit in which it is moved is favourable to the publicans.  I understand that if a man walked into a publichouse, called for a drink and drank it, and walked out without paying, the publican would be guilty of an offence.  Now, the publican is put to inconvenience.  He has got to have a face of brass and say to every customer, &ldquo;Have you got the money about you: if you have not I will not supply you.&rdquo;  That is a very awkward position. Can there be any other way out of it?  Perhaps that is the only way the Minister for Justice can see out of it. <Col N="2348" /> It would be an offence, I think, if a man walked in and drank a half of whiskey without paying.  If he was thirsty he would not take very long to swallow it and walk out.  If the publican followed, and handed the man over to the police, he would be guilty of an offence, as the giving of drink on &ldquo;tick&rdquo; is against the law.  If the next door neighbour of a publican walked into a publichouse with three or four friends and called for drinks, and if the publican said to him, &ldquo;Have you the money?&rdquo;  what would be the opinion of that neighbour's friends except that he had &ldquo;bilked&rdquo; him before. An easier way out would be that if a man who went into a publichouse refused to pay, the publican should be authorised to report the matter to the police.</P>

      <P>I think so.  Is a publican supposed to find out before supplying a customer if he is going to pay or not? I think he is, or otherwise he will be brought before the court and fined £5 or something like that sum.  Two or three offences would automatically do away with the licence.  I agree that this is a step in the right direction, but I wish that the Minister would find some other solution.  Supposing a tinker went into a house, called for five or six drinks and walked out after they had been consumed, I know the payment the shopkeeper would get if he followed and asked for payment.  He would get a slap of the soldering iron.  In that way I think the publican should be compelled to praosecute any man or report to the police any man who would act in that way.  I am at a loss to find a way out of it.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the said amendment.  Deputies will remember that on the Report Stage of the Bill I undertook to have inserted in the Seanad an amendment which would leave it optional with the Minister for Justice to prescribe the size of the bottles in which intoxicating liquor might be sold.  The difficulty was in prescribing bottles for all kinds of intoxicating liquor such as those for foreign wines and so on.  An amendment was introduced by Deputy Johnson for the purpose of having stout and beer sold in specified bottles.  The section now leaves the provision in the Bill a permissive power to the Minister for Justice to prescribe the size of the bottle in the case of whatever intoxicating liquor he thinks proper.  As it stood formerly, the Bill was mandatory and would put on him the onus of prescribing <Col N="2350" /> the kind of bottle, and it went in advance of anything sought here.</P>

While the original proposition set out that there would be an obligation on the Minister to prescribe the sizes there is no obligation in the amendment, and it is left open to the Minister as to whether he will prescribe the sizes or not. As far as I am personally concerned, I would be satisfied to get an assurance from the Minister in due time, as far as he can promise after full inquiry into all the interests concerned, that there will be a size prescribed by order.  If that assurance were given I would be pleased to support the amendment, although I would like it to be made a mandatory provision of the Act.</P>

      <P>I, like Deputy Beamish, accept the amendment but would like to point out to the Minister for Justice that if he mentioned sixteen bottles to the gallon you will have a half-pint to the gallon which will be Imperial, or State measure now, and it would be much easier to determine whether the persons filling the bottles were going to cheat or be honest.  If it were decided that you were to have 12, 13 or 14 bottles to the gallon it would mean at least a loss of £1,000,000.  All the bottles in the State would have to be broken, and that would be a great hardship to some bottlers.</P>

I prefer that the Minister should be compelled to specify the sizes with regard to beer and stout bottles, because from our experience we know that the trade has gone from 12 to the gallon.

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in this amendment.  It was introduced to bring the section into conformity with the wording of Section 11, sub-section (1).  Similar words were missing from the original Section 10, and the effect of this amendment is to supply this.  It simply puts the responsibility on the licence holder if the drink is supplied regardless of who supplied it.</P>

The effect of the amendment is to omit the word &ldquo;knowingly.&rdquo;  That is, if a person sends a young person to a licensed premises for liquor he would be in a position to know the age of that <Col N="2352" /> young person, and the onus should not be put upon the prosecution of establishing actual knowledge against the defendant, who should be presumed to know.

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in this amendment.  The object of this amendment is to permit the carrying and delivering of intoxicating liquor in sealed or corked bottles by members of the licensed holder's family or apprentice, if such member of the family, or if such apprentice be a young person.  I think it is a reasonable facility to give to the licence holder, and I ask the Dáil to agree to it.</P>

      <P>Amendment 8.  The following new sub-section added at the end of Section 11:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) In this section the word &lsquo;corked&rsquo; means closed with a plug or stopper, whether it is made of cork or wood or glass or some other material; the word &lsquo;sealed&rsquo; means secured with any substance without the destruction of which the cork, plug, or stopper cannot be withdrawn.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in this amendment.  When the Bill was before the Dáil, portions, I think, of the Intoxicating Liquor (Sale to Children) Act, 1901, were repealed.  It has been thought better to embody the draft, to re-enact the whole of the Act in the present Bill, and to include the whole of the Act in the repeal Schedule.  The amendment is necessary for the purpose of improved draftsmanship.</P>

      <Col N="2353" /> Amendment 9.&mdash;Before Section 12 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  From and after the 25th day of September, 1927, it shall not be lawful to carry on any business (except the businesses hereinafter expressly authorised) in the same building as that in which the business of the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail for consumption on the premises is carried on, unless the portion of the building in which such sale of intoxicating liquor is carried on is structurally separated from and has no internal communication with any portion of the building in which any other business (except as aforesaid) is carried on.</P>
    <P>(2)  From and after the 25th day of September, 1927, the renewal of a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail for consumption on the premises may be objected to on the ground that some other business (not being one of the businesses hereinafter expressly authorised) is carried on in the same building as that in which the sale of intoxicating liquor under such licence is carried on and that the portion of the building in which such sale of intoxicating liquor is carried on is not structurally separated from or has an internal communication with the portion of the building in which the other business aforesaid is carried on.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every licence holder who shall carry on the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail for consumption on the premises in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding one pound for every day on which the offence is continued.</P>
    <P>(4)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section it shall be lawful to carry on all or any of the following businesses in the same premises or portion of a building as that in which the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail for consumption on the premises is carried on, that is to say, the sale of tobacco, matches and table waters, and the sale or supply <Col N="2354" /> of food for consumption on the premises.</P>
    <P>(5)  This section shall not apply to the sale of intoxicating liquor in any premises structurally adapted for use and bona fide exclusively used as a hotel, refreshment house, restaurant or railway refreshment room, or to any theatre, music-hall or other place of public amusement.</P>
    <P>(6)  No premises shall be included in the lists for revision under the Irish Valuation Acts merely on account of an alteration made to such premises before the 25th day of September, 1927, if such alteration has been made for the sole purpose of complying with the provisions of this section.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in this amendment.  The amendment means the re-inserting in the Bill of the clause on structural alteration.  The Seanad made certain minor alterations in the original section, inasmuch as they enlarged the time for making structural alterations to the 25th September, 1927, and they made slight verbal alterations which will be found in sub-section (6) of the new section.</P>

      <P>Would it not be better to postpone the undertaking of this proposition to the 25th September, 1927?  Why should we accept an undertaking to do it three years ahead?  We are going to cause torture for three years in the minds of those unfortunate people who have got to do these structural alterations, and when the time comes they may hardly have the money to carry out these alterations.  It means in many cases thirty or forty or fifty pounds.  Deputy Good might suggest eighty or ninety&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BEAMISH</NameTxt>
      <P>We suggest that in the country it will come to forty or fifty pounds.  We are promised, I believe, a Commission which is to make enquiries into the disadvantages of the liquor trade.  That is a reasonable thing, to my mind, and it will be supported by a great many members of the <Col N="2355" /> Dáil, including myself.  I think if we were to postpone this thing until we have the Commission, it would be a good thing.  Some of the existing licensed houses may not be acceptable to the Commission.  They may be reduced considerably in number.  Why not wait then without this threat of danger for a whole three years?  It ruins digestion for one thing.  They are to wait for three years to know whether or not they are to divide their houses. I do not see the advantage of it.  The Dáil, probably, unlike other things, is going to live for ever, and surely when the time comes in 1927, even if a month or so was lost in discussing the question, it could be discussed by the Dáil then.  Why disturb these people and bother them now?  Leave them as they are until September, 1927, and you will find probably by that time, after having three years to think about it, what is right to be done.  I think it is a curious thing to legislate for what should be done in three years' time, because undoubtedly no one of them will do it before the three years expire.  It is a useless threat, to my mind, to hold over people.  If you want to do the thing, do it, but if you do not, then, leave it over until the 25th September, 1927, when probably you will carry it with the other suggestions for improvement that the Commission may suggest.  For these reasons I feel inclined to suggest that we should drop this matter now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I think after the overwhelming majority that we had here on the last occasion when the structural alterations clause came before us that the Senate were unwise in rejecting what I described as the views of the people.  The action of the Dáil on that occasion expressed the views of the people until we go to the next election and are defeated or are sent back here again.  We have no mandate, as Deputy Davin pointed out earlier to-day, to make all these laws, because we did not tell the people we were going to make them.  I would like to point out that there is no assembly that has a lesser claim to interfere with the licensing trade than the Seanad, because during <Col N="2356" /> the last forty years men of their class, against the legitimate protests of the licensing trade that existed then, swamped the country with licences; they gave licences to almost everyone who put his hand to his hat for them.  Now they are trying to overtake and hunt down the evil that they themselves created.  They know as well as we do that there is a Commission about to be set up, but they would not have patience and wait for it.</P>
      <P>We, the publicans&mdash;I will shout it out because you all know I am a publican, and I speak for them&mdash;say there are too many publichouses in the country, but we saddle the right horse.  We say that the class that had the management and the giving away of licences for the last forty years were the cause of this. When they were giving these licences to their friends they did not say to them: &ldquo;We give them to you on condition that you are going to sell nothing else in the house except liquor.&rdquo;  They made no condition until now, and they want to victimise, for that is the word, publicans who told them that time that they had no right to give new licences. They want now to inflict restrictions upon publicans who held their licences perhaps at that time as a birthright, because the country has been flooded with licences.  The licensed traders were not the cause of that, except those who got the new licences. I think that least of all in the community the Senate should not interfere with the licensed trade.  These Senators do not come out at election times, nor do they canvas the houses, nor do they go into the publichouses, nor do they know what hardship it would be to tell a publican that he would have to make structural alterations or else give up one of the businesses that help him to make a living. There is not a publichouse in Munster that I did not go into in my time; I am known in nearly every one of them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I was never flung out of a public-house, because I never met a publican yet who was able to fling me out.  But apart from that, I did <Col N="2357" /> not deserve it.  It would be impossible where you would have a publichouse with a frontage of sixteen or seventeen feet to make two entrances.  The time is inopportune.  Let the Commission regulate this.  The publicans welcome the Commission.  We are told by some Senators that when a woman or young girl comes into a publichouse for a loaf of bread, she is tempted and might be forced to take a bottle of stout, and that because she went in to get a loaf of bread she eventually becomes a boozer.  Well, there are more boozers made over a game of Bridge than in buying bread, in the case of this sex. I take this opportunity of apologising for mentioning that there were twenty-seven at the passing of this amendment about St. Patrick's Day, but I am almost certain that there were only twenty out of a possible sixty voting on the structural clause, because I was there.  The real point at issue is that it is impossible to make the structural alteration.  The real grievance and the real cause of all the trouble is that we have too many licensed houses, which is brought about by the indiscriminate granting of licences during the last forty years.  We welcome the Commission, and we will be obedient to it, and I think that the Seanad, the Dáil, and all concerned, should await the findings of this Commission and bring in legislation on the basis of these findings. I think I pointed that out here seven or eight months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to say any more, except to inform the House that it is impossible in a great many cases for publicans to make these structural alterations, and that if you take away the grocery business from the house you might as well take the head from the body, because the living is gone.  If you take the spirit business away the grocery business is not sufficient to carry on.  In addition, at present one <Col N="2358" /> member of the publican's family is able to mind the shop, whereas with the structural alteration it will take two members to mind two shops.  That may be all right from the Labour point of view&mdash;I see that Deputy Johnson is watching me&mdash;but I speak for a number of people who have no assistants in their houses, the poorer class publicans. I tell you that if you pass this you will be inflicting hardship on the publicans, and that hardship will have been brought about by Senators granting licences indiscriminately to their friends for the last forty years, without asking them first if they were going to make structural alterations.</P>

      <P>This amendment is moved in order to ensure that any functions that may not come under the heading of &ldquo;sanitary functions&rdquo; may be transferred to the board of health, if it is considered expedient to do so.

      <P>I think it should be line 17.  I suggest that this matter is of more importance than the Minister has suggested.  The Section fixes that the duties of county councils as sanitary authorities are to be performed by the boards of health.  &ldquo;Powers and duties of the council of such county&rdquo;&mdash;I take it that that is the county council&mdash;&ldquo;as sanitary authority of such district shall, save as is otherwise provided by this Act, be exercised and performed through and by a board to be established in such county health districts and to be called the board of health.&rdquo; In the amendment it is proposed &ldquo;and such others of the powers and duties of such council in such district as the Minister shall direct&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, that the Minister may direct that all the powers of the council shall be transferred to the board of health if he wishes.  That is surely a very substantial amendment.  It means that there is to be no limit fixed to the powers that may be transferred by the Minister's order.  I think that the proposition is too wide and that the amendment should not be accepted.  It is not proper that the Minister should be able to transfer powers in this way from one authority to another, and I ask the House not to accept the amendment. The powers of the Minister are great enough, and to allow the question to be decided by him in this way, to transfer power from one authority to another, is, as I have often said, handing over to the Minister powers and authority which he ought not have.</P>

We should not even contemplate the possibility that the board of health would be handed over such a matter as lighting. Then, I think, under the amendment, without the Minister's last suggestion, it would have included roads and the committees of agriculture, but even with the suggestion that the Minister is now making it would hand over to the board of health authority power over the water supply and lighting.</P>

    <P>Amendments, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>In page 8 to insert a new sub-section before section 12 (3):</P>
      <P>(3)  a board of health shall appoint a committee for the better and more convenient regulation and management of the relief of the poor for each urban district or town under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, within its area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the section as it stands, the county board of health may appoint local or other committees.  In this amendment I seek to make it mandatory on the county board of health to appoint committees in urban districts or towns under the Towns Improvement Act, 1854.  That would include a town or urban district with a population of not less than 1,500.  It ought to be apparent to anyone that it is absolutely necessary we should have local people on committees appointed by the county board of health to deal with the administration of home assistance; otherwise there are bound to be abuses, and people who would be sadly in need of assistance might be left without it.  It is all the more necessary to appoint local people, in view of the fact that the Minister refused to accept my amendment on the Committee stage, which sought to give urban district councils direct representation on the board of health.  There is no guarantee whatever in the Bill that there should be a single representative of the urban district or a town on the county board of health.  That is altogether wrong <Col N="2366" /> when we consider that the great bulk of applications for home assistance come from people in urban districts or towns, such as the amendment is meant to cover.  You are bound to have hardships and abuses of home assistance, unless you have committees set up in the different towns composed of people who are interested in the work, committees that will know intimately the circumstances of the different applicants, and who will be able to say whether the applicant is or is not a deserving person.  I do not think there is any necessity for me to develop the argument very much further.  The principle was fairly well discussed in Committee.  It ought to be quite apparent that, if home assistance is to be administered upon a sound basis, it will be absolutely necessary to have local committees appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Morrissey has raised any new point in his argument in favour of the amendment, the subject of which was discussed through the length of forty-four columns on the Committee Stage, when an amendment of similar import was introduced by Deputy Colohan.  I cannot see how I could answer Deputy Morrissey on this occasion without repeating the arguments that I used against Deputy Colohan's amendment on that occasion.  One of these arguments was that it is not advisable to stereotype a form of committee that county boards of health can appoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree to insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may,&rdquo; and not stereotype the form of committee at all?  The section says that the county board of health may appoint local or other committees. Will the Minister agree to insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>That would stereotype the committee.  Another of the arguments I used was that the question of home help is about to be considered by a commission, and I did not wish to deal with it in this Bill at all. It is a matter that is being at present dealt with under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Bill, and it will get permanent form as soon as we <Col N="2367" /> have had an opportunity of having it considered by a commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us there were so many columns of a discussion in the Official Report on an amendment which touched upon this question of local committees.  Probably the Minister will agree with me, if he has gone through these columns, that Deputy after Deputy from all parts of the Dáil pointed out in opposition to the proposals from Deputy Colohan, that Clause 12 provided for committees, and they argued on the assumption that there would, inevitably, be local committees and particularly local committees for the supervision or control of this dispensation of home help.  That occurred on Section 12, and several endeavours were made to try to ensure that there would be local supervision, either an individual or a committee having a knowledge of the circumstances of the people who are going to receive home help or of the applicant for home help, who would have some say, either advisory or controlling, in respect of the dispensation of that assistance.  But nothing yet has been put into the Bill which ensures that any other person than an officer&mdash;the official appointed by the board of health&mdash;shall dispense home help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No other person will have anything to do with it in any locality, and under the Bill, as it stands, you are likely to be in this position, that in a town nobody resident in the neighbourhood will know anything about the condition of the people who are applying for home help, and will know nothing about their fitness or their suitability for this kind of assistance.  Only the visiting officer, the officer who is to enquire, the relieving officer as he used to be called, will have anything to say to the matter as far as the Bill is concerned. There may be, under this section, local committees appointed by the board of health.  The amendment seeks to make it an obligation that the board of health shall appoint such committees in an urban area.  I cannot understand the Deputies who argued, as they did, on the assumption that there must be committees of that kind to oversee properly, <Col N="2368" /> and assist in, the distribution of this relief.  I cannot understand any Deputy of that kind refusing to accept this amendment.  It only seeks to put into the Bill provisions which they all argued would necessarily be in operation. If there is no such provision of this kind, and the boards of health fail to appoint local committees, then, you will have a state of things which no one, I think, who has considered, sympathetically, the question of relief for the poor would contemplate with satisfaction. It is universally advocated both by those interested in the problem, from a social stand-point, and those who have studied it, scientifically, and who have been brought into contact with this kind of problem from the administrative point of view, that when you are dealing with the assistance, relief and protection of the poor, that the purely official mind is not enough. You must have the contact of persons who are able to treat the matter from some kind of knowledge, local knowledge, knowledge of the circumstances and of home conditions.  That is what this amendment seeks to ensure.  The Bill will not provide that.  The Bill leaves it open for the board of health in any country district, or in any county, to leave the matter in the hands of the official concerned.  That official may be a most generous-minded and sympathetic person.  I say nothing about that.  But, notwithstanding the individual sympathy, there ought to be some local knowledge brought to bear, and that should be insured in the Bill itself.  I hope that the Deputies will realise that aspect of the case and support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was endeavouring to pilot Clause 3 of this Bill through the Dáil he informed the Deputies who were trying to make a case to retain district councils, because of the fact that they would be a medium to help the poor, that the county board of health would appoint committees to look after the various functions of the board of health proper.  Now that he has abolished the district councils under Clause 3 of the Bill, he refuses to consider an amendment <Col N="2369" /> of this kind, an amendment which I think he will find on careful examination is absolutely necessary.  Deputy Johnson has told the Dáil that the official mind cannot deal with the situation as it is now in the various congested districts in the Saorstát.  Distress has assumed such an acute form in the various provincial towns in the Saorstát now, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been forced by reason of these circumstances to bring forward a Bill here to resurrect the dead contributions of insured contributors.</P>
      <P>It is apparent to everybody, including the Minister, that distress has assumed a form so acute that even the small committees operating in the various areas, unofficial as they may be, are hardly able to cope with the demand made upon their services to deal effectively with the payment of home help.  In Wexford, where there are practically 12,000 inhabitants, there are at present, unfortunately, five or six hundred people in receipt of home help, and were it not for the fact that two or three local people and myself attend along with the home help officer every Saturday it would be impossible for him to attempt to relieve the poor in that area.  What is true of Wexford is true of towns of only half the size, and that, I take it, is the size of the average provincial town.  It has been necessary in some towns to seek the aid of the Gárda Síochána to deal with the crowds seeking home help in order to keep some sort of order when relief is being given out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister refuses the request which the amendment makes to him, I feel that we are going to have a state of chaos in the various towns.  We are told there will be a superintendent of home help, who will manage everything. It is absolutely impossible for him, no matter how clever he is, to deal with the matter effectively.  He will not know the people who are making representations to him.  He could not be expected to know them.  It is necessary that a medium should be supplied through which the people could make representations to this superintendent. The people are going to be neglected, and it will be absolute criminal negligence <Col N="2370" /> on the part of the Minister and Government if they refuse to make it mandatory upon the board of health in the various counties to appoint committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be clear on one point in connection with this discussion.  It might be possible that a county council would exclude representatives of people residing in an urban district or town when appointing the board of health.  That would entail considerable hardship on the poor, because at present it is the members of the board of health who issue the dispensary tickets and the orders to doctors to attend the sick.  I do not believe myself that such a case would arise, but if the county council did exclude representatives of persons resident in urban areas I would like to know from the Minister what the position would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much point in what Deputy Shaw said, because the issuing of tickets is not restricted to the members of a county board of health.  The board has the right to appoint what they call wardens in the different districts.  I put it to the Deputy that it is a much greater hardship that there will be no representative from a small town or urban district to decide who is or is not entitled to home help.  I want to bring it home as clearly as I can to Deputies opposite, who may live in urban districts or may be members of urban councils, that there is nothing in the Bill to guarantee that any person living in an urban district elected to the county council shall be on the county board of health. Deputy Johnson raised the point as to the home assistance officers and officials, and the Minister stressed that very much on the last stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my experience of the working of a board of guardians, and the giving of home help, or outdoor relief, as it was called, it is the ambition of every relieving officer who wants to stand well with the board to keep outdoor relief as low as possible.  Any Deputy who has any experience of the work knows that that is the practice.  The <Col N="2371" /> fact that you have a superintendent of home help appointed is no guarantee whatever that there is not going to be abuses.  Supposing there was a relieving officer who was a corrupt official, and who had a friend to whom he wished to give outdoor relief.  He makes application to the board of health for that particular person, paints a suitable picture, and is allowed to give so much relief.</P>
    <P>When a superintendent of home help comes along he is not able to decide whether that person should or should not get outdoor relief, as the official will have the person pretty well tutored. The superintendent of home help will not be able to decide, by walking into the house of a recipient of relief, if that person is entitled to it.  I believe the system cannot work without these committees, and without people with local knowledge.  I think the Minister should come out in the open with his propositions, and let us know if it is his intention gradually to do away with the system of outdoor relief altogether.  It seems to me that that is what he is aiming at in the Bill.  It puts the administration of home assistance into the hands of people who, in most cases, have no sympathy with, and no real knowledge of, the wants of people who are looking for such assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey has gone over the same ground we went over on the last occasion.  I am quite as well aware as Deputy Morrissey is of the distress that prevails in the country. It is not confined to the urban areas by any means, and is very pronounced in rural areas, particularly in the West of Ireland, where there is a good deal more poverty than in the towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I know something about that, too.  I do not agree with Deputy Morrissey that the official is the wrong person to administer relief of this kind.  There may be exceptions, cases where the official is liable to yield to pressure of one kind or another, the same as any other human being, but, as a general rule, I say he would be far more likely to administer home help in a fair and upright manner than a person who would be amenable to all kinds of local influences.  There is no reason under the Bill why committees of this kind cannot be set up.</P>

      <P>I am extremely reluctant to insert a provision in the Bill that would make it compulsory to set up committees for dealing specifically with this one matter of home help, leaving the public health and sanitary matters altogether unprovided for.  In any case, Deputy Morrissey's amendment does not achieve the purpose he seems to believe it would achieve.  It would be quite possible under the amendment for a county board of health to set up in a town a committee consisting of four or five farmers from the opposite end of the county.  It does not specifically tie the board of health down to appointing members from the town.  In the long run, you have to trust the board of health, so that you might as well trust them in a whole-hearted manner, and not tie them up with knots that would eventually prove ineffectual.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c)  to exercise supervision over the milk supply of the area and to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure its purity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an addition to the duties of the ordinary county medical officer of health.  In addition to the somewhat general duties which are prescribed under Section 19, I am seeking to add, that he shall exercise supervision over the milk supply of the area in which he acts.  Probably the Minister will tell me that this amendment is unnecessary, and that already, under sub-head (a) of this section, the medical officer of health has those duties and powers. I think that is the case, but I am anxious to emphasise this matter, and to single it out as one of the most important duties that can fall on anyone charged with the responsibility of the health of the public.  That is why I put down this amendment.  I owe a certain apology to the Dáil.  I had hoped to support it by the opinions of eminent doctors, but circumstances over which I had no control made it impossible in the time at my disposal to obtain those.  I put down this after consultation with one or two doctors especially interested in child welfare because they thought it of considerable <Col N="2375" /> importance that the onus of discharging this duty should be laid on the shoulders of a medical officer of health.</P>
    <P>So far as the City and County of Dublin are concerned, this duty has already been discharged fairly efficiently. We read fairly frequently in the papers of the prosecutions of milk suppliers whose milk has been dirty or deficient in fats.  It may be so in Cork, I do not know, but so far as the country is concerned, we have been singularly negligent of our milk supply.  I think in the country districts where the milk comes straight from the cow, that even though there are oldish cow-houses and sometimes people who do milking with dirty hands, generally speaking, there is not much wrong. The milk comes straight from the cow and is poured into the receptacles of the children for their tea.  I think small country towns are bad, indeed, that is, towns with a population of from 2,000 to 10,000.  There is not the same antiseptic quality or the free air or exercise which you find in the actual country districts, and I think more ought to be done in the direction of inspecting and ensuring purity of milk than is done at present.  This Dáil has under consideration measures for the improvement of the quality of livestock, butter and eggs, but we have let the milk supply go.  I need hardly stress the importance of the milk supply. On it mainly depends the health of the rising generation and the rate of our infantile mortality and, therefore, I hold that while this amendment may not be a perfect one, it should be accepted because it contains a great and desirable principle.</P>

      <P>As for the Farmers' Party, the Deputy who I thought was coming in to speak on behalf of the Farmers' Party did not remain because he realised suddenly that he came from County Meath.  It is a striking illustration <Col N="2376" /> of the lack of interest in matters affecting the poor, because this does distinctly affect the poor more than the better off.  The people who are going to man county councils and boards of health are not here, not even one representative of them, to consider the question. The proposition of Deputy Cooper is one which should be supported in principle.  I think it is doubtful whether any such phrase as &ldquo;to take such steps as may be necessary to ensure its purity,&rdquo; could be embodied in a Bill with any assurance that it would be accepted perhaps by a careful supervisor.</P>
      <P>The idea of giving specific powers in this Bill in this respect, in addition to such powers as they already may have on the general law, is, I think, quite desirable.  It will draw the special attention of the medical officers of health that supervision over the milk supply is within their jurisdiction.  It is important to bear in mind that this does not merely mean supervision over the distribution of milk in towns.  It is supervision over the milk supply, and in that way would do what some of us hoped might have been done by the Dairy Produce Bill which was passed recently.  This would give the local medical officer powers to supervise the dairies, or if he already has those powers, it draws direct attention to the fact even though it is duplicating what he already knows.  He may not have those powers.  If he has not, we should give them to him, and for those reasons I support the amendment even though it should be necessary in the Seanad to amend the phraseology of it.  Perhaps even the Minister now could suggest some slight modification of the last two lines and insist on the amendment being adopted in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Cooper intimated when he introduced this amendment, I cannot see my way to accept it because it is unnecessary.  We have all the powers that this amendment would confer upon us already in present and preceding statutes.  I quite agree it would be a good thing to emphasise, so far as you can emphasise by legislation, the necessity for insisting upon pure milk&mdash;one of the most urgent matters <Col N="2377" /> before the public at the present time. But oftentimes, in trying to do good in one particular way, the only result of our efforts is, not to improve matters in that particular way, but, perhaps, to disimprove them in other ways.  In Section 19 (5) (c) I have got ample powers to deal with a situation of this kind.  The county medical officer will have other duties in regard to other matters besides milk.  He has to deal with meat inspection, and water inspection, and all matters of that kind, and the only effect of picking out one particular point of this kind and stressing it is, not to make the law any more stringent in regard to that particular point, but oftentimes to confuse it and make it less clear and specific in regard to that point, and for that reason alone I think the Deputy would be well advised to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>There is also another point, and that is, that under this Bill we will have veterinary officers appointed for each county, and at the moment it is not yet decided whether it will be the veterinary officer or the county medical officer who will be the particular official responsible for inspecting milk.  The veterinary officer will be primarily responsible for inspecting dairies and cowsheds, and things of that kind, and this is one of those border cases where we find it difficult to say who will work it.  For these reasons I would not like to be pinned down on a matter of this kind.  This would be largely only a propaganda section, and would have no binding legal effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's answer, even though he spoke as I anticipated.  I admit that the terminology of my amendment is inadequate, and I would be quite prepared to meet Deputy Johnson by withdrawing the last half of it.  I would like to meet the Minister <Col N="2378" /> by inserting the words &ldquo;in conjunction with the veterinary officer.&rdquo; I think this question needs more attention than has been directed to it.  The Minister says it is one of the most important questions before the public. Would anybody here, reading the daily Press, believe that the public mind is really agitated about the milk supply? So far as they are agitated about the milk supply, I think they are more agitated about the price than the quality of the milk.  I feel that the Minister's statement that this is only a propaganda section will only help to increase that indifference and apathy in the minds of those responsible for the administration of local bodies.  I regret it from that point of view.  I do not see that to re-assert and emphasise a principle can do harm.</P>
      <P>If the Minister asks me why I singled out milk rather than meat or water, I will tell him.  I singled out milk because milk is a matter that vitally affects the welfare of children, and it is in our dealings with children that we in this Dáil have been most negligent.  We have in the year past done very little for the children of this country.  There was a School Attendance Bill promised months ago, but that School Attendance Bill still tarries.  All our measures, useful and necessary though they have been, have done very little indeed to improve either the moral or physical condition of the children of the State, and that is why I would again urge on the Minister to reconsider his decision and if he cannot accept this amendment, to give some sort of an indication that if a more concisely worded and a more carefully considered amendment is put forward in the Seanad he will give it favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite evident from the Minister's earlier reply that he is not of any mind to do anything of the kind that Deputy Bryan Cooper suggests.  He says that the powers at present in his hands are sufficient, and that at any rate the Bill is giving power to the Minister to prescribe any other duties, which might include greater supervision of the milk supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2379" /> But the Minister may not prescribe such extra powers, and it is well, I submit, that the medical officer should have the fact directly borne in on him that he is responsible for exercising supervision over the milk supply of the area. If it is not possible to pierce the mind of the Minister by appealing on the health side, possibly if we put the case in respect of the commercial value of better supervision, we might have some success.  In the course of the discussion on the Dairy Produce Bill, suggestions were made regarding the necessity for ensuring that the dairies shall be clean and healthful and that the milk which they send to the creameries&mdash; whether it is to be made into butter, or sent away fresh, or after pasteurisation sold as whole milk&mdash;shall be clean, and that the conditions surrounding the buyers shall be healthful.</P>
    <P>The case that was made in discussion in Committee on that Bill was that the creameries and the machinery to be set up by the Minister for Agriculture would gradually introduce provisions enforcing greater cleanliness and better surroundings, and that it would be by a kind of commercial pressure, financial interest, that these better surroundings would ensue.  I think that that is too slow.  I think it is not quite sufficient.  You will always have the minority in a dairying district backward and disinclined to improve their conditions, partly from ignorance, partly from inability, and partly from stinginess.  If the medical officer of health is given specific power and our injunction that he must exercise this power, with a view to the double purpose, first, improving the health of the people, and, second, of increasing the commercial value of the butter, then something will have been achieved, and possibly the Minister might be induced, coming from a county where there is a large number of creameries, a big dairying district, on the score of commercial prosperity that would ensue from the adoption of this amendment, to accept it.  I think that the double argument, at any rate, one reinforcing the other, might be sufficient to persuade Deputies that an insertion of a <Col N="2380" /> provision of this kind is advisable and necessary for the better administration of the health services of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity to stress the point, as far as I am concerned, of the necessity of pure milk both from the standpoint of health and from the commercial point of view &mdash;why Deputy Johnson thinks that that reason appeals with special force to me I do not know.  It is not because I have any particular objection to seeing pure milk in the city or in the country that I cannot agree to accept this amendment.  The sole reason is that it does not add anything to the Bill.  The medical officer is responsible for the sanitary services and for safeguarding the health of the people.</P>

      <P>I think that is as broad as it is long.  He has the same functions with regard to the milk in the area as he has to the meat, or any other edible production in the area, and, as I say, it does not increase his powers in any way; he has got exactly the same powers.  It stresses them, and <Col N="2381" /> it would be useful from a publicity point of view, perhaps, to some extent, and would let people see that we were taking a particular interest in milk and milk production.  On the other hand, you would have to set off against that the fact that it would be a weakening influence on other functions that are, perhaps, just as necessary, dealing with meat, drugs, and other productions of that kind.  For that reason I cannot agree to accept the amendment.</P>

It was purely an official argument, and did not touch the question on human grounds, or on the grounds of health and welfare in the least.  If he had met me, recognising the imperfections of my amendment and having no illusions as to my imperfections as a draftsman, I would have met him by withdrawing it.  As it is, I am afraid I must have a division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister, although he intended, no doubt, to fulfil the promise he gave when we were discussing amendments on the Committee Stage of the Bill, has gone beyond that and introduced propositions which run distinctly contrary to the intentions of the amendments he then looked upon favourably.  The section provides: The maintenance and construction of county and main roads in the county shall be the duty of a county council.  The maintenance and construction of urban roads shall be the duty of the council of an urban district. On the Committee Stage it was sought to introduce words which would ensure that the county road, that is, the main road running through an urban district, would also be maintained by the urban district council. That was the proposition that was withdrawn on the understanding that the Minister would bring in an amendment to embody the idea on the Report Stage.  The amendment states that if the county council makes a request that all the roads in the urban district shall be constructed or maintained by the county council, the urban district council may make a similar claim in regard to the main roads, and then the Minister may by order prescribe that such shall be the control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that rather weakens than strengthens the section from the point of view of those who put forward the original amendments.  It leaves the likelihood of giving a certain point of view to the Ministry.  The county council may claim that they could do the roads in the urban district better than the urban district council itself, and that they could maintain the roads to an advantage greater than the urban district council itself.  The Minister can, by order, decide that such shall be the case and can take the power out of the hands of the urban district in regard to the maintenance and construction of all urban roads.  That is a worse proposition than the proposition in the original scheme.  I do not think the Minister intended to do that, but that is really what has been accomplished <Col N="2385" /> by the amendment that he has proposed.  I would like to hear from him whether he really intends that, and, if not, whether we might not then be able to find a form of phraseology which would secure the aim that we at least argue is desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the aspect of the question raised by Deputy Johnson, I can see visions of very extreme friction as between urban district councils and county councils.  In the Bill, as originally drafted, before a transfer of control could take place from an urban district council to a county council, there had to be agreement between the two bodies.  On the basis of that agreement you could proceed without friction, but if you leave it to the option of the county council to extinguish the control of an urban district council, by a request to the Minister, on which he acts, I see possibilities of great friction.  Of course, it is not quite clear on the question raised by Deputy Johnson whether this applies to all urban districts.  It could not possibly apply to all urban roads, because all urban roads, except main roads, pass through the urban areas, and are at present bound to be maintained by the urban district council. It is only the main roads that are maintained by the county council.  I expect that that is what is intended to continue, but whether the phraseology here is sufficiently clear on that is another matter.  At any rate, I see a considerable amount of friction ahead if this amendment is passed.  I think that the old arrangement in the Bill was much better than the proposal in this amendment, because under that arrangement you had to have agreement between the county council and the urban district council before this transfer of control could take place from the urban to the county council.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to understand how the Minister can tell us for a moment that the amendment he puts forward here would suit the requirements of the amendment put forward by my colleague, Deputy Hogan. Sub-section (2) says: &ldquo;The council of an urban district or the council of the county in which the urban district is <Col N="2386" /> situate may, with the consent of the Minister, agree.&rdquo;  That is to say, that the two councils must agree before the county council can come into the urban area to repair a road.  In the amendment proposed by the Minister the county council may make representation to the Minister with a view to going in, constructing and maintaining a road in an urban area.  To my mind that is a very undesirable state of affairs.  I do not think it is a wise thing to permit a county council to go into an urban area to construct or to maintain a trunk road or, indeed, any road in an urban area.  As Deputy McGoldrick said, it is going to lead to conflict and to chaos.  I wonder what would influence the Minister, what representations made by a county council would influence him, to permit a county council to go into an urban area to construct and maintain a road in that urban area.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Employers' Federation in a certain town wanted to bring down wages, and if it approached the Farmers' Union, which had sufficient representatives on a county council, to secure that that county council would make representations to the Minister, with a view to bringing in county council workmen, who would be paid at a lower rate of wages than workmen in an urban area, would that influence the Minister in acceding to the request of the county council?  It is not unreasonable to expect that it would.  I do not think the Minister&mdash;no matter how he stretches his imagination&mdash; can think for a moment that that amendment embodies the principle put forward in Deputy Hogan's amendment. The amendment by the Minister certainly does not please this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I was interested in, this matter when it was before the Dáil on the last occasion, and I must say that, to my mind, the amendment on the Paper now is better than the original provision in the Bill. It gives power to a county council or an urban district council to make application to the Minister.  It does not confine that power to the county council <Col N="2387" /> alone.  The urban council can make representation as well as the county council.  That being so, I am of opinion that this amendment goes a long way to meet the case put up on the last occasion. What was in the Minister's mind on the last occasion, I think, was that there were many urban districts not able to get the machinery or to maintain their roads as well as they should be maintained, having regard to the standard now required.  If that work can be done by the county council in a better manner, and if the council of the district wishes it so to be done, I think it is the proper procedure.</P>
      <P>But you must go further than that. The urban district must get a share of the expenditure for the maintenance of these main roads in the entire county. If we do not do something of this kind, the urban district will have to maintain its main roads through the urban district at its own expense.  That is a consideration which Deputies&mdash;and particularly Deputies from urban areas&mdash; should advert to.  I want to see a proportion of the money that will go to the county council for maintenance of these main roads being obtained by the urban councils for the main roads in their districts.</P>

      <P>From and after the appointed day, the maintenance of all urban roads in an urban district shall be the duty of the council of such urban district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They may then come to an agreement with the county council, if the Minister <Col N="2388" /> approves, whereby the county council will maintain or construct, not merely the main roads, but the urban roads within that town.  The amendment makes it likely in certain circumstances &mdash;which, I think, are readily conceivable&mdash;that the county council shall put in a claim to have the right to maintain and construct even the urban roads within the urban district.  And, provided the Minister approves&mdash;notwithstanding the objection of the urban council&mdash;it shall be so.  That is a most undesirable development, and certainly makes the proposed amendment much worse than the original section.</P>

      <P>I think that is sound. When you form an urban area, I take it you do not intend to provide for dual control over the services rendered in that area.  It may be that an urban council will recognise that the roads in a particular district would be administered better by a county council than by them.  There could be, then, something in the nature of an agreement with the county council, but I think it would be very wrong to allow a county council to go into an urban area, and, on any pretext, take over control of the roads.  If there were good and sufficient reason for the change, it should be advanced by the urban council rather than by the county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion which we have had shows one of the reasons why some of us have objected to divided authority in the matter of road control. Take a particular case that possibly this amendment is designed to meet.  Take half a mile of main road running through an urban district. The rest of that main road will be maintained by the county.  The half mile in the urban district will be maintained by the urban authority. <Col N="2389" /> That half mile of road is not maintained at all up to the standard of the rest of the main road maintained by the county council.  Complaints are constantly being made against this urban authority for not keeping its portion up to the standard.  The Minister complains that he has no further power under the original Act than to make representations to the local authority. Unless there is agreement between the two authorities&mdash;the county council and the urban council&mdash;as to the terms on which this road shall be maintained, the Minister has no power to act.</P>
      <P>Look at the matter from the point of view of the amendment, bearing in mind the case I have mentioned.  &ldquo;On the application of the council of an urban district, or of the council of the county in which such urban district is situate, the Minister may, by order, direct, either that the council of such county is to construct or maintain all or any of the urban roads in such urban district&rdquo;&mdash; that is where the urban district has not carried out its work properly, or, in the alternative, &ldquo;that the council of such urban district is to construct or maintain all or any of the main roads in such urban district.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That provides what is to my mind an absolute essential.  Suppose that in one case the county council is not keeping its roads up to a certain standard and a complaint is made by the urban district council, the Minister has power to act.  If, on the other hand, the urban district council does not keep its roads up to standard and complaint is made by the county council, the Minister also has power to act.  But if you had the original clause maintained, he would not have power to act except those two bodies entered into an agreement.</P>

      <P>I am not at all satisfied with this amendment.  The Minister promised to introduce an amendment to meet some views expressed regarding the control of roads by urban authorities.  To judge by what Deputy Good has said, one would think that county councillors, some of them coming from ten or fifteen miles <Col N="2390" /> outside an urban area, are more interested in the main roads passing through the towns and in keeping them in proper state or repair than the urban councillors who come from the urban districts and who are immediately concerned with the state of those roads.  It would be interesting to see how the thing would work out in practice, and to see how two sets of machinery, one belonging to the county council and the other to the urban council, and two sets of men, one under the control of the urban council and the other under that of the county council, would operate.  It would also be interesting to see when an urban authority, charged with the control of gas or electric mains, digs up these mains, how the road will afterwards be settled by the county council.  I cannot see any reason for this proposal except that suggested by Deputy Corish to the effect that as the workers in rural districts are likely to have less wages, they will possibly be used as a lever to reduce the wages of men controlled by the urban council.</P>

      <P>I regard the observations of Deputy Good as jocular. He could not possibly put forward any large percentage of cases where he would find that roads running through an urban area, in the maintenance of which every man trading in the area is interested, would be better looked after by the county council.  On the other hand, I feel that you are going against public opinion very much in this Bill in regard to many things that are being done, such as removing the district councils and so forth.  Now you propose to take, without their consent, from the urban councils the authority which they had over their main roads and to hand them over to the county councils.  I feel that you are going to have a good deal of antagonism if you have to face problems of that kind.  I think it is wrong, and I think that the original Bill, where it provided that agreement should be come to between the urban and the county councils before that could be done, is a sensible piece of draftsmanship which will meet the situation.  You should not give authority to the county councils to take <Col N="2391" /> control from the urban councils.  I think it is wrong to insist on this amendment being inserted, as it is only going to do damage and create a lot of friction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy McGoldrick had been here during the Committee Stage he would have realised, under the Bill as it stood, that originally all main roads were maintained by the county council&mdash;those that went through urban districts, as well as those through rural districts.  The original Bill gave the county council two kinds of authority over urban roads.  First of all, it gave the county council absolute authority over all main roads, even those going through important towns like Drogheda, Clonmel, Wexford, and towns of that kind.  Certain Deputies here demurred to that section as it stood originally, and said that it was unfair to insist on the county council maintaining roads in towns that might almost be considered cities, that they had splendid machinery of their own, in every way adequate to maintain those roads at a proper standard.  It was, on the other hand, agreed pretty generally that small towns are not able to maintain main roads running through them up to the same standard as main roads in rural districts, and it was accordingly decided that it would be better to have the main roads running through small towns maintained by the county council. Accordingly, we decided that there should be no change in regard to small towns, and that the county council should continue to maintain the main roads running through them, and that with regard to the large towns that there should still be power to maintain the main roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another provision in sub-section (2) which enables the county council by agreement with the urban authorities to maintain roads, other than main roads, in urban areas.  We started to draft an amendment to meet the wishes of those Deputies who objected to maintaining the main roads in large towns by the county council, and we looked at the question, and also at the section, as a whole.  We decided that we would give power to the larger <Col N="2392" /> towns of some importance to object to having the roads maintained by the county council, and that we were to be a kind of board of arbitration to decide whether they were competent to deal with these roads or not, and that in cases where we were satisfied that they were competent we would grant these powers to urban authorities.  In addition to that we also decided that as a final referee the Minister would be the best person to decide whether or not the county council would be the best authority to deal with all the roads in an urban area; I really think that there is a verbal change, a slight change, in form in the amendment, but it gives everything the Deputies desire with regard to the main roads, and makes little change with regard to other roads in the urban area.  I do not think there can be any objection to this amendment.</P>

      <P>(3) No order shall be made by the Minister under the next preceding sub-section in respect of any occupied cottage or other small dwellinghouse unless and until the Minister is satisfied that alternative accommodation, reasonably equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects is available for the occupants, and it shall be the duty of the council charged with the maintenance of the road to assist the occupants to obtain such accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Power is given to a council to raze to the ground a cottage on the corner of a road, if that cottage obstructs the view of motorists.  The amendment seeks to restrict the powers of the council in that respect until the occupier of the cottage has been provided with alternative accommodation.  It really comes to be a question as to whether the safety of road users, or rather, shall I say, the need for care and the necessity for slowing down on the part of motorists, is of greater importance than the necessity of housing a person.  I think it should appeal to the House as reasonable. <Col N="2397" /> Ordinary structures which are not habitations are not affected by the amendment, and in the case of a habitation, a cottage which is on the road, and is an obstruction, it is not right that the local authorities should remove that cottage unless some alternative accommodation is provided.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose there are very many cases throughout the country. There may be a few; there may not be any.  The fewer there are, the less obstacle this will be to the pleasure of motorists.  However few they may be, the cottagers in such houses should be protected and should not be turned out on the road to satisfy the requirements of speed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Government for giving me an opportunity of taking up the Second Reading of the Dublin Port and Docks Bill, 1924.  I tried to explain, in introducing this Bill, that it is a matter of considerable urgency in connection with the port.  It is necessary for me, on the Second Reading, to go into rather more detail as to the position <Col N="2398" /> and what led up to the condition of affairs that we find to-day.  Briefly, the Dublin Port and Docks Board was, in the first place, constituted by an Act of Parliament in 1707.  It was incorporated with the Corporation of Dublin and was empowered to erect a Ballast Office and act as Conservator of the port.  In 1786 the care of the port was transferred to a special Board called the Corporation for Preserving and Improving the Port of Dublin. This Board consisted of the Lord Mayor, the High Sheriff, seventeen persons and three Aldermen, who were named in the Act for perpetual succession.</P>
      <P>In the year 1867 an Act was passed again changing the constitution of the Board and giving representation to the Lord Mayor of Dublin, three citizens appointed by the Corporation, seven members appointed by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, seven members elected by the traders and manufacturers, and seven members by the owners of shipping.  Then we come to the Act of 1898, which again dealt with the franchise.  It is under the Act of 1898 that our difficulty arises, and, with the good-will of the Dáil, we seek to get over that difficulty now.  The Act of 1898 provided that a revision should take place in the list of electors, and that a revisor should be appointed before the 31st of October in each year. The person to appoint the revisor was named in the Bill as the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.  I ask the Dáil to recognise that it was by an Act passed here the difficulty for the Port Board was created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the Courts of Justice Act, certain functions of the Lord Chief Justice were transferred to the Chief Justice of the Saorstát.  Not all of them, however, were transferred, and one of the things left out has reference to the Port and Docks Board. As I have stated, the transferring of the functions of the Lord Chief Justice to the Chief Justice of the Saorstát was carried out under an Act of the Dáil. All the functions were not transferred. It was a deliberate act of the Dáil. When the Port and Docks Board in the ordinary way were asking the Chief Justice to appoint a revisor to deal with <Col N="2399" /> the list of electors, the Port Board became conversant of the fact that there was some difficulty in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice wrote: &ldquo;The Government decided, and it was stated in the Dáil, that it would not transfer those functions by a general omnibus section, but would leave the case to be dealt with individually, after consultation with the Corporation and the various bodies affected, so that individual views might be taken of each particular case, as to whether it was desired that the Chief Justice would possess and continue to discharge the function in question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that there could not have been any question as to the desirability of making a change in connection with the Board.  We do not meet with any difficulty as far as the Government is concerned.  Unfortunately, we are bound up with dates, first as regards the appointment of a revisor, and then as regards the election.  Owing to delay all these dates had to be altered.  The main thing aimed at in connection with this Bill is to put things in order, so that we may be able to hold our election in due course, even though there may be some little delay.  The members of the Board who should ordinarily retire next January, should be allowed to remain and assist in discharging the Board's functions during the interregnum between the time the election should have been held and the time when, with the permission of the Dáil, it will be held.</P>
    <P>On the First Reading I was asked by Deputy Corish what would be the position of the Port and Docks Board in the event of these changes not being authorised.  The position would be serious.  Out of twenty-seven members of the Board, six civic members have retired under circumstances the Dáil is already aware of.  Of the remaining members, seven who retire cannot be co-opted, because the period for which they were elected is exhausted, and the board has no power to co-opt additional members unless where vacancies occur owing to death or retirement.  They have no power to fill vacancies that occur by retirement on rotation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2400" /> That leaves fourteen members of the board who would still be available to do the ordinary work of the board.  But in our Act of 1898, and all through our Acts, the main functions of the board are governed by the necessity of having a majority of the board, and in any case there must be not less than fifteen members before they can make any change&mdash;that is to say, any rather drastic change&mdash;as a protection against any small number of the board putting into operation changes of a far-reaching nature.  To-day we are up against that provision of 15 members for there are only fourteen available members.  If we had the whole 14 we could not put into operation certain changes that we are very anxious to bring about at the present moment.  For instance, a steamer came up into the Liffey the other day.  It was a large steamer for pilgrims, and the Deputies will have noticed that a complaint was received by the Port and Docks Board as to the very high charges that were levied on this vessel, for a very short stay in the port.  The whole thing was examined in the light of what we could do, and as to whether we could make our charges more reasonable.</P>
    <P>We found that the only means we had of doing so was to make a universal order providing that all similar boats coming in to the Liffey in a similar way with passengers, that is to say passenger boats, would be treated in exactly the same way.  The necessary resolutions have been prepared. Certain notices have to be given.  Fifteen members of the board are required to put that business through, and in this particular case, in the event of our not getting any relief, it will be impossible for us to do anything in the matter until the period expires when the board can be reconstituted by having an election in 1926.  Apart from that altogether, as a matter of fact, in connection with changes on dues leviable, 15 members are also required.  I emphasise and stress the point that our difficulty is not one created by ourselves, not one created under our Acts of Parliament, but it is a difficulty created by the action of the Dáil in circumstances that I think I may claim <Col N="2401" /> throw a responsibility on the Dáil to relieve us from the difficulty in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>That can only be done, I think, by the hearty co-operation of the Dáil on all sides, because if the Deputies will agree to give me a Second Reading for this Bill to-night it is a very urgent necessity that I should ask the Dáil for leave to press the matter through in the briefest time.  The dates mentioned in this Bill will be of no use to us unless the legislation is expedited, so as to bring the dates within the period in which this Bill is going through the Dáil.  If the Bill is not through on a certain date, then, of course, all our dates are wrong.  As the matter is not of a contentious character, I ask on behalf of the Port Board, in order to meet the temporary difficulties, that the Dáil should assist us in getting over that difficulty as they have been instrumental in putting us into it.  I think Deputy Johnson, on the First Reading, was inclined to raise a question as to the constitution of the Port and Docks Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think his party has raised that question on every possible occasion.  However, I put it to him that in this case we are not dealing with the franchise, and we are not dealing with anything except purely the change of authority that is to appoint the revisor. Let us get on with the election and, even if Deputy Johnson or any other Deputies are not very enthusiastic about our constitution, I beg to submit that the Deputies will, in the not far distant future, be in a position to go into all these things as to the constitution of the Port and Docks Board, at any time when we bring up a private or amending Bill before this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This cannot be very long delayed. As far as I am concerned, I will welcome the promotion of such a Bill at the earliest possible moment.  I would be glad, personally, to get the Board in line with any national aspirations, if I may put it in that way, or, at all <Col N="2402" /> events, to put our constitution to the test of any argument that may be advanced for or against it.  I will, however, say in connection with what Deputy Johnson said on the occasion of the First Reading of the Bill, just one word.  I think he said on that occasion that a person came down with bunches of proxies at the election and handed in the proxies.  Now, the whole constitution is based on giving limited companies and partnerships a vote.  That may be right or that may be wrong. That always has been and is in operation in most of the ports so far as I know.</P>
    <P>A limited company can only vote by seal.  A limited company, when wishing to vote for a representative on the Port and Docks Board has to fix the seal of the company to a document authorising somebody to record their vote.  In the same way in partnerships, a form is provided by which the partners can nominate one or other of the partners to vote.  These are handed in on the day of the election, and are scrutinised carefully by the people in charge of the election.  I do not think they are handed in in big batches, but even then they are an expression of the wish of the combination to vote in a certain way, and it is the only way in which they can authorise an individual to do so.  Otherwise in these cases every voter must attend in person and vote.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have got a very large area, and a particular franchise which has been examined into on every occasion in which we went to Parliament for a Bill for authority.  I may say that every Bill that has been promoted by the Port and Docks Board has had to run the gauntlet of these objections.</P>
    <P>In my experience of the Port and Docks Board I have met members of the Corporation who came on that Board time and again, and over and over again with the same feelings that everything was wrong with that Port and Docks Board and that nothing was what it should be.  But in all cases that I know of where these men in connection with the Corporation sat on the Board for any reasonable time, they were eventually changed in their attitude, and in <Col N="2403" /> their appreciation of the work of the Port and Docks Board.  As far as I could I have tried to emphasise the reason why the Dáil should not ignore the fact that an election should be held in the early part of the year.  That election is important for carrying out the functions of the Board.  It is necessary for the carrying out of some functions. Even if it were not necessary, it certainly is not desirable that an important body like the Port and Docks Board should be left without a number of its members through a circumstance which arose owing to the action of this Dáil in connection with the transference of the functions of the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland to the Chief Justice of the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I should like to touch upon.  As the Minister for Finance knows, for quite twelve months we have had the desire to stabilise our finances by creating a consolidated stock to take the place of the financial method in vogue for some years&mdash;the issuing of mortgage bonds. This is an important matter and we ought to be in a position to deal with it at the earliest possible moment.  There will be considerable embarrassment if we have not got our Board.  In fact, in order to carry out the operation I do not think fourteen members of the Board would be sufficient.  Even if they could do it, I think it would be a very grave responsibility to put on such a small number of members.  In that financial operation would be included the provision of funds which, in my judgment, should run to a quarter of a million at least for the furtherance of new works required at the port.  In other words, what we have in mind and what has only been waiting for a favourable atmosphere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The atmosphere is not going to be improved by leaving us with some of our branches lopped off. The consolidation of the stock, including the mortgage bonds of the Board, should, I think, be on the basis of one <Col N="2404" /> million pounds.  That would give us money for very urgent work.  I think everyone would agree that the port of Dublin is an important asset to the State, and that works of development should be undertaken as soon as possible, so as to bring our port to a point that will meet all the demands to be placed upon it in the near future.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill seeks to substitute the Chief Justice of the Saorstát for appointing a revisor of the Board's register of electors in lieu of the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, named in Section 20 of the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1898, that is described in the Bill as the main Act.  Section 2 is to appoint a date by or before which such appointment, for the present year only, shall be made, in substitution for the 31st October mentioned in Section 20 of the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1898.  That is merely a temporary provision to get over the difficulty of the dates.  Section 3 is to fix a date in lieu of 10th November, the date mentioned in Section 21 of the Act of 1898, for the purpose only of any election to be held next year.  The election is due to be held at the beginning of each year after which the revisor usually held his sittings.  That is to put in a possible date in place of a date already fixed. Section 4 is to fix a date for the purpose only of any election to be held next year, on or before which a revision is to be completed, in substitution for the 5th December prescribed by Section 25 of the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1898.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 is consequential on above, to postpone the election which ordinarily would have been held, as provided for by Section 7 of the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1898, on the Tuesday preceding the second Thursday in January, 1925 (that is, the date on which the elections should be held) until the Tuesday preceding the second Thursday in February, 1925.  That is giving a month's extension.  Consequential on that is a section which is to continue in office until the second Thursday in February, 1925, the seven elected members of the Board who would ordinarily have retired by rotation on the second Thursday in January, <Col N="2405" /> 1925, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 (5) of the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1898.  I have tried to make the position as clear as I could, and I hope that the Dáil will give me the assistance necessary to put this useful Board in a position to carry on their functions with undiminished vigour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat has made a very reasonable and well-argued case for the Bill, and I think he deserves a good deal of sympathetic support in the line he has taken up.  Undoubtedly the Port and Docks Board have found themselves in a difficulty owing to certain, shall I say, lack of foresight or circumspection on the part of their legal advisers.  I realise that they find themselves in certain difficulties, because they desire to do work which they feel they cannot do with a number as low as fourteen.  I am prepared to assist Deputy Hewat in this matter if he will meet some of the requirements.</P>
      <P>The difficulty that the Deputy points out would arise owing to the smallness of numbers, if there is no election, might be met, for instance, if we could agree to substitutes being appointed on the Board for the civic members, who are no longer eligible to sit there, and have not attempted to sit, owing to the dissolution of the Dublin Corporation. If the civic members, as they are called in the Bill, were replaced by other civic members, that would supply the deficiency in numbers, and allow the important resolutions and financial changes that Deputy Hewat suggests to be brought into operation.  The increase of the Board by the number of Corporation members who have been superseded or abolished should fill that gap at any rate.  I think it is a pity some effort was not made by the Board, or by Deputy Hewat on behalf of the Board, to supply the deficiency which was created by the abolition of the Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a lawyer and do not pretend to read Acts of Parliament very correctly, but as I read the Act, &ldquo;six members of the Corporation, to be appointed by the Corporation, acting by the Council,&rdquo; were to act on the Board.  If the Corporation is abolished, there are no six members of the Corporation.  Therefore, they cannot act on the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think an order was issued, the Abolition Order, which put the members of the Corporation in a position to act on the Board if they wished to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, I do not pretend to be a lawyer, but it seems to me that when the Act of Parliament constituting the Board stated that the Board was to consist of, amongst others, six members of the Corporation, to be appointed by the Corporation acting by the Council, it means that there can be no alteration by order of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  If it had said that the council shall appoint six members, and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would act for the Council in such a matter, that is one thing.  The Act says the Board shall consist of six members of the Corporation, plus the elected members, etc.  These are not members of the Corporation, so that the proposition of the Deputy is that this big financial operation he foresees, and other considerable works which he deems to be necessary, shall be undertaken by the Board without the assistance of any civic members whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder will the Deputy agree to insert in this Bill a section providing for the substitution of the six civic members that have been dethroned by, say, six other members to be appointed by the Deputies of Dáil Eireann, representing the city and county of Dublin, and say the adjoining counties of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, to act for so long a time as the Corporation is not in existence, such elected members to be citizens of Dublin or the area appertaining to Dublin.  That would provide civic membership and would at least meet one of the difficulties that the Deputy says faces the Board.  There is, <Col N="2407" /> of course, the bigger question which I hope will be dealt with very quickly and very early.  As I learned in my childhood, when trying to learn to read, &ldquo;never put off until to-morrow what you can do to-day.&rdquo;  I have tried my utmost to follow that injunction whenever I thought the thing to be done was a good thing.  That is my position on this occasion.  If I could secure a general revision of the constitution of the Board in this Bill I would be glad to do it, but I can see difficulties in that respect.  It might require too long a discussion and an examination beyond my capacity.</P>
    <P>There are certain propositions which, I think, would go a long way to meet the immediate needs, and perhaps give an opportunity to the Board to show its willingness to meet what I conceive to be democratic requirements.  I do not like the electorate at all, that is to say, the powers that are given to certain elements within the electorate that elects the Board.  I think the idea of duplicate voting&mdash;and triplicate, quadruplicate and quintuple&mdash;by which certain persons may have up to six votes, and certain other persons may have up to ten votes apiece, while other persons may have only one vote, is an undesirable method of electing public bodies and I hope that some day very soon it may be altered.  I do not propose to ask the Deputy to agree to that alteration in this Bill.  I think it may require a good deal of examination and detailed consideration by experts. I think, apart from the various sections and qualifications for votes, we can, and ought, immediately in this Bill, as we are dealing with revisions, provide against any person being an elector having more than one vote. That is to say, more than one vote for each elected member.  I do not want to restrict the electorate to one vote when they are electing six or seven persons, but I think we ought to take the opportunity that now presents itself of altering the constitution of this Board, so far as the election of elected members goes.  We ought not to allow this Bill to pass in its present <Col N="2408" /> form without providing for a limitation of the number of votes that any individual may exercise.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not want to use the opportunity to press too hard a bargain, but if the Deputy will indicate his willingness to amend the present Bill in such a way as to secure the appointment of civic members in the way I suggested, and to limit the number of votes for any elector on the list to be drawn up, so that he shall have only one vote, then I would do my best to facilitate the passing of the Bill before the New Year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Deputy Johnson must know that the Bill is an emergency one, and that to attempt to amend it at this stage would make it useless.  There would be no possibility of amending the Bill in time even if the postponement of the elections could be made effective.  As regards the members of the Corporation on the Board, I may say it was the greatest possible grief to every member of the Board to lose the advice and assistance of the members of the Corporation.  I can straightaway answer for the Board that we are willing either to get this civic representation back by any means, or we would fall in with any suggestion that would enable us to fill the six vacant places.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that if such proposal was submitted and was feasible the Board would welcome it unanimously, and be very glad and willing to co-operate in giving it effect, because they recognise what a benefit it would be to the Board.  We do not look upon the Corporation members in any hostile spirit, rather do we believe that the assistance we got from them was very valuable and we positively miss in our proceedings the membership from the City Hall.  Time is the essence of this Bill.</P>

Deputy Johnson can raise that the first time the Port <Col N="2410" /> and Docks Board want any amendment of their Act.  I would, on my own account, make a promise to Deputy Johnson that as far as I am concerned within the next four or five years he would have an opportunity of raising the whole question on a Private Bill presented by the Port and Docks Board, and then anything that is defective, we would trust to the judgment of the Committee and the House to put right. Meantime I am asking now that we should be allowed to have our elections by getting this Bill through.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>That means if the Bill is to be considered on Friday it will not become law until the Seanad meets after Christmas.  In any event Deputy Hewat wants to suspend Standing Orders to take the final stages.  He has not given sufficient notice and we will have to get a certain majority of Deputies under Standing Order 123 to approve of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am relying entirely on the support of the House, and as I have explained the urgency of the matter, I had hoped that it would be treated entirely as non-contentious. I recognise that if a Deputy treats it in a hostile way it will put me in a very difficult position.  I will only have to bow to the wishes of the Dáil with the distinct understanding that if this Bill goes over the Recess we will be put in the position of facing another year without the seven members, and I would have thought that it would not be to the advantage of any party to leave us in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that it would be quite possible for Deputies <Col N="2412" /> to agree in some way to a Bill which will secure the Deputy's object in the early part of the new session, on condition that he will agree to provide means whereby civic representatives can be appointed on this Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am not out of order I would like to say to Deputy Johnson that I do not think it is quite fair to put the sins of our neighbours on to us.  As regards the civic members of the Board, it is not the wish of the Board that they should be in any way interfered with in the discharge of their duties on the Board.</P>

      <P>I would, of course, have to see the amendments, the amendments to replace the civic representatives on the Port and Docks Board.  At the moment it does not appear to me to be in order on this Bill, so that that cannot be accomplished. Deputy Hewat can make a motion to take the Bill to-morrow, or on Friday as he pleases.  If that is carried it can be taken to-morrow under the Standing Orders, but he has again to-morrow to get a certain very considerable majority to have the Standing Orders suspended in order to take further stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no alternative but to propose that the Bill be taken to-morrow and to leave it to the sense of the House to say whether I should get the facilities which I require.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Agriculture whether he is aware that the De Clifford Estate, Co. Mayo, was acquired by the Congested Districts Board over twelve years ago; that acute congestion exists in the townlands of Acres, Coolaghbawn, Facefield and Derrowel on this Estate, and if he will state what steps, if any, are being taken to stripe and divide the large grazing ranches <Col N="2306" /> and untenanted lands on this estate to relieve the acute congestion existing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that an account amounting to £24 1s. 0d. is due to Mrs. Roughneen, Railway Hotel, Kiltimagh, Co.

      <P>The only account presented by Mrs. Roughneen that can be traced in the Department of Defence is one amounting to £18 2s. 0d. in respect of the billeting of troops in October and November, 1922.  It was assessed at £11 1s. 0d. on the authorised rates, and the payment of this sum was made on the 21st July, 1923.  Mrs. Roughneen has, therefore, been asked to furnished particulars of the account mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
