      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if an application for compensation was made on behalf of Mr. Francis Doyle, Marsh Lane, New Ross, in respect of damage done to his motor car by British forces in May, 1921; if the case has yet been heard, and if he will state when payment may be expected.</P>

      <P>A claim for compensation for the commandeering of a motor car by Crown Forces on 2nd March, 1921, and for subsequent consequential loss owing to restrictions, was lodged with the Compensation (Ireland) Commission on behalf of the person named by the Deputy.</P>

In accordance with the agreement entered into between the two Governments, liability for payment of any compensation rests with the British Government, to whom the application has been referred for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>PADRAIG O hOGAIN (An Clár) for Tadhg O Murchadha,</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that many workers employed at the Blarney Woollen Mills, who were discharged from their employment on April 25th, 1924, did not receive unemployment benefit till May 14th, 1924, and whether, in view of the hardship caused by the delay in payment, he will take steps to obviate such delays in future; further, whether, in view of the fact that workers in Blarney have to travel six miles to make a claim for benefit, and that there are close on one thousand insured persons in this district, he will consider the setting up of a Branch Office in Blarney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan) (replying)</NameTxt>
      <P>Special arrangements have been in force for some years whereby workers discharged in considerable numbers from the Blarney Woollen Mills are not required to attend at the Employment <Col N="1651" /> Exchange for receiving benefit.  Under this arrangement the manager of the Employment Exchange sends an officer to the mills on the first day of unemployment, and thereafter payment is made at the mills at regular intervals.</P>
      <P>I understand that over 400 workers were discharged from employment on the 24th April last.  The procedure which I have indicated was applied; the workers received their first payment of benefit on the 14th May, and have been paid regularly since.  According to the Acts, no benefit could have been paid until the workers had been unemployed for six days.  Having regard to the large number involved, some time was occupied in authorising and computing their claims.  These operations had been completed by the 6th May; the employers were notified accordingly, but were not able to collect the workers at the mills and pay benefit earlier than the 14th May.</P>
      <P>With reference to the second part of the question, having regard to the special arrangements which can be put into operation to meet the convenience of any considerable body of unemployed workers in Blarney, who desire to claim unemployment benefit, I do not consider that there is any necessity for setting up a branch office at that centre.  Benefit is normally paid by post to any claimant who resides over six miles from the nearest local office of the Department, unless the claimant prefers, as often happens, to attend personally at the Exchange to receive benefit.</P>

      <P>I have no information in regard to the first and second part of the question, but I am looking into the matter at once.  A difficulty may have arisen through the non-receipt of funds by the West Cork County Board of Health from the County Council.  I understand that at their meeting on the 28th instant the County Council were to sign transfer orders in favour of the treasures of the County Boards for the necessary money to enable them to meet their obligations, so that the difficulty has probably been overcome by now.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the granting of leave <Col N="1655" /> with pay and ration allowance to N.C.O's and men on discharge was introduced as a temporary measure during a period when the strength of the Army was being considerably reduced and general demobilisation was in progress. The conditions at present are that recruiting is open and men are wanted in the Army.  The soldiers who are now taking their discharges are doing so on completion of service, and in practically all cases are eligible for re-enlistment.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="MINISTER FOR JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) MINISTER FOR JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER FOR JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to ask the leave of the Dáil to have printed and circulated a Bill to amend the law relating to the sale of intoxicating liquor, and the law relating to the manufacture and sale of spirits, and in connection therewith to amend the Illicit Distillation (Ireland) Act, 1831, and the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904, and for other purposes relating to the matters aforesaid.</P>
      <P>The Bill purports to deal in some degree with every reasonable reform of any considerable importance in the law relating to the sale of intoxicating liquor which does not involve the question of compensation to vested interests. The Bill is in four parts, and Part I. deals mainly with the hours of sale.  I have here a table showing the existing hours and the hours of sale proposed by the Bill.  On week days other than Saturdays the position at the moment is that in cities and towns where the population is over 5,000 the hours are from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., and elsewhere the hours are from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.  The proposal in the Bill is to arrange the hours from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. everywhere.  There will be a uniform opening hour from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. On Saturdays in cities and towns where the population is over 5,000, the opening hours are from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., and elsewhere the hours are from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.  The proposal in the Bill is to have the opening hours from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Sunday, there is no change in the existing law, which is that in Dublin, Cork Limerick and Waterford you have opening hours from 2 to 5 and elsewhere complete <Col N="1663" /> closing.  As regards Christmas Day, the present position is complete closing everywhere the whole day, and the Bill makes no change.  On Good Friday the present position is that the opening hours are from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. in cities and towns where the population is over 5,000 and from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. elsewhere.  It is proposed to make Good Friday the same as Christmas Day, that is complete closing everywhere.  At present St. Patrick's Day is the same as an ordinary week day and the proposal is to put it on the same footing as Christmas Day and Good Friday.</P>
    <P>In regard to <i>bona fide</i> traffic, under the existing laws travellers may be lawfully served by publicans at any hour upon any day of the year.  Under the Bill <i>bona fide</i> travellers may not be served at any hour on Christmas Day, Good Friday, St. Patrick's Day, or during the period from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Sundays.  The Bill further provides that no person shall be admitted to any theatre after 9.30 p.m., unless he has paid for a seat prior to that hour or is employed in the theatre. The existing hours of sale of intoxicating liquors, viz.:&mdash;from half an hour before the first performance until half an hour after the last performance remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>Power is given to a District Justice to close licensed premises in towns or villages in the interests of the preservation of public peace and order.</P>
    <P>Part II. of the Bill deals with licensing. The penalties for &ldquo;shebeening&rdquo; are increased, and the offence of &ldquo;keeping for sale,&rdquo; which is the commonest variety capable of detection, is put on the same plane as selling, and for convenience, sections in earlier Acts dealing with this offence are repealed and re-enacted in a stronger form.</P>
    <P>Sale on credit of intoxicating liquor for consumption on the premises is made an offence to be recorded on the licence of the licence holder.  Sales to young persons under the age of 18 years are prohibited.  Girls under the age of eighteen may not be barmaids.</P>
    <P>The penalty for consumption of liquor on premises licensed only for consumption off the premises are increased considerably, the punishment <Col N="1664" /> for a second offence being forfeiture of the licence.  The Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1902, which at present has to be renewed annually, is made permanent. From and after the 25th September, 1925, mixed trading in public-houses will not be lawful.  An exception is, however, made in the case of tobacco, matches, table-waters, and food for consumption on the premises.  The provision in question will not affect off-licences.  Provision is made for the compulsory recording on licences of convictions of the more serious offences against the licensing laws.  Three convictions of such offences, or in some cases less, will involve forfeiture of the licence.</P>
    <P>Part III. deals with clubs, i.e., mainly clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904.  It is provided that no club may be registered unless its rules prohibit the supply of excisable liquor during certain hours.  These prohibited hours are the same as those provided in Part I. for public-houses on ordinary week days and Saturdays.  On Sundays, Christmas Day, Good Friday, and St. Patrick's Day such liquor may be supplied only between 1 p.m. and 10 p.m.  The annual registration fee is increased to two pounds from five shillings.</P>
    <P>Restrictions are placed on the grants of certificates of registration to new clubs.  The police are given power to enter and search clubs if they suspect abuses.  Under the 1904 Act every club to secure registration must have rules on the model prescribed by the Act, except any lodge of Freemasons duly constituted under a charter or warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. This exception is removed by the repeal of the proviso to section 4 of the Act, so that in future such lodges will be on the same footing as any other kind of club.</P>
    <P>Part IV. deals with illicit distillation. Provision is made giving power to control the ingredients used for illicit distillation.  In such areas as may be prescribed purchasers of such ingredients will require police permits. Licence holders convicted of concealing, possessing, or selling illicitly distilled spirits will suffer forfeiture of their licences.  Illicit distillation is <Col N="1665" /> made an ordinary criminal offence, punishable with imprisonment.  Under the existing law, except the Public Safety (Punishment of Offences) Temporary Act, 1924, it is primarily a Revenue offence, punishable by fine. The sale of methylated spirits is controlled by Part V., and the drinking of these made an offence punishable with imprisonment.  Money penalties under the Licensing Acts and Illicit Distillation Acts are doubled.  This is merely a recognition of the depreciation of the currency since these penalties were first fixed.  I ask leave to introduce the Bill.</P>

I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter in regard to mixed trading.  I have no objection to the hours or to the penalties imposed for breaches of the Licensing Laws or other items in the Bill.  But I do object to the abolition of mixed trading in country districts, which would lead to the closing down of a great many houses in these district.</P>

      <P>I do not propose, at this stage, to enter into any advocacy of the provisions of the Bill.  I merely put them in a general way before Deputies.  The Bill has been in preparation for a very considerable time, and there has been a great deal of consultation with the interests affected, far more consultation than is normally possible in connection with legislation.  Deputies will remember that last year a Bill was brought before the Dáil dealing with this matter, and that owing to pressure of time, many of its provisions were sacrified. as ballast, in this House, and that when the Bill reached the Seanad that assembly felt that they had not, at their disposal, adequate time for the consideration of a measure so important. I would propose to take the second reading of this Bill at the end of next week.  As I say, the interests affected or, primarily and directly affected, have been consulted, and consulted very very fully over a long period.  I do not propose, at this stage, to attempt any reply to the impassioned oration of Deputy Lyons.</P>

And it was hoped that the comparatively few outstanding cases would be settled in the same way.  Unfortunately, these hopes have not been realised in all cases, and in several places the refusal of certain parties to recognise the facts of the <Col N="1668" /> situation has created a position which might, if neglected, lead to serious trouble.  In those circumstances I cannot contemplate with any equanimity the continuance of the present state of affairs during the summer and the autumn, and, despite the rather heavy programme, it has been thought proper to introduce this Bill, the main purpose of which is to enable the Dáil Eireann Court (Winding-up) Commission to deal with the uncompleted business of the Dáil Land Settlement Courts in the same way as they are dealing at present with the uncompleted business of the other Dáil Courts.

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short space that remained to me at the close of yesterday's debate I took advantage of the President's proposal to refer the whole question of Local Government to a Committee of Investigation to press upon the Executive Ministry's notice and upon the notice of the Dáil, that mixed up with this larger problem is another equally important, I will not say more important, but an exceedingly complex problem, the problem of <Col N="1669" /> the future development and administration of a larger Dublin.  I drew attention briefly to the urgency of this particular problem and the necessity of leaving out of the Bill and leaving out, therefore, from the scope of any Committee, whether a Parliamentary Special Committee or an External Committee of Inquiry, this particular problem, so as to have it dealt with by itself and without further delay by the appointment of a Special Committee. It was pointed out to me since by one of my friends in the Farmers' Party that I had made a mistake that was natural to the Dublin citizen, of thinking that Dublin is Ireland, and that all the interests of Ireland must be postponed in favour of those of Dublin.  I was reminded that there are other towns.  I am not unmindful that there are other towns, but I would beg Deputies to remember that Dublin is not a mere ordinary town, but that it is the national capital and that it occupies a position in regard to Ireland that, in many respects, no other metropolitan city, ordinarily called a capital, could possibly occupy.  It is more than the seat of the national Government.  It is also the greatest port in the Free State. It is the centre of the shipping and of the commercial life of the country.  It is the whole focus of the commercial life of the Free State, with just a few partial exceptions, and it is undoubtedly the cultural capital of the Free State.  What New York is to the United States, what Washington is to the United States, and what Boston is to the United States, all these things, Dublin is in one to the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the city requires special and peculiar consideration of its own, and that, I contend, it cannot get if this highly complex and difficult problem is to be taken up as merely an incident in what is itself a very complex and difficult problem.  I have been told that I have made a second mistake. However, I believe that the great mistake was in speaking at all, under the circumstances.  The second mistake was that I appealed to the President, and that I should have appealed to the Minister.  I have the bad habit, unfortunately of putting two and two together, and though I may be wrong, and I am not in the secrets <Col N="1670" /> of the Executive Council, and in no position even to operate as an eavesdropper and become illegitimately aware of these secrets, it must have been obvious to everyone that the proposal to substitute a Commission of Inquiry and a conditional passing of the Second Reading came as a surprise to the Minister in charge of the Bill himself. The Ministries Bill has altered the position of the External Minister. I know that the Attorney-General will exclaim that I return to a denunciation of that blot upon an otherwise perfect Constitution, the External Ministries. Under the Ministries Bill an External Minister merely does the will of the Executive Council or goes out, and consequently, in view of that, I appealed to the President.  If I were technically correct and socially wrong I apologise to the Minister for Local Government, and I amend my appeal now, and make my plea to him and to the President of the Executive Council to exclude from the operations of the Bill the County of Dublin, so that the relation of the county borough and the whole county in the future may not be prejudiced by this Inquiry.</P>
    <P>The portion of the Bill in which I am most interested, so far as I am a representative of a constituency, is that which deals with public health. Deputy Johnson declared that the praise which Deputy Sir James Craig, another University representative, gave to that section of the Bill was cheaply bought.  I cannot assent to that view because, though the reforms are not so thorough-going and complete as the medical profession perhaps had a right to expect, at any rate, in so far as they do go, they are a positive contribution to useful and needed reforms.  I mentioned two of them particularly yester day, and I need not repeat further than to give a passing reference to the creation of the County Officer of Health, making him a whole-time officer, and removing him from the very awkward position he found himself in hitherto of being in conflict with his best-paying patients if he carried out reforms in the proper spirit of the reformer.  The second is the making of it imperative to have all these Medical Acts that are in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill applied <Col N="1671" /> for the whole area of the Free State, instead of leaving it in the option of a particular local authority to apply them, like the Dogs Act, which used to be so absurdly worked that it was a crime, or at any rate a misdemeanour, to bring a dog out for a walk without a collar round its neck if you crossed the canal, whereas it was quite law-abiding and good citizenship to give the same dog the same type of walk on the other side of the canal. That kind of anomaly with regard to medical administration is removed.</P>
    <P>As regards the section dealing with roads, in my personal character and not as representing medical graduates, it seems to me that this is a very vital matter, and I agree with Deputy Johnson that the Minister has not perhaps carried out to the fullest extent what he undertook to realise, to make the trunk roads a national concern.  I took a very little, a very qualified interest in the Railways Bill; I am sufficiently a crank to regard railways as obsolescent; they are contrivances that were good enough in the Victorian period, and because they exist something has to be done with them.  But they will shortly be an anachronism, and Ireland, being an island blessed with the possession of very many great ports, could far more usefully develop a system of carrying heavy freight by sea &mdash;coastal traffic.  I should not say coastal, because when I referred to this matter with that term in the last Dáil I found myself recorded in the Official Reports of the debates as advocating the substitution of a postal service. That, of course, would be a reactionary proposal of the worst type, even if it were feasible to carry it out.  A good system of highways in conjunction with a coast-borne traffic is undoubtedly the proper thing to look to in the industrial and commercial expansion of Ireland in the future and therefore the provision of a real system of efficient highways is all-important as a factor in the development of the country.  I will not use so strong a term as absurdity, but it seems absurd that it should be left to the discretion or indiscretion of a county council to have charge of a highroad up to the more or less artificial boundaries of its bailiwick, <Col N="1672" /> and then that the same road, which is a continuous highway, should be subject to the indiscretions of the next local authorities.  I quite agree that as regards roads of convenience for a particular district the local authority ought to be, whether it is in fact or not, the right body to supervise and have control of the making and of the proper repair of these roads, but the arteries of traffic ought to be a national concern.  I am almost afraid to advocate that any further for fear that Deputy Johnson would wake up to the fact that this is advocating bureaucracy. I want, in the better sense of the word, a bureau to have charge of the roads.  I want a road fund raised by a proper system of taxation upon all that use the roads.  Anyone who is acquainted with the excellent roads of the County of Dublin will realise what terrific havoc has been made by heavy lorries continually passing over these roads, and the ordinary private motorists who use high-powered American cars, such as the Ford and the Canadian Chevrolet, pay £20 or £18 as a contribution to the upkeep of a road that they do very little damage to, and the heavy vans and the farmers' carts, with their little narrow rims and steel tyres, cut up the roadways still further once the perishing of the surface has been set going by the heavy lorries.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy who makes the interruption is well aware, the great difficulty in this country, in democratic institutions, is to bring home a sense of responsibility, and make the individual feel that this is his country, this is his government, that this is his administration, and that he has a share in it, because, if for nothing else, he is paying for it.  Let him know what he is paying for so that he may demand a proper return for his money.  I do not see why every cyclist, every user of the roads should not, in some measure, contribute.  I believe in applying it <i>ad hoc,</i> that a man should know, as in the case of the water rate in the city, for this I pay so much, for the gas-meter so much, and so on.  The upkeep and maintenance of the roads is, I think, of enormous importance.  I <Col N="1673" /> do not think the importance of it could be exaggerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That portion of the Bill dealing with superannuation has been dealt with sufficiently, from my angle of view, by Deputy Sir James Craig, when he pointed out that, as regards officers of health, the language now used is that they &ldquo;may&rdquo; be superannuated.  That is permissive, and authority is given, whereas under former Acts and, in fact, in an ideal Act it would be, no matter what the precedent would be in past Acts, an imperative &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  Old age pensions were an attempt to pension everybody who has in his life, by his work, contributed to the building up of the whole social fabric and of making the social machine go.  When a man, as in this case, withdraws from private practice and devotes himself exclusively to the public service in one direction, he is entitled to look forward to a pension, for a pension in that connection must be viewed as deferred pay.  Though I agree with Deputy Johnson as regards the road question, and agree with him, as I have always agreed, in his general denunciation of bureaucracy, when we come to the proposals for the abolition of rural district councils.  I fear I cannot follow him.  Listening to him last evening it struck me, if he will allow me to use such an expression, that he spoke as a doctrinaire democrat.  I knew <i>a priori</i> what objection the Deputy would raise to this section of the Bill.  I knew it would be on the ground of democracy, that it was interfering with the democratic ideal.  Deputy Johnson is a very severe, a very acute critic of the details of the Bill, but he enunciated certain general principles which I venture to suggest, with all respect, he proceeded to contradict, or if not wholly to contradict, to be inconsistent with.  For example, he complained of the absence of provision for specific committees, other than health committees&mdash;complained of the absence of specific directions to these committees. In other words, he wanted regulations, he wanted regimentation of the local bodies that do survive under the Bill, while at the same time he protested against regimentation altogether.  Democracy, to my mind, does not demand what Deputy Johnson is committed to, <Col N="1674" /> one man, one local authority.  That is the logical conclusion of the Deputy's argument, I submit.  In earlier years the great subject of debate was the right divine of kings to govern wrongly.  Now it is the right divine of rural councils to administer badly.  I recognise no divine rights for either rural councils or for kings.  I took to the ideal of efficiency, of honesty and of public spirit.  I am sorry to have to believe, that the educational system of this country is so radically bad that it has operated so dreadfully to the detriment of the State that there is no civic sense.</P>

      <P>Take the in strument out of the hands that are either inefficient or do not wish to operate efficiently.  Make your area of administration larger, select a better type of man for the administration, and meanwhile try to create a system of popular education that would make the people fit to bear the burden of local administration, and discharge their duties to the community efficiently and honestly.  I am a doctrinaire, perhaps, in this respect, when it comes to educational matters, but I do think that that is the root of everything, the imperfect education.  I do not say that education is a panacea for every evil, but unquestionably the one complaint, and in fact the one indictment I would make against the old regime without hesitation is that, while it was willing to spend millions of money on education, it was willing only so long as that should be unfruitful.  The legacy it has left us is an uneducated people, a people with not even a rudimentary sense of civic responsibility or civic duty.  These are not popular statements to make, I know, but this is a place <Col N="1675" /> where the truth should be told at all costs.  After all, the ideal of democracy finds its best and most effective expression under a system broadly of the character we ourselves have set up here, that is, representative government. What is required is that the people who send representatives should be willing to co-operate with them, and I think there should be sufficient mutual faith and mutual confidence between the two, that the representative should be left to advocate a measure.  I think Deputy Johnson confuses the two things, namely democracy applied to law making and the democratic system applied to administration. These are two different things. Administration is a business affair and it must be conducted on business lines.  That is why I insist upon efficiency and economy, and, after all, economy is only an element of efficiency rightly regarded, but if you will have two, efficiency and economy are the ideals.  Whether or not this obliteration of the rural district councils at one sweep&mdash;one fell swoop&mdash;is a reform can be discussed before the Special Committee to which I hope this Bill, after a second reading, will be referred. I believe in it at any rate as a temporary measure pending, as I say, the education of the people.  I had only intended to speak upon the medical portion of the Bill, but in view of the difficulties that were raised with regard to the second reading, I think after all, even at the risk of wasting valuable time, I ought to add one individual's views in praise of the general lines of the Bill, to suggest to the Dáil that it is worthy of getting a second reading, and getting that further emendation, improvement and extension of its reforming elements that will come after the second reading.</P>

      <P>I think the House has reason to complain of the way in which it has been treated by the Government in regard to this Bill.  The reform of local government is a matter which has been before the country for a considerable time.  It is necessary and urgent.  There have been many discussions in the country and promises on the part of the Government that such a reform would be initiated at an <Col N="1676" /> early date.  The Bill is produced and printed, and the Minister goes and defends the provisions of the Bill.  Later on in the discussion he points out that it is necessary that this Bill should be carried over to the Autumn Session in order to afford the country a fuller opportunity of discussing it.</P>

      <P>In any case, during his speech, when he was proposing the Second Reading, he made it quite clear that it was not what he himself would like, and what the Government would like in the whole matter of local government reform.  Later on we had a suggestion from the President that a Commission should be set up to go into the question of the special lines the reform should take, and meanwhile he asks for the conditional Second Reading of the Bill.  I do not know what I am to understand by a conditional Second Reading of the Bill, but I would like to point this out.  This Bill has been introduced, and we are asked to give it a Second Reading.  It consists of five parts, and the first part deals with the abolition of rural district councils, a matter in which the Minister will admit there is very grave controversy, and a matter which will be discussed and considered by this Special Commission if it is set up. Meanwhile he asks us to give the Bill a Second Reading&mdash;in other words, to commit the House to the principle of the abolition of rural councils.  I want to know in what position the Minister or the House will be, supposing this Commission recommends that the district councils should not be abolished. What will be the position then?  The House will be committed to abolish the district councils if it takes a decision on the Second Reading of this.  Perhaps the Report of the Commission will be turned down, as other Reports of Commissions were turned down when they did not report what those in charge thought they had a right to report. A suggestion was made that one of the conditions on which a Second <Col N="1677" /> Reading would be given was that the county council elections would be held. The rural council elections would be postponed, and also the Corporation elections.  No reasons were given for the postponement of the Corporation or City of Dublin elections.  Surely if there is any place in which an election should be held immediately, it is the City of Dublin, but then the election of district councils will not take place for some time, and I believe that under the Temporary Provisions Act, the Minister has power himself to dissolve rural district councils.  I speak subject to correction, but if this Bill gets a Second Reading he will be entitled to say he has got the approval of the Dáil for the abolition of rural district councils.</P>
      <P>I would like to know if he is prepared to give an undertaking, as one of the conditions for a conditional Second Reading, that such action would not be taken.  On the whole I think the Government have, with regard to this Bill, treated us rather badly.  If the Minister, on the introduction of the Motion yesterday, told us that while he wished to have a discussion on the Bill that he had put before us, and the general principles of it, that he did not wish to commit the House at that stage to deciding one way or the other on those principles, then it would have been quite fair. Now on the Bill itself I do not wish to say much except with regard to one particular part of it&mdash;that is Part 2 (Public Health).  It arises out of what Deputy Sir James Craig said in the course of his speech.  I want to know exactly what is the position at the present moment under this Bill with regard to the medical treatment and inspection of school children.  I understand that at the present moment there is on the Statute Book an Act of Parliament providing for the medical treatment and inspection of school children.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is enforced, this is the first I have heard of it.  I think I should know something about it.  The Act makes it mandatory on every county council in Ireland to produce <Col N="1678" /> a scheme for the medical inspection of school children.  I would like to know how many county councils have acted on that mandate, and what action the Minister has taken to see that they so act, and whether it is the intention of the Minister to allow that Act to operate.  The Minister, in the early part of his speech yesterday, said that the application of those Acts was illusory.  I am anxious to know what exactly is the position with regard to that Act, whether this measure interferes with it in any way, or whether it is an Act which is to operate independently. If that is the case, is there any reason why it has not been put into operation up to the present?  I understood from the former Minister for Local Government, when this matter was raised a considerable time ago, that they did not intend to put the Medical Treatment of School Children Act into operation, but rather that they were waiting for the reform of Public Health, and a special measure regarding Public Health which it was intended to introduce.  I was, therefore, very much surprised when I got this Bill to find that there had been no reference whatever to the medical inspection of school children. I do not think it is necessary for me to stress the importance of this matter in the way of preventive treatment, but I will only say this, that it is a matter that has been absolutely neglected in this country.  I think that a lot of the evils at present in the matter of health are due to the fact that this question of the inspection and treatment of school children has been so neglected. It is a thing in all other countries that is done as a matter of course.  I do urge upon the Government to put into operation the powers they have at present, as I believe unless they are interfered with by this Act, and I do not see how they are, they should be put into operation at the earliest possible opportunity.  There is another matter I would like to draw attention to in connection with this matter of sanitation, and I think it would be almost necessary that official reference should be made to it in this measure, and that is the matter of the sanitation of schools.  Anyone who knows our <Col N="1679" /> schools, especially the rural schools&mdash; the same might apply to city schools in another direction&mdash;can see that the majority of them are not up to the standard of sanitation they should attain. It seems to be a matter that gives nobody any great concern, and still we should remember that the children of the country spend a great portion of their lives in those schools, with bad results to the health of the future citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would give the Minister credit for recognising that there is absolute necessity for local government reform, but I cannot agree that we have a sound basis for reform in the present Bill.  The Minister's own argument was, perhaps, in one way, clever.  He argued in favour of the reforms, and he ultimately arrived at the stage when we discovered that the district councils were to be abolished.  The Bill, as it is issued, starts off by saying that the district councils shall be abolished.  The Minister wound up by abolishing them, having pointed out the remedies that he proposed to introduce for the present defective system of local government.  He did not tell us that the abolition of the district councils was one of the principles of the Bill on which he stood.  I do not know whether he intended us to infer that that is something that must be, if the Bill is to be at all.  If it is the intention of the Ministry that the district councils shall be abolished, and that the county councils are, to a great extent, to discharge the work that the district councils formerly had to do, I question if this work can be done in a much better or more improved fashion.  After all, members of the county councils admit that they have more to do than they are capable of performing in the time at their disposal, if they are to do the work efficiently.  This Bill will pile on them an additional amount of work. We have to look to the same type of individual to transact the business of our county councils as formerly performed the duties of the district councils. I cannot see that the Minister can fairly argue that if the district councils have failed, that the county councils are going to do their work ever so much <Col N="1680" /> better, and, because of that, say that the district councils must be abolished.  With that I cannot agree. The failure there has been in district councils also exists at present in the county councils, and will exist in the new county councils, because you have only the same type of humanity to draw upon to compose those county councils as have composed county councils and district councils up to the present. I cannot see that you can hope for very much improvement.  There have been complaints, and very well-grounded complaints, against the way the business of the county councils has been transacted in the last three or four years, just as there have been complaints about the way our district councils managed their affairs.  I am inclined to the view that it is largely because of what the Minister might term the maladministration of our district councils in the last three or four years that he has decided they must be abolished.  The work either of county councils or district councils cannot be fairly judged on the record of the past three or four years.  The capacity of the people to manage local affairs cannot be judged by the standard of the last three or four years.  That is not a fair basis or a sound basis to start off from.  If that is the basis on which this Bill is constructed, it is not constructed on firm ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county councils are to be enlarged and the district councils are to be abolished, and we are to have men coming forty or fifty or nearly one hundred miles, perhaps, from the extreme ends of counties to one centre to transact the business of the county. All the time we have the poor people in the remote districts absolutely cut off from all touch or contact with Local Government.  Deputy Magennis, a few moments ago, tried to make us believe that we are incapable of managing local affairs, because of the lack of educational facilities afforded us in the past.  He is not inclined to the view that we can be given even a chance to learn how to administer local affairs. The opportunity of doing that is to be taken away.  I do not know if he means that the people in the country are to be taken up to the universities, there study how local affairs are to be managed <Col N="1681" /> and come back to the country to try and apply the theory taught them. I can assure him that local affairs will not be managed successfully by methods like this, and I do suggest that it would be a better and sounder principle if we were to be taught how to manage local affairs by having local centres where our people would learn&mdash; learn perhaps by making mistakes, by having to pay for their education. And remember they have been taught a lesson during the last three or four years.  We must agree that, perhaps, the best type of men&mdash;the best type of business men&mdash;were not in charge of local administration during the past three or four years.  But we have passed through a revolutionary period, and the ratepayers have been taught a lesson.  They will take steps to see that they will be more fairly and more intelligently represented next time, and I do suggest that it would be a sounder principle to give them another chance. The work of the past three or four years cannot be accepted as a proper standard upon which to judge the ability of our local administrators. Give the electors another chance.  Give these people whom they may elect a chance, and see how local affairs will be administered.  If then, in calmer days, when things are in a more settled and stable condition, we cannot manage our affairs either economically or efficiently, everybody in the country will want a change.  But the people are not satisfied that the step now proposed is the best that can be taken towards making local administration efficient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Johnson has made reference to the fact, and I agree with him, that there is no suggestion in the Bill that we can have even a parish committee. One, two or three county councillors, coming in from a distance of 60 or 80 miles, are to attend to the needs and cares of the people of a huge rural area, very unlike the area that the Dublin municipal council has to deal with, and very unlike the area in which Deputy Magennis lives.  The fact that our people in rural areas have this inconvenience is all the more reason why we must carefully consider what suggestions we can support, and what changes we will bring about before we <Col N="1682" /> make changes that will only be experimental, and that is all this Bill can really be said to be.  As regards the administration of the roads, the Minister tried to convince us that their upkeep ought to be a national concern; but it is going to be a local concern as regards paying for the upkeep.  I think the Minister was correct in his view that the upkeep of the roads is a national concern.  It is the concern of the nation that the roads should be properly kept.  They are every day becoming more and more important in the life and progress of the nation, but while we are supposed to believe that it is the concern of the nation that the roads are to be maintained in an up-to-date manner, and made capable of bearing the heavy traffic of the time, people in the remote rural districts are, according to this Bill, to be taxed to pay for the upkeep of these roads that are being used by people in towns and cities, and by many people who are paying very little taxation at all.  That is a principle the agricultural community certainly cannot accept.  Formerly, we had district rating for roads, and each district raised its own rate for the maintenance of the roads in its own district.  Under this Bill we will have small farmers, living away in mountainous districts, paying for the upkeep of main or trunk roads one hundred miles away from their own homes, roads which they will never use. They may be used by some section of the people, but by people of other counties to a far greater extent, and the cost of the upkeep of these roads is coming out of their pockets.</P>
    <P>That cannot by any stretch of imagination be said to be fair or just, and it is not fair, just or equitable.  If the Minister for Local Government, who introduced this measure of local reform, thinks the rural inhabitants are prepared to accept that principle he is making a mistake.  Looking at the Bill to see whether it will bring us efficiency and economy, I must say that I cannot see that it will.  I will bow to the superior knowledge of Deputy Sir J. Craig and others, and accept the portion of the Bill that deals with public health, but from my point of view, so-far as the ratepayers are concerned, that portion of the Bill is going <Col N="1683" /> to mean a much heavier tax on us than formerly.  I will admit that I cannot see that one County Officer of Health can be kept at anything like the same salary the duties were formerly discharged for.  No stress is being laid on that point.  I would like to know from the Minister for Local Government how much more this section of the Bill, dealing with the administration of public health, is going to cost us than it did formerly.  I admit much needed improvements are required.  I would also like to know what they are going to cost us.  I must say that I think this is going to cost us much more than can at the moment be appreciated.  It comes down to this: the county councils are to be made practically responsible for all administration in their counties under the authority of the Minister and with the Minister exercising the veto in many things, but the people in the country have to pay for all this.  We will accept it that there is need for tightening up local administration. There is need for changes in many respects, but we have to consider when making changes whether they are as wide in their scope as they ought to be, and whether they are going as far in altering the administration as it is possible to go in order to make the changes effective and welcome, and at the same time whether these proposed changes are not going to cost the ratepayers an extravagant amount.  To me it seems there are going to be changes, but they are not going to be changes in effecting greater economy.  The Bill, from my point of view, will put on the ratepayers of the county a much heavier burden of taxation than they have been called on to pay up to the present.  As far as I can see, the proposed alterations in the Bill do not point to possibilities of greater efficiency, and I do not think that the amount we will be called on to spend will bring any return in efficiency, and give us value for the money.</P>

When I referred to public education I meant primary education, and not University education.  What I advocated was a better village school, and not the bringing up of the villager to a University.  What I advocated was education in a peculiar and narrow sense, if you like, but an education of the most vital importance and necessity &mdash;training in citizenship.  I want the rural dweller to have some idea of community with his fellow-men, and not to be individualistic, but to have honesty, to have public spirit, to know that if he took on the duty of a rural councillor, or any similar duty, that it was a duty for the proper discharge of which he was responsible to his fellow-men.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Baxter, I recognise the need for reform in local government in Ireland, and I think anybody who has had any first-hand experience of the working of local government in the country must be of the same opinion.  The Government, after all, are faced by one very definite fact, and that is that local administration in many cases is extravagant, inefficient and largely irresponsible.  That is the position which confronts them, and that is the position that they must deal with. No Government could possibly allow such a state of affairs to continue without making a serious effort to counteract it; and I venture to think that, although we have a multiplicity of Bills before us in the immediate future, there are very few Bills of greater importance or which affect the definite welfare of a greater number of people than the particular Bill before us now. Whether you look upon it from the point of view of public health or from the point of view of the urgent necessity of creating a healthy civic spirit in the country, it is equally important in every respect.</P>

      <P>Now, one of the very painful and visible indications of the mal-administration of local bodies is <Col N="1685" /> one which has been referred to on more than one occasion in my hearing by the Deputies on the farmers' benches.  I refer to the tremendously high rates which obtain in certain districts. These rates are directly the result of downright inefficiency and irresponsibility. They are the result of the lack of civic spirit which characterised a number of the people who are elected to these boards at the present time; and the mere fact that in some counties you have a high state of efficiency and a relatively high rate, and that in other and fewer counties you have a relatively low rate shows that the whole scheme of Local Government wants revision, and shows the necessity for some controlling check, even though one has for a while at any rate to appear to subscribe to what is something contrary to real doctrinaire democratic ideals.  In my opinion, although Deputy Johnson very ably and very forcibly expressed his notion of democratic government, I think that at the present time one of the functions of any Government, having regard to what we have gone through, having regard to the history of the country for several hundred years, and having regard to the lack of some of the essential qualities which make for good local government and which long-established governments and countries and administrations like those of England have&mdash;I say that one of the first functions of any government in the present state of Ireland is to take steps to exercise wholesome checks over the local administration of affairs in order that by doing so they may by degrees bring home to the people an appreciation of their civic responsibilities and guide them and train them in the successful management of their own local affairs.</P>

      <P>This is a perfectly logical and intelligible point of view.

      <P>Of course you can dispute between yourselves as to the authorship of it, but in any case I do suggest that it is a rather dangerous doctrine to dwell on too long, because the ordinary man in the street listening to Deputy Johnson, would, as I did, come to the conclusion that his idea was that the local bodies throughout the length and breadth of Ireland should be allowed to do wrong as long as and as far as they wished, uncontrolled, in order to give full expression to doctrinaire democratic ideals.  That is not my idea of handling the situation.  Although Deputy Johnson paid a great tribute to democratic ideals, and declaimed at considerable length against the centralisation of Government, I am glad to say that I am with him in one particular Department of centralisation that he refers to.  He referred to, and I think he recommended, the setting up of a national Road Authority. Well, now, I am in thorough agreement with him on that, and if I may say so, with great respect to the Minister, I think that is one of the serious defects and wants of the Bill.  I do not know whether people thoroughly realise the tremendous importance of having an excellent system of main roads in this country.  I go a very long way towards agreeing with Deputy Magennis when he says that railways are now in an obsolescent stage.  I do not go the whole way with him in that.  I believe there will always be a use for railways in Ireland, but I think, where we have such wonderful potential assets, at any rate in the way of tourist traffic, that it would pay this Government to spend a considerable sum of money in creating a really good main road system throughout the length and breadth of Ireland&mdash;a system which will attract tourist traffic, and is sufficiently strong to carry heavy commercial vehicles as well as tourist traffic. And in that connection I may mention that I happen to be a member of a committee who have been giving considerable attention to this particular <Col N="1687" /> matter, and we have had the benefit of the advice of an expert American road maker; and he has pointed out to us that water macadam roads are absolutely inefficient, that tar macadam roads are very little better, and that the real solution of the problem of roads lies in the making of concrete roads.  It may appear at first sight to be a very daring statement, but the expert has pointed it out to us, and he has given us definite figures in support of his views.  He has told us that the United States have 22,000 miles of concrete roads; and the inhabitants of the United States of America cannot by any manner of means be characterised as fools or bad businessmen.  They take a big view, they are up to date in their ideas, and they know where they are going.  And although such a scheme of roads would, in the first instance, necessitate a very considerable outlay, it is pointed out, and it is beyond all question, that in the long run the cost of these roads per mile per annum would be undoubtedly cheaper than the cost of roads made of tar, macadam, or any other known system.  I simply refer to that in passing, because I would really like to focus the attention of the Dáil on this very important matter.  I think that it is clear that the condition of our roads is one of the disabilities in the development of our country, more especially from the point of view of attracting people to the tourist districts.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  This Bill, on the whole, is one of which I thoroughly approve, though it lacks certain things, and it is undoubtedly capable of a certain amount of amendment.  One of the valuable things in the Bill is that it provides very definite checks on mal-administration of local bodies.  One thing I observe is that in the case of people who irresponsibly make payments of public money, and are surcharged, unless the surcharge is paid, they cease to qualify as members of the council.  I think that is an exceedingly desirable check, because <Col N="1688" /> it has been within my own experience as a member of some of these boards that people very often put their signatures to paying orders with an utter lack of responsibility and not caring what the results will be.  As has been indicated by this discussion so far, probably the most contentious part of this Bill will be the proposal to abolish district councils.  Well, now, I have a fairly good first-hand knowledge of the working of various councils and of the conditions under which members are elected and how members attend them; and I would venture to suggest that if the Dáil seriously reflects on this proposal to abolish district councils there is not such a very great hardship in it at all.  It is not, as is suggested, a very definite departure from democratic ideals, because the county councils are still democratic bodies, and the county councils are going to be increased in their membership in order that they can carry on their extra duties.  One of the best points I have heard against the proposal to abolish district councils was made by Deputy Corish and, I think, also by Deputy Baxter.  They said it would lead to a very considerable congestion of work in the existing county councils.  That I am in agreement with, because what happens at county councils is that the members come in from all ends of the county and sir, say, at 11 o'clock in the morning.  There is a long agenda, and there is usually a long discussion on the first three or four items.  Then their enthusiasm wanes and by the end of the afternoon a great deal of the programme is left untouched.</P>

      <P>However, as against that it must be remembered that county councils are empowered to elect a great many committees, which will relieve them of a considerable amount of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I think will help to greater efficiency by keeping up quorums at the meetings. Very often it is exceedingly difficult to get a quorum even when there are important matters for discussion.  It can be easily understood when farmers and business people come from the far end of a county, and have not the advantage <Col N="1689" /> of trams and other facilities which people in cities have for getting about, that it entails a considerable inroad on their time.  I think the provision to pay travelling expenses, in the case of people who attend three out of four of the meetings, is a very excellent one. I do not think it is right that people should have to devote a great deal of their valuable time to the conduct of public business and get no recompense for it.  Another matter referred to by Deputy Baxter in connection with the proposal to abolish district councils was, that he thought it was going to be very extravagant and that he could not see where any economies were going to be effected.  I would like to remind him that the Minister in introducing the Bill said that the cost of district council elections to begin with amounts to about £65,000, and that the various staffs&mdash;who, of course, will have to be pensioned and provided for&mdash;cost £85,000 per annum.  It appears to me that there is £65,000 worth of economy to start with together with whatever sum will be saved after providing for reasonable and fair pensions to the various staffs.  It may be news to a great many Deputies when I tell them that there are at present over 3,000 district councillors in the Saorstát and the staffs amount, I think, to over 4,000.  One of the tragedies of rural life is, I think, the extraordinary number of men who go in for public and political life.  Under this abolition of district councils, you will have a matter of 3,000 members released to go back to their ordinary vocations, and to carry on their ordinary business.  I think that that in itself is a considerable economic saving.  I have known in my experience more than one man who has owed his commercial downfall, and possibly bankruptcy, to the neglect of his own business by attending to those boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow Deputy Gorey to define that, when it comes to his turn, in any way he wishes.  With regard to the public health sections of the Bill, they have been very ably dealt with by Deputy Sir James Craig.  There is, however, one thing that I certainly <Col N="1690" /> highly commend, and that is the suggestion to appoint a whole-time medical officer of health for each county.  There are certain things that I would like the Minister to explain.  Possibly I have not read the Bill carefully enough.  For instance, I would like to know what is going to be the position of future dispensary medical officers?  Are they to be whole-time men, or can they take private practice?  Another matter which I should like the Minister to refer to is in connection with the appointment of these ten people for the County Health Board.  There does not appear to be any provision made as to what districts they are to represent. Under the section, as it reads at present, I think they can be appointed from anywhere.  I suggest to the Minister that it is desirable that that should be altered; that is to say, that every corner of the county should have adequate representation.  I happen to belong to a county with a very peculiar geographical shape, as Deputy Davin knows, where there are enormous distances to be covered.  One end of the county is a tremendous length from the other.  If the members of the Committee came from one end of the county or, say, the centre of it, they would be quite ignorant of the sanitary conditions and the public health needs of the other portions of it.  Taking the Bill on the whole, I think that we ought to congratulate the Minister.  Although, as I have said, it is quite capable of intelligent amendment, which I have no doubt it will receive at the hands of the Dáil, I think the main principle of it is good, and I certainly recommend that the Dáil should give it a Second Reading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" />&ldquo;That a committee of seven members of the Dáil to be selected by the Committee of Selection, be appointed to inquire into and report on (1) the circumstances which led up to the granting to the Irish Bonded Film Store, Limited, or Messrs. McConnell and Hartley, of the contract for the projection of cinematograph films for censorship purposes; (2) the terms of said contract and the charges agreed to be paid to the Irish Bonded Film Store, Limited, or Messrs. McConnell and Hartley, for such projection; (3) the fees fixed for the censoring of films and the orders and regulations made under the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, and the basis on which such fees were fixed; (4) the effect of the import duty on films and amusements tax on the cinema trade, and the incidence of said taxes; and (5) to make recommendations as to the arrangements for the censoring of films which should be made on the termination of the said contract.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before I agreed to allow this motion to go down in my name I took every reasonable precaution, in consultation with other Deputies who are interested, to see that there was nothing in the motion that would in any way pass a reflection on the Minister himself, or upon any of those who have been advising him in connection with this particular matter.  I am not going to say anything now that would, in my opinion, prejudge or prejudice the decision of the Committee, which I hope the Dáil will agree to set up for the reasons given in the motion.  If the Dáil is prepared to agree to the setting up of a committee for the purposes named I think it is very undesirable that I should go into any of the questions which that committee would rightly have to deal with.  As far as I can understand, the main complaint of the people who have grievances in this matter is that the organisation which represents the film trade has not been taken into consultation in the way that it should by the Minister, before certain decisions were arrived at. The motion requests that the Dáil <Col N="1692" /> should agree to the setting up of a committee of seven members of the Dáil to be selected by the Committee of Selection &ldquo;to inquire into and report on (1) the circumstances which led up to the granting to the Irish Bonded Film Stores, Limited, or Messrs. McConnell and Hartley, of the contract for the projection of cinematograph films for censorship purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to say here and now that if there is any contract in existence which is regarded as legally binding for a certain period I do not claim in this resolution that that contract can be or should be terminated in any way until the period of the contract has expired. That is not demanded in the resolution which I am asking the Dáil to agree to.  Questions have been asked in the House, I think, on several occasions, and by several Deputies, and one long statement, at any rate, has been made by the Minister for Justice in connection with the whole matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did read it.  As a matter of fact I listened very carefully to the statement at the time, if that is any satisfaction to the Minister.  Statements of a contradictory nature were made by people outside as a result of that statement made in the Dáil.  For that reason also I think it is only right that the Committee should be asked to go into the whole matter and examine the statements that have been made both by the Minister and by the people outside who are interested, so that a correct view may be taken of all the circumstances that led up to the granting of this particular contract. The trade organisation complained very bitterly that they had not been consulted by the Minister or his advisers in this matter.  Information in connection with the fees was given to the Minister and it led up to the existing charges, which are regarded by the trade as excessive and unfair.  It was stated, for instance, that the Minister was advised that the amount of films submitted for censorship would not exceed 50,000 square feet per week.  I think experience has shown from the correspondence I have read, and even from the Minister's statement itself, that that figure has been exceeded.  If <Col N="1693" /> the figure of 50,000 square feet per week was the figure upon which the Minister worked out the present charges, and if it has been exceeded, then I think it is one good reason why the existing charges should be revised. The Minister himself in a letter to representatives of the trade dated 9th February, stated &ldquo;the present charge will be reduced, if it is found to be greater than required.&rdquo;  I understand that the charges that are being made, and that have been made by the Minister are made for the purpose of producing revenue that will be sufficient to defray the expenses incidental to the working of the Act.  The charge of 16s. 8d. per thousand feet, which is the present charge, is regarded as highly excessive for that particular purpose.  The charge split up is supposed to represent 10s. for running the films through the censor and providing office accommodation and 6s. 8d. for expenses in connection with the Censor's Department.  The estimated revenue based upon these charges has been given to me as £4,300 per year, while the estimated expenditure in connection with the working of the Censor's Department and all other expenses incidental to the working of the Act is £1,135 per year.  That would leave a surplus of £3,165 per year. That is being thrown on to the trade, and it imposes upon it a burden which is regarded as excessive and unfair. In other words it is alleged that a private trading concern, namely, the Irish Bonded Film Store, Ltd., is being subsidised to that extent by the imposition of unfair charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another complaint with regard to this matter, a complaint which I think has already been put up to the Minister&mdash;that is, that the contract for the censorship of films was not advertised in the Press; at any rate, it was not generally made known to the people engaged in the trade that it was intended to give this work to a private trading concern.  Some of the people representing the trade were led to believe&mdash;I am not saying it was definitely stated&mdash;that the work of censorship would be done by a Civil Service Department acting under the Ministry of Justice.  If it is agreed to set up this Committee reasons can be given as to <Col N="1694" /> why that should be done.  At any rate, good reasons can be given to show that interested people should not be employed by a private trading concern to engage in the work of censorship.  All people engaged in the work of censorship should be regarded as Civil Servants or semi-Civil Servants, and should be directly under the Ministry. Returns have been called for to show the number of square feet of films that have been submitted for censorship in a particular period, and the average taken over six weeks was 107,000 square feet.  Based on the existing charges, that would bring in a revenue of £83 per week, £33 of which is alleged to be set aside for the cost of the Censor's Department, and the remaining £50 for the Irish Film Bonded Store, Limited.  The organisation representing the trade claims that the charges could be reduced to about half, or about 8/4 per square foot instead of 16/8, as at present charged.</P>
    <P>There are other things dealt with in the Resolution which the Committee, if set up, should deal with&mdash;&ldquo;the effect of the import duty on films and the amusements tax on the cinema trade and the incidence of said taxes.&rdquo;  I notice there is an amendment by the Minister for Finance to cut that out. Complaints have been made, particularly by the general public who patronise the picture houses that the amusements tax as at present imposed is very unfair, especially to those patrons of the lower priced parts of the house. I am not a patron of picture houses, but I understand that most of the houses in the City of Dublin cater for the poorer classes, and that the tax on the lower priced seats is unfairly assessed.</P>
    <P>The taxes, for instance, on the lower priced seats are roughly in the ratio of 33.1-3rd per cent., while on the higher priced seats it is reduced to 16 or 16.2-3 per cent.  If there is to be a tax upon amusements, that tax should be imposed upon the people who have the greatest amount of money to spend, and there should be no undue or unfair tax placed upon the poorer class of people who may find a little pleasure in patronising picture houses from time to time.  That is the reason it is suggested that they should be taken <Col N="1695" /> into consideration by the Committee. I repeat that I have no interest to serve whatsoever in connection with this matter.  I am not a patron of picture houses.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I have only visited picture houses on one or two occasions, the last occasion being four or five years ago when I went to see the picture of some big fight reproduced.  I have no axe to grind or interest to serve in moving this motion.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept it.  If there is nothing that the Minister and his officers are anxious to hide, I do not see why he should object to the setting up of a committee to deal with the things mentioned in the motion.  If the Minister for Finance is not disposed to accept that portion of my motion, to which I notice he has an amendment down, I suppose I must accept his amendment.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister for Finance should take any exception to a Committee of the Dáil going into a matter of this kind, and making recommendations to him.  I take it that if anybody is anxious to do so, there will be an opportunity to raise this matter on the Finance Bill or probably on the Estimates.  I hope the Minister will take what I say into consideration in regard to the unfairness of the amusement tax now imposed on the lower-priced seats in picture houses. The Committee is asked also to make recommendations for arrangements as to the censorship of films.  I take it that the recommendations of a committee of this kind are not binding on the Minister, but there are many reasons which even the Minister should welcome why this committee should be set up, so that any injustice which any individual or body of people may feel they are suffering from as a result of what has happened in the past, may be removed by the inquiries and recommendations of the committee.  I put it to the Minister that so far as I am concerned I am not moving this motion for the purpose of casting any reflections on his attitude.</P>

      <P>Shall I say, re-read the statement, previous to putting down this motion.  He has not suggested in what respect the statement was at all inaccurate or inadequate.  It is simply mentioned by him and passed by.  Now, in drafting that statement, I aimed at making it as full, as detailed and as comprehensive as I possibly could.  I aimed at giving to the Dáil all possible information and enlightenment on the matter which was under review.  I explained in the course of that statement that the basic thing in the transaction which was come to, was the average footage per week which would be censored.  Although the Deputy states there was insufficient consultation&mdash;in fact, I think he put it there was no consultation with the trade&mdash;there was in June of last year very full consultation with both branches of the trade. the renters and the exhibitors.  I sought from them all the advice and information which would enable my Department to arrive at just conclusions and decisions.  In particular, I sought from them information on this important <Col N="1697" /> basic question of film footage.  The renters, when asked for an estimate of the footage, gave estimates varying from 150,000 feet to 400,000 feet per week.  The other branch of the trade, the exhibtors, ridiculed those figures and said that the figure was 50,000 feet per week.</P>
      <P>Finding such a wide divergence of opinion between two branches of the trade, I sought from Revenue statistics some confirmation of one or other figure, and from the statistics which were available in June of last year, I got what I believe to be a confirmation of the lower figure of 50,000 feet.  That would be, in fact, the estimate given by the exhibitors.  On that estimate of 50,000 per week the transaction that was arrived at was based.  At these interviews in June of last year both the renters and the exhibitors represented that it would be a great facility to the trade if films could be censored in bond, so that import duty would not have to be paid on films rejected by the Censor.</P>
      <P>On that question of cost, exhibitors thought it would be necessary to charge between a half-penny and one penny per foot, and represented this as an excessive burden.  They professed to be completely satisfied if the work could be done at one farthing per foot Now, the actual charge is one-fifth of a penny per foot, and one-tenth of a penny in the case of topical, travel, interest and educational films.  So that, whereas you had these people representing in the month of June last that we would need to charge one half-penny and one penny, and that they would be completely satisfied if the work was done at one farthing, the work is actually being done at one-fifth of a penny in some cases, and one-tenth of a penny in other cases, per foot.  I want to know from Deputy Davin, or any other Deputy, whether it is contended that the charges are too high.  Perhaps Deputy Davin will answer me now?</P>

      <P>In England you have the British Board of Film Censors, a body set up by the trade, which deals with a far greater quantity of films than the Censor here deals with, and which should operate more economically. <Col N="1698" /> Yet the charge is 2s. per 100 feet or £1 per thousand feet as compared with our charge of 16s. 8d. per thousand feet.  Now, suppose even that charge were high and compared unfavourably instead of favourably with the corresponding charge in England, who would be to blame?  I submit that the people who represented that from a half-penny to a penny would be the minimum practical and who professed themselves completely satisfied if it could be done for a farthing would be the people chiefly to blame if the present charges had been somewhat high. But the present charges, as I have shown, are not high.  They are below the figures with which the trade professed themselves satisfied.  They are below the charges of a farthing per foot, and they are considerably lower than the charges for corresponding work in England under the British Board of Film Censors.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept my statement that the fees charged are supposed to produce the Revenue that would be necessary to cover expenses incidental to the operation of the Film Censors Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>It was made perfectly clear at the time the Act was being passed, that the Act was not to be a source of revenue, that it was meant only to cover the expenses of the administration of the Censorship. Now, the Deputy says the fees are too high.  He is arguing that they are too high.  The scale of fees was, in accordance with the Act, laid on the Table of the Dáil for 21 days, 21 days during which any Deputy might have raised his objection.  There was no objection raised.  The Deputy comes along now and says there should be an inquiry because the fees are too high.  In the statement of the 5th March last I said and I repeat it now: &ldquo;If experience proves that lower fees will suffice or that cheaper arrangement can be made, the contract with the Irish Bonded Film Store, Limited will not be renewed at the end of the year.&rdquo;  That is the position.  That has always been the position.  Representatives of the trade coming to me on deputations have received that assurance time and time again.  What is it they ask to be done? Is it that I should break the contract <Col N="1699" /> which my department entered into on the basis of information which was the fullest and the only information available at the time it was made?  Because in practice a contract may work out slightly more advantageous to one party than to the other, is it to be repudiated? That is not my idea, and I hope it is not the Deputy's idea of a business transaction.  In fact, the statistics for the year ending 31st March last showed that the footage works out at 70,000 feet per week instead of 50,000, which was our estimate and on which we based this bargain. The transaction had to be entered into in June of last year.  At that time there were only figures available for three months of the financial year.  The figures which were available pointed to the confirmation of the exhibitors' own estimate of 50,000 feet per week, and it was on that basis and on the basis of that figure that the arrangement was made.  Now, I would like to think that I had disposed of the charge of lack of consultation.  There was the fullest consultation with the trade on this whole matter of the Censorship. There has been a suggestion of monopoly and I want that cleared up.  I want to know what information or what opportunity the contracting firm had which any other member of the trade did not share?  It was well known to the trade that the Government would have to make arrangements for premises and make arrangement for the projection of these films for censorship.  That was the whole matter under discussion and the probable cause of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now, the matter was one of letting premises, and one does not invite tenders for every little detail of administration.  But the trade knew it.  The trade knew that it was necessary for the Government to make arrangements for premises and for the projection of these films for censorship.  Every member of the trade knew it, and they contented themselves with saying: &ldquo;It will cost between a halfpenny and a penny, and we are entirely sceptical of the possibility <Col N="1700" /> of your doing it at a farthing.&rdquo; And they left it at that.  In fact we are now doing it at one-fifth of a penny.  We were able to arrive at that because this firm wrote in and offered to take on this task at a particular figure.  That figure was refused by us.  Later we entered into a bargain based on our estimate of 50,000 feet per week.  Now the Deputy, with characteristic tact, says, &ldquo;If there is nothing which the Minister is anxious to hide, I do not see why he should oppose the motion.&rdquo;  Now I scarcely want to take up the position of opposing the motion.  But I do suggest that the Deputy's leg has been stretched in this matter, just as a very elaborate attempt has been made, and a very sustained and intensive attempt has been made to stretch the leg of the man in the street.</P>

      <P>There is implicit in this motion an abuse of the forms of the Dáil or an attempt to abuse the forms of the Dáil.  The real object of this Inquiry, and it will probably be news, and interesting news, to the Deputy, is to enable certain members of the trade to ventilate a grievance, real or imaginary against one member of the contracting firm.  The matter is one extraneous to the contract, and is in no way a proper concern of my Department or the Dáil.  But it is felt that if the Dáil could be induced to set up an Inquiry, that such Inquiry would provide an excellent sounding board for the ventilation of the grievance against the individual member of the trade.</P>
      <P>That was as much as was stated to me by a representative of the trade. He said: &ldquo;We have no grievance whatever against you or your department. Our real object is, so to speak, to get after the men with whom we have had a business falling out.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I regard the Deputy as a babe in the wood in this whole matter.  I am telling him a fact, that a professional representative of the trade informed me that the real object of the Inquiry, which they were seeking, was to enable them to ventilate a grievance against an individual member of the contracting firm, and to enable them to substantiate a charge of, let us say, lack of candour on his part in dealing with certain of his business associates.  That is no concern of mine. It was a matter anterior to the contract, and a matter extraneous to the contract, and I submit that the Dáil ought to have a better sense of its own dignity than to set seven of its members to work to enable them to clear up what is, after all, a private dispute between members of the cinema trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this motion.  I am not concerned with the charges, whether they are high or low, but from the information placed at my disposal I support the motion with a view purely and simply to getting at the bottom of what I might call a scandal.  When I say a scandal, I do not for a moment suggest that it has anything to do with the Minister or the Ministry that he is concerned with.  I do say this, that the Ministry were very gravely at fault in not making proper inquiries, but again I say at the time at which this occurred there was every reason why they should be excused, and fully excused.  It is with the definite object of helping the Ministry and helping the Dáil that I am speaking on this, so that when the contract ends sometime this year they will be in a position to know exactly what they should do in the future regarding the exercise of a proper censorship control of its staff, and the fixing of proper charges.  They should see that the censorship is definitely controlled and <Col N="1702" /> also its staff.  If my information is correct, it seems very strange that what you might call three foreigners could get the <i>entree</i> into two separate and distinct departments of this State.  It is not only the Ministry of Home Affairs, but also the Ministry of Finance, that is concerned in this matter. It is alleged, in spite of the statement that I heard read, that these people were fully consulted.  They hold, in spite of that statement, that they were not, and their real grievance is that they were told on several occasions that they would be kept in touch.  That is their real grievance: that they were not kept in touch, but at the end of the time they were just faced with an accomplished fact.  This store and the censorship have been granted to this firm or whatever it is.  I believe it is called the Irish Bonded Film Store.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it quite clear I think that I said there were two departments of the State concerned in this.  That is their real grievance.  The information I have is that this store was approved of, in the first instance, or rather that this company when they got the contract in the first instance, had not this store.  The point is that this store was apparently inspected and a certificate was given to it as a bonded film store while it was not the property of the person who was getting the concession.  That is my real reason for bringing this on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might intervene for a moment I should say as a matter of accuracy that the premises were approved of as a bonded store before the censoring transaction was entered into and not subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGRATH Mr. McGRATH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes you all the more clear in the matter.  We will take it that that was the course that was followed.  The bonded store was approved of, apparently, and again I say if my information is correct, a certificate was given for a store which was not the property of the party getting the concession.  My real, reason for supporting this motion is to get at what should be put down once and for all, and that is a sharper getting into a <Col N="1703" /> new State&mdash;a foreigner coming across here and by sharp practice wiping out those who had been here before him or who were Irish people, and doing a trick, because really it cannot be described as anything but a swindle. Again, I qualify that by saying, if my information is correct.  I am also concerned with a real censorship.  I think the Censor, who is responsible for the pictures shown, when he has passed them should be in a position to say and to know definitely that every picture he puts his signature to is a proper picture and that it has been shown fully beforehand.  He cannot be in a position to say that unless he has definite control over the party showing the picture. That is the real point.  That is an aspect of the question that the Minister will have to consider carefully in the future, even if he does not accept this motion.  It is quite possible, more particularly when dealing with this type of people, to slip in a number of feet of film.  The Censor has no power in the world over the operator. He simply sees what is put before him; he does not know whether he has seen all the picture or not, and consequently something very objectionable may get into a picture.  If my information is correct, there has been a good deal of sharp practice going on here.  I am not alleging anything against the department concerned, but I think a grave error was made by the Finance Department in granting a certificate for a bonded film store.  The Finance Department did not make proper inquiries regarding the premises before granting the licence.</P>

I have discussed this matter with both sides, and both sides have expressed to me in conversation a desire to have this Inquiry or this Committee set up.  If that is so, I for my part cannot see any ground for refusing such a Committee of Inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious there are two sides.  As a matter of fact, the Minister for Justice indicated in the course of his own remarks that it was simply a dispute between certain parties. I do not know how far he is accurate in that or not.  Certainly the information supplied to me led me to think that there are grounds for inquiry, and very considerable grounds, and that certain persons had been given a monopoly in regard to this matter which gives them a most unfair advantage in the trade.  According to the information I have received, it places them in a position to dominate the trade, to control the whole trade, and eventually to become a small ring regulating the whole trade throughout the Saorstát.  That does seem to me to be sufficient ground to warrant some sort of an investigation, but when I find those who are alleged to have secured that advantage, and those contesting the equity of that arrangement, and when both sides have personally informed me that they are anxious for an inquiry, then for the life of me I cannot see why the Minister should refuse it to those parties.  The various pros and cons of the matter are matters to be argued out, not so much in this House as before a committee of inquiry. For the reasons I have stated, and in order that there may be removed any suspicion that there was anything in the nature of sharp practice, or of unfair concession, or of anything in the nature of placing a few individuals in a position from which to dominate this particular trade, and treat unfairly the other parties interested in the trade, I think there is quite sufficient ground for setting up a committee of inquiry, and therefore I support this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>At the inception of what I might call this cinema dispute I was asked to put down a question to the Minister for Justice.  I did so and I got a reply which was not only, as the Minister to-day described it, very complete, but was elaborate, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for the very complete and full answer he gave me then. After that question had been answered I found there was still agitation going <Col N="1705" /> on and what you might call dissatisfaction. I have been approached by both sides and the attitude I took up was that as far as I was concerned, and with the information that the Minister had given me, I certainly could not see any justification for the wire-pulling that was going on, in connection with the whole business.  To-day the Minister for Justice has again amplified what he said, and really I do not think that this House should be called upon to enter into a petty squabble between different members of a trade.  I think it is beneath our dignity and the amount of wire-pulling and agitation that has been going on in this matter is far and away in excess of the merits of the case, even if the case made out by any one section was entirely correct. I oppose this motion as being beneath the dignity of this House to ask seven Deputies to enquire into a matter which has already been thrashed out <i>ad nauseam</i> among the members of the trade themselves.</P>

      <P>I have a certain amount of pleasure in speaking on this occasion because I find myself in agreement with Deputy Hewat, which is not often the case.  It is not enough to come here and say there is no case made out for a Parliamentary inquiry commensurate with the dignity of this Dáil.  A very strong case would have to be made out for such inquiry, not merely a case involving a dispute between two rival sections of traders, but rather seriously involving Departments of State.  I do not think from the beginning a very strong case or a moderate case, or any case at all, has been made out so far as I heard it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in a peculiar position.  I am in the position of a juror, with an absolutely virgin mind in regard to this dispute.  I was not approached by either side, and I did not read anything about it in the papers.  I give it as my candid opinion that there has been no case made out for the inquiry. <Col N="1706" /> Whether there is a case or not, certainly no case has been made for an inquiry of this kind, and the idea of setting up a committee of the sovereign assembly of the nation to decide whether one set of traders in the State was guilty of sharp practice against another set of traders should not be entertained, and I hope Deputy Davin will not press his motion.  I think the Minister said he did not like to oppose the motion, but apart altogether from the wishes of the Minister, and from the point of view of the House alone, I think the Deputy should not press his motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, have a certain amount of sympathy with what Deputy Hewat expressed as to the inadvisability of, shall I say, cheapening the procedure of Dáil inquiries into matters of this kind, that is to say the matters of dispute between members of the trade.  But I think the case that might have been made for this motion has not been made, because it was probably thought to be an accepted motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice incidentally hit upon the issue as far as I can see it, and that is that it is not as to whether the charges are too high alone. But when he said that Deputy Davin was the babe in this matter and that his leg was being stretched, the allegation in reality is that it is the Minister who is the babe in this matter, and that it is his leg that is being stretched, that those who advised him have up consciously, and perhaps ignorantly, allowed themselves to be drawn into a trap which has given certain people in the trade an advantageous position; that sharp practice has been used with the Minister or his advisers which has led to the prejudicing of the great majority of the trade; that there is incidentally or&mdash;shall I say&mdash;directly involved in this dispute an allegation that the Ministry have been more or less careless and faulty in having entered into a contract of this kind without due inquiry, and that such inquiry as was made was made of those people who were interested in the contract that eventually was entered into which placed them in a particularly strong position in respect of their competitors. <Col N="1707" /> That is the issue.  It is not whether it is a little extra here or a little extra there, or that there is an overcharge here which will be remitted at the end of the period of contract, but that there is quite apparently at the back of all this an allegation that a department of State has been grievously at fault, and&mdash;shall I say&mdash; the real justification for any inquiry of this kind is that that department of State&mdash;I do not think there is any truth whatever in it, but nevertheless it is part of the general issue&mdash;may have been advised by its experts wrongly, and possibly corruptly.  That is the kind of question that has to be inquired into and that on the part of certain people concerned corrupt influences have been used, or if not corrupt, too clever methods adopted with those who are new to such matters. My only interest in this matter arises from the fact that I have been approached by the people working in the trade, who feel that they have serious grounds for apprehension; that the members of the trade have been handicapped sufficiently to make them contemplate the closing down of their premises and their businesses; that the trade is feeling a very distinct grievance and feeling it so acutely that it may lead to the closing down of premises and the consequent disemployment of a large number of people.  I do not say that the Minister would be wrong in describing that simply as part of the bluff; I do not know.  But the workmen in the trade feel quite seriously that there is solid ground for apprehension, and it is only on that account that my interest has been aroused in this matter.  But I think it well to state, as well as I can, that the issue is not the simple one between one section of the trade and another.  If it were, then the Dáil has no right to intervene at all; that is a matter for the Minister, in so far as it affects him. But if there come any such suggestion of undue influence, possibly corruption, or any suggestion that people have been given concessions as a result of undue influence&mdash;say sharp practice&mdash;then I think it is competent for the Dáil to enter into an inquiry as to the truth of any such allegation.</P>

I would take Deputy Johnson's assurances very often, but in a matter of this kind I cannot; I want some proof.  Any person can get up here and make allegations that a Department was guilty of misconduct and corrupt practices, but before we would take the very serious step of appointing a commission we must have more tangable evidence, at least a probability, and I have not heard a bit of evidence so far.

As far as I can see, from all the evidence and the case that has been made to-day, this is a matter between either one or several firms in the city of Dublin that are interested in this business.

I could have taken advantage of Private Members' time by spending a good deal of time in going into the whole correspondence and into the charges that are supposed to have been made against a Department, and between one person and another, but I did not do that.  I told the Minister for Justice, in a private conversation, that if he regarded this Motion as a Motion of censure upon himself or his Department, it would be up to me to make the case then, and to take up the time of Deputies by going into the matter from every angle.  I understood from him, and I hope I am not incorrectly stating the facts when I say so, that he did not regard it as a vote of censure.  I do not think he said anything in the course of his speech which could be taken to show that he did regard it in that light, and he more <Col N="1710" /> or less left it to the Dáil to say, whether or not from their own knowledge and from what has been said, it was advisable to set up this committee.

May I say this also: it has not been put to me, and I do not know, that there is a dispute between the people claiming to represent the trade and one or two particular individuals. I have never gone into that aspect of the case, and there is nothing in the correspondence I have that would go to show that.  I think if the Dáil agrees to set up such a committee, the terms of reference which have been put down here would actually preclude the committee from going into any petty squabble that is supposed to exist between one or two parties who may have grievances in this matter.  There is a complaint, and even in spite of what the Minister has said, I say that the trade organisation has not been consulted in the way it should have been in this case.  I would put it to the Minister to say who were the people who were consulted as representing the trade organisation.</P>

The Minister admitted that the estimate, which he acted on <Col N="1711" /> and on which he imposed the existing charges, has been proved to be wrong.

      <P>The contract was based on an estimate of an average weekly footage of 50,000.  That estimate was formed from all the information available for me at the time; it happened to be the estimate of the exhibitors themselves.  It was confirmed, or it seemed to be confirmed, or corroborated from revenue statistics.  I cannot alter the contract or the bargain that was made because, on further experience, it proves to be a few thousand out.  The bargain must run its course for the period for which it was made.

      <P>I make the statement now, and you can take it if you like, <Col N="1712" /> that the charges is that the people who gave the information of 50,000 feet to the Minister and upon which he acted, are the very people who have got the contract, the Irish Bonded Film Store Company.</P>
      <P>That is quite definite.  If that is a charge, I say it is a reason why a Committee of the Dáil should be set up to inquire into that very serious statement. Another thing the Minister ignored was the Government's intention with regard to the giving of the contract to the Irish Bonded and Film Store Company. I say that in Government contracts every person who is entitled to tender for the contract should have the necessary information at his disposal. It was the qury of the Minister to have advertised the contract publicly, so as to put all parties interested, and everyone engaged in the trade, on fair and equal terms.  That point has not been answered by the Minister.  I did not take up the time of the Dáil by trying to make the case here when I had reasonable grounds for assuming that the Minister did not look upon this motion as a vote of censure, and that consequently he would not oppose the setting up of the Committee if the Dáil agreed to it.  This would not be the time to try to make a case if the Dáil afterwards decided that a Committee of Inquiry was to deal with the question. The Minister is not going to remove the injustice that these people feel they are suffering under.  Something should be done by the Minister to remove such an impression.  In view of the statement that the Minister made, and the denials of the accuracy of his statement, I would have thought that the Minister would welcome the setting up of a Committee.  No one assumes that it would be a Committee on the lines of the Broadcasting Committee. I hope that Deputy Hughes, or any other Deputy who was a party to the setting up of that sensational stunting Committee, will never come to the Dáil and ask for a Committee of the same kind again.  Deputy Hughes is more responsible for the Broadcasting Committee than, perhaps, any other Deputy in the Dáil.  The whole thing was prearranged at a meeting of the Government Party.</P>

That is the position that I put to the Dáil.  There was one suggestion made that the people I met in my department were unofficial.  This is the letter that was <Col N="1714" /> written to Messrs.

      <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letter of the 4th instant, addressed to the President, I am directed by the Minister for Home Affairs to state that if the representatives of your Association will be so good as to call at this Ministry at any date which may suit their convenience, full information will be afforded them as to the expenses involved by the Censorship of Films Bill, 1923.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorHogan" hpid="Mr. CONNOR HOGAN Mr. CONNOR HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice at question time that on the adjournment I would raise the question of the shooting of Mr. Albert O'Brien, and the payment to his mother of an <i>ex gratia</i> grant of £20.  I did so because I understand there are analogous cases of public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy is in a sense unique, and the manner of dealing with it extraordinary. Mr. O'Brien, I understand, was motoring home from Kilfenora to Lemanagh Castle.  His car was overtaken by one or two, or several Crossley tenders containing forces of the National Army.  At the inquest it was ascertained that a military party called on him to halt, but the order was somewhat misinterpreted, and the party in the Ford car understood that the order was &ldquo;keep in,&rdquo; and as the road was narrow they accelerated speed for a little distance when suddenly a volley rang out from the military lorry, and Mr. O'Brien was shot dead.  At the inquest the jury found after mature deliberation that the officer in charge had not taken reasonable precautions to ascertain the identity of the persons in the car, and as such it implied a censure.  I cannot say what disciplinary action was taken against the officer in charge, but on the face of it, and in view of the jury's finding, we cannot regard the thing as justifiable homicide.  In any case, as far as I am aware, he has not been put on trial before a military court, or before the civil courts.  That would have been a tragedy in itself, but unfortunately the evidence that came out at the inquest was that this officer, not satisfied with the deed he had done, but with the lust of blood uppermost in him, took another man out of the car, forced him along the road for a considerable distance, searching for mines, put him on his knees, and fired shots over his head.  That was clearly sworn at the inquest, and now the State comes along and makes an <i>ex gratia</i> grant of £20 to the mother of Mr. O'Brien, who was an ex-officer of the British Army, and had secured several medals and distinctions for bravery in the battlefield.  If his mother was entitled to any compensation at all, surely £20 was a ridiculous sum to offer her, and if she was not entitled to compensation why offer her £20?  As a matter of fact, we are on <Col N="1717" /> the horns of a dilemma on the question. How could they ascertain that £20 is sufficient for a woman who had been bereaved under the circumstances by the death of her son?  That is the question I want to put to the President. Do they consider that the son might make his mother an offering of £1 a year for the course of his life, and that this sum, if invested, is sufficient to produce £1 a year?  As a matter of fact this £20 alone would not pay the funeral expenses.  It would fall very far short of it.  I do not suppose it would meet one-third of the funeral expenses.  Though this is a particular question, the principle is general&mdash;the principle of paying persons injured by the State only the minimum compensation and the most trivial they can put them off at.  It is a thing the Dáil should not allow, that when citizens of the State during the troubled period happened to be wounded or killed by the National forces their relatives or dependants should receive only the minimum compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very sad case, but I do not think that Deputy Hogan is aware of all the circumstances of the case.  These military lorries were sent out on special duty, and in the course of that duty, having arrived at their destinations, they found Mr. O'Brien, a brother of the deceased gentleman, at the spot where they arrived.  This Mr. O'Brien's name was on their list for arrest, and he was placed under arrest.  They then went on their journey, and some cars got out of order, and subsequently, after performing some other duties upon which they were sent out, they came up on a narrow road with this Ford car, in which the deceased gentleman was one of the occupants. They called on them to halt.  Apparently there was some misunderstanding about the order, and according to what Deputy Hogan says, the Ford car moved off rather quickly.  They opened fire, and the deceased was struck and expired in a few minutes. The Ford car stopped after the fire was opened, and it was found that in front of the military car, or at least a very short distance from where the military <Col N="1718" /> car stopped, there were huge stones, and that much further down the road, beyond where the Ford car was, there was a trench.  Now, the report that was furnished by the officer in question states that they were received at the first place where they stopped in an unfriendly manner; and this is one of those cases in which, where there are military operations, accidents of this sort were almost inevitable.  I have stated so on many occasions.  This is very regrettable, but under the circumstances, having read the case carefully within the last month before this order for £20 was issued, I was definitely of opinion that it was one of those cases in which evidence should be submitted that the parties in question were friendly to the State; and I could not discover from the information submitted in the files&mdash;and it is very full and very complete&mdash;that there was any friendliness towards the State.  In the circumstances only the expenses of burial were allowed; and I am not satisfied that any claim would lie against the State in this case.  From the military point of view I think it would be admitted that if the officer in question had not fired he would have failed in his duty.  He would probably have accelerated speed after the other car, and would probably have been upset or discommoded by the heap of stones, and would have probably gone into the trench.  In the circumstances I could not find evidence of friendliness towards the State.  I could not find that the officer failed in his duty, and I could not find that that there was liability on the part of the State.  Now, in these cases it is a matter of human judgment; and acting in my capacity as Minister for Defence in a case of this kind, I am a sort of juryman and at the same time a Judge. If there are circumstances in the case that are not before me, or circumstances other than those I have described. I shall be pleased to hear them.  But in the facts as I have discovered them, it is not a compensation case, it is only a question of paying burial expenses. I believe that Mr. O'Brien's brother was interned.</P>

      <P>With your permission I did want to say that it is an extraordinary proposition that the President has made&mdash;that evidence of friendliness to the State should be brought forward. Would it not be sufficient to show that the man himself was not engaged in any offensive act against the State, that he was a peaceful, inoffensive citizen?  As long as he acted as a good citizen committing no wrong, violating none of the civic precepts, surely that is in itself sufficient to show that his people should be compensated.</P>

We had one brother under arrest who received our troops in an unfriendly manner.  We have the other brother, the deceased gentleman, whose death I regret very much, on a car within easy distance of our troops.  They had lights and he had no light; the order came to halt; they did not halt, but accelerated their speed.  If our troops had not opened fire, but had gone on, there would have been almost inevitably one accident, and possibly two.</P>

It is proposed to deal further with Municipal Government in a new special measure, after adequate examination of the many far-reaching problems involved.  It is not my opinion that municipal administration should be superseded or that the powers given in the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, should be exercised, save in most exceptional circumstances.  I have had the advantage of very many suggestions concerning the future administration of the City of Cork which are being examined.  I cannot say what views are held by the Executive on the question of Municipal Government, but my own opinion is the whole matter should be legislatively dealt with on democratic lines after a Commission shall have advised as to what is necessary to best secure social progress at moderate costs to the ratepayers.</P>
