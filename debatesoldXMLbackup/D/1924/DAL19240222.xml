      <P>asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will state what sum is due to the Tirconaill County Council in respect of Dog Tax, and what payments, if any, have already been made, and when it is proposed to pay the amount now due to the Council.</P>

      <P>The surplus moneys from the Dog Licence Duty under the Dogs Regulation (Ireland) Act, 1865, which were payable to the Counties, Boroughs, Towns and Townships in Ireland for the year ended 31st December, 1919, were paid to the Local Authorities entitled on 11th June, 1920. The proportion paid to the County Council of Tirconaill was £272 2s. 6d. No payment has since been made.</P>
      <P>Owing principally to the falling off in the revenue from Fines and Fees, it was found necessary, in order to secure the Petty Sessions Clerks Fund from variation, to transfer the surplus receipts from Dog Licence Duty in 1920 to that Fund, and an Order was accordingly made by the Lords Justices under Section 2 of the Petty Sessions Clerks (Ireland) Act, 1881, transferring the said surplus (except in the Metropolitan area) to the Petty Sessions Clerks Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instructions have been issued for the distribution of the surplus Dog Licence Duty for the year 1921, which is payable to the Counties, Boroughs, Towns and Townships in Saorstát Eireann.  The calculation of the amounts due to Local Authorities has <Col N="1332" /> been made, and it is hoped that the necessary arrangements can be completed before long to enable payments of the amounts to be made to the Treasurers or other authorised officers of the Local Authorities.  The proportion payable to the County Council of Tirconaill for that year is £733 16s. 7d. There was no surplus for the year 1922. The entire amount collected by the Post Offices and lodged to the credit of the Dogs Act Account in that year was, by Order of the Provisional Government, dated 26th September, 1922, transferred to the Fines and Fees Fund.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what unemployment benefit Martin Gibbs, labourer, of Longhall, Kilconnell, who was employed for sixteen weeks under the Galway County Surveyor between August 1st and December 3rd of last year, is entitled to; further, if he will state what sum has actually been paid to him through the Ballinasloe Labour Exchange, and also whether he is aware that in order to obtain payment Gibbs was compelled to travel from his home to Ballinasloe, a distance of nine miles, on five occasions, and whether it is intended to introduce further legislation with a view to improving the Unemployment Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>Martin Gibbs, Longhall, Kilconnell, claimed Unemployment Benefit at Ballinasloe <Col N="1334" /> Branch Employment Office, and benefit was allowed in due course in respect of all the contributions to his credit. As the claimant had only 16 contributions to his credit, he could only receive benefit for 16 days.  Payment was duly made to him of all benefit due, namely, £2.  It was necessary that the claimant should attend at the Branch Office, Ballinasloe, to lodge his claim. His subsequent attendance to give evidence of unemployment and to receive payment could have been dispensed with if he had made application to have payments made to him through the post.</P>
      <P>In many cases persons claiming benefit prefer personal attendance at the local offices of the department to the transaction of their business through the post.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the question, the Unemployment Benefit payable under the Unemployment Insurance Act is proportioned to the number of contributions paid for the unemployed persons, and it is not proposed to make any alteration in this provision.</P>

      <P>There is no delay in the issuing of passports to Irish citizens.  Unfortunately there has been considerable delay in the introduction of our own passports.  This was occasioned in the first place by the difficulty in getting passports made in Ireland to fulfil the requirements of the international design.  This difficulty has been overcome, and the later delay arises from the necessity to make certain international arrangements.  We are now waiting to hear that these arrangements are completed.</P>

Kildare, under the Land Act, 1923; and whether he is aware that the condition of some of these holdings is appalling, and as bad in individual cases as any on the Western Coast, and to ask whether this estate will be dealt with in the near future.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Finance Ministry that the application referred to has been received. Schemes to relieve unemployment in the City of Dublin, which will receive assistance from money which the Government are making available for the purpose of road reconstruction, &amp;c., are being formulated.  The awards <Col N="1342" /> in respect of compensation cases made up to the present in the Recorder's Court total over £300,000, of which £212,000 is in respect of buildings.  It will therefore be observed that considerable provision for the relief of unemployment in the city has been made The separate proposals of the Port and Docks Board obviously fall into a category by themselves and must of necessity be open to examination in the light of the previous sums, which are exclusive of the grants made in respect of housing, which are considerable in amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been criticised as to its form.  I understand well enough the objection to legislation by reference, and I will take to heart what has been said in that respect.  I think, however, when we have a Bill amending fairly recent Acts, the amount of reference that is allowable may be taken to be greater than when we were dealing with old Acts&mdash;perhaps a large series of old Acts.</P>
      <P>I also hoped that it would be possible to have some arrangement whereby Deputies could consult previous statutes without going all around the town. Even if we do not manage very quickly to have a Parliamentary Library, I think arrangements could be made whereby Deputies could go into the National Library at any reasonable time so that they might look up any references that are contained in Bills.  I can quite well see that it would be desirable to print relevant Sections from previous Acts, but I would not like to undertake that we should always print Sections referred to in any particular Bill, because that would be in many cases quite unnecessary, and it would involve a considerable amount of printing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> Turning to the arguments which were used yesterday, I would like to deal first with that put forward by Deputy Johnson to the effect that the destruction of the past two years was not responsible for the necessity for this cut in the old age pensions.  I have no hesitation in saying that the destruction of the last two years can be taken to be solely responsible for this particular cut.  I am aware that, apart from the Army charges, apart from the compensation charges, and apart from the charges which that destruction is directly responsible for, there would be a comparatively small deficit in the revenue.  That deficit would be such as could be met by ordinary savings that we would be able to effect in the departments, and that are being effected in those departments.  We are now, however, as a result of the damage that has been done, faced with a deficit so great that it cannot be met without much more drastic measures.  It is even open to doubt whether, if the destruction in the past two years had not taken place, there would be any deficit at all.  When the Compensation Bill was under consideration in the Dáil there was a great deal of talk about consequential loss, and, I think, we said many times from these benches that if we admitted consequential loss, the bill would probably be twice as great.  That consequential loss and the wastage it represents are great, and there can be no doubt that they have caused a loss of revenue.  When a loss is suffered and the country is thereby impoverished, you will find that that will always decrease your revenue.</P>
    <P>Further, the destruction and turmoil of the past couple of years have driven large numbers out of the country, whose presence here would have resulted in employment, and, through employment, would have helped the revenue, and whose presence would have meant income tax coming into the Exchequer. I think it is possible that if we had not the campaign of the last two years, without having to undertake any particular economies, we would have been able to meet our expenditure out of income.  In any case, it is quite certain, had it not been for the destruction of the past two years, we would <Col N="1350" /> have had a saving of £40,000 or £50,000 on the Stationery Office, and £70,000 on national health insurance, as well as other savings which we have in hand, and we would be able to make up the deficit without going to such a length as we have to go to at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister assume that there would be no debt to pay interest on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that I will discuss in the proper time, and I do not want to say anything about the debt that we might have to pay interest on.  In any case all the factors, such as our liability to meet old age pension charges, would, I presume, have to be taken into account if we were to arrive at the amount of any debt.  I will deal with that matter at the proper time.  Deputy Cole again asked: &ldquo;Why touch the old age pensioner first; why not consider other methods of economy?&rdquo;  Now, dealing with old age pensions is not such a pleasant thing that one rushes to deal with them first, without considering whether other economies cannot be effected.  We have considered other economies, and have put other cuts into effect before old age pensions have been touched.  The teachers' cut has come into operation. The pay of the Army has been cut, and the pay of the police has been cut, and, I take it, that the remuneration of the doctors in connection with national health certification will be affected before old age pensions are cut.  Even when this Bill goes through the Dáil there will be certain delays before there is anything taken off old age pensions, and the cut in the old age pensions will be very far from being the first cut.  We had to survey the field, when we got the opportunity, as the result of the cessation of hostilities, and we had to put our house in order. We had to survey the field and see what the deficit was, and where it could be met.  There was no use leaving out of consideration the economies and the measures which would give us large savings until we had exhausted the methods which we knew would not give nearly sufficient.  We have to get the Budget balanced as soon as possible.  It would be easy to come along this year <Col N="1351" /> and make half a dozen very inadequate economies, and make another half dozen next year before we came to the bigger things that would yield bigger sums, but we would all the time be increasing the debt and making the financial position of the country more insecure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may, when speaking in November, have said that we proposed to save £70,000 or £80,000 on the Stationery Office, and I may have said one or two other minor things, but we wanted to give an indication that we were prepared to go the whole hog in taking the necessary steps to balance the Budget, and there was no use in leaving out things that would give us a saving of £400,000, and mention things that would give us only one-tenth of that amount.  In no sense did we deal with old age pensions first.  We only came to that decision when the best survey we could make convinced us that only in this way could we balance the Budget. No doubt, it is only talk to the gallery when people say, &ldquo;Why cut old age pensions first?&rdquo;  We have heard it said that we are going to make the present Border permanent as the result of this cut.  I have no belief it will have any such result.  I certainly believe that we would easily make the boundary, not at any rate the present boundary, but the division of the country permanent by any sort of imprudent finance, and by letting the country get into a mess financially.  I have been talking to people who were engaged in the recent elections in Tyrone and Fermanagh, and I asked them was there any refusal on the part of old age pensioners to go to the poll because of the cut which had been announced in the old age pensions, and I was told that the old age pensioners had gone to the poll just as before.  I think it is wrong to assume that because people are old they have neither reason, sense, nor patriotism, and that they have regard simply to some purely personal and material considerations.  I think in one sense the suggestion is that the cut is going to make the old age pensioners turn their backs on all the things that they believe is insulting to them.  Suggestions were made by some Deputies, if I heard the suggestions right, that we might put additional stamps on the <Col N="1352" /> National Insurance Cards and pay the old age pensioners.  That would mean considerable taxation on the people who would be involved, to pay the old age pensions in full.  It would involve a half-a-crown stamp every week, but of course, to pay the difference would not involve nearly that amount.  We have had Deputies asking what the Secret Service Fund was spent on.  If I told them that, it would not be Secret Service any longer.  I do not intend to tell them.  Deputies can very well realise that while as large sums will not be necessary in future as have been even this year, in the state of this country, for another year or two some fairly substantial sums will have to be available for the prevention of any action against the State that might be suddenly sprung.</P>
    <P>We heard reference to other items of expenditure.  Now, supposing we could wipe out these items, they are only a very small fraction of the three millions, and of the amount that would come to the Exchequer as a result of the changes proposed in this Bill.  There is no use if a very big sum is to be saved in suggesting measures which probably are impossible, and which if possible, would give us only a small fraction of the money that is necessary. We have to face these things in some sort of business-like way, and if the thing has to be done, let us do it in full and not be simply tinkering at it.  To get any radical improvement, the services that are done by the Ministry for External Affairs, or very nearly all of them, will have to be done by some other Ministry.  If you had no such Department, most of that expenditure you could not avoid.  Then you have a Deputy dragging in the Viceregal Lodge.  Of course, that is only dragged in for the purpose of drawing a red herring across, and for purposes of propaganda.  He knows very well we are bound to provide for that establishment, and that we are bound to provide the salary, too, and that that is not a matter we can avoid. Certainly, as far as we are concerned, we are not going to invite a breach of the Treaty by making any breaches ourselves, or going near to any breach of it.  We stand for the fulfilment of it, and we stand for demanding our full <Col N="1353" /> rights under it.  I think any Government which did anything else would be acting against the interests of the future of this country.</P>
    <P>One Deputy said it would be better to leave the Budget unbalanced, or to increase taxation, rather than effect this cut.  That Deputy does not bring his mind to bear on the matter at all; he speaks from the depths of his emotions, I presume.  If he would think, he would be able to realise what the effect of leaving the Budget unbalanced would be, and he would realise that it would not do one bit of good to the old age pensioners. If we let the country get into a bad financial condition, if we put ourselves into the position where we may have a 20 per cent. increase in taxation all round, the old age pensioner would be more hit by that than he would be by this cut.  To say we should let things go to the devil rather than take the necessary steps to save ourselves, even if these steps are somewhat hard, is not a sensible suggestion.  I wish the Deputies, whether they agree or disagree with us, would realise that if a certain thing has to be done there is no use in leaving it undone.  If any practical suggestions, or better proposals can be put forward, I would be glad to hear them.  I am not wedded to the particular proposals I have put forward, and I have no pleasure in putting them forward.  I have put forward proposals which, I am convinced, are necessary, and to which I see no adequate alternative.  I think Deputies, when they criticise our proposals, might endeavour to see, when we are faced with a difficult and unpleasant work, that their criticisms would be constructive, and not merely foolish vapouring. Deputy Johnson has said that by certain proposals we are penalising people.</P>
    <P>One can see the argument in favour of giving an old age pension to every person who has reached the age of seventy years, irrespective of means. But it would certainly double the cost. It would certainly mean that we would have to pay six millions out on this, and perhaps more, instead of the three millions, or so, that we are paying now. That is a change that we could not afford.  It is a change, again, which would not benefit the people very much, <Col N="1354" /> because the money would have to be collected off them, and you would have the cost of collection added.  It would be a case of having money taken out of one pocket and put into another, and you would have a toll taken in the process. The cost of the collection would have to be borne.  If this money were taken off in the form of duty on tea and sugar, the shopkeeper would make his profit on the article as he paid for it, and that profit would include the increased duty, and you would have a higher profit coming off the article in the course of distribution, as well as the higher tax and cost of collection, and you would probably find that there would be very little satisfaction with the change if it came.  To the extent that we have a means limit at all, we are penalising thrift.  But there seems to be no alternative in our circumstances to penalising thrift to that extent.  Of course, thrift that provides merely for old age is not the only kind of thrift, and is not in fact the best kind of thrift.  The thrift that provides for the actual doing of things by the person who saves money and who gathers up capital for doing things, is thrift that is more productive to the nation.  But there is no possibility of avoiding it.  We have heard talk about the British rate of pension, and the fact that they were able, in spite of five years' war, to pay the 10s. pension. We have also heard the statement that the British had a huge national debt that we have not, and that they are able to pay interest on that, and not reduce the pension.  The fact is that they are able to do so because England is a richer country with a lower taxation than we have; they are able to meet all their charges.  We are not.  We have a higher taxation and we are not able to meet our charges.  It is no use our comparing this country and its resources with the resources of Great Britain.  We have taken our own course and we have to follow it, and to develop it in our own way.  There is no doubt at all that one of the reasons why we are not able to pay what Great Britain is able to pay, is that the administration and legislation that we have had in this country has been made without reference to the conditions and requirements <Col N="1355" /> of the country.  We have had services and establishments set up here which are costly beyond what the country is able to bear.  It does not follow that this country was not overtaxed even when the British Exchequer was losing on it.  It was overtaxed because the type of administration and departments that were set up here were of such a sort that the country could not afford. And even if the British had to come to the rescue, as they had to do at a certain stage, and pay for what they had set up, that did not alter the fact that this country was overtaxed.</P>
    <P>We have heard it said in the course of this debate that we had increased the superannuation burden by causing people in the service to feel insecure and to resign under the Treaty.  What I have to say about that is the behaviour of large sections of Civil Servants under the Treaty must certainly lower one's opinion of their honesty and public spirit.  We had all sorts of people simply going out at an increased pension which they could get under the Treaty in the belief that with that pension they would pick up employment outside that would pay them better. They did not mind robbing the State when they got the opportunity.  There was certainly the meanest and the most dishonest attitude on the part of very large numbers of Civil Servants who had no real objection to serve under an Irish Government, but who pretended they had and were willing to come forward to testify falsely that they had, in order to grab this advantage.  I had no doubt about that.  One could not prove a particular case, but when one has seen what anybody who has been dealing with the matter has seen, one has no doubt about it at all.  We certainly have done nothing that we could help to swell that burden of superannuation, and we have resisted any particular drive from any particular side that might lead us to take action that would increase that burden beyond the minimum.</P>

      <P>There was certainly a number of people, but the number was very small.  For instance, there were certain people who had been very prominently identified in the Local Government Board in the struggle with the local Boards.  There were a few in the old Local Government Board who had been prominent in the fight with the local Councils.  We felt at the time that it was necessary that they should no longer be associated with the work of the Local Government Department. Perhaps if the particular type of struggle that took place in this country had not been developing it would not be necessary.  But we had to have regard to the attitude of the Councils.</P>
      <P>Then again, we had the question of the Resident Magistrates.  I have no hesitation in saying that it was an absolutely necessary thing to let them go and that we could not have got the courts now held by District Justices, or the Civic Guard, going in the way they have been going, if we had kept the old Resident Magistrates.  It was an utterly impossible thing to keep them. It meant a certain amount of money to dispense with them, but I feel it would have cost us perhaps ten times more money because of the dissatisfaction and delay there would have been in the country if we had retained them, by reason of the difficulty in getting any sort of civil law.  There are certain small cases like that where we did force out men.  We certainly let these go; but in regard to the Civil Service, the number of employees there discharged was very small, indeed.  It was certainly the minimum.</P>
      <P>There was no forcing out of anybody. Anybody who was got rid of through political necessity&mdash;using the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; in the wider sense&mdash;was got rid of openly and definitely, but there was no such thing as forcing anybody out.  The talk about forcing people out is one of the lies that some of these people who went out and who saw the opportunity of mulcting the public put forward in their own defence when they had gone out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is one case that occurs to me which I may mention, though it is a little wide of this topic.  It is the case of a man who was transferred from one branch in a Department to another branch in the same Department.  He was transferred at the same rate of pay, but his status was somewhat reduced by the transfer. The reduction was rather technical than otherwise.  That individual, who was transferred at the same rate of pay, was able to take advantage of the Treaty provisions because of the technical reduction in his status, and he got 17 added years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard it said that the old age pensioners were going to be forced into the County Homes as a result of this cut.  At a time when the 10s. was worth very much less than the 9s. would be worth now, they were not forced into the County Homes.  Reference was made, too, to old people who were living entirely on their pensions and who had no friends to assist them in their support.  They were not the people to whom Deputy Johnson referred who were assisted by the fact that their relatives were in more remunerative and constant employment. I do not think we really could take that suggestion very seriously.  We have been spoken to about new methods of taxation and about increased taxation. Now, new methods of taxation would be at any rate experimental, and if they yield an increase in revenue there is no doubt&mdash;temporarily at any rate&mdash;that any increase in revenue is going to be reflected in an increase in the cost of living, and it simply means that certain Deputies prefer to camouflage the cut on the old age pensioners.  They prefer to increase taxation, send up the cost of living and attack purchasing power, as it were, by stealth instead of doing it openly and directly.  When we think it is necessary to do a thing we are prepared to take the responsibility for doing it. There is no doubt that you cannot save the old age pensioners from suffering a certain amount unless you definitely increase <Col N="1358" /> the burden on the population in general.</P>

      <P>It is much more easy to say you can do certain things to the luxuries of the rich, but I would have the Deputy remember that by increasing the rate of taxation you can very easily reduce the yield.  It would be quite easy to drive a certain number of rich people out of the country and lose thereby Income-tax and Super-tax, and the death duties that would be payable when the Almighty would take them away, and a decrease in yield could very easily be the result of the increase in the rate.  I believe that, as a matter of fact, we are losing, at the present time, by having a higher rate of Income-tax than there is in Great Britain.  To cut off the 6d. would mean an immediate loss, of course, but I have little doubt, on the other hand, that to bring it down to the English level would mean that in a year or two the yield would improve so as to meet the loss.</P>

      <P>No shadow yet, anyhow. You have to bear in mind the particular circumstances of this country and the close commercial and financial ties that have existed, not merely from the Governmental, but from the commercial, point of view, with Great Britain, and you have to realise that you might lose by doing things in this country, in the particular circumstances that exist, that would not cause a loss in another country where there would not be those close ties and channels to which people are accustomed to, not only in their social but in their commercial and financial matters.  We believe there is no actual hardship inflicted on the old age pensioner <Col N="1359" /> by this change.  We know that we are proposing a rate which will, in the maximum case, be of much more value than the maximum of a couple of years ago.  We believe we are saving them from a greater loss by preventing any state of affairs in this country which would require largely increased taxation in the future, which would lead, before that increased taxation became absolutely necessary, to <Col N="1360" /> insecurity, to increase in the cost of living, and to, perhaps, the necessity for financial measures that would make the nominal ten shillings only a fraction of the value of the nine shillings which we offer the pensioners under conditions of security and financial stability.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Committee be appointed consisting of five Deputies to be nominated by the Committee of Selection&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to examine the transcript of the oral evidence given before and the documentary evidence presented to the Special Committee on Wireless Broadcasting and to report to the Dáil whether any, and if so, what charges or imputations have been there made against any Deputy or other person in the course of the proceedings of the Special Committee;</P>
      <P>(b)  to afford an opportunity to every person directly or indirectly affected by such evidence to offer to this Committee such relevant statement in refutation of any such charge or imputation as he may think fit;</P>
      <P>(c)  to report to the Dáil the evidence given in support of such charges or imputations, and to what extent the same are substantiated or established upon the face of the said evidence, documents and statements;</P>
      <P>(d)  to report to the Dáil whether any, and if so, what further action ought to be taken in the premises; that the quorum of the Committee be three, and that the Committee report back not later than 14th March, 1924.</P>
      <P>In introducing this motion I request permission to make a personal explanation. When I stated in the Dáil last week that I did not feel happy about this Broadcasting affair, I had no other matter in my mind than one&mdash; namely, that from the information before me I felt I was not in a position to deal with the whole subject matter to my own satisfaction.  My fears in that connection were justified when I received a letter from Alderman de Roiste concerning the company of which he is secretary&mdash;that is the Irish International Trading Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that certain remarks of mine reflected to some extent on that company. Now I knew that company had <Col N="1362" /> been in existence for something like three or four years, that it came into existence at a time when the old Dáil was endeavouring to function under exceptional difficulties, and that it performed a very useful public service affecting the trade of this country and the opening up of a foreign trade.  In connection with this matter of Broadcasting, they were interested in the sale of apparatus, and I understand they applied somewhere in June last to the Post Office for a licence, and that the licence was refused.  Subsequently, I think, they also applied.  I had no intention of associating that company in any way with the company promoting, and I think it is due to the company and the directors of it that that statement should be made.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion I do so on the understanding as Leader of the House, in a matter in which the Whips are withdrawn, that my interpretation of the trend of the debate on the last day was correct.  This resolution I think meets the summarisation by you, sir of the debate on the last day, and to that extent I move it.  I find on looking over the report of the debate on this day week that of something like twelve members, including myself, it could be reasonably inferred six were favourably disposed to consider a motion of this sort, but on the other hand there were five who did not subscribe, according to the report which is published, and could not be said to subscribe, to that interpretation.  I think it is due to the Dáil that I should make that clear.  If I correctly interpret the view of the majority of the Dáil I think this motion fulfils the conditions, or at least the points, that you, sir, laid down in your summarisation.  To that extent the Dáil is absolutely free now to express its opinion upon whether this meets with approval.  So far as my view of it is concerned it would be that this Committee would consider the matters which are referred to when the Broadcasting Committee is considering its business; that the two Committees would report on the same day, and that each Committee would submit with its report the evidence that it had before it.  In that case the whole of the circumstances would be before the Dáil when called upon to express its opinion <Col N="1363" /> upon the report of the Broadcasting Committee, and the report of this Committee.</P>
    <P>Now, the alternative to this proposal is printing and circulating the evidence to the Dáil.  I said on the last day, when, I think, we were dealing with the Broadcasting Committee's report, that I was particularly desirous of giving the Postmaster-General justice in the matter.  It will be remembered at that time that the Postmaster-General said that if the Dáil had the evidence before it it would not adopt, or I think he put it, it would not be inclined to adopt&mdash;I forget his exact words&mdash;the report of the Broadcasting Committee. Now, on re-consideration, I am inclined to the view that if the Postmaster-General at that time had tabled an amendment that the evidence be printed and circulated we could not have refused that request.  It would have been due to him and to his office that we should accept an amendment to that effect.  The Postmaster-General, I should like to say&mdash;I do not want to confuse the two matters&mdash;was concerned with Broadcasting proper.  This particular Committee would deal with a matter which might not be said to be Broadcasting proper, and I do not want the two matters to be mixed up together. I think it is due to the Dáil that I should make that point clear.</P>
    <P>The motion before the Dáil deals with matters referred to in Paragraph 8 of the Report.  The motion carries out the undertaking I gave last week, I think, almost in every particular.  It is submitted now for the consideration of the Dáil in order that it may express its opinion, first whether it meets the view and conforms with the opinions of the Dáil in dealing with the matter; and, secondly, whether it is a correct interpretation of the Ceann Comhairle's summary of last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, perhaps I should say something, as the President's pledge was more or less given to me, in consequence of which I withdrew my motion.  He <Col N="1364" /> has, I agree, completely fulfilled the pledge given last week in adopting Deputy Johnson's suggestion.  I am not perfectly certain, but I think that this is probably the best way in which we can meet this difficult situation, though, as I said, sooner or later all the evidence will have to be forthcoming both to us and the public.  The thing I am most concerned for in this matter is that the Dáil should act as a whole.  This is one of the first matters we have had in which the Dáil is not concerned with the Government.  It is not a question for the Government or parties, but for the Dáil as a whole, when charges are made against the credit and the integrity of any one member of the Dáil. I hope, therefore, that Deputies will express their opinions.  There was a certain amount of division on the last occasion.  Some persons suggested I should not have withdrawn my motion. If there are Deputies who hold that view I hope we shall have full and frank discussion on the subject.  I, personally, am only anxious to facilitate investigation of this matter on the fairest lines to everybody concerned.  It cannot be left as it is.  The Postmaster-General has expressed the desire for publication of the evidence; I gather that Deputy Figgis wishes the evidence to be published, and we cannot keep the public in the dark indefinitely.  Therefore, while I personally accept this, so far as I am concerned, if there is a strong current of opinion in any quarter or in every quarter of the Dáil, that it will not be enough, that people may think things are being hushed up, then I will urge the President to see if he cannot go a little further in the direction of publishing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'SULLIVAN Professor O'SULLIVAN">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'SULLIVAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say I am enamoured at this particular method of dealing with the evidence.  I think I am correct in saying that, strictly speaking, there was no decision of the Dáil given on the last occasion. Therefore, the Dáil was in no way bound, and, so far as the setting up of this Committee is concerned, the only decision we took was to allow Deputy Major Cooper to withdraw his motion on the understanding that the whole matter would be brought up again, especially the question of the publication <Col N="1365" /> of evidence.  One of the principal objections, as I understand, raised here on the last day to the immediate publication of evidence was, that in the Committee, as was perhaps inevitable, the rules of evidence were not observed in the same way as they would be observed in a court of law.  Are they going to be observed in the new Committee any better?  The last Committee was composed of Deputies, and the new Committee proposed is also to be composed of Deputies.  I presume they will behave in exactly the same way as the last Committee.  I suggest, therefore, that that objection hits the new proposals quite as much as it hit the procedure of the last Committee, and the suggestion that the proceedings of the Committee should be printed and circulated. I quite admit that if you had a trained judge as chairman, who was familiar with the laws of evidence, and the application of the laws of evidence, you might have some improvement in that matter, but to suggest that we should appoint a person of that character as Chairman of a Committee of this kind, investigating the actions of members of the Dáil especially, would, I think, be a dangerous precedent, and one that the Dáil should not readily drop into.  There is one thing I would like to suggest.  If you look at paragraph (c) of the proposed motion I think that, although in practice you may not call it a Court, it practically means a Court:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) To report to the Dáil the evidence given in support of such charges or imputations, and to what extent the same are substantiated or established upon the face of the said evidence, documents and statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice, I say, if that is not a Court it goes very near being a Court. I ask, can you set up by resolution of one House of the Oireachtas a Court? As I understand the Constitution, if that is not a violation of the Constitution it is sailing pretty closely to the wind.  You may say it is not, strictly speaking, going against the Constitution, because in the strict and absolute legal interpretation that is not a Court.  But I suggest that in practice it is meant to work out as a Court.  I may suggest also that in nine cases out of ten&mdash;I do not mean to say there will <Col N="1366" /> be ten, but in that proportion&mdash; in matters of this kind a verdict one way or another, in the strict sense of a Court giving a verdict, is a practical impossibility.  I think what is the important thing is not so much the question of what verdict&mdash;if I may use that phrase&mdash;a body of this kind may come to, but that the evidence should be before the members of the Dáil.  I think the really important thing is the publication or the printing and circulation of the evidence to the members of the Dáil.  So far as this is concerned, I must confess I do not see what advantages the new proposal offers over the advantages we would have had had we accepted on the last day Deputy Cooper's motion.  As far as I can judge, there will be two classes of matter to be published&mdash;first, what I may call, roughly speaking in the ordinary sense, the evidence; that is the statements made by those who came before the Committee, the questions asked by the members of the Committee and the replies given by the witnesses examined.  Then, as to the documents, these again are of different kinds, as I understand.  Some deal with the question of broadcasting, others deal with the question of what, I think, the Ceann Comhairle alluded to as the personal question.</P>
    <P>I think all the evidence and all, the documents that deal with broadcasting and with the personal matter, will have to be published or printed and circulated. But, in addition, I understand, from what was said the last day, that there were a number of other matters also introduced, documents given in that had really nothing to do with the inquiry, either with the principal object or with what I might call the incidental matter that cropped up, the personal matter that cropped up in the course of the inquiry.  A lot of purely irrelevant documents were handed in.  For instance, acknowledgements of the receipt of a document from one Department to another.  These, of course, are purely irrelevant.  As to whether they should be published or not, personally, I have no views.  If Deputies think they should be published, let them suggest that.  In addition, however, I understand, there are other classes of documents&mdash;and this, I suggest, is an important <Col N="1367" /> matter for the Dáil to consider &mdash;confidential departmental documents from a subordinate to his chief dealing with purely departmental work, and giving what is very often purely confidential views on certain matters.  So far as these do not concern either the personal question or the broadcasting question in a narrow sense, I think the Dáil should be slow to create a precedent by publishing confidential documents of this kind.  I must confess I cannot see what precise advantage is offered by the new proposal over the proposal that Deputy Cooper put forward. If a few new witnesses are to be examined&mdash;I doubt if there are many whose names have been mentioned and who have not been given an opportunity of stating their views &mdash;I suggest that the evidence be circulated to them and that they be given an opportunity of coming forward before the present Committee.  But if the Committee is to start anew there may be a difficulty, as I gathered from what Deputy Figgis said on the last day, that there is a probability that some very material witnesses may not be present.  I candidly can see that there are grave objections to the new course, and I do not see that it offers any advantages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. WILLIAM DAVIN Mr. WILLIAM DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILLIAM DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to oppose the motion moved by the President. I realise, from all I can see, and from all I have heard here, that no matter what the result of the inquiry, such as it is proposed to have, is, in the long run, all the material evidence will have to be put before the jury, which is the common people in this case.  Previous to the publication of the Interim Report leading articles were written in the Irish daily newspapers that conveyed to me, at any rate, the impression that serious reflections were made upon every member of the Dáil, and any one who was a party to the refusal of publication of the evidence brought before the Committee is, in my opinion, subscribing to these charges.  I think it very unfair on the part of the people responsible for writing these leading articles to make any statements that will reflect on the good name of members <Col N="1368" /> of the Dáil without giving the names and the reasons for doing so. The President some time ago made a statement in which he pointed out that the State had to be run on honest lines. If the State has got to be run on honest lines, and if Deputies are the people to see to that, I say that no Deputy has a right to come into the Dáil and to use his position and his influence as a member, in order to promote his own selfish interests or ambitions.  If there is anything in the evidence or in the charges brought before this particular Committee, so far, that would prove that any Deputy has abused his position in that direction, I say that it is in the interests of the purity of public life of this country that it should be exposed. In moving his motion, the President stated that the Committee he proposed to set up has nothing whatever to do with broadcasting.  In my opinion it would have to deal with very serious charges that were broadcasted all over the country, reflecting on every Deputy here.  Paragraph B of the motion reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To afford an opportunity to every person directly or indirectly affected by such evidence to offer to this Committee such relevant statement in refutation of any such charge or imputation as he may think fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No matter how the Committee may have conducted its business, from what I have heard, and from what I see stated in the Interim Report, I take it that those against whom charges have been made have been given that opportunity already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a verbatim report of their evidence on record, if it is published in full, it will enable those who are entitled to judge and see who is right and who is wrong.  My main objection to this proposal is that in my opinion it sets up not what in effect is a court of inquiry but something in the nature of a judicial inquiry.  That, I think, is a policy that should not be subscribed to by Deputies, especially when personal charges are made against members.  If charges are made against Deputies that reflect on their reputations I say that the people entitled to judge are the voters who were responsible for sending them into the <Col N="1369" /> Dáil.  When those concerned appear before the electors next the electors will be given an opportunity of giving a final decision with regard to their conduct in public life.  I do not agree that this court should be set up to take out of the hands of the people to whom Deputies are responsible the right to decide when they get the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that one very important point was made in connection with this matter.  That is the question of the publication of Departmental documents which might be regarded as private.  I think if the Postmaster-General or any other Minister failed to realise the nature of the inquiry that was going on and thought fit to put in documents which he now regards as private and confidential, it is to be regretted.  Notwithstanding that, if the evidence is to be produced and published these documents have to be submitted in whatever form they were tendered before the Committee. Paragraph &ldquo;C&rdquo; states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To report to the Dáil the evidence given in support of such charges or imputations and to what extent the same are substantiated or established upon the face of the said evidence, documents and statements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it for granted, and I hope someone in favour of the motion will correct me if I am wrong, that the evidence to be given before the Committee that is proposed to be set up by the President's motion will be secret.  Therefore the findings will be arrived at by the Committee on evidence given in secret, and it will never come before the public.</P>

That might take place as a result of this motion.

      <P>Then if the President intends to submit all the evidence that has already been brought before the Committee dealing with the question of broadcasting, and if it is the intention of the President under the terms of this motion to submit all the evidence, I do not see the necessity of setting up this Committee.  At any rate I feel that the terms of this motion, so far as I can interpret them, mean that certain things or certain facts or certain documents that have been already before the Committee&mdash;whether they be of a confidential nature concerning the Postmaster-General's Department or concerning the charges about certain persons named in the Interim Report&mdash;should not be published.  As one who is extremely anxious that everything that has happened should be published I believe that if I voted for the motion I would not be serving the purpose which I have in my mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DOHERTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Dáil to discard the diversion that has been created on this motion and to come down to the purpose for which the President has moved it.  A Deputy&mdash;more <Col N="1371" /> by implication than otherwise&mdash;has been charged with offences against the dignity of the Dáil.  The President offered a Committee and I think it fully meets the case.  It is the duty of the Dáil not to delegate its duties to the courts or to lawyers or, I was going to say, to professors, but it is its duty to inquire into this business.  Deputy Cooper, who had a motion on this matter and upon which the President has now submitted his motion, took a standpoint with which I disagree.  I take a higher view.  As an old Parliamentary hand I believe that he takes the ground of expediency, whereas I take the ground of right, and I say that it is the right of the Dáil when one of its members is impeached that it should take cognisance of it and inquire into it.  Deputy O'Sullivan with something of the mediaeval mind went back to a period of a very long time ago, and I thought until I looked across the chamber that it was the Attorney-General who was speaking.  Apparently what he wished to impress on the Dáil was that nobody except a legal man could inquire whether this charge was right or wrong.  This is a plain question. A member of the Dáil is charged, or rather suggestions of charges are made against him, and it is our duty to inquire into that, and the President has fairly and honestly met it by his proposal, and I propose to vote for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. ALTON Mr. ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I advocated the formation of a Committee on the last occasion in the interests of expedition.  We were told that there was an enormous mass of evidence which would be almost impossible to print in a short time.  I thought that the best way in which the Dáil could get at the facts would be for a small Committee to select the evidence relevant to the alleged misconduct of any Deputies.  Now that the President has agreed to publish all the evidence, I, like Deputy Davin, do not see why such a Committee should be formed at all.  Members of the Dáil, perhaps, could peruse that evidence for themselves, come to their own conclusions and make motions, perhaps, as a result of the perusal of that evidence.  There is a point, however, that troubles me, like Deputy O'Sullivan, and that is the question of confidential documents.  I <Col N="1372" /> think we should respect such documents, and I think that in the publication of such evidence some steps should be taken to conceal, at least, the identity of certain officials.  If the President agrees to publish the whole of the evidence I think we might now return on our steps and go on the lines of Deputy Cooper's original motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand when this matter was under discussion before, in connection with Deputy Cooper's motion, that the reason the Committee was set up was to avoid publication of all the evidence, but possibly I may have misunderstood the position.  However, I understood that the object of the Committee was to go into this evidence, and see as a result of that inquiry what portion of it ought to be published.  I could not help feeling at the time that this Committee was being considered that under all the circumstances of the case, and taking all the interests into account, the best and wisest course for the Dáil to have adopted was to have the evidence published, and leave it to anybody who had any grievance to take any course that was open to him. In view of what has transpired since, I am convinced that is the proper line to take.  The motion the President has tabulated may elucidate matters, but I do not think it will prevent anybody who has a grievance from taking the matter further if he desires.  I am not quite satisfied how the work of the Committee is going to help to clear the atmosphere.  Clause 2 of the proposal put forward by the President states that the Committee is to give the opportunity to those aggrieved to put forward their grievances, and have an inquiry into them.  I think that is the correct interpretation of the Clause. The aggrieved parties may say that in the absence of the whole of the evidence they cannot make their case, and that they should have all the evidence and documents put before the Committee in order to make their case.  I do not see exactly how those parties who will be examined by the Committee are to make their case without the evidence. Surely if all the evidence given is to be made public it is just as well to make it public and allow these people <Col N="1373" /> to take any steps they like.  It was pointed out that a certain number of confidential documents, which I suppose would be evidence subsequently, have notes on them of a confidential character.  May I say, as a business man, that that is a practice that ought not to be encouraged in Government Departments.  Where letters are received from outside it is, of course, quite possible to attach on the file all the documents containing confidential and departmental information.  But, surely, if these letters had been received from outside bodies other than Government officials, received in the ordinary course of business, it should not be the practice of these departments to have confidential information from different officials written on the face of these letters.  As I understand&mdash;I may be wrong, possibly it is not so, and I hope it is not so&mdash;some of these letters have been received and reports attached to them.  I do not know whether it will be necessary to publish these reports, but if they have been sent in by different departments to be considered by the Committee, then I am afraid that these departments, having taken the responsibility of sending that confidential information to the Committee, will also have to accept the responsibility, in view of that action, of having the confidential information published.  So far as I can see, as one having no particular interest in the matter, I think the proper course of the Dáil would be to publish all the documents and leave the matter there.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with the President's action, but the only point I would like to bring out <Col N="1374" /> strongly is on this question of the appointment of a Committee.  In my opinion that Committee should be selected first of all for its knowledge of the law of evidence, and secondly it should be selected in such a manner that it would be far removed from any insinuation of party politics.  I think that Committee, if appointed in that manner, would present a suitable report to the Dáil a report upon which the Deputies could arrive at some conclusion. These documents published in their entirety would be things that the ordinary Deputy would not care to wade through.  Even by reading over these documents very few Deputies would be in a position to form a conclusion. If you selected a Committee of the nature I have suggested, it would put before the Dáil&mdash;who really would be the final judge in this matter&mdash;their carefully considered findings.  This Committee cannot in any way be regarded as a Court of Inquiry.  It would put before the Dáil relevant matter only, from which the Dáil could judge. Even if the entire documents were published, I believe nine-tenths of the Dáil would not be in a sufficiently well-informed position to judge.  The appointment of this Committee would also get away from the difficulty that seems to arise by the publication of confidential documents.  If those documents are relevant let them be given, by all means, but, if not, let them be kept out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'MAHONY Mr. O'MAHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, there are three methods in which this matter may be dealt with.  One is by the creation of a Committee, such as is suggested by the President; that is, a lay Committee.  From statements that have been made, that a good deal of the evidence tendered would not be tendered if the Committee was a judicial one, I think that would be placing a lay Committee in a false position to deal with this matter.  The second alternative would be the appointment of a Judicial Committee.  I certainly would favour that, as against the Committee proposed by the President.  That Committee would be able, by reason of its legal knowledge, to eliminate much of the matter that was presented in the first instance, and which ought not to come <Col N="1375" /> before the Dáil.  I think the appointment of either Committee is not advisable. We have no definite statements, by reason of which we should come to the conclusion that all the evidence should not, in the first instance, be presented to the members of the Dáil.  I am in favour of the position taken up by Deputies O'Sullivan, Davin and Good, that the better course to pursue is the publication and circulation of the evidence, and documents relating to that evidence, that was tendered to the Committee.  Then let the Dáil, or the individuals concerned, determine what their action ought to be in these circumstances. When all the evidence has been put before the Dáil, let the members be the judge of what is the desirable course to follow.  Let the individual, if he feels that he has suffered in any way, be entitled to take the initiative in defence of his personal character; but a lay Committee dealing with the voluminous evidence that has been presented to the Broadcasting Committee&mdash;evidence that admittedly is not evidence that would have been tendered under lay conditions&mdash;would only tend to make confusion worse confounded. For these reasons.  I favour the course suggested by Deputies O'Sullivan, Davin and Good.</P>

      <P>Might I intervene for a moment to say that I explained while Deputy Davin was speaking what my view was on the publication of the evidence.  It was that when the two committees would report all that matter would be submitted.  Now, to prevent any misunderstanding, and to make matters perfectly clear, and to show, as the Americans say, that Deputy Davin has not anything &ldquo;on me&rdquo; in regard to that, it was not brought out by Deputy Davin's statement, but was made by me in the first instance here when introducing the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion of the President does not quite embody what I thought the wiser procedure to adopt. But I recognise that there may have been practical difficulties in the way of carrying through what I suggested on the last occasion.  I think that the end that I sought can and will be achieved <Col N="1376" /> by this motion of the President, bearing in mind what he said in the opening, and what he has repeated two or three times, that it involves the publication of all the evidence tendered, documentary and oral, omitting only such Departmental documents as were communicated from one officer to another. Some Deputies have spoken in favour of the publication of any such documents.  Well, I take it that our intention is that the Minister responsible for the department is responsible for any matters of that kind, and that we ought not to place subordinate officers of the department in a position of direct responsibility to the Dáil, but that we should expect that the Minister will be responsible for any such procedure. If one may speak of one's knowledge as a member of the Committee, so far as my examination of the documents is concerned, nobody will be one halfpenny the worse in regard to all these documents of an inter-departmental nature, because they only deal with such matters as the wave lengths, kilowatts, and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said last week that I desired the publication of all the evidence that had been put forward, documentary and oral, but that I wanted the Dáil to be fair to every person concerned.  It is an easy thing to say publish, publish, but if publication means injustice to any citizen, and means prejudicing the position of that citizen, without giving that citizen an opportunity to state his side of the case, then I say it is not the duty of the Dáil, no matter how many newspapers demand the publication, no matter how many Deputies demand publication, to publish them.  We must be just to the persons implicated.  My desire was and is not only for publication but for justice at the same time, and any person whose name has come forward in the course of the evidence should have an opportunity to know what had been said about him and to state his answer to any such statement, and those answers should be published at the same time as the statement had been published.  That, I think, will be achieved by this procedure that the President has outlined.  While I repeat I do not think it is ideal, I believe it will serve the requisite purpose, and <Col N="1377" /> I intend to support the motion.  Now, things have been said and written and printed in regard to the attitude of the Committee and in regard to my own attitude on this matter.  I should like to say a word about that.  The Committee is with the President, and it is with Deputy Cooper, unanimously I believe, in agreeing as to the desirability of all the evidence that has been put forward being made public.  But I think with equal unanimity it is agreed that an opportunity to state any rebutting case should be given to any persons whose names have been brought into the discussion.  The rights of the Press have been pleaded, and suggestions and imputations of a desire for secrecy for the purpose of cloaking have been broadcasted.  I think, without intending it, Deputy Magennis, when he spoke&mdash;I think he used the words over-generosity on my part&mdash;was taken to have used that term as a sort of euphemism for a desire to suppress information, and that I was trying to be too lenient to culprits.  Deputy Magennis will not support that view at all, I am sure, and I think it will turn out when our desire has been attained, that any action that I have taken in this matter will certainly not support the suggestion that I have been trying to cloak any fault of anybody.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that it is by virtue of a general belief in the fairness of the Press and in Press reports that there has grown up within the last century or so a sort of tacit agreement to the right of the Press to attend public assemblies and the like.  In the main the Press has hitherto generally recognised the responsibilities which should accompany and had always to be recognised as accompanying rights in these matters.  But when one comes into contact with a Press which seems to go out of its way to suppress and distort news it raises the question in one's mind, no matter how fair one desires to be, whether that right which has been tacitly agreed upon should be maintained, and whether the recognition of responsibility should not go with rights on the part of the Press as with everybody else.</P>
    <P>One particular newspaper, the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo;&mdash;others are not much <Col N="1378" /> less culpable, if at all&mdash;is particularly offensive in the way it distorts and suppresses news.  I care not one jot about its opinions, but in its suppression and distortion of news it puts itself out of court when it demands a right of publicity, because publicity of that kind requires a fair statement of both sides of the case.  I am not expressing merely my own opinion in this matter. I am expressing an opinion that is very nearly universal and certainly representative of all shades of opinion amongst public men, and I think it well in this discussion to draw attention to that public opinion in regard to the attitude of that particular newspaper, and perhaps to a lesser extent of the newspapers in this country in general. If we could rely upon a fair presentation of a case, and if experience had not taught us that not merely sensational tit-bits would be printed, I do not suppose any member of the Committee would have formed a majority against the admission of the Press to the proceedings of that Committee.  But it was a recognition born of experience that only sensational tit-bits, prejudicial to the interests of witnesses, and of people referred to by witnesses, would be published, and not a fair portrayal of the evidence brought forward &mdash;it was that influenced them.  I desire the publication of every item of evidence, and I desire the publication of every statement in refutation of charges or imputations that may be put in by any person who feels himself aggrieved.  But I just want to say this, that the curiosity-mongers and the morbitity-merchants will say, &ldquo;What was all the pother about,&rdquo; because most of them are not so much interested in clean public affairs as they are interested in sifting out garbage.</P>

      <P>No, not precisely the same, and it is not the same wording. Nobody who listened to the debate here this day week, and also to-day, could possibly have come to any other conclusion, but that the right and proper thing to do in the peculiar circumstances surrounding this case is to publish the entire evidence bearing on broadcasting without any further delay. If there was ever any great fake built up by Press stunts in our time, it is the fake with which we are now dealing.  I remember, and many Deputies here remember, a play called &ldquo;The Showing up of Blanco Posnet.&rdquo;  This particular play was staged for a London Theatre on a certain night, and the authorities there decided, for one reason or another, that it should be proclaimed. Then it was fetched along here, and on its first appearance the Theatre was almost rushed, because of the false position created in London by its proclamation.  Two or three nights later the seats were empty.  Now, that is precisely what you are dealing with here.  You have had before this Committee, the dry, uninteresting matter-of-fact Departmental evidence, as to why a particular scheme set forth by it should be accepted in preference to some other scheme, and you have had numerous countless little and big documents bearing upon that.  Now, in addition to this matter-of-fact material, you have had just what one might term an interesting diversion&mdash;something that gave the proceedings an element or appearance of sensation.  An arrangement was made between a member of one of the participating companies and a member of this House&mdash; an arrangement dating back some eighteen months or two years ago&mdash;an arrangement that.  perhaps, once thrown upon the full public screen may not after all prove to be such an extraordinary, or such a mighty, sensation as appeared on the surface.  That is all you have&mdash;nothing more or less than dry Departmental material, bearing on a proposal brought forward by the Minister, on the one hand, and an arrangement which may, or may not, be moral depending very much upon the mind <Col N="1380" /> of the particular reader, between two individuals, dating back a couple of years ago.  There is the whole thing that we have had this Press mountain built upon.  My own opinion is that those of the public who read this evidence will regard it as a waste of time.  They will find that they have been grievously misled and very seriously disappointed; that, as a matter of fact, there is nothing in the whole affair. If the evidence bearing on broadcasting had been made public from the start, all this talk and annoyance would have been avoided.  I do not say for one instant that the Committee prevented the Press from being present; I do not suppose the matter ever arose, and, in all probability, if it had arisen at the outset, the Committee would have had no great objection to inviting the Press.  It only arose when half the investigation was through, and had the Press been introduced at that stage, I do agree it is quite possible that quite an erroneous impression might have been created from the evidence adduced from that forward.  I do think the Committee were justified in not permitting the Press to come along at that stage, but I think, in the light of what has happened in the interval, it would have been better to have admitted them from the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy reminds me that it was never refused.  That is true; it was never refused. This must be said for the Committee: the Press was well aware of the first meeting of the Broadcasting Committee and it was then their duty to make the application.  I do say this, further, that if the Committee should decide, even now, to permit the Press to be present at its meetings, it ought likewise to insist that nothing but a verbatim report should appear in the Press&mdash;not a garbled report.  It is possible for the Press grossly, and perhaps unintentionally, to mislead the reader in regard to the evidence.  I do not agree with the President's proposal in this matter, for the very obvious reason that it does not matter how many Committee you set up or what the findings of the Committee will be in regard to this whole subject, you will not convince the public that something has not been withheld. You are simply wasting <Col N="1381" /> your time and the public will tell you that these Committees are being set up to blindfold them.  We know that is not the case but no argument here will convince the public that it is not.  Because of that fact, it is our duty to invite them to be their own Committee, to be their own judge and jury and to place the material for their judgement right into their hands.  It is a pity it was not done long ago.  I would appeal to the Dáil as a member responsible for at least some of the trouble&mdash;responsible for the department&mdash;here and now to decide that this farce has gone far enough and that the time has come when the public must get what they look for&mdash;the evidence. I therefore, wish to move the amendment which I have just read and I sincerely hope the House will endorse it.</P>

      <P>In order that there may be no misunderstanding I should say that I am informed that the evidence on which the interim report was based would occupy about 500 columns&mdash;that is to say about 250 pages&mdash;of the Official Report, or about half of one of the bound volumes.  The printing of that, I understand, would <Col N="1382" /> take at least three weeks.  Then there are other considerations which Deputies, if they are going to discuss this matter to a conclusion, should have regard to.  If, as is usual, the witnesses who appeared before the Committee are to be given proofs of their evidence and allowed a day or two days for verbal corrections, another delay of a week or more would be involved.  It is pointed out to me by the people responsible, that the Postmaster-General, for example, was examined on more than five occasions and that if his evidence were submitted to him he would require a certain amount of time to read it before publication.</P>

      <P>Strange to say, I took the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; out of the amendment myself.  I am not making the point in order to rule this amendment out of order, but on a different question altogether.  Deputy Cooper proposed a motion on Thursday, the 14th February, and withdrew <Col N="1384" /> it on a certain understanding.  The President agreed that he would bring in a motion which he then thought would meet with the wishes of every member of the Dáil.  He has done so, and it is clear that the motion does not meet with the approval of every member of the Dáil.  Subsequent to the withdrawal of Deputy Cooper's motion I stated that there was nothing to prevent Deputy Cooper bringing his motion on again.  Without adverting to the question of order, I wonder whether, if the motion is being persisted in, the Postmaster-General would not allow Deputy Cooper to move his original motion, if he so desires.  If Deputy Cooper does not so desire, the Postmaster-General could move this one.</P>

      <P>May I point out that the two are consistent? It is the understanding of the Dáil that all the evidence is to be printed and circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughKennedy" hpid="ATTORNEY-GENERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL">
      <NameTxt>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no inconsistency between the President's motion and the unanimous understanding of the Dáil that the evidence will be printed and circulated.  I suggest it is not really an amendment but a substantive motion.  I do not know whether the President would accept it in conjunction with his own motion.  It seems to me that the two are quite consistent. The President goes further. He offers an opportunity, as Deputy Johnson has explained, to persons who may be affected by this evidence.  One gathers that there are persons outside the Dáil whose names came up in the course of the inquiry, and the motion gives them an opportunity of putting their answer on record and having it published at the same time as the evidence. I think the general sense is that this evidence is to be all printed and published, and that this special Committee was for the purpose of seeing that there should be justice done to people against whom charges may be published under the protection of the privilege of the Dáil.  Someone has said &ldquo;Leave them to their own course; <Col N="1385" /> leave them to their own initiative.&rdquo;  If you do that, they have to act without the protection of the privilege that they would get by publication through the records of the Dáil.  I suggest that in common justice to these people it is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>I want to make one observation with reference to something that Deputy Davin said.  It is this: that I would ask the Dáil not to close down by accepting Deputy Davin's view, the possibility of the Dáil considering the conduct of any Deputy.  I think it is recognised as one of the powers of the Parliament, if, for instance, disgraceful conduct has been shown against a Deputy, to consider certain action.  Deputy Davin rather indicated that such a course was not to be considered.  I merely mentioned it for the purpose of protesting, as I could not accept that view, and I suggest it to the Dáil.  I would urge that the Postmaster-General's motion is not an amendment.  The sense of the Dáil is that all the evidence should be published, but I am sure the sense of justice of the Dáil will be that, in the terms of the President's motion, persons whose names, from whatever motive, appear on the face of that evidence, should be given an opportunity of making, under the same protection of the privileges of the Dáil, their answer to any imputations that may have been put on record against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed to withdraw my motion in favour of that of the Postmaster-General for two reasons.  It is not that the Postmaster-General has, in the language of &ldquo;Blanco Posnet,&rdquo;&ldquo;staked out my claim.&rdquo;  I have no feeling of that kind whatever.  I put this motion on the paper as an ordinary average individual member of the Dáil, not concerned in this dispute in any way whatever.  If this matter is to be investigated, it should be investigated, either on the motion of the leader of the Dáil, or on the motion of some ordinary member not concerned.  The Postmaster-General is one of the parties to this dispute, and it would give the whole thing a wrong focus if we act on his motion. That is my first reason.  My second reason refers to a difficulty referred to in more than one quarter, the fact that <Col N="1386" /> official documents, and the views of individual officials, have been laid before the Committee.  I agree that it would be absolutely wrong to place these officials in a position where they might be held up to criticism or odium.  The person responsible for laying these documents before the Committee was the Postmaster-General.  He did it with a good motive.  He wished to show that he was keeping nothing back, but was placing all his cards on the table.  But his action was entirely contrary to constitutional precedent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is responsible for his officials and cannot devolve blame on the shoulders of his officials if he acts on the advice or refuses the advice of his officials.  He is the sole person responsible, and ought not, by putting in the views of his officials, attempt to divert responsibility from his own shoulders.  That is an important issue from the constitutional point of view and from the whole working of the Civil Service.  I feel bound to assert that view.  If Deputy Magennis wishes to correct me he can do so.  For these two reasons I do not feel disposed to withdraw any claim I may have.  I would suggest that it is evident the President's proposals do not meet with anything like the unanimous approval of the Dáil.  It is very important in this matter that we should have as much unanimity as possible.  Would it meet the case&mdash;I put it forward as a suggestion&mdash;if on Wednesday I were to revive my motion in this form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the evidence submitted to the Wireless Broadcasting Committee and the documents read in connection therewith, or on which evidence was taken, together with any other statements relevant to the matter, should be printed and circulated&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I say any other statements relevant to the matter I wish to meet points raised by Deputy Johnson and by the Attorney-General.  I think it is only common fairness that when a person's name has been mentioned in evidence, and where he may even be ignorant that his name has been mentioned, he should be sent a proof of the references <Col N="1387" /> made to him and be entitled to submit any statement he wishes in reply. Any such statements may be provided as an appendix to the evidence and will then be protected by the privilege of the Dáil.  There will be no unfairness to anyone.  Any statements that have been made, the person about whom they have been made will be entitled to refute them.  That will get over the question of publication of what may seem one-sided or partial evidence.  I hope that that suggestion may commend itself to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy proceeds I wish to say that I misunderstood the word &ldquo;forthwith,&rdquo; and I took it out as being unnecessary. From what the Attorney-General has stated, it appears that the Postmaster-General intended the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; to have a meaning, and it should be left in.  That is to say, he intends that the evidence taken up to the presentation of the Interim Report, or the evidence taken up to date should be printed at the earliest possible moment. Does the Postmaster-General mean by the amendment to delete all words after &ldquo;that&rdquo; in the motion&mdash;&ldquo;That a committee be appointed&rdquo;&mdash; and substitute &ldquo;all evidence, oral and written, tendered to the Special Committee on Wireless Broadcasting, and on which the Interim Report was based, be printed and circulated to the Deputies forthwith?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the only issue is whether a new committee should be set up, or whether the original committee should take charge of the publication of the report.  That is the residuum of the discussion.  Probably the best reason why the present committee should be relieved of this particular responsibility is that it wants to do its original work.  If that question is going to trouble the Dáil very much I have no doubt that the Committee will be quite agreeable to post pone its original work, if the Dáil decides, so that the preparation of the evidence for publication shall be proceeded with first.  I suggest that the motion and the amendment might well be embodied in one motion, and the sense of the Dáil taken upon it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the word &ldquo;preparation&rdquo; should not be allowed to create in the minds of Deputies or anybody else the idea that anyone will in any way tamper with the evidence.  There is a necessary gap between the motion of the Dáil directing the evidence to be published and the actual appearance of the printed document. The documents are now ready to be sent to the printer, so that preparation to that extent is over.  The difference appears to be whether the evidence should be published now; that the Editor of Debates should simply take what he has now and give it to the printers, read the proofs and get it published and circulated; or that Paragraph B. of the motion of the President should be acted on, either by the Broadcasting Committee or some other Committee.  If that is the difference that Deputy Johnson alludes to, &ldquo;forthwith,&rdquo; I think, in the Postmaster-General's mind excludes that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">

      <P>The Postmaster-General speaks of the general sense of the Dáil.  I deprecate an important decision being arrived at in that very nebulous fashion, if indeed one could say a decision is arrived at at all.  I remember on a former occasion, in the last Dáil, I voted for a speech of a Minister, and found afterwards that what I was bound to was a resolution to which the speech had little or no relevance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I voted for the resolution because of the representations held out by the Minister in the speech.  The bait was withdrawn when the voters had entered the trap.  The <Col N="1390" /> President undertook to feel the pulse and test the temperature of the Dáil on the last occasion, and came to the conclusion that the trend of opinion was altogether in a certain direction.  Now it transpires that the trend was altogether the other way&mdash;an additional reason why we should not assume that there is a general consensus of opinion. There is only one way of knowing what is the general consensus of opinion, and that is by having it declared specifically. Deputy Cooper is a great authority upon constitutional practice and procedure in another legislative assembly, and because he is, he has been unconsciously misled into something which is not quite fair to the Postmaster-General. We have become so accustomed to belabouring the Postmaster-General that it is quite refreshing to have an opportunity of saying something in his favour.</P>

      <P>Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>An External Ministry is responsible directly and exclusively to the Dáil.  At least, it is until the Ministers Bill has been passed.  When this Broadcasting Committee was appointed to inquire into the White Paper, and began its session, we demanded every document from the Postmaster-General's Department that had any bearing whatsoever upon the inquiry we instituted.  Certain officials of his Department pleaded privilege, that documents were confidential.  We told them that there could be no plea of confidence set up between a Committee of the whole Dáil and an External Ministry. Whereupon every document of every complexion and character was given to us.  That is the explanation of how we came to have this monument of memoranda before us.  It is hardly fair to say that the Postmaster-General is now trying to escape the responsibility for this, and trying to hide a secret by selecting so many of these documents <Col N="1391" /> which are to be published and no more. A point I made on the previous debate and which I desire to repeat now, is that some of these things are utterly irrelevant to the interim report, and they have no bearing on the decision we arrived at.  Deputy Davin, in his very admirable speech on the question before the interval, spoke of evidence where he meant documents.  There was no irrelevant evidence; there were irrelevant documents.  I, unfortunately&mdash; I regret it exceedingly&mdash;in supporting Deputy Cooper's motion on the last occasion, pointed out the fact that some of these were memoranda of a routine order, such as &ldquo;Yours of the 23rd received. Due attention will be paid to it.&rdquo;  Others were scribbled notes of subordinates for the information of their chief.  I suggested that these need not necessarily be published, as they would add unnecessarily to the bulk of the book.  That mild suggestion, to keep out irrelevant documents, was immediately construed by some Deputies &mdash;Deputy Wilson worked himself into a fervour of pious indignation&mdash;as a proposal to suppress evidence.  Now, at the end of it all, it is declared by the President, in his proposal for this new Committee, that sooner or later all this must out.  Why not then let it out? Already the printers would have been at work upon it, and it would have been nearer publication.  I think already there is a great deal of confusion which makes confusion worse confounded. Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out that the proposal is to set up a Committee of five Deputies&mdash;not five judges but five Deputies&mdash;representative, I presume, of the various parties in the Dáil.  What are they to do?  Into what are they to inquire?  The transcript of evidence is to be set before them, and they are to find out if in it there are charges or implications made against any Deputy or other person in the course of the proceedings. That is the first stage, but there is a further stage.  When we have discovered that there are charges, we are then to afford every opportunity to every person who thinks himself aggrieved, to bring forward any statement in repudiation of any such charge as he may think fit.  There are two <Col N="1392" /> functions, therefore, to be discharged by this new Committee.  First, it is to edit&mdash;I use that in a technical sense&mdash; and to consider all the evidence, oral and documentary, and to find out if there are imputations in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is then to notify the Dáil that there is an imputation against A, B or C of such a tenor.  Then A, B or C, if he thinks it worth while, is to come forward to defend himself.  Thereupon this becomes a judicial inquiry.  You can call it what you like, but a name will not alter its judicial nature, and it is to consider whether these imputations are well-founded, so that any chance remark that occurred during the evidence that might be deemed by a super-sensitive person as a reflection on his honour or integrity comes before the Committee.  Then on whom is the onus?  Suppose that some of those who made the charges refuse to proceed, not because they cannot sustain the charges but because they have lost all interest in the matter and will not bother further, then those against whom no charge is made&mdash;I am assuming there is a charge&mdash;will, as a County Court Judge said on a famous occasion, leave the court without any further stain on their character.  All this is in substitution for printing the evidence as taken by the Committee.  I was present when Deputy Davin said what I am saying now and twice he was told by the President that that was not so.  I have read this document carefully, and I cannot find anything to the effect that the evidence as taken by the original Committee is to be published.  There is not one syllable of a reference to that in the document.  If the Dáil passes this resolution what has it done?  It has come at least to one conclusion, namely, that the proceedings of the Broadcasting Committee were, if not irregular, at least incomplete, and that they required supplementing in some such fashion as this.  Yet the Dáil, after agreeing to some proposals not quite specifically disclosed, proceeded to pass by unanimous vote the interim report furnished by that Committee, although the Committee did not mention one reason in support of three-fourths of their findings.  You will have this Dáil, at one and the same time, supporting <Col N="1393" /> the Committee in its findings, and likewise setting up another Committee to do in proper fashion what it had not done in proper fashion.  I submit that it is not quite consistent. It is not consistent logically, and not consistent with the dignity of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to the way in which the business of the Committee was conducted, it is necessary that I should explain a phrase I used on a former occasion and to which Deputy Johnson has referred.  It appears that my speech on that occasion was a colossal blunder, or rather a series of small blunders.  I began by declaring that we must all be filled with admiration for the generosity of Deputy Johnson's attitude in the matter.  That is taken to mean that I spoke ironically, sarcastically, and that I meant that he was trying to cloak someone and that it was very kind, nice, and charitable of him to attempt to do so.  What I intended was something very different.  We had the leader of the Opposition doing what leaders of Opposition very rarely do, taking an attitude which was rather in favour of the side he was supposed to oppose.  It would have been popular, highly popular if he had joined in the cry to publish the evidence, as we are now more than ever aware, but he deliberately took the unpopular attitude of saying: &ldquo;No, let us not publish all the evidence because that would be unfair to certain witnesses who spoke without reticence in the belief that they were speaking, more or less, in camera and that the evidence would not be broadcasted to the public at large.&rdquo;  Further, Deputy Johnson said that he himself had put questions and conducted the inquiry in a manner which he believed was not quite on the lines of absolute regularity.  In that way he took the blame upon himself for whatever irregularity might be alleged in the conduct of the inquiry.  All these things excited my admiration.  It was magnanimous on his part.  I think it is due to Deputy Johnson to make that explanation, in view of the fact that those who look for other meanings can always find other meanings when they search for them.  I support Deputy Johnson's view to a certain limit.  It would be unfair, no doubt, to publish <Col N="1394" /> the evidence extorted at times, because occasionally the examining inquirers adopted in their eagerness to extract the truth rather the attitude of prosecuting counsel.  Then I said that these are the accidents of life.  What I thought would be perfectly understood was this.  There are others concerned besides those witnesses who, as Deputy Johnson said, told more of the truth than they desired to tell had they legal assistance.  There are others concerned.</P>
    <P>There is the Postmaster-General, for example.  Charges were made against him, and when we dealt with them we found them wholly baseless after our investigation.  I have been charged with cloaking the Postmaster-General. People will not believe that these were honest findings.  I have been reproached that I have lent myself to a conspiracy to find a false verdict in favour of the Postmaster-General. When these stories are being circulated, sensational reports continue to be made about the suppression of truth.  I think there is nobody in the Dáil who will not support the Postmaster-General in the demand that all the documents and all the evidence given by witnesses in examination shall be published forthwith. It is due to him.  This inquiry in substitution may last for a considerable time, and, then and only then, when this has ceased to have any interest for the public, and when other nine days' wonders have cropped up, the evidence will be published, and it will then be stale and uninteresting.  What will not be stale is the recollection of these scandalous stories that circulate in the whispering galleries of Dublin.  These will not be forgotten.  I hold that when a Minister is impugned and maligned in this fashion it is the prime interest and concern of the Dáil to see if there is any remedy, and that that remedy should be instantly applied.  To my mind the remedy is clear&mdash;the publication forthwith of this evidence.  If I am not too long&mdash;and I am tempted to be too long this time, for, in my efforts to be brief on the former occasion I produced a misunderstanding, especially a misunderstanding regarding a Deputy I hold in the highest esteem, Deputy Johnson&mdash;it is proposed to report <Col N="1395" /> to the Dáil the evidence given in support of such charges and imputations. What charges or imputations? Where are they to be found?  I invite you, Sir, to bring your mind back to the occasion on which Deputy Cooper moved this proposal.  What charges or imputations were then before the Dáil with regard to any Deputy?  I submit none whatever, except those connected with the Postmaster-General, and alongside the mention of these charges was the declaration that they had been gone into and had been found to be wholly baseless.  Another Deputy's name was mentioned, it is true, but there was no charge made against him in the interim report.</P>
    <P>The interim report said, that amongst the documents on the file furnished by the Postmaster-General, was a document in which Mr. Andrew Belton purported to make revelations as to the relations which existed between him and Deputy Figgis, at a period long anterior to the broadcasting project. There is the first mention of a Deputy, and the report goes on to say: &ldquo;We inquired into these charges and counter-charges only in so far as was requisite to enable us to form a clear judgement as to whether Mr. Belton was a fit person to be a State Concessionaire.&rdquo; I hold there is no charge in that against Deputy Figgis, no charge that any reasonably-minded man could discover. There is the statement that charges are made against him by Mr. Belton, and the statement that we did not investigate these.  It was none of our business; whereupon it is proposed to set up a quasi judicial inquiry, to be carried out by members of the Dáil into these charges, into charges that do not exist, into charges that have not been formulated.  I could very well understand that proposal being made if the evidence had been circulated, and had been read, and that someone had said here at a subsequent stage to the initiation of the broadcasting inquiry, that: &ldquo;Documents containing charges against the Deputy have been furnished, and we cannot let this rest here. We must go into it.&rdquo;  That would be the natural order, but this unnatural course is pursued, that before the report <Col N="1396" /> in which that incidental reference to the Deputy is contained, before that report is given to the Dáil for its consideration, a proposition is made in favour of making some inquiry into the charges and imputations.  What the Dáil was asked to do was to consider the report of gossips and evil-tongued critics, rather than to discuss something that has officially come under our notice. I hold with the Attorney-General, that when there is something that affects the honour of a Deputy, and in that way incidentally affects the honour of the Dáil, it is not only the privilege but the duty of the Dáil to investigate it.  What is so far disclosed that affects the Dáil?  If Mr. Belton, or Mr. A.B.C. or D., or any other letter of the alphabet, makes any charge against any member of the Dáil, is the Dáil to set up a Court of Inquiry into it?  Is it fair to do so?  If so, we shall have nothing else to do for the rest of our existence.  Any scurrilous newspaper whatever may accuse me of robbing a bank, whereupon a Judicial Committee is set up to inquire into that, and if anybody, say, the bank manager or the messenger, or whoever is responsible for locking up the doors at night, thinks he is implicated in the matter, he is to be represented by Counsel before the Committee, and solemn judgement is to be delivered for the benefit of the Dáil. The thing is ridiculous.  I submit the proper course to follow, now that this unhappy situation has arisen, is to try to make the best and not the worst of it, and to make the best of it is to admit frankly that the Committee did pursue a course that, after all, was occasionally in the nature of a roving inquiry, but yet it pursued its main objective, and that there is no necessity to create another inquiry to supersede the Committee, for it is, after all, superseding it.</P>
    <P>I withdraw my proposal of a former occasion to except certain documents, for on consideration I find it need not be done.  Here is a simple expedient.  I learn that the Clerk of the Committee had the foresight and industry to stamp every document, and every single page of every document, officially, and to number it, and he has entered in the index every document that was received. <Col N="1397" /> Now, it is quite easy when publication is made, to have the documents that are particularly pertinent to the evidence, given to the public, then along with them in the appendix, a list of every other document, and to allow any member of the Press, or any inquisitive member of the public whose motives can be guaranteed to be in the interests of truth and sound history, to consult these, and they will find that nothing in the nature of evidence is being suppressed. That is a simple and practical expedient.  What will the public whose attitude of suspicion has been heightened by all these debates and by the articles that have been written on them, think?  Simply that the Dáil has been informed secretly by members of the Committee that there are dreadful things, terrible scandals, and that if the evidence were to be published the Dáil might close its doors, and the Government might shut down and retire from business, and that what we are doing is attempting to give the public something else to be interested in, which will appear to be the same thing.  You remember the famous work of Swift, &ldquo;The Tale of a Tub.&rdquo;  It reminds me of the expedient employed by sailors long ago in the days of wooden vessels, when a whale was coming too near the vessel, and in sportive mood, might at one stroke of its fluke smash the timbers of the vessel, and send all hands to the bottom of the sea.  Barrels and tubs were thrown out for the whale to play with and keep it off.  Meanwhile, the ship took a different course, and got out of the danger zone.  This motion will be regarded as a tub thrown out to the great whale of the public to play with, and let it forget all about the evidence taken by the Broadcasting Committee. Is that desirable?  After all, the wisest happens to be the most courageous course in this matter.  Publish everything in the way that I have suggested. I realise, after the speech of Deputy Seán Milroy and the speech of Deputy Wilson, that if the Postmaster-General were to persist in his proposal, that even the least little document should be left out, that there are wise people who would regard it as a proposal to suppress evidence.</P>
    <P>So, since there is confusion in the public mind between documents laid before <Col N="1398" /> the Committee, to read or not, as the Committee pleases, and actual evidence given, considered and utilised as part of the machinery in bringing about our decision&mdash;since there is such confusion, then let us have everything published.  It will cost a little more to publish, but public anxiety will have been allayed, and good work will have been done, namely, it will have been proved up to the hilt that the allegations audaciously made and frequently repeated had nothing in them and had nothing to support them, and the public will learn not to be so receptive in the future of scandalous stories circulated about public men.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a personal correction, arising out of Deputy Magennis' speech, if you do not mind my doing so.  The Deputy, no doubt unintentionally, referred to some charges that had been made against me. Of course, he knows that no charges were made against me at any time.  I expect he will be able to correct that part of his speech.  What is more grave and equally necessitating a correction is the remark made by Deputy Cooper, to the effect that I am attempting to discard the responsibilities, or rather to shift on to the shoulders of my subordinates my responsibilities.  The Committee knows well that I was requested to furnish all and every document bearing on this subject, and that I did so frankly and fully without any reservation. In other words, I simply complied with the request from the Committee, nothing more or less.  To accuse me now, as Deputy Cooper has accused me, of trying to shift my responsibility for the conduct of my Department to my subordinates is grossly unfair and improper, and not worthy of a Deputy of the standing of Deputy Cooper, who certainly ought to know better</P>

      <P>I was a perfunctory seconder of the President's resolution. I seconded it mainly for the purpose of putting it in order and enabling it to be discussed and also because at the time it seemed to me the most proper course to adopt in connection with this business.  The speeches made by Deputy Cooper and Deputy Magennis have changed my view.  I believe now that the best course that the Dáil could adopt would be to have all the evidence and all the documents which have been submitted to the Committee published, after an opportunity had been given to anyone mentioned in that evidence or in those documents, to submit any statement they wish to submit, which would be published together with the documents and the evidence considered by the Committee.  After that, if the Dáil, or any member of the Dáil, was of opinion that the public character and conduct of any member of the Dáil was seriously affected by the published <Col N="1400" /> evidence and documents, it would be open to any particular Deputy to move that a Committee of the Dáil be set up to inquire into these matters which seem to affect the public character and conduct of that particular Deputy.  I merely wish to state that having seconded the original motion my view has been changed by the statements that I have listened to this afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unnecessary, I expect, to go into any further explanation of the matter of introducing this motion.  I explained when introducing it that I made a certain interpretation of the discussion which took place here on Friday last.  Out of twelve Deputies who have spoken, six favoured a proposal of this sort, and five were apparently against it.  I thought that the numbers were stronger in favour of it and my interference to produce a motion of this sort, was on the assumption that there would be general support for it.  I also stated that if the Postmaster-General, when introducing this motion, were to have asked for the printing and circulation of the evidence at the time the interim report was under consideration that we could not refuse him.  We cannot now, in view of the action the Postmaster-General has taken, refuse to give him this evidence and have it printed and circulated. I object, however, to giving a direction to the responsible Committee of the Dáil, I would have preferred to have let the Committee itself order the printing and circulation of the evidence. I deliberately excluded from this motion any interference with the Committee.  If names have been mentioned in the course of the evidence, and if those people have not been acquainted with the statements made about them, or have not been given an opportunity of appearing before the Committee, it is not quite fair to them. It is unfair to them.  And I adhere to my own view&mdash;it may be looked upon as an aesthetic view.  At first I was inclined to move an addition to the resolution which, I take it, is Deputy Cooper's resolution that is now before the Dáil, and not the resolution of the Postmaster-General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another <Col N="1403" /> point.  There seems to be general opinion in the Dáil that it is not a desirable thing that confidential memos., written by Civil Servants to their Ministers, should be published.  I do not know whether we have drifted into the position in this particular case that those memos ought to be published.  If we have it might be desirable that the memos should not appear in print over the names of those people who wrote them.  Those people cannot very well come into the public light.  They wrote those things in confidence and they had no idea at the time that they were going to appear in print or in the newspapers. If the idea is once broadcasted in the Civil Service, that whatever one official writes to another official or to his Minister will be liable to appear in print and in the newspapers, there will not be the same confidence in Departments and you will not have advice or suggestions given with the same candour as would be the case if these things would not be published.</P>
      <P>It might lead to the setting up of a custom to give advice verbally, and have no minutes written.  At present all advice and suggestions, in the form of minutes, are written.  An official would say in a written minute what he would say in conversation.  He usually writes it in a particular way, and if he once thought it would be liable to be published subsequently, he would write with greater care, and the same confidence and candour would not be expressed. I think that the privilege of confidence in the Civil Service should be retained.  I do not know whether it would be possible to leave certain statements, which may be of no importance, out.  The publication of a lot of them, which might be really of no importance, would possibly cause embarrassment. If we do decide on publishing those memos. at the present moment, I think they ought to be published without the signatures of those who signed them.</P>

If the Minister puts forward an amendment <Col N="1404" /> to cover that matter I would be glad to accept it.  The mere omission of names, however, would not be of much value because the context would invariably show who the official was.</P>

      <P>Yes&mdash;things that do not concern outside people.  They were not letters that were sent out from the office, or recived in the office.  Any documents which the whole Committee unanimously thinks should be published, ought to be published; but documents that the Committee think are of a nature not relevant to the main subject matter&mdash;merely official advice or inter-official communications&mdash;might be left out with the Committee's consent. Obviously there are documents that ought to be published and that are quite relevant.  There is no objection in that case.  But the official memos., written in the way of minutes from one official to another, or to the chief, ought to be left out.</P>

      <P>Since the interim report was published the Committee has met and considered further documents. I suggest that all documents that have come before the Committee up to the present time be issued as soon as they can go through the printer's hands.  If it is intended that we are to continue adding to the volume of evidence, it means that the publication of these documents will be deferred practically until the Committee makes its final report, which I think would be undesirable.  I suggest that all documents at present in possession of the Committee be sent for publication, and if subsequent ones require publication that they be published in a separate volume.  If Deputy Magennis had been as lucid on the last occasion as he was to-day, I certainly would have given him the support I intend to give to his suggestions to-day. Further consideration brought me to doubt the wisdom of setting up a tribunal to investigate these charges. If there are matters in these documents that are libellous, the parties aggrieved or who consider themselves aggrieved have a proper remedy.</P>

I think the Dáil will subscribe to that.  Deputies do not want part of the evidence before the Committee to be printed; they want the whole of it to be printed. I do say, in connection with these Departmental files, that the Committee itself might be trusted to exercise a wise discretion in respect of the documents that would be included in the Report. Other than that, I do not think any direction ought to be given to the Committee. They surely appreciate the position as well as the head of a Department or a Minister and will act accordingly.

      <P>Perhaps I can throw a little light on the matter. Yesterday we entered upon part II. of the inquiry&mdash;hearing exclusively expert witnesses.  All the evidence that comes to us from expert witnesses might be published with the Final Report, and all that preceded that with the First Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to warn Deputies that if they are not careful they are going to do an injustice they will be sorry for.  Evidence must be submitted, since the Interim Report was issued to give an opportunity to persons implicated to state their side of the case.  If you cut off the evidence at the date of the Interim Report, those people will have a grievance, and have a right to complain of our unfairness and injustice.  I think we ought to guard against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor MAGENNIS Professor MAGENNIS">
      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>That is guarded against by publication of the evidence up to yesterday, and from yesterday forward.  All the evidence from yesterday forward is exclusively technical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect, I do not think that is so, because those persons who gave evidence are unaware up to the present that that evidence is to be published.  Deputy Johnson's point is that if we are now to decide to print that evidence up to a certain date without giving these people an opportunity of putting forward any rebutting evidence, we will do them injury and injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened most attentively to the discussion, and my idea is that the House is in favour of making public the evidence leading up to the Report.  Before that evidence is published each of the witnesses would be sent a copy of the evidence in the form in which it was proposed to publish it; if that party felt aggrieved and wished to make any statement in connection with the evidence, that statement was to be received and published in the form of an appendix, so that persons would have an opportunity to qualify some points that arose in the evidence.  Thereby I hold no injustice would be done, and I understand that could be agreed upon by the House.  But if we start supplementing the evidence after the Report we are only going to deal with subsequent matter not referred to in the Report, and I think it is advisable in the first publication that we should concentrate on what led up to the Report and what is in the Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could help by giving some dates.  If we were instructed that all the evidence taken up to the present should be published, then we could give instructions to have the matter sent to the printer in the morning.  The printer will send proofs here, and proofs of each person's evidence will be sent to the person who gave the evidence.  These persons will be told that verbal corrections will be required within a certain limited time. Suppose we take it that one volume of the evidence up to the present be printed; that certainly will not be ready until the 16th March.  Now, Deputy Johnson's difficulty appears to be that persons who may wish to make any relevant statements in relation to the evidence will have to be heard after this date, after to-day&mdash;that is the point.  We can give instructions to the Committee that all the evidence taken after this date be published too, and since I shall have instructions from the Dáil, I can get the evidence, as it comes in, printed, so that when the Committee presents its final report we will have the whole thing together.  That is the only suggestion, so far as I know, that would get us out of all the difficulty Let the Committee continue to meet until the 14th of March, and print all the evidence together; that is, everything taken before the 14th of March. The delay, as I say, is inconsiderable. If you take all the evidence up to the present, and have it sent to the printer, the interval between this and the 14th March is not great.  I do not know if that meets with everyone's approval, but we must decide upon something.</P>

      <P>We are told that it is necessary to send proofs of evidence to witnesses.  I quite agree that is essential, because some blunders in the official Report are of the most extraordinary type, quite the reverse of the sense of what one said.  I am quite sure they are unconscious.  In addition I think the suggestion has been made that they should have an opportunity to put in rebutting evidence to the evidence given by other witnesses.  Is that so?  That would mean that they would have to be supplied with copies of the evidence of all the witnesses who happened to mention their name, which I think would be a rather cumbersome and prolonged procedure.</P>

      <P>May I make a suggestion?  It has been before you, sir, for a very considerable time that the Dáil generally wishes to have the evidence and other matters printed and circulated to members.  I take it that you, in the exercise of your functions as Ceann Comhairle, can order that to be done, having learned that that is the sense of the Dáil.  There are other smaller matters of detail or <Col N="1413" /> matters which ought to be put in what I might call&mdash;if it is not a disrespectful term&mdash;a fool-proof motion.  I would therefore suggest that we leave over the final terms of the motion until Wednesday, and that the Ceann Comhairle in the meantime should see that no time is lost in having the evidence and documents printed, so that the Dáil will have them as if we had passed a resolution to-day.  If that would meet with the approval of the Dáil I would be prepared to move the adjournment and bring in a motion in perfect order on Wednesday.</P>

      <P>Surely the President is not going to suggest that we are going to have another field-day over this?  It seems to me that we have threshed out the thing <i>ad nauseam</i>, and that we ought to be in a position to make up our minds at this point.  The only thing that is suggested at present is that some persons' names&mdash;I know very little even about the whispering gallery in the House&mdash;may have been implicated in the proceedings up to a certain date and that they ought to have an opportunity of putting forward rebutting evidence. Surely the Committee would be in a position before the final date, or what might be called the appointed day, of giving everybody an opportunity of going before the Committee and by that means getting their evidence into the Blue Book that is going to be published on this subject?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstood me.  I would not like it to <Col N="1414" /> go on the records of this Dáil that a motion was passed here which by any stretch of the imagination could be interpreted as meaning injustice to any person.  The Attorney-General takes up the stand that he must object to that motion unless he is satisfied that justice is going to be meted out to certain individuals.  There are other people here who think that there is no such injustice at all.  I am sure it is not the desire of any person that there should be any doubt regarding that matter. Leaving the matter over from this until Wednesday simply means putting down a motion of five or six lines which would meet with the approval of the Dáil, a mere matter of form, not meaning a debate, and that, in the meantime the Ceann Comhairle, by reason of the general approval of the Dáil, should get the matter printed.</P>

This decision was duly conveyed to the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>John McGrath, Stephen Street, Waterford, claimed benefit on December 31st, 1923.  As his account with the Unemployment Fund showed that no contributions had been paid in respect of him during the Insurance Year 1922-23 the claim had to be disallowed under Section 8 (4) on January the 28th.  It subsequently transpired that he had served in the National Army and was entitled to contributions under Section 7 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1923.  Accordingly on February <Col N="1344" /> the 16th, authority was issued permitting payment of benefit to a maximum of 59 days, and he will be paid all benefits due to him to-day.</P>
    <P>David Butler, Lower Newtown, Waterford, claimed benefit on January the 21st, 1924.  As no contributions had been paid in respect of him during the 1922-1923 Insurance Year he was disqualified for the receipt of benefit under Section 8 (4) of the Act of 1920. His case is, however, being investigated with a view to the payment of further contributions which it is thought may be due for him.  If and when those are paid his case will be reconsidered, and any benefit due will be paid without delay.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he can see his way to recommend a dependents' allowance to Henry Burgess, Long Lane, Celbridge, Co. Kildare, on account of the service of his son, Corporal Patrick Burgess, No. 40894, 1st Battalion, Transport Corps, Hope Castle, Castleblayney, Co.

      <P>Mr. Burgess's claim has been disallowed on the ground that the amount normally contributed by his son, Patrick, towards the maintenance of the home for a reasonable period prior to enlistment was less than the minimum required by the regulations, namely, 12s. per week, before an allowance might be issued.</P>
