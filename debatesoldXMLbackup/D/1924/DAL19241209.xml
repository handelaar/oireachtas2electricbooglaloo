      <P>The Deputy appears to have been misinformed as to the nature of the charge against John Melody, Clondorney, Tulla, Co. Clare.  This man has been detained under the provisions of the Public Safety (Powers of Arrest and Detention) Temporary Act, 1924, since the 20th July, 1924, on strong suspicion of being concerned in outrages on the Moloney Estate, Kiltannon, County Clare.  He was informed on the 3rd instant that he would be released on entering into recognisances for his good behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that the case was before the Appeal Council on the 20th <Col N="2210" /> October and the Council reported that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting him of being concerned in the offence for which he is detained.</P>

      <P>An examination in connection with this post was held in March, 1922, not in March, 1924.  The general standard exhibited by candidates was not satisfactory, and an appointment was not made as a result of the examination.

It is not considered proper to publish markings of unsuccessful candidates at examinations.  The person permanently sanctioned for the post had been acting Secretary since August, 1921.</P>

      <P>I ask the leave of the Dáil to introduce the Police Forces Amalgamation Bill, 1924.  This Bill has for its object the amalgamation of the Gárda Síochána and the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  Last June, when the Dublin Police Bill was before the Dáil, I was pressed to justify the continuance of two separate police forces in the State, and I explained that the tendency of that Bill which was then under discussion was towards an amalgamation. Personally, I favoured that course, and I hoped that circumstances would permit of the early introduction of such a Bill.  The Bill which I am asking leave to introduce now proposes an amalgamation of the two forces on equal terms. All members of each force on the date of amalgamation will become members of the amalgamated force with corresponding rank.  The rates of pay and allowances of members of both forces, and their present pension rights, will not be affected by the Bill.  Existing members of the D.M.P. will not be liable for service outside the Dublin Metropolitan area without their own consent.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the gradual reduction of the police rate which is now levied in the Dublin area and for its final disappearance.  The rate for the year 1925-26 will be 8d. in the £; for the following financial year it will be 7d., and it shall decrease until, in the year 1932-33, the rate will be 1d. in the £; and thereafter it will cease to be levied.  I should like to make it clear that the Bill is not introduced as an economy measure, although certain minor economies may be effected.  The object which is aimed at is an improvement of police efficiency by means of unified control, and responsibility and closer co-operation than is possible under the existing organisation.  I ask the leave of the Dáil to introduce the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday, when the Standing Orders interrupted me, I was endeavouring to persuade the Dáil that they would not be justified, in view of the past protestations and professions of the majority of Deputies, in passing this Bill.  In the main Railway Bill <Col N="2222" /> which was passed some months ago, on the proposition of the Minister the Dáil decided that the Directorate of the Amalgamated Company should be elected by shareholders, and that the qualification of a director should be the holding, in his own right, of such amount of share capital as might be specified.  The Bill proposes to alter that provision with respect to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and to confer upon them the right to appoint a director to the Irish railways without holding any shares in the company, and without any other qualifications except the continuance of an agreement, which is not laid before us, making certain concessions, allowances and advantages to the new company. It has been estimated by the Minister that these concessions may be worth £20,000, and from £15,000 to £20,000 in the estimate of the G.S.W.R.  In virtue of that estimate we are asked to confer a right upon the L.M.S. Co.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be borne in mind by representatives of the various Parties in the Dáil that this concession to the L.M.S. to appoint a director without qualifying does not apply to any other company, association or body of men of any kind whatever.  It does not confer the right, let us say, upon the Great Northern Railway of Ireland.  It does not confer any right upon, say, the Cattle Traders' Association, by virtue of the traffic that they provide for the Irish railways, to have a director.  They may increase their traffic by any sum, but traffic will not give a right to a directorship.  Other shipping companies that provide traffic for the Irish railways will not have any right.  No public authority&mdash;not even the State itself&mdash;is provided with any right to have representation on the directorate of the new Irish railway company, notwithstanding that we are proposing to give a right of that kind to the L.M.S. Co. by virtue of certain concessions. Those concessions the Minister described as being so valuable as to make it good business on the part of the Government to confer this right upon the English company.  I think a report in yesterday's papers of a speech made by an eminent official of this State <Col N="2223" /> shows how easy it is for any concession which is alleged to be contained in this agreement to be counterbalanced by a very slight charge upon any kind of traffic which may travel over the English railways from the Irish railways.</P>
    <P>One wonders what is the purpose of selecting a director for the Irish railways. Is it to serve and benefit Irish railways?  More particularly&mdash;and this is very much more important&mdash;is it going to serve and benefit the Irish public, the Irish national well-being?  I can conceive and, possibly, go so far as to say that I can admit, that as a purely railway affair between two railway companies a proposition of this kind might be defensible; quite possibly, even, may be advantageous, if one is thinking purely in terms of commerce and business arrangements between private companies.  I want to ask the Dáil to bear in mind that the railway service here is a public service, and to think of it as a public service entrusted to a private company by statute to administer, bearing in mind all the time that it is intended to benefit and develop industry and commerce and national growth everywhere.  If we bear that in mind we can see that when we introduce as part of the management of an Irish public service a person whose main interest it is to look after the interests of a non-Irish public service, where the interests may likely clash, and have clashed, and do clash, then I say we are doing an unpatriotic thing in passing this Bill to confer that right.</P>
    <P>It is said, of course, that because the L.M.S. Company controls all the ports except one on the west coast of England, therefore that railway company can help or retard as it wishes Irish economic development, and that we have to try and buy favours of that company by allowing them to nominate a director on this Irish public service. I am afraid one has to suggest, and almost, shall I say, one is forced to believe, that the object of the company in its rather protracted antagonism to the wishes of the Government and of the Irish railways in respect to this railway scheme as a whole shows that they were very anxious by any means <Col N="2224" /> to force themselves upon the Irish railway service.  They stood out at the beginning against the proposed unification of the Irish railways.  They suggested various counter proposals.  They have used influences of various kinds to impede the programme that the Government set out before us here.</P>
    <P>Now they find that they have succeeded in obtaining their ends by slightly different means from those which they first announced, and we are now asked to accept this as a matter of good business for the Irish railways on the one hand, and, on another hand, to throw up our hats with joy because of the opportunity this proposal gives for co-operation between the Irish and the British railways.  It seems to me that we are asked practically to go on our knees to the L.M.S. Company and to admit that, notwithstanding any measure of political autonomy which may have been won, at any rate so far as Ireland is concerned in its traffic with England, they are the predominant partner.  We are not asked, for instance, to say that collaboration between the Irish railways and the Great Western Railway of England requires that that railway should have a nominee on the Irish directorate.  One would imagine from some of the arguments adduced that there is no need to collaborate, to act co-operatively, to think of reciprocity of any kind, between the Great Western Railway and the Irish railways, but only with the L.M.S. Company, because, of course, they control the western seaboard of England.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the closest analogy that can be drawn would be a suggestion that there should be a British representative on, say, an Irish Board of Customs to ensure that there shall be some kind of co-operation between the two services.  The Irish railways can, if they will, assist the development of Irish industries, assist economic development in Ireland, in a way which railway companies in the past have declined.  If there was a desire within any section of the directorate of Irish railways to move in the direction of developing Irish industries, by preference on the internal traffic for instance, <Col N="2225" /> here at least is one director who is going to try his best to thwart that&mdash;the director that we are asked to appoint &mdash;because that is the effect of the Bill. If we take the analogy and said we shall appoint upon a Board of Customs in Ireland a nominee of the British Treasury, we can make our proposals, make our suggestions, to assist and develop Irish industry, but, at any rate, this nominee of the British Board would, first, be kept in touch with the proposals, and, secondly, would do his best to thwart, if by any chance&mdash;as in all probability they would&mdash;they ran across British interests.  In this case, if Irish railway policy runs in any way across British railway policy, we are conferring a power upon the British railway company to use considerable influence to thwart Irish railway policy in favour of British railway policy.</P>
    <P>We have read a good deal lately about the British financial adviser and legal adviser to the Egyptian Government. The Egyptian Government is autonomous&mdash;independent within limits. These limits are set by the appointment of financial and legal advisers.  This is not far off a similar position.  We are asked to appoint on the directorate of the Irish railways a British adviser, nay, more than an adviser, a director, one of the Cabinet of the Government of the Irish railways.  I would like, had there been still in the Dáil a number of those Deputies who had been insisting upon the utilisation of the powers given by the Treaty to develop Irish industry and help Irish development, in order to support my opposition to this Bill. I hope that Deputy Casabianca, who still remains on deck, will at least voice the views of that group or party. There is, I believe, a very important consideration that I wish to put before Deputies in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have said that it is not really a railway matter.  It is a question affecting the general national position economically. Through economics, it affects the political development of the country. We have seen a good deal, during the past couple of weeks, of the apparent resurgence of what was aptly called, up to recently, the &ldquo;West-British <Col N="2226" /> policy&rdquo;&mdash;a sort of pro-Imperial policy. The attitude that I would adopt to this Bill has been quoted as being antagonistic to the rise and development of a sane view in regard to the relations between England and Ireland, that &ldquo;sane view&rdquo; being one which would maintain the economic relationships and the business associations as they have always been in the past, while recognising that political changes have taken place.  I speak as one who has always remembered that all political developments can be thwarted, provided they are not used to impede economic forces.  If we are going to take the view that political change is satisfactory in itself and that we ought not to use it to alter the relationship between commercial companies&mdash; that the ordinary processes of trade and commerce which have prevailed for seventy or eighty years, and that railway policy in the country which has helped those ordinary processes of trade and commerce&mdash;should continue, then, I say, that within a very few years it will be proved to the country, as a whole, that no real change has been accomplished.</P>
    <P>I think that any person who has examined fairly the railway policy of this country since the beginning of railways here will admit that the purpose of the railways has been to encourage the export of raw material, largely in the form of live stock, and to import manufactured articles and distribute them through the country.  Railway policy, directed to that end, has undoubtedly played a great part in the economic development in the wrong way that we have experienced.  I had hoped that even with the form of railway control which the Dáil has agreed to we might have an opportunity of forcing the development of a railway policy which would help to protect and nurture Irish industry, even if this was done at the cost of imported traffic in manufactured goods; even if it meant some cessation in the export of raw material and cattle.  Apparently, that view does not prevail with the Ministry. Apparently the Ministry continues to think of railway interests as purely an industrial and commercial affair, having no particular relation to <Col N="2227" /> national economics, and to be treated purely as a matter of business.</P>

      <P>The Minister may say that but I would like him to prove it by acts.  I have no doubt he will try to justify the statement he makes now with his action in promoting this Bill, but I think the action is a contradiction of the profession.  If we desire that railway policy shall assist in the development of internal industry&mdash;production and distribution&mdash;even if it means a decline in the returns of the railway companies of revenue from cattle traffic or in the returns of revenue for distribution of manufactured imports&mdash;we ought not to pass this Bill, conferring a right on a British company to put a director on the Irish Companies Board to thwart what would be Irish national railway policy. I think the passing of this Bill would be an indication that the views expressed by the <i>Irish Times</i> are going to prevail with the Government, that we are going to turn our backs upon the line of development which most of us have looked for, with the coming of Saorstát Eireann.  If we really did entertain any hopes of that kind, then we ought not to give a Second Reading to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal before us has two aspects&mdash;the business aspect and the national aspect.  On the business side, the Minister said, on the First Reading, that the question Deputies have to decide is whether they were going to allow the new Amalgamated Company to be deprived of the sum of £20,000, previously guaranteed to the Dublin and South Eastern railway company. From the details of the position that we have had put us in the discussion by the Minister and others, I do not think it is unfair to say that from the business side the proposition is reduced to this&mdash;are we going to keep this £20,000, in consideration of appointing a director on the Board of the Amalgamated Company, or are we going to lose it?  I do not think it is unfair to suggest that, on the details before <Col N="2228" /> us, that is what the question resolves itself into.  If that is the case, it seems to me that, even from the business point of view, the present proposal is a questionable one.  The Railway Bill was projected with a view to the more efficient and the more economical working of our railways.  If that is so, and if the position is that left to our own resources, we are going to be £20,000 down this year, surely it is better as a start-off that we should probe the question from the purely Irish point of view and see whether that is the fact or not.</P>
      <P>From the business point of view, the question puts itself to us: in tackling our Irish railways, with a view to making a success of them, is not the realisation that there is the possibility of being £20,000 down if we do not direct them in the most efficient way, a more vitalising factor than the getting of this £20,000 subsidy from outside the State. From the purely business point of view alone, it seems to me that we cannot very well support the proposition as it stands at present.  There is then the national point of view.  Deputy Johnson says that this proposal will affect the position economically and, through the economic position, that it will affect the political position.  It seems to me that it affects a much more deep thing&mdash;that it affects the whole outlook of our State and the status of our State here.  At the present moment, the idea of an Irish State is attacked from two sides.  It is attacked from the Irregular side; they deny that the Irish people have the powers in their own State that they actually have.  It seems that there is another section that while not denying the powers of the Irish people over the Irish State, practically deny their right here in their own State, and practically seek to deny the status of our State.  Those are the people to whom reference has been made as having the <i>Irish Times</i> outlook. An attack is being made from that particular side on our State which is, perhaps, more insidious than the attack that is being made from the Irregular side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are considering the railways of our State here, we are very <Col N="2229" /> much concerned with the fact that the people of the country will recognise the existence of this State, and the frontier that you are going definitely to recognise as your frontier in commercial matters and in financial matters.  It seems to me that while we are in such a condition that these matters are not fully accepted by our people and that every point of vantage for attack on our position here as a State is being taken, we are doing a very serious thing, if, in the matter of our railways, we take action which can so affect the minds of our people as to suggest that there is not a clearly defined frontier to our State here.  The insidious attack on the State is there.  There is a group in our country who have the phraseology of the last century when they speak of our being an &ldquo;independent Dominion within the British Empire,&rdquo; but who have a rather up-to-date outlook in physical matters.  You have a group here who, while not prepared to set themselves up definitely as a political entity, for fear of showing their weakness, from that point of view, or showing that they are very small fry, want to keep a sort of wireless control over the activities of the people in the country who have political energy.</P>
    <P>In our railway matters you have the same suggestion, that you must have some kind of control over Irish railways from Britain; in the organisation and control of our medical profession here you must also have wireless control by the Medical Association in London.  These are new schemes of wireless control in all our organised matters here, whether political, commercial or professional.  Now, we are being invited to come in to the open and say where we are.  I think the Dáil must show very plainly that we recognise ourselves as an Irish nation, and that we are going to organise our professional, commercial and educational groups inside our own country first, bring all these matters to a focus inside our own country, and show that we are clearly an independent State, and that in consultation with other members of the Commonwealth of Nations, just as in the League of Nations, we are co-equals, and that we are <Col N="2230" /> not going to have any obscuring of where our national frontiers are.</P>
    <P>So it seems to me very dangerous for us at present to take any action regarding a big national concern that would show that we do not clearly realise that we are a clearly defined State and that we are not going to organise that State into an intensely organised one, so that we may very readily and safely enter into any interchanges of a helpful nature which we may have to enter into with other States.  If we were a State fully accepted by our own people in every way&mdash;and it is not challenged that we are not&mdash;and fully accepted by people outside, and not challenged as we are here, there would be no very serious reason for having such connections with any group of railways working into our own system of railways as is proposed here.  I feel that we could not, and should not, consider the proposal that is put up now for, say, the next three years until the Amalgamated Company has been properly set up, and our Irish directors have considered their Irish problem and looked into the whole question of the railways here, and until we know that, from one quarter or another, the actual existence of our State is not challenged by any group of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to give a vote for the Second Reading of this Bill, and, in view of all the circumstances, I feel compelled to place my views on record for doing so.  At the outset, I may say that it is very refreshing, indeed, to find a Deputy like General Mulcahy, who must have a very important share in the responsibility for railway policy of the present Government, coming along at this stage and admitting, as by inference he does, that he has already made a mistake.  This and the Third Dáil were first of all responsible for setting up an Irish Railway Commission to inquire into and report as to how the Irish railways could be put under a better system of management and control than that in which they were when the Commission was set up. Deputy General Mulcahy was responsible, by reason of his position in the Executive Council, for setting up that <Col N="2231" /> Commission and, what is more important, for turning down its recommendations. General Mulcahy was then subsequently responsible for turning down the Bill promoted by the Irish Labour Party and introduced by Deputy Johnson, and which would place the control of the Irish railways under the State and free them from any external and anti-Irish influences.  Further, when the Committee Stage of the Railways Bill was going through in last May, an amendment claiming this right &mdash;I admit on different grounds&mdash;was brought forward by Deputy Alfred Byrne, and at the concluding stage of the discussion, as indicated by reference to the Official Report, Alderman Byrne withdrew the amendment in deference to a promise made by the President to give the matter more careful consideration. I cannot find on the records that General Mulcahy took exception to the discussion that took place then on that matter.</P>

      <P>That is the case I am trying to make, and to place upon General Mulcahy a responsibility which he would, perhaps, like to disclaim at this moment.  This Bill is unique in so far as it proposes to amend an Act before that Act comes into operation.  That is another indication of the hasty manner in which legislation is being rushed through this House without giving the serious matters concerned adequate consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amending Bill to increase the number of directors in control of the future Irish National Railway, or whatever name it is to be given, and it merely proposes to give legislative sanction to an agreement already entered into by two contracting parties, namely, the Irish National &mdash;I query that word &ldquo;National&rdquo;&mdash; Railway Company on the one hand, and the London, Midland and Scottish Company on the other.  A Bill of this kind must either be accepted or rejected, <Col N="2232" /> because an agreement, being an agreement, cannot be amended, and, therefore, it must be voted upon without any amendment.  Previous to the establishment and setting up of the Free State Government the operations of the Irish railway undertakings were largely controlled by a tribunal which was purely British in its character and which had its headquarters in London. As a result of the passing of this Railways Act and of the amalgamation of the various railway companies, or at least those which come within our jurisdiction, a tribunal was set up which nobody can dispute is Irish in its character, and, so far as the future control of Irish railways is concerned in regard to this Bill, the new Great Southern Company will be subject to the Irish Railway tribunal instead of being, as the Irish railways were, subject to the British tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That argument must be taken into consideration by anybody who speaks of anti-Irish influences.  Whether those influences be external or internal in the future, so far as they affect and concern the working of the Great Southern Company, that company will always be subject to the scrutiny of the Irish tribunal so far as the Railways Act is concerned, and that cannot be denied by any Deputy unless he admits his ignorance of the terms of that Act.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when introducing this Bill, referred to a sum of £20,000 being the value of a concession supposed to have been received from the L.M.S. Co. in consideration of a directorship for that company. So far as I can learn from making inquiries, that sum is only fixed at a valuation of the concession for a fixed period, and with the increase or decrease of traffic passing between the points that have hitherto been affected that amount will either increase or decrease. The Minister's reference to the fixed figure of £20,000 does not actually represent the facts of the case.  Another point is this: the agreement is not between two companies only, and it only operates, according to the wording of the agreement, until the 30th November, 1940, or, if, as we all hope, at a very much earlier date the Irish Government will take over the management <Col N="2233" /> and control of the Irish railways for the State.</P>
    <P>I believe they will be forced to do it in the near future, and immediately on the acquisition or control of the Irish or British railways by the Governments of either countries, this agreement will automatically terminate before the 30th November, 1940.  I think it is agreed that if the railways are nationalised in any country all Acts concerning agreements between private companies, such as the railway companies are at present, cease to exist on the acquisition of the railways by the State in any country. The Minister explained the effect of the agreement so far as it concerns the existing shareholders of the Dublin and South Eastern Company and how it would affect the shareholders on the transfer of the existing stocks to the new company.  If the money is not to be found either in the form of a Government subsidy or given by somebody to the Dublin and South Eastern Co. and transferred to the amalgamated company, nobody will dispute the fact that it will have to be found by the Great Southern Company, which is, just the same as any other company, not a charitable institution.  If they find that they are £20,000 short of their working expenses or revenue, in a particular year, as a result of the operations of this Bill, this money will be found out of the pockets of the people who use the railways either as senders of goods or as passengers.  There is no use in anybody pretending that in any railway company carrying on as a private trading concern their work either in England, Ireland or anywhere else, it is not the first concern of the management to make certain dividends for the shareholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Deputy Gorey is right; pay the directors all the time, and that is probably the first charge on the revenue.  The claim which was originally put up in this House, in a different form from that which is being put up to-day, was not supported by me on that particular occasion for the reasons that were then given.  Deputy Alfred Byrne moved an amendment to <Col N="2234" /> the Railways Bill in Committee claiming that the London, Midland and Scottish Company should get a director on the Great Southern Company by reason of the loan given by them to the Dublin and South Eastern Company for the development of the New Ross and Waterford extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They gave that loan, and they are protected in the Act of 1905 so far as their rights are concerned, on the assumption that it would bring a return of 3½ per cent., provided that the New Ross and Waterford extension get the revenue which would enable it to pay on that particular section of the line interest at the rate I have named. It may be information to learn that no interest was ever paid on that particular loan of £100,000.  In reality, what happened was that hundreds of Irish shareholders and hundreds of thousands of pounds of Irish money are invested in the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.  They agreed to reinvest £100,000 for the development of the New Ross extension without any interest.  That was not explained by Deputy Alfred Byrne, but I think it is worthy of the attention of the Deputies. I believe, and I have expressed the view before on many occasions, that so far as we are concerned as a State everything depends upon producing inside our own limits of jurisdiction as much as we can produce, so as to reduce as far as we possibly can the amount of manufactured articles imported. I supported that by my vote on the protection policy proposed by the Government, and I still believe in it and will support it until the profiteering element in the country will make it impossible to do so any further.  I mention that as a counter argument against some of the arguments used in the opening stages of this discussion. In taking this view I have certain industries in mind, one of which is on the verge of death in my own constituency, and which affects 200 or 300 workers. If Irish people are not prepared to put their thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds into the development of Irish industry, I do not care whether a Chinaman or a Jew comes along, I will take that money so long <Col N="2235" /> as it is used for the development of this country's resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement was made, and I think Deputy Johnson was justified in referring to it, by a public man in a high position in this country.  Deputy Johnson referred to it as an argument in favour of his opposition to the Bill.  I wonder if it was proved to Deputy Johnson that that statement, though made by a distinguished individual, was wrong would he change his opposition into support of the Bill? The statement was: &ldquo;It was a fact that the London, Midland and Scottish Company controlled every port on the west coast of England except one, due to the fact that the British railways were compelled to combine.  That was followed by an increase of rates against Irish agricultural products,&rdquo; but the individual concerned was &ldquo;not without hopes, however, that a remedy would be applied to reduce these advances.&rdquo;  I can only attribute that statement to the fact that it was made at a luncheon on board the high seas, and probably the tide was so high that it interfered with the equilibrium of the people who were enjoying themselves at the expense of a well-known British and Irish company.  However, the fact is, and I think the Minister knows it full well, that as a result of the grouping of the British railways there was an immediate decrease in the railway rates in England from 100 per cent. to 50 per cent over pre-war, whereas in the Irish National Railways, as they are to be called, the rates are at present 100 per cent. over pre-war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have been reduced from 120 to 100 per cent. against the express wishes and opposition of those on the National Board who are to control the future of <Col N="2236" /> the railways of this country.  I defy contradiction on that statement.  That inaccurate statement was made by an individual who at one time was a director in one of the constituent companies that is going to make up the amalgamated company.  With regard to the Board of Directors, I think from 18 years' experience in dealing with Irish and English boards of directors I ought to be competent to say something in regard to the patriotism of both the Irish and English directors.  Everybody who has opposed the Bill up to the present has assumed that the people who are now, or are to be in the future, for how long I do not know, in control of the Irish Railway Board of Management have always been of the super-patriotic type.  I can tell them quite plainly from my experience, and can prove it by statements I will make on the matter, that that is not the case.  If anybody in the Dáil says it is, it will be a keen disappointment to the railwaymen in this country who know what they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>It may appear strange also to say that I support the Bill from a railway-worker's and trade union point of view.  It is correct to say that the conditions of service of the employees of the London, Midland and Scottish in Ireland, England and Scotland are the best enjoyed by any railway workers, whether in Ireland or England at present.  So far as the claims for better conditions of service by Irish railwaymen are concerned, they have always been based on the conditions in operation on the British railways, particularly on the London, Midland and Scottish, and I say that as a representative of Irish railwaymen, and a representative of the employees on the railway where I work, and have worked, for twenty years.  Everything in regard to salary, superannuation, etc., is looked upon as something which would enable the representatives of the Irish railwaymen to work for in their anxiety to improve the existing conditions of Irish railwaymen.  Recently £1,000,000 was lent at the rate of 4 per cent. by this particular company to their staffs in different parts of the country in Ireland and England to enable the staffs to build houses.  In that matter <Col N="2237" /> this company have gone further than the Government in providing suitable housing accommodation for citizens of the Free State.</P>
    <P>Another consideration which influences me in this matter is that whenever agreements are made between railway companies and their staffs, I have always found, and I regret to have to say it, that the agreements have been always carried out in the letter as well as the spirit by the English companies, whereas in the case of the Irish companies they have constantly quibbled, and in many cases repudiated the agreements they have made with the trade unions.  As well as that, the conditions of service of the employees of the London, Midland and Scottish, the London and North Eastern, the Great Western, and other English groups of to-day practically admit of control in the management of the concern by the workers, with representatives of the shareholders on the Board.  Another thing which is quite uncommon to us here is the fact that the employees can go from the bottom to the top, and reach the highest positions in these particular companies.</P>
    <P>I want to bring one case home to the minds of people opposing this Bill with reference to the aspect of the case which assumes that everything is pro-British and anti-Irish as regards this English company.  All I wish to say is that in the strikes of 1911 and 1913 in Dublin I worked at the time at the North Wall, and I had practically most of the responsibility for the conscription strike, the munition workers' strike, and the strike in connection with the Mountjoy hunger strike in regard to things going on in pre-Truce days.  My experience as an authorised delegate of the railwaymen was that any railwayman who was arrested in 1916, or who took an active part in the fighting which led to the Treaty, and got arrested, on release from jail was immediately taken back by the London, Midland and Scottish without any opposition so far as the management was concerned, but when they went to Kingsbridge or Amiens Street, which are to be controlled by super-patriot people in the future, they found their positions were filled, and were not <Col N="2238" /> allowed to return.  If General Mulcahy were here he could bear that out, for I know many representations were made to the Government up to two or three months ago, and even to the present Minister to reinstate the men victimised or left out as a result of their activities in pre-Truce days. That is an instance if people want to have that information, of the attitude of one company as against another.  It proves conclusively that all the patriotism is not on the side of the Irish National Railway Company.  I am voting for the Second Reading of this Bill, and I propose to assist the Minister in getting it through the remaining stages for the reasons given, and particularly for reasons given from a railway worker's and a railway trade union standpoint.  I believe if there is on the board of management of the new Irish Railway Company an individual who will stand for proper treatment to the Irish railway worker in the same way as they have treated their own employees on the other side of the Channel, that the Bill will be welcomed by Irish railwaymen on the whole for that reason.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take a note of this, that the Government and the Dublin and South Eastern Board are mainly responsible for the holding up of the amalgamation scheme.  I believe it was only yesterday an agreement was arrived at in regard to the terms upon which the amalgamation was to take place.  That has resulted in the new directors electing themselves so far as three or four of the constituent companies are concerned.  The further result has been that in the new appointments made, thirteen of the principal officers of the new company, no Dublin and South Eastern man has been included.  I put it to the Minister that he is responsible as well as the Dublin and South Eastern Company for the hold up which has taken place, and which as a result is likely to prejudice the position of the Dublin and Southern staff in the new railway combine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The proof is that the tribunal set up under the Railways Act is under your Ministry, and the tribunal is concurring in the delay, and to that extent you are responsible.</P>
      <P>At any rate I will not repeat the statement, but it is a fact that the Dublin and South Eastern Railway staff have been, as it were, left out in the cold.  I think it is due to the Minister, and it is only fair, that there should be invited from him an assurance that, in asking for support on this particular Bill, he will make representations, in his own diplomatic way, both to the members of the board, who are to be appointed by the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company and the new director of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company, that things in that respect should be put right.  He may not dispute the fact, at any rate, that the staff of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company have been prejudiced because not one of their officers, high or low, has received any share in the appointments that have been made by the new board which was only partially set up at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One may assume that in this discussion a certain amount of prejudice has been shown as against the English and on behalf of the Irish company; but from my own personal view of the matter, the coming into operation of this Bill, which enables a directorship to be given to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company, will mean that not alone has it been a good proposition from a purely business point <Col N="2240" /> of view, but it will also be a good proposition from the taxpayers' point of view, and will be the same ultimately from the point of view of the shareholders as well as the workers of the Amalgamated Company.  For those reasons I intend to support the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the speeches that have been delivered on this Bill since it was introduced, one is compelled to say that their effect has been to fill one rather with despair as to the commercial future of the Free State.  I read in the Press some weeks ago a rather interesting letter from an American who is not unknown in this country &mdash;I think it was Judge Coholan.  Writing on the subject of the importance of tourist traffic in Ireland, he stated that, in his opinion, it contained a gold mine for the Free State, and he went on to point out that it should be one of our first objects in this new State to recognise the importance of encouraging tourist traffic and to do all we could to develop that traffic.  Those were wise words, and that was useful information of a practical kind, coming from a man who was interested in the development and the progress of the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what would be the views of that man if he had listened, as some of the Deputies here have had to listen, to the speeches that have been delivered from the Labour benches on this particular subject?  I am sure he would have returned not too full of optimism as to the future of the Free State; I am afraid he would be rather pessimistic as to its future progress.  Those who have had any experience in connection with tourist traffic tell us that monies left by tourists&mdash;and some of them leave considerable sums when visiting the country&mdash;percolate through to many of the poorer inhabitants of the cabins that are to be found on the south coast and in the western parts of this isle of ours. The industry at which those poor people worked in the past has been almost entirely supported by the tourists who visit our island.  They, as well as a great many others in this country, have missed the tourists.  I do not think the importance of that industry needs <Col N="2241" /> stressing&mdash;at least it should not&mdash;in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in my opinion, can do more, and ought to do more, to develop that industry than any other step we could take, because with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company depends the success or otherwise of that traffic.  They can either make or mar the tourist traffic in Ireland.  They have the railways and the steamers and they can make arrangements which will encourage tourists to visit this country. And when a Bill comes forward that will do more than any other step this Dáil could take to encourage that traffic, one cannot but deplore the speeches that have been made against it.  Deputies have spoken of the business aspect of the proposition.  As one who has some authority to speak on the subject, I took the liberty, when the Railways Bill was going through originally, of supporting the principle of giving privileges to those railway companies in order to get some of the results that we hope to get from their co-operation.  That, I think, did represent the view of thoughtful business' men.</P>
    <P>They would go further and, in view of the importance of railway and shipping connections to the industry in the Free State, businessmen would almost be inclined to say that as a business proposition, without any other consideration, it would be a wise thing to give representation to those particular interests.  Let us look at this matter from a business point of view in connection with the Free State.  I have not heard any Deputies from the Farmers' Benches speaking on this Bill; doubtless we shall have some speeches that will let us know the views of that important industry on this particular question.  One does not need to go into all the details to show that it is advisable in the national interest to establish and retain friendly connections with Great Britain.  It is almost unnecessary to repeat that the great staple industry of this country&mdash;agriculture&mdash; is entirely dependent on its export trade.</P>
    <P>Practically the whole of that export trade goes to Great Britain.  Great Britain is the best customer of our <Col N="2242" /> staple industry.  Will anybody suggest as a policy that it is not in his interests to keep in with his best customer?  Or, put it another way: Would even the smallest shopkeeper suggest that it was not to his interest to keep on the most friendly relations with his best customer? Now, the best customer of our staple industry is Great Britain.  Does anybody in the Dáil suggest any other policy in the interest of that industry than to keep on the best possible relationship with your best customer for any product of that industry?</P>

This is only one necessary step in connection with that policy.  What is the alternative to that policy?  Doubtless some Deputies will say: &ldquo;Cut the connection; the connection is not worth developing.&rdquo;  What would the result of that policy be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised that point, because the case I made when the Railways Act was going through was, that the Great Western Railway of England had invested large sums in Irish railways in return for certain considerations which are recognised in the Bill.  But when it came to the question of the London, Midland and Scottish, which had invested a large amount of money in a railway in Ireland, and had, as one of the conditions of investment, got representation on the Board, we held the money and refused to recognise the obligation.  At the time, I argued that that was an unreasonable attitude, and I urged that this representation should be given for reasons that were obvious. Now there are additional and possibly stronger reasons than were then urged, and, as far as I am concerned, I am prepared to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the Second Reading of the Bill.  I cannot see why there should be any opposition to it.  As Deputy Good has said, the Great Western Railway of England have certain safeguards provided for them in the Railways Act regarding unconsigned traffic.  At present a lot of unconsigned traffic that should naturally go via the port of Dublin is being diverted via Waterford, Rosslare and Fishguard.  Traffic from Athenry and other places in that part of Galway are being sent by that route.  The principal reason I have for supporting the Bill is that I consider it is good business for this country.  The London, Midland and Scottish Railway have always given great help to the development of the live stock industry here.</P>

I always found the London, Midland and Scottish Railway ready to assist the live stock trade.  There has been too much sentiment in this country latterly.  We can carry sentiment too far, and it has been carried too far. When the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, after the amalgamation, wanted a good manager for their system did they bother about sentiment? No.  They put an Irishman at the head of affairs.  I think it is very petty for people in the Dáil or outside to talk in this way about one director out of fifteen.  He will be a watchdog there in regard to the Great Western Railway of England, and what we want is competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>The Great Western have safeguards in the Railways Act with regard to unconsigned traffic.  The London, Midland and Scottish are losing a lot of money which they had invested in the Dublin and South Eastern and they have no safeguards.  Apart from that, I do not think that one director on a board of fifteen will make a lot of difference to the future of the railway system in this country.  Furthermore, Deputies should look at the matter from this standpoint: owing to the passing of the Free State Act we are finished now when we leave the port of Dublin so far as the Rates Tribunal is concerned.  If I want a through rate established from an inland station to some destination in Great Britain, and if I go before the Railway Tribunal, they have no power to grant that through rate unless the London, Midland and Scottish Company are an assenting party to it.  Since 1913 through rates have been discontinued from many stations in Ireland to destinations in Great Britain.  It is only recently that some of them have been resumed. One of the chief things that the live stock trade and people generally are complaining of is the excessive railway rates.  As Deputy Davin pointed out in his able speech in defence of the <Col N="2245" /> Bill, we are paying 100 per cent. and, in some cases, 120 per cent. over pre-war rates.  In England railway rates are down to 50 per cent. over pre-war. Previous to the war and to the discontinuance of these through rates, we had head rates and wagon rates from inland stations in Ireland to Great Britain. Now you have to book locally to the port of Dublin and rebook there across channel.  I may point out for the information of Deputy Johnson, that the port of Dublin, so far as head rates for pigs are concerned, was always a couple of shillings more than Waterford.  There are evil influences at work to divert as much traffic as possible from the port of Dublin, north and south.</P>
      <P>I have tried to get as many opinions as I could about this Bill from those engaged in the live-stock trade, and the general consensus of opinion is that the Bill should be supported, and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway allowed to nominate a director.  The directors will be a very foolish lot of men if they allow one man to boss the whole show.  Majority rule will prevail on that board just the same as in any other assembly.  I think it is very petty to have all this opposition and talk about a simple measure such as this is.</P>

      <P>I do not need to add anything to what Deputies Johnson and Mulcahy have stated with regard to the national or political aspect of the Bill. They have stated the case against the Bill with great moderation and conciseness. There is also the business aspect of this Bill, the value of the bargain which we are asked to support. In the first place, the Dáil is asked to assist the carrying through of the Bill without having the exact text of that deal before them.  We have to rely upon statements from the Minister, Deputy Davin, and others, as to the contents of the actual agreement which is mentioned in the Preamble.  As far as I can make out from these generally vague statements, the Bill is not a very satisfactory one from our point of view. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway are obviously taking advantage of the financial difficulties of the Irish railway and of the Irish State at the <Col N="2246" /> present moment in order to drive a much harder bargain than they would be able to do in a few years time.</P>

      <P>The amalgamated railway.  They gave concessions to the Dublin South Eastern Railway which were supposed to be worth £20,000 per year, and for these concessions they obtained one director on that railway. They are now willing to provide those same facilities to the amalgamated company, but they are given in return a director on the general company, which is a far more important thing than simply a director on the Dublin and South Eastern.  Whereas before they had one director out of perhaps 100 directors on the Irish railways, now they are being given one out of fifteen for only the same concessions as they originally gave to the Dublin South Eastern.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not, I think, shown any very great enthusiasm for the Bill, and I do not think, particularly after the speeches of Deputies Johnson and Mulcahy, that he should continue with this Bill if he does not supply the full text of the agreement to the Dáil. Alternatively, he should leave the question of Second Reading to a free vote of the Dáil, because I certainly will oppose it.</P>

      <P>When the last Deputy stood up, I thought we would have got more information about the Bill than from any other Deputy.  One would naturally expect that, but instead of our expectations being realised, we have been given less information than by any other Deputy.  One thing which must have struck every Deputy is that anything referring to our national aspirations is absolutely outside what is contemplated by this Bill.  In listening to the debate one could only think of pounds, shillings and pence.  One could only observe the interests of one English company pitted against the interests of another English company. Deputy Good talked about the advantage that a director from an English company would be to the development of this country&mdash;of the necessity for <Col N="2247" /> and fitness of it.  Why did not the Deputy speak about a director from the two English companies which are competing for the trade of this country&mdash; the London, Midland and Scottish and the Great Western?  To my mind, the Deputy over-painted the picture&mdash;in fact, it became a daub before he had finished.  Is there any director of an Irish railway company who, by reason of English trade with this country, is a director of an English company?  If the picture be good at one end, it should be good at the other end.  The Deputy talked about our English trade, and said England was our best customer. Ireland is also the best customer of England.  And if the argument is good in one case, it should be good in the other case.</P>

      <P>It will bear re-stating. Deputy Good said that this proposal will mean a lot to the tourist traffic, and that the London, Midland, and Scottish Company could make or mar the tourist traffic.  I am not prepared to accept that statement.  That statement hits me as water hits a duck.  There are two companies competing for the tourist traffic of this country, and while those two companies are in active opposition it does not rest with one of them to make or mar that traffic.  It is their business to protect their end of the traffic.  It is not a question of philanthropy at all, and there is no use in over-daubing the picture.  I suggest&mdash; I speak under correction&mdash;that fifty per cent. of the traffic of the London, Midland and Scottish Company is Irish traffic, and that they could not pay a dividend or keep their system going without their Irish trade.  The Irish traffic means life or death to the London, Midland, and Scottish Company.</P>

I hope the Minister will take a note of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very rarely listened to a speech which <Col N="2250" /> founded itself upon a national viewpoint, which proposed to argue against the ancient spirit of dependence, and which, at the same time, breathed so much of the ancient slave spirit as did the speech which Deputy Johnson delivered partly on Friday and partly to-day. He stood up to oppose this Bill mainly on principle, and if one were to judge his speech by time, his arguments were mainly business arguments, plus imaginings.  The Deputy treated us to a hectic picture of the future if this Bill were passed.  According to the Deputy, one railway director out of 16, one appointed to a board of 16, is going in a short space of time to get the 15 others completely in his grip&mdash; the 15 directors appointed by the Irish proprietors of Irish railways&mdash;and keep them so completely in his power that no question of Irish goods and no question of the benefit of Ireland will enter into their minds when any question of railway administration arises; in a short space of time that one man, having special experience&mdash;having experience which no Irish appointee could have&mdash;would absorb the Board.  He would even get control of the general manager, and all &ldquo;routeing&rdquo; of traffic and every little point of detail in railway administration would be governed by the one man; so far as the railway directorate was concerned, the 15 others and the general manager&mdash;presumably, if he could so operate on the mind of the general manager he would operate on all other officials&mdash;would disappear and you would have got one dictator of the Irish railway companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot assent to the proposition that one appointee of an English railway company is equal to&mdash;and, in the old phrase&mdash;better than&mdash;15 appointees of the Irish proprietors of the Irish railways.  On that purely imaginative case, Deputy Johnson founded his main objection to the proposal in this Bill&mdash;that it was going eventually, and indeed in a very short space of time, to lead to the subordination of Irish interests to English interests, English interests being represented by one appointee on a board of 16.  That, to me, shows timidity.  It is even worse than timidity.  It shows a lack of respect <Col N="2251" /> for Irish intelligence and Irish ability.  It shows, to the greatest extent possible, what I said at the beginning &mdash;the existence of the slave mind, that we thought might have got some chance of disappearing under the present conditions. I cannot conceive of this mighty Colossus who &ldquo;doth bestride this narrow world&rdquo; and who is going to overawe, overpower and override all the decisions and all the points of view that his colleagues, 15 in number, may happen to put up to him at any time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy then said it was bad business, or&mdash;to put it the other way&mdash;that it was good business, from the point of view of the L.M. and S. Company. Although I endeavoured to correct the mistake several times he persisted in it, with the effect to-day that Deputy Esmonde thinks it right to follow him. Deputy Esmonde, with Deputy Johnson, holds that the right as to appointment of a director, previously guaranteed in respect only of the Dublin and South Eastern Co., is now being extended to the amalgamated company, and that there is no extension of the consideration on which that previous right was founded.  I think that is what Deputy Esmonde said; it is certainly what Deputy Johnson said.  If Deputy Johnson tells me that there is no difference between Deputy Johnson, say, as an employer, who says: &ldquo;I have been in the habit of paying my workmen a certain amount of money and if you continue to work with me you will probably get what I used to give the other people,&rdquo; and the position of an employer who says: &ldquo;I contract and bind myself to give you so much for a stated period and for a stated amount of work&rdquo;&mdash;if Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Johnson thinks the consideration is the same in both cases, I wonder what argument would have effect with them.  If there is no difference between a voluntary and a discretionary payment of £20,000, which might disappear at any moment, and over which the company had no control, and a binding agreement to pay £20,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. ESMONDE Mr. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there a binding agreement on the part of the Dublin <Col N="2252" /> and South Eastern Company to allow a director to be appointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a binding agreement by statute that a director should be appointed on certain consideration.  That consideration was not the payment of £20,000 per annum. £20,000 per annum did happen to be paid.  I hold that to change that voluntary payment into a binding contract to continue to pay is a considerable advance on the previous state of things.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson pursued the line of argument with regard to the railway director who can overwhelm his fifteen colleagues.  He asked was it contemplated that this man should have the rights of an ordinary director, and that he might, on a particular occasion, have a casting vote in deciding that the London, Midland and Scottish Railway shall continue to pay this £20,000 to the new company.  That was in line with the general horrible imaginings of the Deputy with regard to this.  This incubus of £20,000 per annum might be forced by the casting vote of this representative of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on a board of directors otherwise divided, and which might otherwise avoid taking this £20,000 but for the presence of that director on their board.  That is a sufficiently horrible contemplation, and it is horrible enough to make anybody vote against this Bill!  The Deputy can urge it as an argument because it is proposed that the director shall be a director for the ordinary purposes of a director, and would be present if any discussion arose as to whether or not this money was to be continued as a payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the agreement has not been laid before the Dáil.  The agreement will be laid before the Dáil before the Committee Stage.  An argument was used that because it was vague, and because of an estimate by me as to what the money was, and an estimate by the London, Midland and Scottish, or the Dublin and South Eastern, that therefore there was something far from certain, something far from being fixed, and that there was nothing definite to found an agreement on.  The amount of consideration is this, that the agreement was sufficient <Col N="2253" /> for the Railway Tribunal to decide the issue at stake.  The Dáil can see the agreement, and have the terms of the agreement before them before we reach the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The agreement is binding if this Bill is passed.  This agreement, on the basis that this Bill is going to be passed, has been considered a good bargain by the three members of the Railway Tribunal specially selected to judge in these matters. I am told, however, by the Deputy who objects to the bringing in of a director, the nominee of an outside company, that his further objection to the Bill is that it does not confer the same rights, to which he objects, on any other body or association.  The cattle traders have no power to appoint.</P>
    <P>The Great Northern Railway have no power to appoint, the Government themselves have no power to appoint. They have not at the moment.  This Bill is singular and deals only with one agreement, and beyond that it does not pretend to go.  It deals with a company which is in a very exceptional position with regard to Irish railways, a company which had previously lent a sum of money amounting to £100,000, and which had previously made payments amounting to £20,000 per annum, to one of the constituent elements of the new amalgamation.  No other company is in money value in the same position with regard to Irish railways as this one is.</P>
    <P>The Great Western Railway of England has been alluded to.  The Great Western Railway of England was brought in as an argument by Deputy Johnson, and as far as my memory serves me, Deputy Johnson was by no means willing to allow that undertaking with the Great Western Railway to be continued in full force and effect under the Railway Tribunal when passing through the Dáil.  We hold that we have acted fairly to these two great companies when we have secured to the Great Western Railway by the actual terms of the Act all the allowances and rights safeguarded in a proper way for the Irish interests that they previously had in regard to Irish traffic.  We could not see our way to grant the directorate previously allowed on the Board of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway in the new <Col N="2254" /> amalgamated company by virtue of the old consideration of £100,000, which was consideration having operation only towards the Dublin and South Eastern and towards one end of it. But this is a new and specific and completely different consideration, and it is considered good enough and sufficiently good business in consideration of this £20,000, to agree to a director.  I say that on that basis alone, as Deputy Good pointed out, inevitably one result of this is going to be closer co-operation between the amalgamated board and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and co-operation with every desire to preserve the national outlook and with every desire to denote very clearly the commercial frontier. It is very desirable to have that close co-operation with that railway company which carries most of the traffic from this country.  Deputy Johnson concluded by saying that he thought that this was a very unsuitable measure to proceed from the Government which set out having as its cry that it was out to make full use of the powers of the Treaty.  He asked the remaining member of that party here who was going to make a fuller use of the powers given by the Treaty to speak against this.  This is a using, a bold and courageous using, of the powers given by the Treaty.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Mulcahy said that our national status should be more clearly defined and our commercial frontier more clearly recognised before any step of this kind was taken here, I would say that I cannot conceive any greater or clearer demonstration of our status or any more clearly marked sign of our commercial frontier than that the company has to come into the Dáil to secure the approval of the Oireachtas before the appointee of a foreign company can be given a seat on an Irish railway board. That, to me, is the greatest demonstration of our status, and very clearly shows the frontier of the country.  Deputy Mulcahy contended that as a business arrangement this was questionable, and that a better and more vitalising factor would lie in losing £20,000 per annum.  I presume his argument is that it would require greater application <Col N="2255" /> and greater diligence and care, and greater work from the railway tribunal, and the railway management if this £20,000 disappeared.  That may be arguable.  But surely a very vitalising factor to the whole railway management is that a certain revenue has been established, that they have to prove the case before the railway tribunal next year to get such rates and freights established as will enable them by good, economic and efficient management to bring in that revenue, and that any surplus revenue brought in by the application of these rates will go in part to the company and in part to the railway users.</P>
    <P>That is a sufficiently strong factor to make them use their best endeavour to see that the railways are more efficiently and more economically managed.  Deputy Esmonde, I think I have answered.  He said that these concessions were the same as before, and as that argument has been very often used, at the risk of being tedious, I want again to say that the consideration is entirely different.  The consideration previously for a director was that a sum of £100,000 had been supplied in a certain way.  Interest was paid on it; the payment of the interest, remember, being dependent upon certain other circumstances, and interest, I think, for a sufficient number of years was paid, but the right to a director remained.  In addition to that, there were voluntary payments of £20,000, which might disappear at any moment. This directorate has nothing to do with the £100,000.  It is a directorate founded upon the £20,000 agreement, and that £20,000 now must be paid.  It is a directorate no longer voluntary or discretionary, it is a power given to the London, Midland and Scottish when this Bill is through.  It is a contract, and there are penalties for breach of it. The Deputy asked about the agreement; the agreement will be circulated before the Committee Stage is reached.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey spoke, but I did not rightly understand him at one time. Did the Deputy ask whether the Great Western Railway should be given any right to appoint a director on the <Col N="2256" /> board?  I may have mistaken the Deputy; I wonder was that what the Deputy was urging.</P>

They have secured in the Railways Act of 1924 all the rights and privileges they previously had with regard to Irish traffic, and it was one of the most contentious points, fought bitterly through the Dáil, as to whether or not this agreement should be continued with the Great Western.</P>

It is a discretionary promise to pay £20,000, converted into a contract, to pay for getting one director on a board of sixteen.  Deputy Gorey asked another question.  He wanted to know was the delay in coming to terms with the Dublin and South Eastern due to any quarrel about the number of directors or what was the cause of it.  That I cannot say.  I could make a guess and I could make statements, but I might be contradicted. If the Deputy had been in the House the other day, and if, being in the House, he had attended he would have heard me say that the chairman of the Dublin and South Eastern towards the end of August made a statement of the position and outlined the various obstacles and gave the main obstacle, and the main obstacle was this getting of £20,000 a year.  That was really the obstacle. It operated this way, that until the Railway Tribunal knew whether that sum of £20,000 was to be continued and to be given as part of the rates and assets of the Dublin and South Eastern, the tribunal had no security and no foundation on which to base the value of the stock of the Dublin and South Eastern with regard to the amalgamated company.</P>

      <P>I am only attempting to quote from memory as to what the chairman of the Dublin and South Eastern said.  I said I could make a statement and that probably it would be contradicted.  I endeavoured <Col N="2258" /> to quote the chairman and I am contradicted. I can go no further.  I gave what the chairman stated, at a meeting of the shareholders.  The point Deputy Johnson made does not affect the revenue of the amalgamated company. That revenue is stated.  The revenue upon which the whole basis of the Railways Act is built up was stated, and the rates will be made out on that basis but sufficient to make up that money, and the only point on which the public could come in is this: that if the contention of this House appeared to be that the Railways Act should destroy this £20,000 of receipts, then it would be for the Central Fund to make up the equivalent payment.</P>
      <P>That is a point which the tribunal have not been asked yet to decide and will not be asked to decide if the Bill is passed, because the agreement is going to be based on the assumption that the Bill will pass, but they would have the right to re-open that if the Bill is defeated.  But if that contention were to be upheld by the railway tribunal, then the Central Fund would have to make a payment corresponding to the £20,000, and in that extent the public might easily suffer.  Now, the whole question of the Bill has been put as if it was a matter of conflict between business and national interests.  It has been argued that it is not good business from our point of view, but that contention has not met with much support&mdash;the whole question is a matter of business. It is very good business from the Irish railway point of view and from the national point of view.  If you stated that you were selling a birthright for £20,000 per annum, of course a certain amount of rhetoric can be spoken on the matter, but I am putting forward the business point of view.  We have taken our stand firmly upon this.  We know our position.  We know our status; and, confident in the strength we have got, we can come to this House and ask this portion of the Oireachtas, the Dáil, to assent to the Bill.  We hold when they come here, the necessity of coming here to get the assent of the Oireachtas, is in itself the clearest definition of our status and shows very clearly the independent position we have at the moment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2261" /> Deputies will remember that following a report of a committee it was decided that for the present, at any rate, the Dáil should remain, that the Seanad should be accommodated in Leinster House and that the whole premises should be taken over.  After that there followed negotiations with the Royal Dublin Society with a view to finding them accommodation in temporary premises.  Certain premises were inspected by representatives of the Society.  The result, however, of their inspections was that they put it to us that they could not find any suitable premises that they could occupy temporarily; that the prospects of the Society and its membership would be very seriously injured if it were put in some unsuitable temporary premises for a considerable period, perhaps a period of ten years, and that it was necessary that they should at once accommodate themselves in a permanent way; that whatever the intentions of the Government were with regard to the occupation of Leinster House, it was necessary that the Royal Dublin Society should not spend, say, seven or ten years in temporary premises, but that it should have permanent suitable accommodation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We felt that that attitude was reasonable, that we could not ask them to go into a house which they said was unsuitable in, say, Merrion Square, and stay for an indefinite period, with a loss to their members of the amenities which they would have in suitable premises, a loss to the Society of its members, and the weakening through that of the whole fabric of the Society and a decrease in its usefulness.  It became a question, therefore, of giving them compensation for their ejection from Leinster House, and we, after a considerable amount of negotiation, agreed to a sum of £68,000.  That sum is one which I think is fair to the Society.  It is fair to the Society especially in view of the fact that they have determined to concentrate all their branches at Ballsbridge, and consequently it is probable that they will not have to build there as much as they would have had if they had chosen a site in town.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2262" /> My own view is that if the Society had chosen to remain in this neighbourhood and had chosen to build, say, on the site of Maple's Hotel, we would not have been able to agree with them on a sum as low as £68,000.  That sum may seem fairly considerable to Deputies, but there are factors to be taken into account, which may not be generally known, because in addition to having possession of this building, the Government had to pay for this building in the last year a sum of £832 for rates. If you take 20 years' purchase of that, it would be over £16,000.  Of course, it may be assumed that rates will come down somewhat, but in any case the fact that the Government paid £832 rates on the premises was a very considerable advantage to the Royal Dublin Society.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government spent approximately £300 a year on the upkeep of these premises.  I do not think that will go down anything appreciably. That certainly may be taken as worth £6,000, so that between these two items alone the Society was entitled to something from £20,000 to £22,000.  It was estimated that to erect a building, giving them the accommodation they had here, and to be a building of somewhat superior construction, as they would be entitled to, in view of the premises they were being put out of, would cost about £54,000.  Then the Society, if we had been dealing with the matter item by item, or going before some sort of arbitrator in the matter, would have been certainly entitled to something for the occupation of portion of its premises during the last couple of years.  There is no doubt our occupation of portion of these premises involved the Society in actual expenditure and by inconveniencing members and by causing certain amenities to be restricted, did lose the Society actual membership.  I do not know what would be a fair sum to fix for compensation to the Society for our occupation of the premises during these two years.</P>
    <P>The Society, in a claim, put in a large sum, a sum which I think could be shown not to be accurate, but on the other hand, if one were to say £2,000 per annum, it is a figure which would not be widely wrong.  It might be <Col N="2263" /> fairer to say £1,500 per annum, but in any case there is an item there of £3,000 or £4,000.  If we were to add together the price of building new premises of the same extent as those we were putting the Society out of, that would be £54,000.  If we were to take the full value, the rates and upkeep of 20 years' purchase, that is £56,000, you would have £22,000&mdash;that is £75,000 altogether. A claim could be made of three or four thousand pounds for damage to the Society during the last two years, say, in all, £79,000 or £80,000.  On the other hand, that is susceptible of certain reductions.  I think the Society going to Ballsbridge would be able to pay for itself well with the sum of £68,000.  I believe from investigations I made and from inquiries addressed to the Valuation Office that perhaps it might be able to get certain exemptions for part of its premises, devoted strictly to scientific work.  There was no exemption in respect of those premises here although certain parts were devoted to scientific work.  It might get a certain reduction in valuation.  The rates will be down a bit and the Society, having its premises all together, will save something by concentration, and I feel that the sum we offer, and which they, with some reluctance, accepted, will compensate them fairly well.  On the other hand, I think it is a good bargain from the Government's point of view.  I believe if we had gone to arbitration in the matter, and if that claim had been discussed item by item and a value fixed on each item we would not have got off with £68,000.</P>

      <P>I would like <Col N="2264" /> to know whether the Government have abandoned all hope of having the Bank of Ireland.  It has been the hope of a good many citizens of the Free State that we would eventually get those premises. If I remember rightly the President said if we made up our mind to get those premises it would take ten years.  I want to know whether the Government has given it any further consideration, or whether the ten years' notice has been given in view of getting back the Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to explain the position of the Government with reference to Leinster House.  Does this £68,000 make it clear that there is no claim on Leinster House by the Society.  I understand that some question was raised as to the ownership of those premises.  I want to know whether in the settlement it has been made clear that those premises are, in fact, the property of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be perfectly clear for the future that the Royal Dublin Society has no further claim. The sum of £68,000 is in settlement of their right to occupy the premises and in respect of any damages done during the years we have been in occupation here.  With regard to the Bank of Ireland no further consideration has been given to the matter by the Government. Even if the Dáil had agreed, and the Government has decided that we should go to the Bank of Ireland, a very considerable period of notice would be required. I, for one, am not in favour of going to the Bank of Ireland.  I do not want to go to the cut-throat's house, and I would be for staying here or building a new Parliament.  The one place I do not want to go to is the Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The figures that the Minister has given do not appear in the estimate and I am rising now as a precautionary measure.  There are certain amendments put down for the Committee Stage and it has been suggested as a remote possibility that somebody may object to the amendments being discussed on the grounds that they may possibly increase the charges upon the revenue and that, therefore, they should not be discussed on the motion by a member not an Executive Minister. I do not think that is quite in order inasmuch as no figures have been stated in the motion.  Perhaps it would not be asking too much if you would rule that the amendments which are fixed for the Committee Stage will be discussable at that stage and that we are not to discuss them at this motion.  I dare say if the Minister does not object to their being discussed at the Committee Stage we can avoid discussing them now.</P>

    <P>For the purpose of determining the amount of benefit to which, having regard to the proportion of benefit to contributions fixed by paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule to the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, hereinafter referred to as the Principal Act, any person is entitled, but for no other purpose, no account shall be taken after the passing of <Col N="2268" /> this Act notwithstanding anything contained in the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920 to 1924, of any benefit which may have been received by such person during or in respect of the Third Benefit Year established by the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1924.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1.&mdash;In line 16, before the words &ldquo;no account&rdquo; to insert the letter &ldquo;(a)&rdquo;; in line 20 after the figures &ldquo;1924&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;and,&rdquo; and to add a new paragraph at the end as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  during the Fourth Benefit Year each of the total number of contributions actually paid in respect of such persons since the 8th day of November, 1920, shall be treated as equivalent to three contributions or such lesser number of contributions (not being less than one) as the Minister may from time to time prescribe by regulations made for the purpose.</P>
      <P>The great defect of the Bill is that while it provides an extension of benefits for contributors who have a fairly large number of contributions to their credit, it makes no provision for those who may have very few contributions to their credit.  In other words, if a man now unemployed was insured prior to 1920, and, owing to the boom years of the war built up a big reserve of contributions to his credit, or, if he was in fairly constant employment since 1920, he would be entitled to nearly the maximum benefit allowed under the Bill up to the period of March next. On the other hand, a man who got very little employment since 1920, and who was unlucky enough not to have been in an insurable occupation prior to 1920, will have very little, if any, benefit to gain from the Bill.  The object of the amendment is to remove this defect by multiplying every contribution by a maximum of three, or by a smaller figure, where multiplication by three would be excessive, having regard to the maximum period over which benefit could be drawn.  I think the defect the amendment seeks to remove must be apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2269" /> It should be the object of the Bill to give the most relief to those requiring it.  As it stands, the Bill will benefit those who have been lucky enough to be in fairly constant employment, while the man who was unlucky enough to have very little employment will gain practically nothing.  The Minister will probably tell me that this is not the only measure the Government have adopted to deal with the unemployment problem, and that there are certain monies provided for works of reconstruction, and for the relief of unemployment. Even though monies are provided there is no guarantee that the class of people I seek to bring in under the Bill will be employed.  It is quite possible that the man with a fairly large number of stamps to his credit will be employed, and that the man with no stamps to his credit, will be left unemployed.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey has explained that the effect of this amendment would be to multiply by three, and he based that on the contention that there are certain people whose contributions would not be revived to any great extent, and that he seeks to bring in.  It must be remembered that the contributions have been multiplied already three times and over.  I said on the Second Reading that we had almost got to the point when this was no longer an insurable measure; when it was almost uncovenanted benefit.  We leave ourselves in the position that on no actuarial basis could it be made to appear a contributory scheme.  It seems to me also that if I did accept the amendment, and by regulation, multiplied by one, I would leave the thing as it was.  I could do by regulation what I do more openly in the Bill.  The question of the extra money to which the Deputy has referred does come into consideration.  If we are going to be forced to put an additional £150,000 on to the Unemployment Insurance Bill, it will be necessary to take that amount off some of the other money allocated for the relief of distress in the present benefit year.  This amendment will multiply <Col N="2270" /> contributions to the point where it will not be possible to say that this is an insurable scheme, but will be uncovenanted benefit.  I do not propose to discuss that now.  The money will be swallowed up by the addition of this amendment, and would necessarily have to come off other monies already allocated for relief schemes.  The more of these sums that are multiplied up the longer is there going to be for the payment back of these monies, and the longer is the burden of repayment going to be put on industry.  One of the next things we would have to consider, after a Bill for unemployment, would be that, possibly, the Minister for Finance would have to have a Bill for the relief of industry, with regard to taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has explained that the provisions of this amendment are really taken out of the 1923 Act for which the Minister himself was responsible by law.  It is not much satisfaction, of course, to the person who would be brought into benefit under this section, if it were accepted, to find himself excluded and to learn that we have kept within the scheme of insurance, or that people in Connemara are being supported out of the grant, or that some time in the future the fund would have to be made up out of taxation, so that there would be a longer period before the fund could be replenished. This may be all very true, but it does not give any satisfaction or food to the person who ought to be brought into insurance or, certainly, into benefit by this Bill.  It is intended to meet the case of the most needy person, the longest unemployed, who has not had an opportunity of accumulating credit, and these are people, of course, who are the most needy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, as I have said before, the fact that one is only one unit in a thousand, and that there are 999 suffering with that individual, does not make the hunger of that individual any less.  I was hopeful that the Minister might be <Col N="2271" /> persuaded to bring into benefit these people who are the most needy of the unemployed persons, those who have been unemployed longest, and who happen to be living in districts where trade has been hardest hit.  One would have thought that the first provision would have been made for them.  To say that relief schemes are a foot and that if this is added relief schemes must fall short, should not in my opinion be put forward as an argument.  If relief schemes are going to assist these people they will not go on the unemployment fund during the time they are employed, and if relief measures are not going to assist them the existence of such schemes does not bring food to their kitchen table.  After all, that is the essential factor that is of moment to these people.  Quite rightly, we must take into account all the circumstances, but the one big and overpowering factor affecting people who are hungry is hunger and the need for provision being made for them.  This is an attempt, at least, to bring these people into the position, shall I say, to give value for wages when they get employment, otherwise you are going to have men and women too hungry, too debilitated, to give value for employment when it comes.  On that account alone, it would be worth while bringing such persons into benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Johnson, in putting forward this claim for people who are, as he says, most in need, rather ignores an aspect of the question which I would like to put before the Dáil.  The trend of this legislation, which has been going on for some time, is, I think, to establish in the minds of the people that this sort of grant is going to continue in perpetuity. That, I think, would be a very harmful view for them to take.  The Minister, I take it, is extending the provisions and, in fact, straining his insurance scheme to the point of bankruptcy in his anxiety to provide for the state of unemployment which we all know has existed in the country, but when you come to deal with people who are out of benefit, one has to examine the general trend of the case.  May we <Col N="2272" /> not assume that people who have got employment, even periodically, are those people who are anxious to get employment, and the people who have not got employment, during the long period like that referred to, may be and very often are, people not too anxious to get employment at all.  Of course, there may be specific cases where I would be wrong, but I say notwithstanding the unemployment&mdash;of course, the unemployment has been there and has been rather prolonged&mdash;the men who have really been anxious for work have during that time been able to get, if not constant, at least, intermittent work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at it from the general aspect of the case, Deputy Johnson asks that a further sum of money should be provided in this direction, but I think that the measure of the ability of the funds to bear any extra strain is certainly going to make it very difficult to carry on the funds on the basis of an insurance fund.  I think the Minister has already put the fund to the maximum strain which it can <Col N="2273" /> bear, and to add anything more would only bring it to breaking point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great attention to the statements made by Deputy Hewat.  One of his statements was that the Minister is straining his insurance scheme to the point of bankruptcy.  I think Deputy Hewat will realise that at the moment he is living in a very abnormal state of affairs.  We have had very abnormal unemployment for the last three or four years and the necessity has, I think, been brought home to the Government to cater for this unemployment.  In England and Northern Ireland there is what is called the dole system in its entirety, and I doubt very much if the contribution of the workers in those two areas is able to meet the strain placed on these insurance funds.  The Minister has used a very peculiar argument.</P>
      <P>He has said in reply to Deputy Morrissey that if there is to be a further extension of unemployment benefit it would be necessary to take the extra money out of the relief schemes.  I do not think that is a fair way to put it. It would be all right for the Minister to use that argument if he were going to employ men who would not be entitled to any benefit.  I take it that it will be laid down as a rule that in the event of local authorities putting up a scheme to get some of this relief money that the Minister for Local Government, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the case may be, will insist that the men to be employed will be procured through the machinery of the Labour Exchange.  If that is so, the Labour Exchange will only be able to control the supply of men in receipt of benefit, and with whom they have been in constant intercourse day after day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he is going to secure that people not entitled to benefit would be employed under the relief schemes, there would be something in his argument, but it would be almost impossible for the Labour Exchanges to get in touch with people who will not be entitled to benefit.  In speaking on the Second Reading I suggested to the Minister that for these benefits this year he should have varied the terms of the <Col N="2274" /> Act with a view to bringing in what is called the dole system, in view of the fact that Christmas is included in the period.  Everyone would like to see some sort of happiness in the home of the worker during that period.  It is a time when people are expected to live properly, and I think even yet on the Report Stage the Minister might do something in this direction.  I do not think it is too much to ask.  On examination of the figures he will find that it will not cost too much to bring in the people Deputy Morrissey wishes to bring in by this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wished I was speaking from the opposition side, with no sense of responsibility.  I have to set all the factors one against the other, and to arrive at what seems to be the most equitable course under the circumstances.  If there was a policy that maintenance must be provided for everybody, and if there was money to carry out such a policy, then this Act would be criminally inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is a will there is a way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of will; it is a case of whether there is money, and the way it is to be found. If there was a seriously considered view taken of the whole financial situation here, of the number of unemployed, and the way to get them employed, which is by increased trade, the realisation that every increase or additional burden put on unemployment insurance is a burden on the only source from which it can afterwards get employment benefit, then I think Deputies on the Labour Benches would not speak as they have done.  Everybody with any humanity would wish that people should be kept in a decent way, but we are not in such an ideal situation that we can say that is a policy which can be carried out. It may be something to aim at.  It is a humane idea, but we are up against hard facts, and the whole situation has to be looked at in the light of this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tried to set aside certain money which will have to be used in an <Col N="2275" /> unextravagant way, for you are putting men at a work which is not their normal occupation, and you have money set aside to keep people employed and to keep body and soul together, and give some chance for things to revive. Here is a proposition to multiply every contribution by three.  Take the figures I gave on the Second Reading, and the effect of the Bill will be seen to be this, that it is to give 16 weeks benefit for 33,000 out of 50,000; that is, 66 per cent. of the whole, and of the remaining 17,000, 13,000 will have benefit for a period not less than 4½ weeks.  That is below the average of what that remaining number will have.  If you multiply as suggested here, it means that 33,000 applicants will receive full benefit this year, and carry something over to next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment will have to be looked at in the light of the section to which it is an amendment, and the fact that the Bill is, to a certain extent, an amendment of previous Acts.  Contribution benefit not exhausted in any one benefit year is carried over to next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That again is blocked by another financial consideration. I am speaking now of the amendment. It may be that Deputy Morrissey did not intend there should be any carry-over, but that is the effect of the amendment, and it is, in viewing it from that particular point of view I said the increased cost would be over £100,000, and the financial state of things would not allow it.  That cannot be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am speaking of the amendment as it ought to be <Col N="2276" /> interpreted, and not the amendment as interpreted by Deputy Morrissey.  It is an amendment aiming to carry over benefit not blocked by any regulations which I have the power to make under this section.  That is not a situation we can contemplate with equanimity, that by an amendment of this sort you are going to add over £100,000.  It would be something less than that, taking the meaning Deputy Morrissey intended it to have, but it would add a considerable amount to it.  It is said it is not fair for me to assert that any money absorbed in this way would have to come off relief schemes.  That is a thing that has to be faced.  It is an absolute necessity. It is a harsh thing to say, but where there is a limited sum of money what you absorb in some way will have to come off some other fund, and the fullest provision possible has been made to meet the situation between this and the early spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be fair to say that the relief scheme will to a great extent relieve the unemployment fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought that the moneys set apart for relief schemes were going to have the effect the Deputy suggests, I would not have extended this Bill at all.  I believe it is going to take a considerable time for employment to start under these relief schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take at least four weeks before they get fully under way: Suppose it only takes the four weeks, that means four thousand of the total of unemployed will not have benefit to carry them over the waiting period until the work does start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point has been made that you have no guarantee that the people aimed at in this amendment will be the people actually getting employment under any of the schemes.  I do not say that can be absolutely guaranteed, but provision can be made that people who are in benefit should not be given work until those who are not in benefit are extended or absorbed on schemes.  I do not know whether Deputies on the other side will <Col N="2277" /> consider that a good thing to do.  It may be, and it is a thing that could be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We could see if, by regulation, instruction or advice, that sort of thing could be done.  Perhaps it might meet the situation in some way, but it does not give the guarantee the Deputies want.  That involves a considerable sum of money, and that sum is not there to put up for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform the Minister that what he has said convinces me all the more that his scheme fails absolutely to meet the situation.  When he tells us that the amendment would mean at least another £100,000, then we begin to get some idea of the number of people practically destitute and, perhaps, on the verge of starvation.  The Minister says it is all a question of finance and the getting of money.  I venture to suggest there are certain things the Government would make sure of getting money for if it were necessary.  I want to emphasise that if we have thirty or thirty-three thousand people in this country, with their dependents, practically destitute and on the verge of starvation, then it is the duty of the Government to see that those people shall not die from starvation, although possibly the Minister may deny that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to him&mdash;he has, in fact, already admitted it&mdash;that there is a very large number of people at the moment in the country in a very bad way.  It is the duty of the Minister and the Government to come to the relief of those people.  It certainly is one of the responsibilities of the Government.  That is the claim I make.  When a particular Party is returned here and that Party forms a Government, taking upon itself the responsibility of running the country, it is its duty to see the people of the country shall not die of hunger. Deputy Hewat said the reason that the people whom this amendment is framed to relieve do not get employment is because they are not anxious to work. I wonder has Deputy Hewat any real <Col N="2278" /> idea of the number of unemployed in Ireland.  What he has put forward might be very feasible in normal times; but does he not realise&mdash;if he does not he ought to&mdash;there is such a large number of unemployed in this country that no matter how anxious to work men are, they all cannot get work?  That is the trouble.</P>

I am not going to say that for one moment; but I do suggest to the Deputy that there are hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of unemployed who would be very glad to get any sort of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point. They have tried, and are trying to get work, and are very anxious to work in order to support themselves and their families.  When they have failed in their efforts to get work, it is the duty of the Government to come to their assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  This amendment will not give any benefit to a man who has not some stamps on his card.  It will authorise no benefit in those circumstances, and Deputy Hewat can be quite easy in his mind that the type of person he is afraid will get benefit if the amendment is accepted, will not get benefit.  I put it to the Minister that whether it is by means of this Bill or otherwise, it is the duty of the Government&mdash;and a duty they cannot <Col N="2279" /> shirk&mdash;to provide sustenance for people who require it.  I would impress upon him that he should try to frame some regulation, or issue some instructions, to provide that unemployed people who have no prospect of getting unemployment benefit should be the first to be relieved under this scheme. As far as we on these benches are concerned, we are quite satisfied to give all the assistance we can.  The Minister said he would like to be sitting on those benches with no sense of responsibility. Let me tell him, and any others who may think with him, that we on these benches have a full sense of our responsibility, and it is because of the feeling of responsibility we have to the people we represent that this amendment is submitted.  It is our responsibility to bring home to the Minister and his colleagues their responsibility with regard to unemployed people who cannot get any relief.</P>

It provides that during the fourth benefit year each of the total number of contributions paid shall be treated as equivalent to three, or such lesser number of contributions as the Minister may from time to time prescribe by regulations made for the purpose&mdash;for the purpose of doing something within the fourth benefit year.  It was thought that that would have made it clear that the proposal in the amendment is not to go beyond the intentions in the Bill in respect to the fourth benefit year.  I anticipate that we shall probably have to have another Bill before the end of the fourth benefit year, and, therefore, in the amendment it is only intended to cover the fourth benefit year in any case.  However, the Minister suggests that the drafting will probably give credits beyond the fourth benefit year.  In that case, if we can have the general intentions accepted by the Minister, we might find means of improving the drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2280" /> In respect to the general case that the Minister has made on the ground that the amendment would impose too great a charge upon the fund, inasmuch as it gives insured persons the possible maximum of 16 weeks, whereas their actual credits might only give them a maximum of, say, 5 weeks, I think that the claim is quite a reasonable one.  But if the Minister is insisting that it is because of the amount that this would impose upon the fund, I would ask him to agree at least to ensure that unemployed persons would be entitled, shall I say, to benefit to the extent of three stamps for one, or not exceeding that, provided that instead of sixteen weeks ensured to such persons it shall be, say, ten out of the sixteen.  We have, I think, particulars which would suggest that there have been nearly 10,000 persons who, in the previous benefit year, were only entitled to a maximum of three weeks' benefit.  Unless we can show that employment has generally improved, there will be a fair proportion of those persons who will not have more than three weeks for the fourth benefit year, and for the rest of the sixteen weeks.  That is, thirteen other weeks they will be in the position of unemployed persons without means.  The fewer they are, the greater the improvement there may be in trade, the greater the effect that this relief fund expenditure will have, the less the chances are that these persons will have to fall upon the unemployment insurance.</P>
    <P>But I submit that we ought to make the utmost possible provision for these people who have suffered the greatest on account of unemployment, people who during the last three years have not been able to accumulate reserves, against whom the troubled times and the industrial depression have worked the heaviest damage.  Those are the people, at any rate, that should be brought into the position of receiving benefits under this scheme.  If it is a question of the impossibility of meeting the requirements of the amendment, inasmuch as it, perhaps, goes a little bit beyond what the Minister thinks is possible, I would urge that he should meet the case to some degree more than it is met by the Bill in its original form. <Col N="2281" /> We must bear in mind that within this period of four years many young men have come into manhood.  They were not employed regularly; the opportunities of regular employment have not offered.  They have taken on short jobs here and there.  They have had a few stamps to credit in one, two or three years, but have not been able to accumulate reserves of benefit.</P>
    <P>These are the people that are going to be hit hardest and, unfortunately, they are the people who will be most liable to indiscreet action, to say nothing harder, because of their continual unemployment; they are the people who will suffer most in their ability to undertake useful employment effectively when it does offer.  For all these considerations, I would urge the Minister to endeavour to meet the cases of these unfortunate people who have had a lesser share of employment since 1920 than the rest of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a case on a statement made by me when replying on the last day.  That statement I have to correct, and I shall correct it in a moment.  The Deputy is arguing that because the phrase &ldquo;during the fourth benefit year&rdquo; is used in this amendment, that that limits the whole effect of this multiplication to the benefit year that we are now in. It might limit the multiplication, but the multiplication will be a single act, which will take place within the fourth benefit year, and then the other clauses of the code generally will come on, providing that the unexhausted contributions in any one year will go into the next year.  The words used in this amendment are &ldquo;during the fourth benefit year.&rdquo;  The effect is that here and now you do the multiplication. But the result of the multiplication flows over into the next benefit year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear now that Deputy Morrissey meant not merely to have the multiplication done here and now but to restrict the operation of his amendment to the fourth benefit year.  In arguing against the Deputy previously, I said that the effect of his proposal, as put here, would be just as I have described it&mdash;that although the act of multiplying would take place now, the <Col N="2282" /> result would overflow into the next benefit year.  I described that as involving a cost to the State of about £100,000.  That was wrong.  What Deputy Morrissey actually seeks to do would cost £100,000.  What his amendment, as phrased, would do, would cost four times that amount.  What his actual intention is&mdash;that is, not to have any carry-over beyond this benefit year&mdash; would cost £100,000.  That was what I referred to when I spoke previously, and not to the amendment in extended operation, which he says he does not mean and which it is quite clear he did not mean.</P>
    <P>It is then argued that the mere statement of that fact&mdash;that it would involve an extra payment of £100,000&mdash; shows how far short this measure falls of meeting the existing situation.  That is one way of looking at it.  You can argue that this £100,000 is a huge figure and that it shows how great the deficit is and how far the present measure falls short of meeting the existing situation.  You can say that it is a pretty useless measure, in view of that. But that is a statement which would only be made by people who do not realise the enormous sums of money paid out yearly under the operations of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  Twenty thousand people drawing benefit continuously would cost the State, with administration expenses, a quarter of a million a quarter, or about £1,000,000 per annum.  That is merely for twenty thousand people.  When you look at this question in the light of that sum of £100,000, it does seem big, and it is a reasonable argument, superficially, to say that it means that a considerable number of people will be without benefit. But work it down to terms of people and weeks and it reveals the fact that, say, seven thousand people&mdash;to put it roughly&mdash;will be without benefit over a period of fourteen weeks.  If we put it the other way, 14,000 people will be without benefit for seven weeks. Deputy Johnson has just spoken of 10,000 persons who came into the third benefit year, having three weeks' benefit or less, and said that consequently, even with this unamended proposal, these 10,000 people will only be put in <Col N="2283" /> benefit to the extent, at most, of three weeks.  That, I think, is a wrong deduction from the figures I gave on Second Reading.  I assume the Deputy is making that deduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the figure may be too great, but I suggest that approximately it is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not by any means.  The Deputy spoke of 10,000.  I hold that about 3,000 persons would have benefit accruing to them of three weeks or less.  That is the estimate.  If the Deputy will take the second series of figures given by me on Second Reading he will see that I stated that 6,000 claimants would be entitled, if this Bill became law, to from one day to 36 days' benefit&mdash;that is, from one day to six weeks.  The real estimate, I think, would be about 2,000, but certainly not more than 3,000 will have benefit accruing to them only to the extent of three weeks.  The other figures I gave are really the important figures in this connection.  The effect of the Bill, as it stands, will be to provide 16 weeks' full benefit for from 20,000 to 33,000 people. I do not say that 33,000 people will begin to receive benefit after the passing of this Bill and go on automatically. Some of them will have received benefit up to the date of the passing of the Bill, but, looking at the fourth benefit year as a whole, 33,000 people will be entitled to 16 weeks' benefit.  Of the remaining 17,000, 13,000 will be entitled to not less than 4½ weeks' benefit. That leaves 4,000 under the four and a half weeks' benefit mark.</P>
      <P>The question of relief works has been brought in.  The suggestion that has been thrown out regarding employment of non-benefit persons is one that we can meet by sending forward the names.  That will meet the situation to a certain degree, but it will not be a definite guarantee that there will be no overlapping and that people without benefit will not be deprived of work to the advantage of people who actually have benefit.  But we will attend to it as well as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred rightly to my use of the word &ldquo;responsible.&rdquo;  I did use the word but I think the tone <Col N="2284" /> in which I used it showed that I was referring to a particular type of responsibility. Deputies on this side have to view a situation from many aspects. Deputies on the Labour Benches have only to view a question from one or two aspects.  That was what I intended to suggest by the use of the word &ldquo;responsible,&rdquo; and I had no intention of applying the term in the sense suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken into account the people in many small towns and in many large towns where there will be no relief schemes, or the case of women for whom there has been no suggestion of relief schemes, as far as I know, who are going to be left with the possible four weeks out of 16 during which they will obtain unemployment benefit?  They are left then for the balance of that period if they cannot get employment, helpless, drifting, waiting, and this is sharpening the iron in their souls against everything that appertains to the State.  I wish the Minister would think in terms of the odd few rather than even the large numbers.  I feel that you would get groups of people in the large towns or smaller towns who are away from the possibility of relief schemes, away from the possibility of employment developing rapidly under any schemes that may be brought forward and who are going to be left stranded during all these weeks, over this period, and this is a winter period during which they will certainly suffer more physically than they would in a summer period.  I wish it were possible for the Minister to amend the Bill so as to include these people in some more benefit than they are getting under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one more appeal to the Minister to try to do something that would relieve the position of those people whom the Minister speaks of and who number roughly 4,000.  I am prepared to accept the number as being right.  I am sure it is right.  But you have got to take into consideration those who are depending on the 4,000.  The Minister makes a point about the 4,000.  He might say the fewer the number the lesser the charge.  I would put it to the <Col N="2285" /> Minister that after all those people have a right to expect that something should be done for them; especially, as Deputy Johnson, says, when we are in the midst of the winter period, and the Minister very well knows that this is going to be the hardest winter we have had even for the last three or four years, because owing to the failure of crops and other things there has been a very great increase in the cost of living, and a very great increase in the prices of the absolute necessaries of life, such as flour, bacon, milk, potatoes and other things.</P>
      <P>Those people are certainly in a very wretched position, and they have nothing very promising to look forward to.  The Minister has stressed the point as to what the amendment would mean if it were accepted, but if he is prepared to try to meet the case in any way I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.  If he is prepared to look into the matter&mdash;I was going to say between now and the Report Stage, but the remaining stages are to be taken to-night&mdash;in some way, I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment. I think an effort ought to be made to meet the case.</P>

      <P>It is extremely difficult to make any promise of the sort.  I did not set out to get the result, and I do not say the Bill will result, in seeing that everybody, without exception and without any possibility of exception, is going to be relieved by way of unemployment insurance.  I think Deputies should realise without going into the figures what has been done.  If the money that has been given under relief schemes and all the other things is totted up, and if the situation is looked at properly, it will be seen that a very definite and a very whole-hearted attempt has been made to meet the situation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy speaks of 4,000.  It comes down to something about that, possibly lower. It is a well-known fact that even with the 87,000 unemployed in the country, the army at present is under strength. There has not been a sufficient <Col N="2286" /> influx of recruits to get it up to strength.  There are possibilities in other respects, but while I have very definite evidence of the seriousness of the situation in the country, still we have to face a fact like that, that there is employment going, and there are so many thousands unemployed, while the stream of recruits is not sufficient to bring the strength of the Army up to what it was arranged in some arbitrary way.  That is a matter that has to be taken into consideration, that there are avenues of employment not yet availed of.  And when Deputy Johnson talks of people that if they cannot beg or borrow must steal, you must remember that there is room in the Army for some thousands of men, and nobody can say that you have got to the point where the alternative is begging, borrowing, or stealing.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Standards which I understand have been lowered.  Modifications have been made in these standards. There was a very high medical standard especially with regard to one point.  That has been lowered to see if a greater number of recruits could be obtained.  That has to be taken into consideration, and it is not fair to put up simply this, that do what these people can, there are 4,000 people who must starve if you do not make provision for them by way of unemployment insurance, that would mean an expenditure of £100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But not those who are most likely to be on the unemployment insurance fund.  I do not think the Deputy's argument has any force with regard to this.  This thing can be looked into, but I do not say at the moment that there is any likelihood of an amendment of the Bill so as to do what the Deputy sets out to do.  Possibly there is an appreciation of the fact that certain people will not be met by this, and that will have to be <Col N="2287" /> met in some other way.  That is not very consoling to those who want every one of those 4,000 people catered for, but it is the most that can be said with honesty or any belief that something can be done for them.  I could not undertake to agree to the amendment itself or to any modification of it.  The situation can be looked at, keeping in mind all the Deputy has said.  It may be met in some other way, but no pledge can be given that it will be met.</P>

      <P>(1)  Every person enlisted in the military forces of Saorstát Eireann whose period of service terminated on or before the 29th day of June, 1924, not being a person to whom Section 4 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1924, applies shall, subject to the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920 to 1924, relating to the payment of Unemployment Benefit so far as they are not inconsistent with this section, be entitled to receive payments (in this Act referred to as &ldquo;Special Benefit&rdquo;) at weekly or other prescribed periods during the Fourth Benefit Year, at such rates as are authorised by or under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920 to 1924, for persons entitled to Unemployment Benefit and Increased Benefit so long as the Statutory conditions specified in the Principal Act continue to be fulfilled and so long as he is a person who would not be disqualified under that Act to receive Unemployment Benefit.</P>
      <P>Provided that proof of continuous unemployment prior to the date of the passing of this Act shall be accepted for the purpose of a claim to Special Benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  For the purpose of qualifying any person to receive Special Benefit under this section, but for no other purpose, there shall be deemed to have been paid in respect of him into <Col N="2288" /> an Unemployment Fund (in this Act referred to as &ldquo;The Special Unemployment Fund&rdquo;) such number of contributions as are sufficient to qualify him.</P>
    <P>(3)  No person shall receive more Special Benefit than in the proportion of one week's Special Benefit for every six contributions deemed to have been paid for him under the last preceding sub-section.</P>
    <P>(4)  No person shall receive Special Benefit for more than fourteen weeks in the Fourth Benefit Year or in respect of any period of less than one day.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purposes of this section there shall be established, under the control and management of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;) a fund called the Special Unemployment Fund into which shall be paid, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas such sum or sums as may be required for providing Special Benefit under this section and out of which Special Benefit shall be payable.</P>
    <P>(6)  Section 11 of the Principal Act and sub-section (2) of Section 1 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, shall apply to all claims for Special Benefit and all questions which shall arise in connection with such claims and as to whether any person is a person to whom this section applies.</P>
    <P>(7)  The Minister may make rules providing for any matters incidental to the receipt of Special Benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (7) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This section shall apply to every person to whom sub-section (4) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1924, applies to such extent as may be necessary to ensure that every such person shall receive not less by way of Unemployment Benefit, Increased Benefit and Special Benefit than he would be entitled to receive as Special Benefit if the said Section 4 had not applied to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> As the section stands, it is possible for a person who was in insurance to be in a worse position than a person who is not in insurance&mdash;that is to say, a person who had been in the Army and was in insurance could be in a worse position during unemployment than his neighbour who was not in insurance but who was also in the Army.  So far as this section is concerned between two unemployed persons, both of whom had been in the army, the man who had been insured and had made some provisions through insurance for the period of unemployment may be worse off than the man who had made no provision for himself in that respect.  The object of the amendment is to endeavour to ensure that an unemployed ex-soldier shall not be allowed to be in a worse position by virtue of the fact that he had been previously insured. That seems to be an unassailable proposition unless you are going deliberately to penalise a man for having been insured.  I would hope that it is not necessary to enlarge upon that, and I think the amendment does fulfil the intention, which is to bring the two classes of persons on to a level; that there should be no hardship applied to the ex-soldier because of the fact he had stamps to his credit or that he had been insured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment is to give every ex-National soldier, whether he was previously in an insurable occupation or not, the right to the maximum of 14 weeks, whereas the Bill confines that right of a maximum of 14 weeks to those who had not been previously in an insurable occupation. Deputy Johnson has but one way of looking at it, with the result maybe that a man who was in an insurable occupation may find himself with less weeks benefit to his credit than a man who had never been in an insurable occupation&mdash;that is to say, if you take over the fourth benefit year.  He put it as an unassailable proposition that a man who had been in an insurable occupation should be at least as much entitled to insurable unemployment money as a man who never was in an insurable occupation.  That is unassailable, <Col N="2290" /> but how we differ is as to what is the period over which that should be granted.  The ex-National Army man who had been in insurable occupation had been drawing, if he needed it, unemployment money in two benefit years.</P>
      <P>The ex-National Army man who had not been in insurable occupation has drawn no benefit up to this.  The man who had not been previously in an insurable occupation, and had nothing to do, will get the maximum up to 14 weeks; the other man will get a multiple over him, or as much as three times whatever was due to him, not merely what was due in stamps, but under the special provisions for ex-soldiers that was originally established under the 1923 Act.  Now, to the ex-service man previously in insurable occupation the average is received over 14 weeks, so that the ex-National Army man, who was not in insurable occupation and received no benefit up to date, is now having paid back to him in one lump, if you look at it, what the other ex-National Army man had paid to him, or is about to have paid to him, in three divisions, so that is not unfair at all.  We are now giving a 14 weeks maximum to the ex-soldier who needs it most&mdash;those who got no benefit before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that does not prove that he needs it most.  The man may have been in first-class occupation before he joined the Army, and had no need to insure.  He joins the Army service, and after a period comes out and comes into unemployment, or he might have been employed for a short time; he will not be in need nearly as much as the man who was in unemployment before he joined the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I talk about the greater need deliberately, and I define it in that particular way.  Looking at the matter in lump, I find 30,000 men now out of the Army.  Fifteen thousand previously had occupations that entitled them to insurance.  Ten thousand applied for benefit and got it.  The remaining 15,000, unless the Deputy on the other side would deduct a percentage of them, found employment as soon as they left the Army, but have lost their employment since.  They are reduced to the position Deputy Johnson describes&mdash;that is, that if they do not beg or borrow they must steal; but we look at it so that they may not say that there are 15,000 men without any provision for them from the State by way of benefit.  We say we will make it up to them now, and we give this maximum of 14 weeks.  With regard to the others, we say what we have given under the terms of the 1923 Act we extend under the 1924 Act, and we are reviving now in the third benefit year the contribution they had firstly revived for them under the 1924 Act, and we say, looking at it broadly, that those who had not been in insurable occupations and are now coming on the Insurance Fund for the first time, deserve it, and some of them more, than people who got the same benefit previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the Minister and myself amounts to this.  He is placed in the possession of certain figures and looks at the matter in a broad way and draws certain deductions from his figures.  I am thinking of two men living in some street in the same town or village.  One working in the building trade, say, and was insured before he went into the army. The other was working in another occupation, a foundry, a farmer, or a shop porter, and had not been insured for many years.  Perhaps he had followed the advice of some irresponsible members of the Sinn Fein organisation, which we had to try to counter in many ways, and he refused to be insured <Col N="2292" /> because he was told if he did so he would be bolstering the British Government in Ireland.  However, for one reason or another, he was not insured, whereas his brother or neighbour living side by side with him was insured. They both went into the army and they come into unemployment benefit, and the one finds himself penalised because he was insured and the other finds himself benefited because he was not insured.</P>
      <P>That is the way it strikes me, and that is the way it would appeal to these men.  You can talk about how it works out broadly and on averages, but, unfortunately, the individual, the man who has a grievance, the man who feels himself penalised, does not think of averages at all; he is not thinking of the matter as it affects 10,000, 15,000, or 20,000 men; he is thinking about how it affects himself and his family, and you are going to create a great deal of dissatisfaction within the ranks of the ex-soldiers because of penalisation owing to the fact that a man was insured.  The Minister makes the case that there was not any real penalisation, that the person who was not insured would have got the same benefit, or, if he did not get the benefit, the benefit was there, because of his insurance, and he ought to take that into account.  Again, that is not going to meet the case, that you have gone out of your insurance scheme in respect of ex-soldiers; you have brought them into a special relationship to the unemployment fund, but you say to the ex-soldiers who prior to joining the Army were insured that they have to remain on the insurance basis, while their friends, their neighbours, who had not been insured, are to be treated in a special way; you are bringing them out of insurance; you are putting them on what is called the dole system of uncovenanted benefit for a period of fourteen weeks.  Certainly that will strike many men as being an unfair discrimination against the man who was in an insurable occupation in favour of the man who was not in an insurable occupation, where they both joined the Army and find themselves unemployed at the same time.</P>

      <P>It was an unfortunate choice, because the ex-National soldier who has been in the building trade would find himself, if he were out of employment, with a full sixteen weeks' benefit.  Those who were in the building trade have had a big number of contributions to their credit.</P>

      <P>Let me take the other point.  I think the Deputy referred to two men living in the same village.  I do not know if he added &ldquo;since they left the Army.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But I would like him to add it for the purpose of my argument.  A was not in an insurable occupation, and B. was, and up to this B. has had tremendous dissatisfaction because he has seen A. over a lengthy period since he left the Army drawing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are both employed up to date; neither of them is unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is taking a particular case.  Then I want to change it; I want to take two ex-National Army men, both unemployed since they left the Army, which is the more usual thing, and living in the same village, A. previously in an insurable occupation and B. not. B. has had a tremendous sense of dissatisfaction up to this, because A. has been drawing benefit for some number of weeks in each benefit year and he has not, and now the thing changes.  Remember, A. is not deprived of benefit; he again has his contributions multiplied, whatever they may be. B. gets all the maximum of fourteen weeks.  Now, if A. is to be dissatisfied <Col N="2294" /> that B., who heretofore has got nothing, is to get the full fourteen weeks in this benefit year, that is to be set-off against the dissatisfaction that B. had previously in seeing A. getting all these contributions and all these payments. Think what the insured soldier did get up to this.  You require, first of all, for any ex-National Army man to get benefit that he must have had twenty contributions at any time, or ten since a particular date, and if that condition were fulfilled in the average number of cases, he would be entitled to twenty-four periods of benefit.  That was revived under the 1924 Act, that in the fourth benefit year, whatever portion has been exceeded in the third is again being revived.  The uninsured man up to date has had nothing; he is now put into full benefit for a maximum of fourteen weeks.  I think the balance has been held fairly evenly between the two sets of this particular group of ex-National service men; the man who had an insurable occupation and who had some stamps to his credit has got them multiplied by three, has not merely got the stamps multiplied, but has got the stamps put to his credit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would it be possible at all for an ex-National Army man who had been insured prior to his joining the Army to have the total of his benefit during the third and fourth benefit years less than fourteen weeks? That is to say, could he draw six weeks in each period?  Would that be the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me state again that it is possible that the ex-soldier who had been in an insurable occupation will in this benefit year draw less than fourteen, or that in the two years, the third and fourth, it is possible. I have stated already that the number of weeks to which the average ex-service man would be entitled in the third and fourth benefit year is much higher than fourteen.  But what the Deputy points out is possible, that either in the fourth benefit year, or in the third and fourth together, a man <Col N="2295" /> previously insured would have less insurance money to draw than a man who was not previously in an insurable occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what proportion of ex-Army men would receive less&mdash;the total of the two years?  I know it is not easy to say offhand, but would it be high?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible now of course to give the Deputy any figures with regard to what the number would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that.  I am wondering would it be high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But the minimum must be at least twelve weeks; the minimum that any ex-soldier, previously insured, would have in the two benefit years, the third and fourth, would be twelve.  The average is over fourteen.  If you look at it simply from the point of view of the angle of the fourth benefit year, or the angle of any previous payments a case can be made, an anomaly can be shown, that a man previously insured will get less money this particular year than a man not previously insured.  But when you look at the average of the whole period since the two groups left the Army, the balance is definitely against the man who was not previously insured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister admit that it would not cost so very much to put something into the Bill which would enable an Army man who has been insured to get fourteen weeks at least over the two benefit years, to put him on the same level as the other, and thereby get rid of confusion?  If the average was twelve weeks for the two parties, the Government themselves would have a better case to answer arguments, and it would not cost them very much.</P>

      <P>They are far away.  I do not know that the person whom Deputy Corish wants to please <Col N="2296" /> would really make the calculation over the third and fourth benefit years.  The man who will be dissatisfied will found his case for dissatisfaction on a legitimate grievance, on the fact that from the passing of this Bill he will get less than the man previously insured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were nothing else what I suggest would provide ordinary Deputies with an answer when they go down the country and are asked these questions.  Ministers are here in their offices; I know that they have plenty to do; I am not complaining about that, but it would be very easy for a member of the Government Party, or any other Party, to put up a good case in support of the Government if the Government were to do something like what I have suggested.  I submit that it would not cost very much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite right that it would not cost us very much, but I do not think that that grievance is so big that it requires to be met.  Take one other point.  When is it expected that this Bill will be passed?  When will payments begin to be made on foot of it?  How many weeks will have to run before the end of the fourth benefit year?  I do not think that there will be sufficient time to enable the ex-soldier not previously insured, coming under the operation of this clause, to get fourteen weeks.  He will probably go down below the average of what the ex-National Army previously insured would have got over the third and fourth year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how quickly the Bill goes through. We are faced by a situation in which it would have been possible to give 14 <Col N="2297" /> weeks.  I will promise to look into the matter as to the number of people it is going to affect.  If it is considered necessary there may be a possibility of amending it in the Seanad, but I do not think there is much hope of that being done.  The ex-soldier who had really a grievance is the ex-soldier who was not previously in an insurable occupation. He has now been met, as fully as anybody could meet him, in this fourth benefit year.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Major Cooper, I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section 6 to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Special Benefit under this section shall be payable to any persons demobilised from the military forces of Saorstát Eireann who reside outside the jurisdiction of the Saorstát under conditions to be prescribed by the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the point was raised on the Second Reading, and I think it was rather stated by the Minister that he was prepared to consider it.  I do not know that it really requires argument. It is obviously a case that might arise and it would appear certainly, as such, to deserve consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I gave any undertaking at all that this would be accepted and I do not think any words of mine could have led Deputy Bryan Cooper to think that it would be accepted.  I did ask, on Second Reading, that certain arguments on certain points which might have been brought with regard to our attempts to secure reciprocity with regard to benefits, should be postponed and that either by a motion, or some night on the adjournment, that these points should be discussed.  This is totally a new thing.  The amendment says that &ldquo;special benefit under this section shall be payable to any demobilised ex-service men who reside outside the jurisdiction of the Saorstát under conditions to be prescribed by the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  Now, that is very far flung.  I could imagine the <Col N="2298" /> cases of ex-National Army men who have emigrated to Australia&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are no definite conditions, just &ldquo;conditions to be prescribed by the Minister with the approval of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  That is to say, the principle is that we are being asked to provide out of the funds of the State, moneys to be paid to people who are outside our jurisdiction and outside our authority, to people who have, for some reason or other, taken themselves outside the area of our jurisdiction.  I do not think it is a reasonable proposition, and I do not think it is a reasonable proposition to be put up in this vague way.  We have, under the previous Acts, power to enter into arrangements with regard to reciprocity&mdash;if that is what the Deputy was talking about, as I think it was, when he referred to what I said on the Second Reading&mdash; but this is entirely a novel principle and I do not think it could be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to imply that the Minister pledged himself to accept the principle of this amendment, but my recollection was that he was inclined to consider it.  I must say the case that occurred to my mind when I read the amendment was something of this kind, that there might have been serving in the forces of the Free State certain people who would wish to have been citizens of the Free State.  I may say frankly I can imagine the case of people who have come from quite close to the Border, who enlisted in the forces of the Free State, and afterwards either because they could not get employment in the Free State or for other reasons, may have gone to the other side.  I can quite imagine many cases of a special kind like that in which the Minister would consider that these people deserve well of the Free State; having served in the Free State forces but not being able to find employment in the Free State, they have gone beyond the borders of the Free State.  I think the <Col N="2299" /> far-flung case which the Minister has cited is outside the range of probability. I do not think a person in Australia would be likely to claim benefit.  I have done my part if I have got the Minister even to consider the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert a new sub-section before Section 4, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In any case where the Minister is satisfied that a claimant for benefit has suffered exceptional unemployment and that his opportunities for securing employment have been exceptionally restricted by reason of destruction of property to which the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act, 1923, applies, the Minister may authorise the payment of Unemployment Benefit and Increased Benefit to the claimant, without regard to the number of contributions paid in respect of him, up to the maximum period for which benefit is payable under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>This is to give the Minister a certain discretion to provide benefit, regardless of contributions&mdash;that is, uncovenanted benefits, in special cases, but subject to the ordinary conditions in other respects. It is intended to apply to cases like Balbriggan or Mallow where there was great damage done which threw a great many people out of employment owing to burning of factories, and where there has been no possibility of getting employment by the people who were disemployed owing to those acts. An attempt has been made to bring in a definition by using the Compensation Act of 1923 so as to give the Minister something to go upon in defining the particular kind of cases referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case is important as affecting a comparatively small number of people. It deals with exceptional unemployment, <Col N="2300" /> and it provides that the Minister has an opportunity to meet the case of men and women, and particularly of women, in those places where, owing to extraordinary circumstances, unemployment has been chronic since the year of the destruction, and where they had no opportunity to develop credits because of that destruction.  The particular cases are left to the discretion of the Minister, and while I admit that the phraseology, perhaps, makes it a little bit difficult to understand without reference to the various Acts referred to, I think it is fairly safe in defining the kind of case that it is proposed to deal with.  There are one or two hundred people affected, and a fair proportion of those have not had an opportunity of employment since the time of the destruction.  It is hoped that the Minister will accept this extra power to use his discretion in respect of special benefits in the cases I have mentioned. I expect the Minister to accept the amendment and earn the gratitude of quite a number of people who have had a long period of suffering in an extraordinary situation unparalleled in the general problem of unemployment in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This would put on me the obligation of considering every case where a claim might be made and not in the two hundred cases Deputy Johnson has decided should make a claim.  Every claimant might come along and urge destruction of property. It might not necessarily be in the town where the property was destroyed. The destruction of property in one town might have a repercussion on that trade generally all over Ireland, and I would have to find out in each case whether I was satisfied that exceptional unemployment had arisen and whether the opportunities for employment had been restricted.  You would require a staff of judges to work that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>We would give you a voluntary staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>A voluntary staff might involve me in more payments than the fees of a judicial staff. It would be quite impossible to carry <Col N="2301" /> this out through the medium of the ordinary exchanges.  Referees and umpires could not tackle this task, and it would be quite impossible to carry it out without heavy administrative expenses. If one had an assurance that the application would be restricted to the two hundred it would be a different thing.  I do not think that the example the Deputy took, that of Balbriggan, is a good one.  Supposing there were only 200 claimants whose claims were to be examined and it was restricted to them it would be all right, but the Deputy knows that if this were passed everyone would be able to make a claim and show a case that unemployment was due to an exceptional situation which was due to the destruction of property. It is owing to the impossibility of getting speedy decisions and anything approaching to justice and owing to the administrative cost that would be entailed that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would have access to the employer, and he would know quite easily from him if the employment was caused by the destruction of that particular factory.  I think there is machinery easily adaptable in this scheme of Unemployment Insurance to show if the claim was due to the place having been destroyed.  I do not think it is beyond the point of reasonable practicability of administering the proposals in such a way as to limit it to the claims of those persons who suffer unemployment directly from the destruction of property, and whose chances of re-employment have been nil because of that destruction.  I think if the Minister would agree to the proposition, that the direct unemployment arose from the destruction of the late employers' property, he would find the number of cases comparatively small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take it on the example the Deputy brought forward, Balbriggan.  It is a fact that all hosiery places are at present depressed. There is great depression in that trade. Possibly it would be easy enough to find out from the owner of the destroyed Balbriggan premises what proportion of unemployment was <Col N="2302" /> caused immediately after it by the destruction, but it would be very hard to estimate now what proportion of the Balbriggan workers&mdash;even if the place was still going&mdash;would be thrown out of employment by reason of the depression that is common to the hosiery business at the moment.  If I had to discriminate on that point, I am afraid the gratitude I would earn from those who would get some benefit under this Bill would be completely outweighed by the criticism of those I would have to judge as suffering simply from ordinary trade depression.  It is entirely unworkable, and putting the cause down as directly to destruction of a building would not be any great help.  Certainly, it would by no means justify me in the minds of those precluded from getting special benefit under the section.</P>
