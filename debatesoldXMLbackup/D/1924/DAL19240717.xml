      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the tariffs in the 1924-5 Budget are based on information as to the productive capacity of the principal industries in the Saorstát, and, if so, if he will state what is the explanation of the exclusion of the textile industry from the benefit of tariffs.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the various new Customs duties imposed in the Finance Bill, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>10 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on candles, 15 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on boots and shoes, 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on empty bottles, and 10 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on soap.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the information on which these duties were based was otherwise than sound, and before any extension of the principle which such duties represent can be considered, it will be necessary to see what the actual results of the operation of the existing duties will be over a period. I might also refer to the statement made by the Minister for Finance when the Deputy raised this matter of the textile industry during the debate on Financial Resolution No. 19 on the 6th and 7th May last.</P>

      <P>All the evidence put before the Committee was most carefully considered, and the Minister for Finance is not prepared to re-open any case upon which the Committee reported unfavourably, unless fresh material evidence, not previously presented to the Committee, is forthcoming.  It must be assumed that as a rule all material evidence was placed before the Committee and consequently no general reinvestigation is called for.  In any exceptional case where new evidence of a material kind is forthcoming, that evidence will be considered by the Minister if submitted.  The cases recommended by the Committee which still remain to be dealt with must naturally take precedence.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that answer, does the President not consider that the answer seems to be somewhat contradictory of the answer given by the Minister for Finance some time ago, when he did, I think, give us to understand that in the cases which had not been recommended by this Committee and which it was urged had not been fully and fairly considered, there would be some opportunity for a review?  My recollection is quite distinct on that point.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state what is a Dry Canteen, and what is its function in a military barracks; and whether a present invitation to tender for such at Cork, Bandon, Kinsale, Fermoy, Haulbowline, Tralee, Bantry, Kilkenny, Clonmel, and Waterford is addressed exclusively to &ldquo;Licensed Traders.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="MINISTER for DEFENCE (The President) William T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for DEFENCE (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Dry Canteen in a barracks is a saloon in which are sold hot and cold foods and non-alcoholic drinks, including tea, coffee and cocoa and other luxuries and necessaries usually purchased by soldiers. <Col N="1503" /> The invitation to tender referred to by the Deputy has reference in most cases to barracks in which owing to conditions of accommodation and numbers of troops it is necessary to combine the dry and wet canteens in the same rooms.  In these cases it is essential that the contractors should be licensed traders.  In the other cases it is convenient from an administrative point of view to have both canteens run by the same trader who obviously must be licensed.  The invitation was, therefore, addressed to licensed traders.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no election in the matter.  The accommodation, I understand, is limited.  Where there is suitable accommodation, I take it both these places would be kept separate. But only in these particular instances&mdash;Cork, Bandon, Kinsale, Fermoy, Clonmel, and Waterford&mdash;by reason of the lack of accommodation, these two particular canteens are carried on within the same room.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest that the persons likely to be affected by this will have the option of saying whether it shall be a dry or a wet canteen, and that there shall be no duplication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The term, &ldquo;dry canteen,&rdquo; or &ldquo;wet canteen&rdquo; is not exactly descriptive of what it means.  I should say that a wet canteen would mean one in which articles were sold which had no sugar in them.  That is not the description in the Army.  It means one in which intoxicating liquor is sold.  It is very desirable to have dry canteens.  I believe they have been a great success, but the accommodation in certain barracks is extremely limited.  In that particular barracks I saw in Cork there was a roof on about 120 yards of the entire building.  The rest was burnt.  In that case I should say there is not sufficient accommodation to allow of two separate saloons, and consequently the two had to be combined in one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. BYRNE</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.  I want to know whether the contractors who supply the canteens subscribe to any organisation like the Red Cross or the hospitals, such as has been done by the Canteen Board in England, which subscribed handsomely to the Red Cross Funds.  Do the contractors take all the profits, or do they give anything back for the upkeep of the hospitals, or for the convalescent treatment of soldiers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are profits and that those profits are apportioned to purposes which the soldiers themselves desire.  I am not positively certain as to whether they are devoted to such purposes as Red Cross work or hospitals.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether it is now intended to reconsider the application for dependents' allowance from Mrs. Annie Nolan, Paulville, Tullow, in respect of her son, Volunteer Patrick Nolan, No. 000774, in view of the fact that this woman was receiving over 15s. per week from her son before he joined the National Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to his previous question regarding the case on the 14th December, 1923.  It was ascertained after due investigation that prior to enlistment Patrick Nolan contributed about 6/- per week towards the unkeep of the home.  The minimum net contribution to warrant the issue of an allowance was 12/- per week.  The regulations assumed that an unmarried soldier would contribute at least one-third of his Army pay towards the support of his dependents. In Mr. Nolan's case that would have been about 8/- per week.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I regret that the decision to disallow the claim must be maintained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any abnormal effects being caused by the present regulations.  Paragraph 25 of Defence Order No. 30, dated the 8th October last, authorises the issue of marriage allowance to re-attested soldiers who had been married prior to that date.  It is not intended to revise the rates set out in that Order, of which I am sending copies to the Deputies concerned.  As the Order was not quickly promulgated, a later regulation fixed the 9th November last as the date before which men were required to have been married in order to be entitled to an allowance.  That date will not be altered until regulations, which are under consideration, are issued showing the percentage of married men that may be borne on the strength of units of the Army.  That percentage may not exceed and may even be less than the existing percentage of married soldiers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether old age pensioners, inmates of a Union, are allowed to draw their pensions, and if, upon any being transferred to the Hospice for the Dying, the pensions are immediately stopped from those so transferred.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS (for Minister for Local Government and Public Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer this question.  An old age pensioner who enters a poor law institution for the purpose of obtaining medical or surgical treatment is entitled to continue to draw his pension for a period of three months subsequent to the date of admission.  If he does not receive medical or surgical treatment, he incurs disqualification on the date of admission and payment of the pension is stopped at once.</P>
      <P>As regards institutions such as Hospices for the Dying, the position is altogether different.  These institutions are not maintained out of the rates and no disqualification is incurred in so far as the nature of the relief received in such institutions is concerned.  The value of the maintenance received in such institutions must, however, be taken into account under the Old Age Pensions Acts, and as the value of such maintenance generally exceeds the maximum limit for an old age pension, it becomes necessary to take steps for the withdrawal of the pension.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first and second parts of the question is in the affirmative. As regards the third and fourth parts, no approval has yet been given to the carrying out of the scheme.  The cost of the works has been estimated by the Rural District Council at £15,497.  No objection to the carrying out of the work was raised at the public inquiry held in connection with the Council's application for a loan but immediately after the inquiry the Country Galway Farmers' Association sent forward a copy of a resolution protesting against sanction being given to the loan on the grounds that the scheme was unnecessary at the present time, and that the farmers of the district, who were the principal ratepayers, were not in a position to have extra rates placed upon them owing to the poor condition of their industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> A sewerage scheme for Loughrea was promoted about 1913.  The cost was then estimated at £8,250.  The Council were informed that the present cost appeared to be unduly high and compared unfavourably with the estimate for carrying out the scheme of 1913, after making due allowance for the difference in the present cost of materials and labour as compared with those prevailing in 1913.  It was suggested to the Council that they should have the costs of the scheme scrutinised by their engineer with a view to effecting all economies possible.  The Council have not seen their way to suggest a reduction of cost.</P>
    <P>The repayment of a loan of £15,497 for a period of 15 years would entail an addition to the present rates of approximately 6d. in the £ on the ratepayers of the entire rural district.</P>

      <P>It is not intended to retain any of the moneys received from the sale of trespassing cattle seized prior to the passing of the Public Safety Act, 1923, by the military forces.  It is proposed, in the first instance, to compensate all persons whose stock was seized in error or who can show that the trespass was other than wilful.  When this has been done it is intended to return to the owners of seized stock the net proceeds of the sale in proportion to the value of the stock at the time of seizure.  Arrangements are at present being made to carry out this distribution, and it is hoped that it will be completed shortly.</P>

      <P>There is very little to add to what I said yesterday <Col N="1519" /> on the slightly more elaborate than usual speech I made upon the First Reading.  The Bill is now in Deputies' hands, and it can be seen that it is very short and very simple. There are four clauses to it.  The most important ones are the first and second. Section 1 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All persons registered under the Medical Acts (whether admitted to the register before or after the passing of this Act) shall in Saorstát Eireann have the like rights, privileges, and immunities and be subject to the like obligations as persons so registered had and were subject to in Ireland prior to the establishment of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It also continues as at present constituted and with the same powers the General Medical Council and the Branch Council for Ireland, and gives the universities and medical corporations in the Saorstát powers of granting diplomas and holding qualifying examinations for registration under the Medical Acts as they previously had prior to the establishment of the Saorstát. The fourth clause has one important point to which I may make reference again.  The third sub-clause states &ldquo;This Act shall continue in force for one year from the passing thereof and shall then expire.&rdquo;  I wish again to emphasise the point that that does not mean that this scheme is being continued for a year and must then be replaced by something new.  It may be replaced by something new, or the present system may be continued for some time afterwards.  That will depend upon what the Oireachtas decides some time between now and the expiration of 12 months from the passing of the Act.</P>

      <P>I agree with the policy of the Government in arranging for the postponement.  This is meant as a temporary Bill.  This matter has been discussed for months past at great length not only in the Press of this country but also in the Press of Great Britain, and I should like to know what steps the Government have taken to find a definite and final solution of this problem.  The Minister seems to think that this would depend upon the <Col N="1520" /> Oireachtas.  But it is the duty of a Government to produce a policy; and in a delicate matter of this kind it is the duty of the Government to conduct negotiations with the parties concerned, and as the result of these negotiations to bring forward final proposals before the Dáil.  In introducing this Bill on the First Reading, the Minister referred to a possible solution involving reciprocity or something less than reciprocity.  This will be a very special test case, and it involves in a practical manner the status of this country and the benefits of the Treaty regime.  And if in the next 12 months the Government are going to accept something less than reciprocity, it would be to the disadvantage of the medical profession in this country; and if the Government are contemplating such a thing, well, I think the Government are asking for trouble.  The Minister has not stated whether the Government intends, during the 12 months, to make definite proposals to the British which will eventually form the basis of a final settlement in this matter.</P>

Is that the case? Or is it the case that the fact of their taking out degrees in this country and going to England would enable them to practice in England on the payment of a very small fee?  I should like a little information on that point and also some information as to the formation of this General Council.  What are its relations, for instance, with the Privy Council in England?  And who has the appointment of the Irish representatives on that General Medical Council?  I understand that the Irish representative to be appointed on the General Medical Council in England must be and can only be appointed by the King of England.  I should like a little information on those points before voting on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer Deputy McGrath in regard to one portion at all events of his question.  The Board of the General Medical Council representing Ireland consists of men who are sent by the Universities and Licensing Bodies.  The University of Dublin sends one whom it elects itself. The National University sends another; the College of Physicians sends one; the College of Surgeons sends one; the Apothecaries Hall sends one; and the Queen's University in Belfast sends one.  Then there is one representative elected by the general practitioners of Ireland, and finally, there is one who is nominated by the Crown.  That answers the question that Deputy McGrath has asked.  During the introduction of the Bill the Minister said that he was giving a year to the medical profession in order that they should make up their minds as to what they wanted done in regard to the matter. As far as I know, the medical profession has made up its mind very definitely that it does not want to be placed in any worse position than it is at present.  Some months ago the Government asked that a conference of the Universities and the Licensing Bodies concerned should be held to consider this matter.  That conference met and spent several months in discussing this question.  The conference consisted of two representatives from University College, Dublin; one from University College, Cork; one from University College, Galway; three from Dublin University; three from the College of Physicians; three from the College of Surgeons, and two from the Apothecaries Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conference which represented at all events the educational part of medicine as far as the Free State is concerned, spent a number of months discussing the question, and in the end it sent an unanimous report to the Government to say that if possible they should remain under the existing conditions and that they wanted no change, as far as it was possible to carry that out.  I do not know whether the Dáil would attempt to listen to me, if I attempted to go through the three alternatives which were before this conference before they arrived at the unanimous conclusion that it would <Col N="1522" /> be very disastrous to the medical profession, and to medical education in the Saorstát if any change were made. Perhaps I might allude to the matter, because Deputy McGrath has raised the question as to what would happen under certain conditions.  The first alternative discussed was the establishment of a separate Medical Council, and a separate Medical Register for the control of medical education, medical examinations, and the medical practitioners of the Saorstát, without relation to the existing Council of Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme practitioners qualified and registered in the Free State would not be allowed to practice in Great Britain or its Colonies.  If such practitioners wished to practice in England they would require to pass an examination in England prescribed by some of the qualifying bodies. This examination would be of such a nature as the qualifying body would determine&mdash;at least it would be equal to the final examination.  They would have to pay for that examination the fees that are paid for the ordinary diploma, and in addition would have to pay the registration fee.  That altogether, I conclude, would amount to something like £100 put on them as an extra fee if they sought to practice in England.  The medical students here who have no hope of obtaining employment in the Free State would naturally seek to get qualified in England, or Scotland, or the North of Ireland, so that they could be placed on the General Register.  I do not know that I can take time to go into the question of the General Register on which the medical practitioners of England, Ireland, and Scotland, have been placed on an equality up to the present time, or to speak of the Colonial Registers by which Colonials are allowed to register if they sought permission and showed that their examinations are&mdash; not necessarily on an equality,&mdash;but at all events, of a degree that satisfies the General Medical Council.  In order to get on this Colonial List, the Colonies have to apply to the General Medical Council for recognition, and their individual students then have to apply for registration of their diplomas. Then when they get on this Colonial <Col N="1523" /> List, the List is regarded as inferior to the general List, because on this List there are numbers of Indians, Canadians, and Australians.  When a practitioner is looking for an appointment in England the General Register is looked up, and if his name is not there they rarely think of turning to the Colonial List, and when they do they feel they are turning to something somewhat inferior to the General List.</P>
    <P>Let me say with regard to this, that there are at least 1,000 medical students in the Free State, and they are spending at least £150 a year each, and if they are driven elsewhere for education so as to get employment the Free State is going to lose a considerable amount of money.  I calculate that £150,000 a year is spent by the parents on the medical students in the Free State.  I think one might also, perhaps. assume that in many cases where parents are not tied in any way, and their sons and daughters have to go elsewhere to look for their education, the possibility is that these parents will follow them to the seat of their education in order to live at a cheaper rate, or to allow the students to live at a cheaper rate.  That was the first alternative which was discussed by this conference.  The second alternative was to establish a separate Medical Council and a separate register for the Saorstát, which should seek for and obtain from the General Medical Council of Great Britain reciprocity similar to that which now obtains between Great Britain and her Colonies.  I might explain that if we were placed in the position of Canada or Australia we would have to apply to the Privy Council for recognition and then to the English Medical Council for recognition of our universities. At all events it is not compulsory on the council to recognise all the institutions in the Free State.  It would be quite within their rights to fail to give recognition to certain of the licensing institutions here.  As far as the reciprocity that has been spoken about is concerned, there must be under the existing circumstances application to the Privy Council, application to the Council of Universities, or Licensing Bodies, application even by the students, and <Col N="1524" /> even when that is obtained the name would only appear on the Colonial List.</P>
    <P>The third proposal made would be the ideal one, and many of us when we began to consider this matter after the Treaty were fairly satisfied that it might be obtained.  But the more we studied the matter the more we came to the conclusion that it would be impossible of attainment, namely, establishment of a separate Medical Council and a register for the Saorstát, with absolute control over the education and registration of the practitioners who qualified in its schools, while at the same time the registration of such practitioners in one country would give them <i>ipso facto</i> the right of registration in the other.  Of course, this would require new and agreed legislation and it is essential that effective reciprocity should be assured before any change is made.  We have nothing to offer the English Council in giving reciprocity to us.  I think there is no doubt that if we asked and even if we were able to obtain reciprocity, so that all our graduates and diplomees would be placed upon the General Register, that the Colonies would come in and endeavour to claim a similar right.  The General Medical Council have always set their faces against giving equality to the Colonies.  I may say also that the establishment of a General Council and Register here would either cost the State a considerable amount of money or else the practitioners throughout the country would have to pay a yearly sum in order to run this Council.</P>
    <P>As far as the distribution of those who qualified in the Free State is concerned, in the Register of 1922 there were 6,599 students who had qualified in the Free State.  Of these there were resident outside of Ireland 52 per cent.; resident in Northern Ireland, 12½ per cent.; and resident in the Free State, 35 per cent.  So that more than 50 per cent. of the students who qualified in the Free State are living outside of Ireland.  A point that was made during the conference was that of the total number on the Register the number of Irish practitioners was slightly under 7 per cent., whereas the percentage of representatives on the General Medical Council, so far as Ireland is concerned, <Col N="1525" /> amounts to twenty-one per cent.  So that we have at present a good deal more control, than the number of practitioners would entitle us to.  There is no doubt that if we gave up association with the British Council we would lose entire control over the practitioners of Irish extraction and with Irish qualifications who are practising elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It may not be out of place to say, as far as the penal clauses are concerned, that although reports are given of men in Ireland who have committed felony, or murder, or anything of that kind&mdash; although such cases as those are dealt with by the General Medical Council&mdash; there has never been any instance in which any practitioner has been brought before the Council for anything in the nature of political offence. As I started, I want to finish by saying that this Conference, representing all the Licensing Bodies in the Free State, was unanimous in the conclusion that it would be a very disastrous thing for any change to be made at present.  They considered that the third proposition put forward would be the ideal one, but they would be the ideal one, but they would be very slow, indeed, to give up the existing conditions unless they were perfectly satisfied that the free reciprocity spoken of in that clause were assured.  It would be a very serious thing for us to give up any rights we have unless we are assured that we are going to get equal rights in future.</P>
    <P>In addition to this Conference I have a letter here from the Irish Medical Association, which represents the general practitioners throughout the country.  The Irish Medical Association, at their annual meeting, last month I think it was, passed the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this meeting expresses the hope that no change will be made in the system of medical registration in the Irish Free State which would interfere with the right at present possessed by medical men qualified in Ireland who practise in Great Britain and the Dominions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as the medical profession is concerned, we have here the Association which represents the entire profession throughout the country and we <Col N="1526" /> have also the opinion of the people engaged in teaching and who are connected with the Universities and Licensing Bodies.  I have pleasure in supporting the Second Reading of the Bill.  I am not explaining why it was necessary this Bill should be rushed, as I think the Minister did that sufficiently when he was introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect that there would be a discussion on the merits of this Bill or, as it turned out, on the merits of a Bill of a much more important character.  The claim of the Bill to support lies in the fact, and only in the fact, in my opinion, that it intends to make valid certificates which were believed by large numbers to be already valid, and to prevent injustice to a considerable number of people who at present are on the point of taking out certificates.  I want to protest against the assumptions that have apparently been made by Deputy Sir James Craig and to say that beyond the present Bill which deals with specific injustices or what would be injustices, there is a bigger and a much wider question to be discussed whenever any further action has to be taken.  As the Minister for Justice so often reminds us, it is a question of angles, and if we are to continue to hold the idea that young men and women whose parents are in a position to enable them to spend £150 per year as medical students are for exportation, then we have got to recast our conceptions of education. This fifty odd per cent. of doctors who have been educated in Ireland and are practising abroad may have been explainable and understandable in the past, but surely it is not going to be suggested that we should continue to assume that several hundred young men and women per year are to be educated in universities and medical schools with the object that fifty per cent. or more of them must, when finished, go abroad?  I take it, it is not the intention to aim deliberately at being a colonising people.  If we are going to be a colonising people, we shall not send medical practitioners. Usually it is mainly rum and guns that they do the colonising with.  But, quite seriously, I say that we ought not to proceed on the assumption that <Col N="1527" /> the schools, colleges and universities will for ever be devoted to the training of doctors or other professional people for practising in other countries.</P>

      <P>One can usually foretell the angle from which Deputy Johnson approaches a question.  It is an angle that ignores natural courses and in this case it has ignored the natural attraction that a wealthy and prosperous country has for the able and the adventurous.  I think it is inevitable, as long as the United States exists, and as long as Great Britain exists, that Irishmen will go out in the future, as they did in the past, to find a wider field of enterprise.</P>

      <P>I do not say that they should be facilitated, but I think if you try to place obstacles in the way you will come up against the forces of nature.  We all know that in the past, taking only one profession, that Ireland was too small for men like the late Lord Northcliffe, Mr. Garvin and many eminent American journalists.  I am not sufficiently acquainted with the medical profession to quote similar instances, but I am sure there are some also.  You cannot fight nature.  It is absolutely ridiculous to put up paper or legislative barriers and say: &ldquo;You have got to live in Ireland, and we will make it as difficult as possible for you to earn a living outside it.&rdquo;  We have a duty to others besides ourselves in this country.  I believe the world would do very badly without Irish brains and Irish genius.  I am not going to support any proposal or measure that would hinder us from giving light to Europe and the world, as we once gave it in the past&mdash;the light of science and the light of knowledge.  I may tell Deputy Gorey that we once, in the dark ages, spread it throughout the world and it may be our mission again.  I want to make that easy, not difficult. For the time being I think we had better get on with the Bill that is under consideration.</P>

      <P>While one agrees to a certain extent with Deputy Cooper, I think there is a good deal in what Deputy Johnson has alleged.  I think this matter should have grave consideration when the question of University education is under review, as it now is.  In industry we have long felt that the best brains of the country go into the professions.  We want to stop that.  We have reached a period in the history of the country when we want the best brains to go into industry. Universities are taking the best brains in the country from industry.  When parents want to give&mdash;as is the desire of most parents&mdash;their sons and daughters the best send-off they can in life, they send them into our Universities. What is the result?  They get into contact there with what is a professional atmosphere.  The sons of many parents I know have gone into our universities in Dublin with the intention of bringing the results of that education into the business with which many of these families have been connected for generations. Instead of that, the sons get into the professional atmosphere that exists in our universities, and their whole outlook on life is changed.  In the universities industry is not looked upon as what is known as &ldquo;a gentlemanly calling.&rdquo;  The whole trend of the education there, and of the professors, is towards the different professions, with the result that industry suffers.</P>

I do not think we ought to anticipate <Col N="1529" /> what is going to happen within twelve months, and I will not follow Deputy Johnson on the track he tried to lead us on.  I would only say that, if we are going to export, it is better to export the manufactured article than the unmanufactured article.  The point at present is, what is to be done now? I heartily support the Minister in the line he has chosen.  In this matter what we all want to get is full reciprocity.  I suggest that the only way to secure that is to take the line the Minister has indicated. If we once lose what we have we would find it a great deal harder to get it back.</P>

      <P>I find myself in some difficulty about answering Deputy Esmonde.  It seem to me he was, to a certain degree, contradictory in two remarks. He seemed to quarrel with me for asserting that the future would depend on what the Oireachtas would see fit to do within the next 12 months. Later on he asserted that if the Government set out to meddle with this question, which had so largely to do with our status under the Treaty, the Government would be seeking trouble.  It is a small point.  I may put it this way: what we want exactly is to avoid the trouble forecasted by Deputy Esmonde.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there was a possibility, and so there is.  Why he should say that the Government is going to look for something less or going to accept, easily, something less than full reciprocity, I cannot imagine. It is because we want to let the Oireachtas see what is being accepted that I introduced the phrase, that the Oireachtas would have control and be put in possession of all the facts.  He asked further what steps have been taken to <Col N="1530" /> procure a final solution.  There the Deputy is, I am afraid, under a misapprehension again.  This point was only adverted to recently because it had been believed that the Constitution and the Adaptation of Enactments Act had continued the General Medical Council and the General Register in full effect in this country, and it was only when attention was directed to certain Acts passed on the other side that the full position was revealed.  Steps have, however, been taken even in the short interval, and as Deputy Sir James Craig has pointed out, the medical profession&mdash;at least that portion of the medical profession which represents the medical education side&mdash;have presented their point of view, and that point of view is before the Government.  Other points of view and the Government point of view will have to be obtained before a solution can be arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath asked what would be the effect of the Medical Council lapsing, or of this Bill not passing, and he suggested two alternatives, namely, that the doctor qualified here would simply pay a fee and get his qualifications in England, or that he might have to pass an examination.  Deputy Sir James Craig has answered him, going on the analogy of what happens between Great Britain and, say, France, or between Great Britain and one of her Dominions, but there is no security that even these two alternatives would be open here if the Bill were not passed. It does so happen that under the Medical Act the British Medical Council makes up its mind that a certain area is to be a scheduled area, and then certain things happen.  The payment in that case has been the payment of a registration fee.  In the case of a foreign country the practice has been that they would view the applicant for registration, consider him personally, consider his education, consider whether or not he should be asked to pass a new examination, and then finally put him on their register.  These are the likely things, but there is no security that either of these two alternatives would be the position here.  The whole of this question is in the dark if this Bill be not passed now.  The constitution of the General Medical Council <Col N="1531" /> was queried by Deputy McGrath. Deputy Sir James Craig has replied to him.  There is a Privy Council in the General Medical Council, as there is one medical representative selected by the medicals in all Ireland, not of the Twenty-six Counties, and that state of things will continue.  But it has to be remembered that we are only by a positive Act here continuing what we thought was continued by the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  It may be said that there is some derogation of status in accepting that, but the other side of the question should also be considered, that we get representation, the representation which, as Deputy Sir James Craig has pointed out, is out of all proportion to our medicals on the register.  We get representation on the Medical Council, and that Council supervises the medical education not merely of the twenty-six or thirty-two counties, but of England, Scotland and Wales, so that we are getting definitely supervisory power really beyond our proper proportion.  That is really more or less a bargain with regard to this Bill, and it is only being continued for a twelve months period.</P>
    <P>The question that Deputy Johnson raised is, of course, one of the matters that will come for consideration when the final solution is proposed.  I am sure that the Deputy understands that the question of these medicals is largely a matter of individual choice.  It is not a matter of Government choice, but the choice of men who enter the medical profession.  Neither is it the atmosphere of the university.  Men come to Dublin meaning to be medicals.  It is not that they arrive here, and when here acquire that view.  Quite a considerable number of them are the sons of industrialists in this country who apparently much prefer to see them in that profession than in their callings.</P>

After all, Sir, I do not think that this is treating us fairly. We should proceed with the present Bill.  The societies in the county that I come from have urged very strongly <Col N="1533" /> that we should proceed with the present Bill in accordance with the pledges given by the Minister for Justice that he would give a free vote of the Dáil on that much talked of Section 12.  I would move that we go on with that Bill if it is possible in the short time we have.  We are promised a Commission from the Minister for Justice, and I understand that that Commission will set the two Bills aside, that is, if it is worth being called a Commission at all.  That is the purpose for which it will work, and as a result I am sure you will have a third Licensing Bill for this year.  I hope it will be an improvement on the other two, and give both the publicans and the public an opportunity of doing better by giving greater facilities to both of them.</P>

Let us take the case of an Executive Council in its last year of office immediately before a General Election, anxious to win popularity for itself.  It passes a number of measures through the Dáil which it knows that the Seanad will hold up. These measures will be held up by the Seanad for the General Election. That Government is defeated.  What happens then?  Does its successor have to get the Governor-General's assent to these measures which it does not approve of, and then solemnly sit down and spend the whole of its first session repealing them?  The situation is an absolutely ludicrous one and has never been contemplated by the framers of the Constitution.  Apart altogether from the merits of the Bill, I am thinking of the general effects on the State, and the Executive Council must take into consideration the Constitution and see that we are not faced with difficulties like this in the future.</P>

As far as I know, both in the city and the country, the licensed trade do favour the Bill before the House in preference to the Bill that is going to be made law on next Saturday, and I thought up to now some way could be found out of the difficulty that has arisen, as far as the Constitution is concerned, of getting the Governor-General's assent.  I thought it might be postponed, but from what the Minister has said that the Bill must become law, I do not see any way out of the difficulty.  I merely want to make the statement that, as far as the licensed trade is concerned, they favour the Bill before the House in preference to the measure of 1923, and it would satisfy me that the Bill introduced this year, with the exception of Clause 12, should become law.

      <P>When this matter was under discussion last week-end the question had been raised as to the position of civil servants, as to the means of access to the Ministry in matters affecting the service, and as to whether the Ministry were prepared to re-institute the Whitley Council system or something equivalent.  I think in answer to a question yesterday the Minister said that there had been some consultations, and proposals were still being considered as to the method of such consultation and whether there should be any formal means of communication between representatives of the civil servants and the Ministry.  It was pointed out, I think, by Deputy Bryan Cooper that a promise to give an answer within a fortnight was made last March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would press upon the Minister the necessity to make provision, or to make some arrangement, whereby civil servants can make representations through formal channels to the Ministry, and with whom Ministers would consult before they make changes. Everything that has been said in regard to the need for channels of communication and consultation in matters affecting the conditions of service in industry and commercial life can be said in regard to the Civil Service.  I think it can be contended that a very great deal of success, not as much, perhaps, as was hoped by the enthusiasts, but, nevertheless, a great deal of success, has attended the establishment of this Council in the British Civil Service, and even in the Civil Service in Ireland before the Treaty.  No real justification has been adduced, as far as I can gather, for the change.  As a matter of fact promises were made, at the institution of the Provisional Government, that similar facilities would <Col N="1538" /> be continued, but nothing has been done, and there is undoubtedly a very great deal of irritation and a feeling of no confidence in the minds of civil servants in regard to the attitude of the Ministry touching their conditions. I say quite seriously and earnestly to the Ministry that they ought to reestablish, in either the old form or some amended form, the Whitley Council so that there could be a practical means of communication and consultation and conference, before decisions are arrived at, with the representatives of the staff.</P>
    <P>Now in respect to non-established officers&mdash;&ldquo;temporaries,&rdquo; as they are called, some of whom, by the way, have been temporary for many years, a technical expression which takes some time to get accustomed to&mdash;I understand the number of temporaries is about equal to the number of permanents and that some of these temporaries have been temporaries for many years.  But a great many of them have served for 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, and the position of having a very large number of temporary Civil Servants is not satisfactory.  There should be a time beyond which, having proved their ability to do the work, they should enter upon the permanent establishment.  Another consideration which I would press upon the Ministry is that there are examinations for Civil Servants being conducted.  Considerable numbers of youths are entering for these examinations and one is forced to ask whether the fact that these youths are being examined or that ex-army men are being examined for entrance upon the Civil Service, will mean the disbandment or dismissal of the temporary men.  I would say to the Minister that experience of say 3 or 4 years in the work of the Civil Service should count against very high marks in examinations, and that, where men have gone through that period and given anything like satisfaction they should not be lightly dismissed, and that they should not be dismissed to make room for juniors or to make way for boy clerks.  But if it is contended that you must have men who have gone through examinations, that there is something of extraordinary <Col N="1539" /> value in having an examination, as against experience, then I say that the temporary Civil Servants should be encouraged to go in for these examinations, and that a very large proportion of the marks required should be given for service as distinguished from ability to pass examinations.</P>
    <P>I believe, and most people in the world of affairs will confirm that contention, that experience in an office is of very much more value than ability to pass examinations.  If they could pass examinations first, and then add the experience, no doubt, you have a further advantage, but that further advantage ought not to be purchased at the expense of the dismissal of experienced men to make way for youths just now entering upon life.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters in respect to the Civil Service to which I wish to call attention, and I think I had better do it on the general question. It has been represented to me that there are a number, I do not know how great a number, of men who have taken advantage of the Treaty and retired on pensions, who would be willing if they saw that there was an invitation, or that they would be welcomed, to reenter the Service.  I do not know what the attitude of the Ministry would be to such persons, but I think, unless there is a very strong objection, it is a reasonable way to meet the financial situation, to some little extent, and I would invite the Minister to give us his view upon that question.  I want also to deal with a matter which has caused a good deal of trouble, and that is the action of the Income Tax Commissioners, but perhaps I should reserve that for the next Vote.</P>

      <P>I will raise it, then, when the Vote comes on, but I will ask the Minister to tell us now, as near as he can, what decisions have been come to, if any decisions have been come to, and if they are favourable in regard to the civil servants, and if they are not favourable not to state them for fear he might be bound to adhere to them, and to tell us he will reconsider any <Col N="1540" /> unfavourable decisions, and do something, at least, to minimise and reduce considerably the irritation and dissatisfaction that has been aroused throughout the Civil Service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day Deputy Johnson and Deputy Cooper raised a question about the Whitley Council.  With regard to it, its history is something like this: In 1919, following the report of the Whitley Committee recommending the setting up in industries of bodies representative of employers and employees for the purpose of settlement of trade disputes, the British Government introduced for the Civil Service a machine similar in principle to the Whitley Industrial Committees. A body known as the National Whitley Council was set up, consisting of an equal number of representatives appointed by the staff and by the Government.  It had very wide powers and functions, including the power of determination of general matters including remuneration, conditions of service, etc.  The National Whitley Council could only arrive at a decision by unanimous agreement between the two sides, official and staff, and when it did arrive at an agreement the Government undertook that the agreement would become operative automatically. The Council, in one case, arrived by agreement on a scheme of reorganisation for the Civil Service as a whole, introducing improved scales of salaries and a new scheme for calculating bonus on Civil Service salaries, etc.  In addition to the National Whitley Council representative of the whole service and dealing with general service matters, the Whitley machine included Departmental Councils consisting of an equal number of representatives appointed by the head of the Department and by the staff serving in the Department whose functions related to purely Departmental matters, such as the remuneration of Departmental classes, and here again the decision could only be by agreement.  When a decision by agreement was arrived at. it became operative immediately.  This Council and the Departmental Councils are without prejudice to the authority of Parliament.  At the time of the setting <Col N="1541" /> up of the National Whitley Council the Irish Civil Service pressed for a National Council for Ireland, independent of the National Whitley Council in London.  This request was refused, but there was set up in Dublin an Irish Civil Service Joint Council which had no functions of decision, but which was empowered to advise the National Whitley Council in London on purely Irish matters, or particular Irish aspects of general service questions.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the change of Government a staff deputation saw the late General Collins and myself and pressed for the creation, in the Free State, of a National Whitley Council and Departmental Councils similar to those in being under the British administration. The late General Collins decided at that early date that he could not commit the Government to that particular proposal, but he agreed that so far as the Departments in Dublin had Departmental Councils already they could continue pending the decision of the Government, but the question whether the Free State would have any such bodies and with such powers as were given in the British Civil Service was reserved.  This continuous pressure has been kept up, and some months ago, it appears, the Minister for Finance received a deputation from the Civil Servants forwarding their representations. The Minister indicated his views to the deputation that he did not consider it was either desirable or necessary to have in the Free State Civil Service bodies such as the Whitley bodies.  Reference was made to the machine used in the police forces, namely, the Police Representative Council, which provides the police with a definite mouthpiece for putting forward their views on questions affecting conditions of service, and also for giving the police an opportunity of expressing their views on any proposal of the Government which may affect their conditions of service.  The Minister indicated that he was most anxious that there should be created for the Civil Service some such body which could bring before the Minister for Finance, and in that way before the Executive Council any representations the staff desired to make affecting their conditions of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1542" /> The Minister asked the deputation to consider, and put forward proposals on these lines.  On the 6th January, the representatives of the Civil Service replied putting forward again the British Whitley machinery as the only suitable machinery.  The Minister received a further deputation on the 29th February, and indicated again his view that he did not consider the Whitley machinery desirable or suitable for the Saorstát Civil Service.  He promised to prepare a draft of the arrangements which he considered suitable, and to meet the representatives again to discuss the draft.  The draft arrangements for the future have been prepared but before communicating them to the staff it is understood that the Minister wished to mention the matter to the Executive Council.  The staff have been pressing continuously since March for that draft.  The substance of the point at issue between the staff and the Ministry is that the staff want bodies to be created which will have power of determining various things including remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>If there be agreement in that case the Executive Council and the Dáil would be in the hands of these people, as the agreement determines itself.  It has to be put into operation without delay.  Now the Ministry are not prepared to give any bodies, other than bodies of a consultative and advisory character, the power of decision being in all cases reserved to the Minister.  It is true that the Whitley bodies can only arrive at decisions by agreement, and the official representatives on the bodies can always prevent a decision by refusing to agree.  But it is not right that Ministers should divest themselves of their powers and responsibilities by leaving it to such bodies to say what salaries will be payable in the Civil Service or not.  What the staff should have, and what the Ministry is prepared to give, is every facility for making known its views on matters affecting the Civil Service, and for considering Governmental <Col N="1543" /> proposals affecting the Civil Service, and giving their views on such proposals before the Government finally confirms a proposal into a decision. It has not been possible for the Executive Council to consider the matter so far.  It will be admitted, I think, that the work of the last three or four months has prevented that, and the Minister's health in addition must also be taken into consideration.  I am informed that the Minister, just before his illness, was on the point of bringing this matter before the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would seriously suggest to the President that he should deal with this matter himself.  I do not think there is anything in the suggestion that the Minister has put forward, that the staffs should determine the rates of pay.  I do not think that is the proposal, nor do I think it is the business or the function of a Whitley Council to do that.  I think there is misunderstanding on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that is the case, but so I am informed.  I do not think it would be possible for me, certainly within the next month or two, personally to take up this matter.  I would prefer that the Minister himself would take it up on his return.  I should think that he will be returning to duty somewhere about the end of August, and in view of the fact that he has had so many conferences and consultations with deputations on the matter, I think he should deal with it himself.  I should say that even a month's delay in the case might be worth while waiting for. With regard to the second question raised by Deputy Johnson, the details are given in the Vote for the Ministry of Finance.  The third sub-head deals with salaries, wages and allowances, and it will be observed from that that the temporary clerical staff absorbs a very considerable amount, almost £9,000.  They are mainly engaged on compensation work, and the value of that work I freely admit is very great and very important.  I should say that there is not a very considerable number of youths entering the Civil Service. The bulk of the men who entered lately have been Army men, and no examination <Col N="1544" /> for boy clerks has been held, nor, I understand, is it even contemplated to hold one.  As far as I know, there is no intention of dismissing temporary civil servants.  There is, I believe, under consideration at the moment an examination confined partly to temporary civil servants.  Such examinations have been held for women who were temporary clerks.  I do not exactly subscribe to what Deputy Johnson said, that a number of years' experience in an office should qualify for a large number of marks.  I admit that experience in an office is of great advantage, but I think that great care should be exercised in not allotting too large a number of marks for such service. I speak in that connection from experience in another institution with which I was associated for a number of years, where the best results were got from examinations.  There is not, to my knowledge, any desire to deal harshly with temporary civil servants, but there is a desire, if they pass an examination, to place them on the permanent staff.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my request to that of Deputy Johnson that some inquiry be made of the President as to the scope and functions of a Whitely Council in regard to financial matters.  I have had a matter that has been under the attention of the President and the Minister for Finance brought before me, and as I understand the case, I thought there would be no room for misunderstanding. All that was asked for was a consultative council.  I will give the case which was represented to me.  It was a question of hours, and my informant on that matter stated that if a consultation had been taken with the Service in regard to recent changes of hours while giving the same number of hours in the week with a different adjustment of them, the result would have been just as satisfactory from the point of view of economy and of much greater content among the personnel of the Service, with the consequent result of higher efficiency in the quality of the work produced.  It is quite clear that any officer responsible directly to the Minister in a matter of this kind sitting down and working out a schedule, may work out a schedule <Col N="1545" /> that may be quite excellent and admirable from his own point of view, but which might not be anything like that which he himself would recommend to the Minister or which the Minister might be inclined to enforce if once the entire Service was engaged in consultation with regard to the advisability of two or three different forms of schedule.  That is only one case. There are infinitely more complex cases arising in the Service where a certain amount of friction unquestionably exists which may be removed if there were somebody directly responsible and elected by the Service with whom the Minister, as the final person responsible to the Dáil for this Service, could get into consultation, and devise the least frictionable and least objectionable form of administration that could be devised.  These things experience has taught, not only in the Service, as every employer also knows that these things could not be obtained except as the result of consultation. I fail to understand the President's reference to a decision by a Council of this kind respecting wages and salaries and any matters of financial adjustment. Obviously they lie at the disposal of the Minister responsible to this House and cannot be parted with. I venture to say, with Deputy Johnson, that something has gone wrong with the sources of information.  As I understand the matter, and I have gone into it with a certain amount of care with those entitled to speak for the Service, that is not their demand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's plan, according to the statement made by the President, was that a council should be set up and it should be authorised to make representation.  I want the President to think of the situation that is created if the purpose of such council is confined to making representations of that kind.  The staff does not make any representations in regard to the beginning or end of its day, or the extension of the day, but the Minister comes forward with a decree and says that after a certain date these shall be the hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection the particular body he wished to set up is a body to which he would <Col N="1546" /> refer any such proposal as that, and can be in consultation with them before finally deciding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to make; that if there were such a body, there would be complete understanding before changes are made.  I understand with a fair amount of authority that if there had been a conference when such a suggestion was made, there might have been a more generous offer from the staff than an extra half-hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be evident to anybody who heard the President's statement and who read the letters written to Deputies on behalf of the civil servants that there seems to be a gigantic misunderstanding that ought to be cleared up, but it can only be cleared up by establishing machinery that will enable the civil servants' organisation to come into direct touch with the Minister for Finance.  I believe that the Minister wants to be absolutely fair.  I am sure that if he could get into touch with civil servants and know what they mean, he will do his best for them.  I am not satisfied with the President's suggestion of a council such as exists in the Police Force.  I do not think it would meet the case.  Such council worked fairly well in the Police Force, but that is largely because the terms of enlistment are generous and because on the part of the departments concerned there is a desire to make them work well.  Such councils were set up by the British Government after the war as to rates and conditions that should be recommended, but their failing was due to the fact that the Admiralty took no notice of them.  It entirely depends on the spirit of those at the head of affairs whether such bodies which have no statutory rights are of very much value.  I hope that the President, even before the Minister for Finance returns, will go into this question again and realise that the men in the civil service are men who for the most part transferred their service to Ireland because they loved their country and wished to serve it rather than claim their rights under the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an obligation on the State to deal with them in a manner so that their discontents will be removed.  As <Col N="1547" /> regards temporary Civil Servants, many of them are being discharged, but I think it would be better to discuss their position under the respective Votes under which they come rather than under this Vote.  When it comes to turning them out it should be remembered that many of them are men with families who have been in the employment of the State for three or four years, and to whom the State has some duty and they should not be turned out to be replaced by boys of seventeen or eighteen years of age who are put on the permanent staff because they have passed an examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a number of public servants who were suspended from duty because of their alleged activities in connection with the trouble that arose two years ago in the country.  Many of those men were suspended from duty.  Some of them were arrested and interned and were released after shorter or longer periods of internment without any charge whatsoever being brought against them. They have not been restored to their positions and they have not been paid any salary, and many of them have been for a considerable time now awaiting some decision as to what their future is to be.  It is only seven months since a committee was set up to investigate the cases of these public servants. I think that there is every reason to complain that there has been very great delay in coming to a decision on those cases.  The procedure adopted, I am afraid, is exceedingly cumbersome and in any case, for some reason or another, there has been great delay.  I may say some of them are not only Civil Servants but teachers also.  Some of them went back to work immediately after being released from internment and are working in the schools in the ordinary <Col N="1548" /> way for the last fourteen or fifteen months.  They received no payment of any kind because of an order issued by the Minister for Finance.  I think it is most unfair that this investigation should be dragged out the length it has been dragged out, and that these people should be so long without knowing what their position is to be.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that practically all of them are people who were arrested and interned merely on suspicion and against whom no charge can properly be sustained.  I would suggest to the Minister that it would be a wise policy on the part of the Government if they simply reinstated all those men who were prepared to give faithful work to the State.  It is time, I think, when things which happened two years ago might very well be forgotten, or overlooked to a great extent, and I think if the Government were satisfied that those people were prepared to discharge their duties faithfully to the State, and I believe that would be the case so far as the vast majority of those are concerned, they should have no difficulty whatsoever in reinstating them in their positions. I believe it would be to the advantage of the Government themselves and the country if they would not leave those people with grievances or cause of grievance.  Undoubtedly several of them were arrested purely on suspicion.  Some of them, perhaps, may have taken part indirectly in the trouble at the time but I think it is not a wise policy on the part of the Government to be too punctilious investigating to the last possibility any part which was taken then.  They should be satisfied now, in view of the changing circumstances in the country, if those people are prepared to give faithful service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit there has been a delay but it could scarcely be avoided.  In addition to the illness of one or two of the members forming this particular Committee there has been another delay within the last week or a fortnight which could not have been possibly foreseen.  With regard to what the Deputy said about giving a clean sheet to those people and about <Col N="1549" /> no charge having been made against them, I may say it has not been for the want of charges that could have been made.  The Deputies here will recollect that the fact of having such a large number of prisoners as 10,000 shows that there was, <i>prima facie</i>, a big case against somebody.  It has not been made, I admit, but that there is grave culpability I think no one will deny.  This Committee formed to deal with them was perhaps the easiest Committee it was possible to get through. It was composed of very generously-minded men and I think they would be prepared, if they were satisfied that what Deputy O'Connell says is correct, to stretch a point and they would recommend that faults should be overlooked.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure that what he says about changed conditions in the State would justify us to that extent.  I have had reports of persons drawing money from this State&mdash;money that we have to make economies for in order to make available.  I know there are such people in the country doing their very best to undermine the foundations of the State.  While we are at all times prepared to give generous consideration to persons who have given offence, it is not a matter of free will how you are to exercise your generosity in those cases.  Deputies know that evidence in favour of those who support the State is always available.  Many persons have been prosecuted, and are serving terms of imprisonment.  You must weigh up the sufferings of those people in those cases with the blank cheque you are to give, in the first place for not prosecuting such persons, and secondly for giving them positions which will be paid for out of public funds.  While admitting that a generous act is a great thing, we must at the same time consider justice in the matter.  I will, before the Appropriation Bill is got through, let the Deputy know how this case stands.</P>

There is no explanation given of that item, but I find in the Vote which we discussed yesterday (Executive Council) provision for Messengers, Cleaners and Protective force at £800.  There is a footnote to that Estimate stating &ldquo;The figure given represents the share to be borne on this Vote for the salaries, wages, etc., of the entire Staff of Messengers, Cleaners and Protective Force employed in the Government Buildings in Upper Merrion Street.&rdquo;  It seems to me rather confusing that each Department should have a special Protective Force Vote.  I do not know exactly what that Force is, or whether it is a unified Force, but I think it ought to be under one Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why there are separate items is a simple one.  The various offices are situated in buildings known as Government Buildings.  I take it that the number of rooms has been counted, and that <Col N="1551" /> the cost of messengers, cleaners, and the body in question&mdash;the Protective Force&mdash;is apportioned according to the accommodation provided.  The Executive Council, with my offices, occupy the greater part of one wing, and to that extent the accommodation there may exceed that occupied by the Ministry of Finance, so that the proportion borne on the Executive Council Vote would be larger than that on the Ministry of Finance.</P>

      <P>I do not know exactly what the accommodation of the Ministry of Finance is at the moment. At one time it occupied one floor, and it may have got portion of another floor since.  The Executive Council offices were at that time upstairs, and I think up to last year the Ministry of Finance occupied the rooms I have.  As regards the Protective Force, that is a body which was brought into existence during the war period, and they act as directors of persons who want to get to particular offices.  They identify persons coming in, and are of general use around the building.  On a couple of occasions we had information that an attempt would be made to rush the building.  These people have particular knowledge of the class of persons who might indulge in an experiment of that kind, and as identity is one of the most important matters in military operations, the Deputy will admit that this particular force is about the most suitable one we could have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act as it was last year, against wise advice from these Benches and, I think, from the representatives of the commercial interests, the Dáil took the advice of the Government, and gave power to the Revenue Commissioners to serve orders upon employers of labour to deduct arrears of income tax from wages or salaries.  There have been a number of orders served upon business houses in the city in respect of arrears of income tax, some of which arrears have accrued since the date of the Treaty, and some of which were pre-Treaty impositions. Now, quite frequently during the course of the discussions, the President, who was then Minister for Finance, gave assurances that where there was any willingness at all shown to pay these arrears, it was not intended to be vindictive, or to be over-stressful or impose too serious an obligation. The idea, in fact, was to allow willing persons to pay on easy terms.  But we have had complaints within the last two or three months of orders which meant the deduction of 25 per cent. of the weekly income, and even more than that, thirty-three and one-third per cent. of the weekly income from assistants in business establishments in the city for arrears of income tax.  That is taken from their salaries or wages, and, of course, is putting both employers and workmen and workwomen into a very uncomfortable position and imposing a great strain upon both sides of that undertaking. I have a case which has been brought to the notice of the Minister, and through him, to the Revenue Commissioners, of a woman who is earning <Col N="1556" /> £4 2s. per week and who is alleged to owe £34 odd, for income tax accruing since 1921.  She gave an assurance that she was agreeable to pay when she found that the obligation was upon her.  Like many another she did not believe that she was entitled to pay income tax.  She was like many others, including, I am sure, many well-known members of the Dáil who sought to evade paying income tax&mdash;perhaps successfully.  However, in this case there is no question of any conspiracy or determination to refuse to pay.  She is typical of many.  She is willing to pay, but she wants to be allowed to pay in a manner which will not impose too heavy a burden upon her.  But the Commissioners are adamant.  She is in receipt of £4 2s. per week, and they say she must pay £1 per week.  The employer must deduct £1 per week from her wages.  I do say that in the circumstances in which she is living the balance left her brings not only herself into difficulties, but brings her relatives also into difficulties.  I have another case where a married man earning £6 a week was called on to pay arrears, and his employers were instructed to deduct £3 per week out of the £6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employers intervened and the amount of the deduction was reduced to £2 per week&mdash;£2 out of £6.  That again I say is an imposition.  Where a man is willing to pay and is willing to pay a reasonable sum weekly he ought not to be asked to pay so large an amount as one-third of his salary. In one case when an employer intervened and interviewed the Commissioners and protested against being called upon to make these deductions he was told&mdash;so I am informed&mdash;that the Commissioners thought £3 a week was ample for a man to live upon, and that they were making no order that would bring the earnings below that amount.  But remember shortly afterwards another case came before my informant showing that there had been enforcement of an order which brought down the earnings to £2 16s. a week and even below that.  Another person was informed that the Commissioners thought that £2 a week was sufficient for a single young man to <Col N="1557" /> live upon and that if they did not reduce his earnings below that by deductions, well, he had nothing to complain of.  That is more or less the line that is taken.  In every case that I have been informed about the debtors have offered to pay direct, and have stated that they would very much prefer to pay direct.  They object very strenuously to having these deductions made by their employers.</P>
    <P>I say that it is not an obligation upon the Commissioners to use that method of collecting these debts, and they ought, where possible, to make the collection directly and not through the employers.  But if they must use the employers as their debt collectors they ought, at least, be as lenient as a County Court Judge or a magistrate would be to a person who is owing money to a money lender or usurer.  They ought not make it hard for the debtor to live upon the remainder of his earnings.  I say that this method of collection in the case of married men and in the case of women where you are reducing their spending capacity and reducing the amount that is available to carry on the households, and to maintain themselves in the way in which they have been maintained, is doing an injury to the people concerned and also to the administration.  You may be getting a larger sum in, week by week, but you are not making it easier for the future, and you are not adding to the annual income by that means at all.</P>
    <P>And I would strongly press upon the Minister who is responsible for the activities of the Revenue Department, notwithstanding the fact that the Commissioners have certain judicial powers, that this kind of pressure ought not to continue, that there ought to be much more discrimination and much easier terms offered to the people who are willing to pay their arrears, than are being allowed to them at the present time.  I can quite understand the line that Ministers may take on the advice of the Commissioners.  They will talk about conspiracy to defraud, and they will talk about a determination not to pay if people can avoid it, and so on, and so on.  But the cases that I am referring to are cases where the people <Col N="1558" /> had declared their willingness to pay, and where, in spite of that declaration, the Commissioners are using the very harsh methods of collecting their debts.  If the Ministry are anxious for an agitation on this question they will continue to be as harsh as they are; and an agitation on this question may not add to the case with which income tax debts will be recovered. I am certain that proper consideration has not been given to this matter, at least not the consideration that would be required from anybody but a debt collector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>My first comment on this matter really will be that, when we come to discuss the Estimates, I think it is necessary, in discussing them fully, that what I might call a certain amount of ragging should take place between the Ministry and the members of the Dáil.  In that respect I would rather protest against the burden being placed on the President.  Personally I feel a disinclination to rag the President, if I may put it in that way; and secondly, I do not think it is suitable for the Dáil or the President to be placed in that position.  I should have no hesitation in going for the Minister of Industry and Commerce, but the President, as occupying the place of the Minister for Finance, is in quite a different position. As regards this question that Deputy Johnson has raised in reference to the collection of income tax, we on these benches are free to criticise very fully the development that has taken place, because at the time when the matter was being discussed we protested against the employers being put in the position of collecting the income tax from their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very false position to be placed in.  In these cases it very very often happens, and indeed it generally happens that there is a dispute whether the amount is due or not.  And to make the employers arbitrators compulsorily in these matters, so that they must deduct from the pay of the employee, whether he is right or whether he is wrong, in any contention he may put forward, is not, as we pointed out it would not be, acting in a manner calculated to carry on the operations of trade in a harmonious way.  I think the sum of money most difficult <Col N="1559" /> to get out of any man is a sum of money which he thought he had successfully evaded paying.  And in these cases of accumulated income tax, surely it is the income tax authorities themselves who are to blame in having allowed an accumulation such as must have taken place in the case that Deputy Johnson referred to where a woman had to pay £1 a week to pay off an accumulation of £34.  And to saddle the employer with the effects of their own mal-administration, or the weaknesses of their system in a case of that sort, seems to me to be a very grave hardship.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far those applications extend and I do not like to refer in a personal way in this Dáil to anything that comes under my notice. However, within the last couple of days a matter did come under my notice and I only mention it as an illustration. It is not in the nature of the case about which Deputy Johnson tells us.  It is the case of an employee in connection with the business with which I am identified. He is in receipt of a very big salary, a fair salary.  He evidently had paid his income tax.  But the firm get a demand from the income tax authorities to deduct&mdash;what?  To deduct a sum of 6s. And, as I understand, this 6s. is a matter in dispute between the person assessed and the Inland Revenue Commissioners. At any rate, the right to demand the money is there.  Deputy Johnson brought forward some large things.  I bring forward this which is a petty thing.  Six shillings is nothing to this man to whom I refer, but he is disputing that it is due by him.  And why should the employers in that case be brought into the matter at all?  The principle of the whole thing is wrong. It is not now as it was a year ago when the Government found it necessary to invoke extraneous aids for the carrying out of collections.  That situation has passed I hope.  Under these circumstances the continuation of any such measures as these is not in the interests of harmony; and I do not think this is a proper and a right method for the authorities to use in connection with taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, I hope, going to rag the President, but I am concerned with a certain constitutional principle, and that is that the Estimates should be fully and fairly discussed. We were told in the Governor-General's speech that the Estimates would be laid before us, and would require our careful consideration.  I do not know if it is claimed that they have got it.  One of the main duties we were sent here to perform was to criticise the Estimates, and I am going to do it.  With regard to this point of the employer being liable for the employee, it is a point I was directly interested in for a long time, because I hold that it is not the place of the employer to interpret the relations between the employee and somebody else, and that the employer should be compelled to collect money due by his employees.  When the Insurance Act was introduced I asked my servants if they wished me to stop money from their wages to pay for the stamps.  They said no, that they got all the advantages of the insurance, pay during illness and such matters, and so I refused to do it.  I was prosecuted, and I was finally fined 6d., and as I got a testimonial from the Bench saying that I was a model employer, I thought it was cheap at the price.  I hope Deputy Hewat will assert the principle in the same way, and refuse to deduct the 6s., be prosecuted, be fined 6d., or possibly more, or go to jail.  That is the only way you can fight these things, these encroachments on what ought to be a private sphere.  I was rather surprised to find that Deputy Johnson rather deprecates State interference between employers and employees.</P>

      <P>I can very well understand <Col N="1561" /> the complaint of Deputy Hewat, but really I am nonplussed at the attitude of Deputy Johnson.  He has in this Dáil advocated the development of a civic idea amongst the people on all occasions, and if there is anything which would tend to the development of the civic idea it is the fact that a man has to put his hand down in his pocket and contribute towards the expenses of the State.  That is one of the best means of education.  When we on those benches resisted the imposition of the 5/- income tax, and when our friends on the Labour benches said: &ldquo;We do not mind how high the income tax is,&rdquo; then how can we have sympathy for the grievance, which really is no grievance, when a man is only asked to pay an imposition which we collectively placed on him?  There is nothing which will tend more towards the development of the civic sense than compelling each man to contribute his proper share towards the expense of the State, and if by means of this machinery which I voted for, and stand by now, the Revenue Commissioners can collect the money due by the workers I wish them success.</P>

      <P>With regard to this question of the inculcation and promotion of the civic spirit to which Deputy Wilson refers, I would like to make an addition, quite briefly, to the particular case mentioned by Deputy Hewat.  I am not mentioning that case, but a case of the same kind brought to my notice two or three weeks ago.  It was the case of a man who was in receipt of a good salary, and a dispute had arisen between this man and the Revenue Commissioners.  I saw the whole correspondence, and I think the matter was really one for the courts, and I think it is quite likely that in the courts the man would be able to justify his case that the small amount in dispute was not owing by him.  But what happened?  He invited the Revenue Commissioners to take the matter into the courts.  He said that there was a question of principle at stake, and if he was wrong he would like the general principle asserted, and he would pay, and then the matter would be decided.  Nothing of the kind was done.  What happened was that <Col N="1562" /> the Revenue Commissioners decided to jump their claim by calling on his employers to pay and deduct it from him; in other words, they took the matter out of the courts leaving on him the onus of proof, and left him over a matter of a few shillings to take the matter into the courts and disputing their action. It was quite a <i>bona fide</i> case. The interpretation I have placed on this particular matter so far as the law is concerned is one interpretation, and the Revenue Commissioners on the other hand have placed another interpretation. Both interpretations cannot be true, and I contend that when a dispute arises between a citizen and a servant of the State as to the interpretation of one of the laws of the realm that the proper place to have that dispute decided is in the law courts, and not that one of the two parties should jump the claim in a small matter, and get the employers to pay and deduct it from his next month's cheque.  That is not fair, it is not candid, and it is not showing that proper respect for the decision of the courts that one would expect from the officers of the State.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of this matter which I think would require attention.  There seems to be a considerable amount of confusion between the local tax collectors and the arrangements they make and the Revenue Commissioners at headquarters in Dublin.  An instance has been brought to my notice in which a person who had certain arrears to pay made arrangements for the payment with the local tax collector, by certain monthly instalments.  One or two instalments were paid, and he was willing to continue payment of the others, when suddenly he found his employer had got orders to have the balance of the debt collected, and it was so collected.  The local tax collector said that he knew nothing about that arrangement.  There seems to be a want of co-operation between the local and the headquarters staffs in these matters, and it causes a good deal of confusion and irritation.  I am sorry Deputy Wilson is not here.  He misunderstood completely the position that we take in this matter, and that Deputy <Col N="1563" /> Johnson took up.  Deputy Johnson certainly did not advocate the non-payment of income tax.  If there was any quarter of the Dáil from which we might expect sympathy in the matter of arrears, I thought it would be from the Farmers' representatives, who spent a considerable time last year talking of the consideration which people who owed arrears ought to get.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that question right off.  It is more than probable that one of the Commissioners is on loan.  I do not know if he is going back.  I cannot say whether there are any others in the same position. I do know that it is my desire that he should remain.  As to the general question, we gave the undertaking that Deputy Johnson has mentioned that no undue hardship would be inflicted in the collection of arrears of income tax, either from employees or employers.  It would be better if cases like the one he has mentioned had been brought to the Minister's attention. To make an announcement in the Dáil that we are going to give every facility to persons who owe income tax would not have put us in the position that we are in at present, of having made a very considerable collection of income tax last year.  I am rather puzzled about the case the Deputy mentioned. I think he said the person had £4 2s. a week and that the arrears amounted to £34.  In that case there must have been over five years' income tax due.  Certainly over four years'. That would mean that since the Saorstát was established, no income tax has been paid by that person.  That is a <Col N="1564" /> different matter to owing arrears.  It is unreasonable that people at any rate should not have paid since the Saorstát was established, even if they were to ask for some accommodation in connection with the payment of arrears.  £34 arrears on a salary of £205 would work out at £6 5s. per year income tax.</P>

      <P>It must be remembered that wages and earnings vary, particularly in that case.  That is her present salary.  I do not know what salary her income tax was assessed upon.  It may be more, or it may be less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, if it were twice that, for a couple of years I am afraid it means that we got very little income tax from that person since the Saorstát was set up.  While admitting that we should give as much facility as is possible, it certainly would be most unwise that I should make a statement here that both employees and employers were to have arrears of income tax spread out over a long period.  We certainly would never get in the arrears if that statement were made.</P>
      <P>I have approached the Revenue Commissioners in a few cases.  In some of these cases the facts reported to me by them present a very different complexion to the facts presented by the individuals against whom the claims were made.  I do know of one outrage which they committed.  A gentleman who held a very important position in the State and who is now, I think, on our pension list, was leaving the country with a debt behind him to the Commissioners of something like £150. They collected it most unceremoniously as he was getting on to the boat.  He had to give a cheque for the amount, which was guaranteed by the bank. He was allowed to proceed after that and caught his boat.  I am sure we will be denounced in some foreign country for the outrage committed upon him. There are other cases like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that the Revenue Commissioners got in between £1,000,000 and £2,000,000 in arrears last year. There is no more unpopular person in the State than the income tax collector. I know a man whose pacifist proclivities are not less than Deputy Johnson's. <Col N="1565" /> When the income tax collector came to him, this pacifist looked at the window and asked: &ldquo;Did anybody see you coming up?&rdquo;  He was a very big man, and, naturally, the unfortunate collector beat a hasty retreat.  I do not know whether he has collected his income tax yet or not.  That is the reception that the income tax collector gets as a rule.  We have not accommodated ourselves to bearing income tax with the cold calmness of people who have had a Government that they liked in power.  I would much prefer, when cases of hardship are brought to the notice of Deputies, that they would communicate with the Minister or with me.  I would undertake to have an examination of such cases.  I got an undertaking from the Commissioners, before I put the new section in last year's Finance Act, that there would be no unreasonable demands made upon either employers or employees who owed arrears.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners are to be the judges.  In my experience they have not been unreasonable in any case I brought before them. I might probably exclude one, but in most of the cases I have brought under their notice they have been reasonable. Deputy Hewat made a good point when he said that this is legislation that should be reserved for particular periods.  I think that the period when income tax will be popular in this country has not yet been reached.  There are people&mdash;there are our own supporters&mdash;officers of the Army, employees of Dáil Eireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not come across any cases of judges.  These people, above all others in the State, think they ought to be excluded from paying their share of income tax, and have repeatedly remonstrated with me. They stated that they got their salaries from the former Dáil free of income tax, and that they should now be free from it.  I think I have put the Dáil in possession of information to show <Col N="1566" /> that I could not say we are going to spread out these arrears over a long period.  If I did that, the work of the income tax collectors would be made impossible.  But if there are cases reported to them which Deputies think are unjust and unfair, and in which some more accommodation should be afforded by the Commissioners, I will undertake to bring these cases before the Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that case involves a question of law.  I should not be asked to give a decision on it.  If the Deputy gives me particulars I will see whether it is open to the Commissioners to do that or not.  Although the case mentioned by Deputy Hewat is a hardship, I am not so sure that I could say the Revenue Commissioners could do anything else.  The 6s. was either a balance or an amount in dispute.  If it was not in dispute I do not know whether the Revenue Commissioners would be entitled to take it to court instead of going to the employer. In connection with the assessment of income tax I think there is a period when it is open to an individual to appeal to other Commissioners rather than to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I would like to call attention to one or two matters that come under this Vote.  It is questionable if a very considerable amount of dutiable commodities have not been dumped on our shores for the past six or eight months.  One hears whisperings in the country that brandies, tobaccos, and other dutiable goods are being dumped.  I cannot say for certain if that is so.  Perhaps the Minister has reports from the Revenue inspectors. <Col N="1567" /> I do not think our coast is being protected.  It cannot be asserted that one vessel is able to protect the whole coast line.  All the other boats are laid up at Haulbowline for a considerable period.  There is a general feeling that at an early date the Government should procure a number of boats in order to protect the coast line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGARRY</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to point out that a serious loss to the revenue arises from the fact that the putting of a twopenny stamp on receipts has become more or less obsolete.  I was shown three receipts this morning for amounts over £2 on which there were no stamps.  The habit is probably due to the fact that people were not encouraged to stamp receipts for some years.  It is a matter, however, that the Revenue authorities should take into consideration.  Those who issue receipts should be told that it is an offence if a twopenny stamp is not placed on them.  The person who showed me the receipts did not know it was an offence to take them for amounts over £2 without a stamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that Deputy Hennessy raised this matter in connection with item (k), for which the contribution is £1,200 against £2,000 last year, showing a reduction of £800.  On a former occasion I think Deputy McGoldrick advocated very strongly a reduction of the duties on wines and spirits.  His principal argument, I think, was that the enormous duties payable on these commodities were an incentive to poteen-making, <Col N="1568" /> and generally to the use of injurious fluids.  Looking at the matter in its broad aspect, it would seem to me that the present duties are a very grave risk to the country generally.  With our coast-line as it is, does any Deputy think that the ingenuity of the people will not be exercised in connection with the very profitable occupation of bringing in goods without paying duty on them?  Anyone who would say that the coast-line can be guarded against such tactics by one obsolete vessel, would be very innocent of the possibilities of human nature.  We have not been looking after our own affairs very long, but it seems to me that if the present system is to continue, of having very high duties payable on such goods, you are faced with a very considerable increase in expenditure under this head.  The coast line is practically unguarded, and if any man says to me that, in parts of the country the running of spirits and wines cannot be carried on with impunity, he is asking me to believe something that my own experience would not endorse.</P>

      <P>If I did know I am not such a fool as to tell my friend, Deputy Alton.  I do think seriously that one of two things will happen.  The Government will either have to face a very considerable reduction in these taxes&mdash;I do not know how they are going to do it&mdash;or if they are going to collect these taxes in perpetuity the sooner they get ready to guard the coast line against people who use it to make money on such cargoes the better.  Deputy Hennessy says he does not know if this trade is being carried on, as he only heard whisperings. I am sure the longer the present situation continues the more whisperings there will be, and the less the revenue will receive from wines and spirits and other dutiable articles.</P>

      <P>I suggested a reduction <Col N="1569" /> on wines and spirits.  I think the boats referred to here are those that run out the Customs officers from Dublin.  Take the coast, and there is no difficulty in running brandy or wine or spirits all along the coast line of the Free State.  I could do it myself if I had the money, and I would rather like the job, but it will not be remedied by putting into commission half a dozen vessels to watch the coast line.  The excitement and pleasure would be only added to by putting on half a dozen trawlers, and they are nothing but trawlers.  You could run spirits in a thousand places along the coast and get rid of them, even if half a dozen ships were on the seas.  If you want to protect the coast properly and if you want to prevent the smuggling which Deputy Hennessy alleges goes on&mdash; there is none of it on the West coast because there were one or two men put on their honour that they would not allow any smuggling&mdash;you must institute coastguards who will properly protect the coast and prevent any smuggling. That is the only way it can be done.  Even at any of the ports in the Saorstát at present where there are Customs officers you could run any of these dutiable goods, because the ship is never boarded until it comes alongside the quay.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with one matter on this Vote and it is more in the interests of the parties who do not reside in our area but who are living in the Six Counties.  I have been approached on this question by some of these people and they are not unworthy of being represented here.  They have interests here in the Free State and the question of income tax on dividends that are coming to them from establishments in this area is a source of irritation. Income tax is deducted from these dividends when they are issued here and when they reach them and they go to lodge the dividends income tax at the rate of 4/6 in the £ is deducted again in the Northern area, so that they have a very small return from their investments when these two amounts are taken off.  When they try to get some refund they find it a matter of considerable difficulty.  Two cases have come under my notice recently in connection with the Great Northern <Col N="1570" /> Railway investment.  I understand that recently the Commissioners have an apportionment made as to how much of the profits of the Great Northern Railway are earned on our side and on the northern side respectively.  I understand that the figures are 1/3½ and 3/8½ and they are able to make a refund on that basis.  There is some difficulty with the Revenue Commissioners in getting this done and in getting their money refunds the people are often in difficulties.  Some of them are parties who cannot afford very well to face these difficulties.  They are perhaps widowed women or orphan children who are depending on these dividends and they are in a position, pending refunds, of great hardship.  I would wish the President to impress on the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the forwarding of refunds to these orphans and other parties and to see that these people are not forced to the only alternative, that is, to realise investments in the Free State.  They could not continue any such investment in the Saorstát because they could not afford to have all this trouble.  They would have to realise these investments here and that would mean that a large number of such investments would have to be realised, thus causing a big depreciation in the stock and consequently it would be detrimental to our establishments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question Deputy Hennessy raised, it is too much to take the coast on credit; we are not taking the Land Border on credit.  We have that fairly well staffed, but there is undoubtedly a deal of stuff filtering through to our disadvantage, and a great deal of revenue lost notwithstanding all the energy that the staff can concentrate on the work and the great expense we are at in maintaining this staff.  If that is necessary on the land side, I think it will surely be equally necessary on the shore side, but the suggestion of Deputy Hewat would, to a large extent, do away with the necessity of having supervision on these coast lines by the duties being the same.  Then there could not be any such inducements, and when they could not get any advantage in this way we would have solved the difficulty and would have little need of supervision on the <Col N="1571" /> coast line, land or sea.  That would be the right way, and the only way, they could safely guard themselves and so save as much on one side as they would lose on the other.  That would imply equal duties.  Our duties are excessive on liquors and sugar.  Not only does this cause us trouble in this way, but it causes a great many of the difficulties that we have in the labour world and in other directions.  I think it is one of the things the Ministry ought to keep before them.  It is not exactly what would be advocated by the Temperance Party, but you cannot suit everybody.  We do not stand for any policy that would run counter to the encouragement of temperance or to proper living.  At the same time, it is necessary to ease the situation in that way, and to feel that people who want these little privileges who have not so many privileges in life, while other people have abundance of privileges, should be considered.  I think you should not deprive the ordinary community of having these advantages to a certain extent.  That is all I have to say on that question at present.  It does not come up just now.  I think that the Revenue Commissioners are doing their work fairly well, but they must press very strongly for getting arrangements made whereby this double taxation would be so arranged that the proper refunds can be obtained simply and speedily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word as this question of smuggling has been mentioned, because I am reliably informed that smuggling is going on, not on the coast line but on the Border.  It has been brought to my notice on many occasions, and I think that the Revenue Commissioners should take serious notice of it, that a big trade is being done across the Border, especially in sugar, sweets and tobacco, to the detriment of the income of the State, and I think the sooner the Commissioners see that supervision is tightened up the better, because I am thoroughly convinced that we are losing a good deal of revenue by it.  A man who gets five cwts. of sugar across the Border gets £5 or £10 for his trouble, and I believe it is done with impunity at various <Col N="1572" /> points from Newry to Derry in every place where there is a railway and a town, where sugar and sweets are being brought in, and a good deal of revenue is being lost.  I am not finding any fault with the Revenue Commissioners for the way in which they have been carrying out their duties, but I believe they should tighten up that matter and see that better precautions are taken.</P>

      <P>Some time ago I spoke to the Minister for Finance with reference to tobacco licences, that is, in the case of shopkeepers who sell tobacco. Very few of them are paying the licence.  I also asked him if he would consider the advisability of readjusting the whole business.  The huckster pays 5/- a year licence, the very same as the big shopkeeper in Grafton Street or College Green.  The licences for the sale of tobacco ought, I think, to be based on the valuation of the shop or premises, but in most cases the licence is not paid at all.

I think there were thirteen cases, and I understand there was only one prosecution. I am not aware of the fact that people are not even paying for the licences, but I do know that the Minister for Finance had this matter under consideration some time ago.  I cannot say at what stage the consideration of the matter is at present.  He had a proposal that Deputy MacCarthy put to him that the licence should be graded on the valuation of the house.  I think that at that time it was put to the Minister that even if that were done, and very considerable amounts were paid for certain houses, there would be scarcely any alteration as far as the revenue was concerned; that it would be an advantage to the larger shops, but that there would be no revenue advantage in it, and I think that that was one of the reasons why the matter was not dealt with in the Finance Bill of this year.</P>

If you did wipe out these small shops you would not have to look after them, and you would get the licences from a smaller number of shops, and the revenue would be bound to benefit.

There is a sum of £1,275 which will be paid into the Vote from the Church Temporalities Fund when the Endowment Fund has been wound up.  The figure is made up of the following sums:&mdash;£365 in respect of Bacteriologist; £450 in respect of lecturer in English, and £460 in respect of grants to students' societies.</P>
    <P>The aggregate net totals of the three new estimates exceed those for the two <Col N="1575" /> original estimates for Ministry of Agriculture and Science and Art by £270.</P>
    <P>It was found, when preparing the revised estimate for Ministry of Agriculture, that the retention in that Ministry of an officer engaged in chemical research whose transfer to the State Laboratory was intended at the time of preparation of the original estimates, involved the Ministry in expenditure of £170 out of sub-head G.1, and £460 out of sub-head G.2.  The latter expenditure is counterbalanced by the inclusion of additional £460 in the Appropriations in Aid sub-head from the Development Fund.  The retention of the officer concerned has been sanctioned by the Minister for Finance between the dates of the preparation of the two estimates, and the opportunity was taken when presenting the latter estimate for agriculture, of putting the matter right by including the above sums as charges on the estimate instead of leaving it to be met from savings in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>As regards the remaining £100, the increase of £100 is more apparent than real.  It arises from the deletion of £100 from the Appropriations in Aid heretofore received by the Ministry of Agriculture from the Endowment Fund in respect of certain officers engaged in the service of technical instruction.  It was clearly correct to divert this sum from the Ministry of Agriculture Vote, and were there no other important Appropriations in Aid of the new Technical Instruction Vote it would probably have been shown individually.  It was not specifically included, because it was considered to be included in the general apportionment of £40,725 representing the share of the Endowment Fund applicable to Technical Instruction. Apart from that £270, the estimates are the same, with this difference: that they are segregated under different Ministries.  I think in these circumstances the Committee will not have any difficulty in taking the Science and Art Vote when we reassemble.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The first recommendation from the Seanad is &ldquo;That Section 2 be deleted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be within the recollection of Deputies that this particular Section was debated in the Dáil for a considerable time.  It proposes to relieve taxpayers of that one-sixth deduction that was granted to them in respect of premises which were subject to Income Tax.  The matter was debated here at considerable length, and on more than one occasion.  The case that was put up was that in certain instances through the country where the owner was in occupation of a large house that this was a hardship, but I find, on a general examination of the question, that the average valuation of a fairly <Col N="1577" /> large house would be about £100.  The outside figure would be about £120, and that would probably represent the valuation of a castle.  Now the deduction of one-sixth in that case would simply mean relieving the owner of £20 a year, at 5/- in the pound, and I think that is not an unreasonable charge, even if it were an extra charge. Examining houses in the country and houses in the towns, I think it will be found that comparing a mansion in any part of the country, outside of the metropolitan area, its valuation is at less than fifty per cent. of a house in town.  In one particular case that was brought to my notice, I enquired as to the valuation, and I found it was £26. I think that any house in the country valued at less than £30 would, in the city of Dublin, be valued at about £70. The main case put up was in respect of these country mansions.  I do admit that large country mansions would entail considerable cost on the owner, but generally speaking this particular advantage that has been derived here for a number of years and which is compared occasionally with the situation in England, is not a fair representation of the facts.</P>
    <P>In England the one-sixth is allowed off the rent, but here it is off the valuation, and to that extent there is a considerable advantage to a person owning premises here.  Take it that a man has a country house valued at £30.  In that particular case only the £30 is added to his income for the purpose of assessing income tax on that particular property.  The property would probably cost £1,000, and taking it at the lowest possible calculation the annual value of £1,000 would be £50, whereas the assessment is in respect only of the £30.  In the circumstances I am not in a position to ask the Dáil to accept this recommendation from the Seanad.  There is there at the very lowest possible computation £1,000 worth of property, which should, in normal circumstances, bring forth an assessment of £50 per annum, but the assessment is only £30 in respect of it. There are cases, of course, which are different from that.  However, as a general case, I think, although the Seanad did not agree with me, the advantages <Col N="1578" /> we are giving in the case of persons having an income of £8,000 a year and over, more than compensates for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether that £30 house which he puts against the £50 interest on the £1,000, is the equivalent of the £70 house in Dublin?  If so, the difference between the £70 valuation of the town house and the interest on the £1,000 is the equivalent to the difference on the other side between £30 on the country house and the £50 interest on the £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A house valued for £70 in Dublin would probably be equivalent to a £3,000 investment. In other words, a house on which the valuation was £70 in the city, would not sell certainly under £2,000.</P>

      <P>When I saw on the Order Paper that the Seanad had sent up a recommendation to this House on the subject that I had the privilege of bringing before the Dáil on previous occasions, to have it again considered, it greatly added to my appreciation of the Seanad, and while I had very high appreciation of the Seanad before then, this added considerably to it.  I am afraid that the discussions that took place, even the recent one in the Dáil, have not helped to make clear to Deputies what exactly this clause means. Prior to the inclusion of this clause in the Finance Bill, for a great many years it has been the privilege of those who own houses and live in them to deduct one-sixth of the income tax payable. That deduction was originally agreed to for the purpose of meeting the cost of repairs on houses.  The cost of repairs in the days when this privilege was first accorded was very much less than the cost of repairs to-day, so, consequently, if the argument was good a number of years ago, the position is greatly strengthened by the increased cost of repairs to-day.  Now this clause, as incorporated in the <Col N="1579" /> Finance Bill, means that if a person owing a house sets it, and agrees to pay for the whole of the repairs, he is at liberty to deduct one-sixth of the income tax.  If the owner lives in the house, and pays for the repairs, he is not at liberty to deduct one-sixth. That is what the clause means.  If a man owns a house and sets it, provided he undertakes to pay for the repairs, he is at liberty to deduct one-sixth, but if he lives in the house which he owns and pays for the repairs, he cannot deduct one-sixth.  I have heard of absurdities in the making of laws, in which I myself have very little experience, but this appears to me to be one of the most extraordinary clauses I ever heard of.  I am afraid this clause was not understood by the Dáil, otherwise the Dáil would be of the unanimous opinion which the Seanad appears to have been on this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has pointed out that valuation varies.  It does vary, as we all know, but to try to make comparisons between city valuations and country valuations is impossible. Valuers consider all the circumstances of the case when making a valuation. The circumstances in a city are quite different from the circumstances in the country, and, consequently, the basis of valuation in the city is quite different from the basis of valuation in the country, and to try to make comparisons between these two valuations, made on different basis, is to try to do the impossible, because there is no comparison. The President has pointed out the differences there are in valuations, and we are all agreed that there are valuations which ought to be revised.  But, if you want to revise old and inaccurate valuations, do not do it by taxing everybody who owns his house.  Do it by altering your valuation, which is the proper businesslike way of doing it.  With regard to the City of Dublin &mdash;and no one knows the City of Dublin better than the President&mdash;it cannot be said, for the purpose of supporting his argument, that there are old valuations there, because, as we all know, house in the City of Dublin were valued as recently as 1916.  The President said in that connection, when the matter was before <Col N="1580" /> the Dáil, that the value of property had increased very much since 1916.  I agree; but I think the President will also agree that house property stands at a very inflated value at the moment. I have heard him say on more than one occasion that house property was too costly.  Does he propose, when house property is in an inflated state, that a valuation should take place?  I would say that the proper value, the mean value, of house property would be somewhere about its value in 1916, and I would strongly oppose any further valuation upon a later basis, because it would be on an inflation, which will, we hope, last only for a limited period. This is a question that ought to be explored much more than it has been. There is a principle underlying this proposition which I would like to urge, and that is that this rebate has been an encouragement, in the past, to people to own their own houses.  That encouragement will be done away with under this clause, and that will be a disadvantage, not alone to the private owner, but also to the public authority. Public authorities to-day, almost without exception, are endeavouring to sell houses that they have erected, and are trying to get the tenants to become owners of their houses.  Up to the present, where they have succeeded in selling houses, one of the inducements has been that a tenant who becomes an owner would get a reduction of one-sixth in the income tax.  Now that incentive is to be done away with, and I want to lay stress on the fact that to encourage people to own their houses is to encourage, what Deputy Wilson very properly called, a civic spirit.</P>
    <P>We encourage people to become better citizens because in owing their own houses they have to pay local rates and other charges, and when they have to do so, they take an interest in and try to keep down as low as possible these rates and charges, whereas, as is the case with many houses in Dublin where they are set at a rental including taxes, they take no interest in civic affairs, because whether the taxes go up or down the rent they have to pay is the same.  There is only one other point I wish to mention, and that is that the Minister for Finance, whose absence we all deplore, when discussing this matter previously said that the <Col N="1581" /> subject had been considered in Great Britain where the one-sixth is allowed while it is refused here, thus adding another burden to taxpayers of the Free State.  We asked the Minister, why, if it was so advantageous to the Government to do away with the one-sixth, it had not been done away with in Great Britain.  He admitted they had considered the question and found that the revenue that they would receive from it was not worth the injury and trouble it would cause.  I am quite satisfied that what has been true of Great Britain will also be true of the Free State, and that in refusing to give this rebate we will do away with the few attractions we have at present to induce people to own their own houses, and furthermore it will cause, I am sure, amongst householders all over the country a considerable amount of inconvenience. Possibly I might explain one point which may not be clear to some Deputies.  In valuations, particularly in rural districts, there are many cases where the land and house are valued together and in such cases there is no rebate of one-sixth.  The modern system is to value the land separately from the house.  Where the house is separately valued from the land and where the owner occupies the house, he is entitled under the clause, as it stood formerly, to that deduction of one-sixth, but under the Finance Bill, as now proposed, he is no longer entitled to that.  I do not know if I would be in order to move a direct negative, that we agree with the recommendation of the Seanad, but if I am in order I would move it.</P>

The measure was introduced by the Minister for Finance, and we have generally adopted the procedure allowing the Minister, when the Bill comes back from the Seanad, to move to reject or accept the recommendation of the Seanad.  I take it if the President were defeated on this question that the recommendation be not agreed to, he would not oppose a Motion to delete the Section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The President was very adroit when he referred to the question of the valuation of large houses and mansions in the country. Of course, there is a case to be made for them because in both cases they are surrounded by pleasure grounds and gardens, and although the valuations of the mansions are low, the valuations of the pleasure grounds are as high as if they were remunerative, instead of being an expense to the owners.  Persons who own such houses need every concession and would be glad to get it even if it were only a five pound note. This section, of course, applies not only to the mansions in the country but to every house in which the owner is living, whether it be a mansion or a cottage which a working man bought out of his savings to live in to the end of his days.  The allowance will be removed from each and every one of these if the motion is carried, and even though it is only a small allowance, I would suggest that this is not the moment to add to the burden of income tax payers who are worse off than income tax payers anywhere else, and to whom this tax may be the last straw. I happen to live in a house which I own.  If I happen to let it to Deputy Good, and if I go and live in Deputy Good's house, although I could not afford it, then we both would obtain this allowance.  What is the sense or logic in that?  The President said that he did not convince the Seanad.  He did not convince a single person in the Seanad.  The Seanad is a remarkable body.  I hope it is not rude to call it a heterogeneous body, as it is composed of various classes of people, yet on this point they were unanimous, and they recommended the deletion of this section.  I believe if a free Vote of the Dáil were given the Dáil would be found to be very nearly unanimous also.  I do not know what action the <Col N="1584" /> Labour Party would take here but I know what they did in the Seanad.  I urge upon the Government to agree to this recommendation, but if they do not I shall have much pleasure in voting against them.</P>

      <P>There is a real difference between Deputy Major Cooper letting his house to Deputy Good and occupying it himself.  If he were to let it to Deputy Good, although I know the Deputy is not a hard man at bargaining, I submit it would be foolish to let it at anything less than a sum which would be a fair return on the capital cost of the house.  Let us take a £1,500 house.  At what sum will that be let?  If it be let at all I should say that it would be let at 8 per cent. on the £1,500 and the rent that will be charged is £120.</P>

      <P>Eight per cent. is the sum assessed by able economists.  If it be in dispute can the Deputy suggest that a house the value of which is £1,000 or £1,500, is let at less?  Can Deputy Good tell me where I can get a house at £120 a year which I would be able to buy at a price not less than £1,500?  That is the point.  If a person has a house worth £1,500 he will not let it under £120 per annum.  The sum is £120 per annum.  Deduct if you like the cost of the rates, and that house would be valued at £30 or £32 per annum if it be a township house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was making some inquiries about that class of house <Col N="1585" /> within the last few years that would be let at £120 per annum.  £36 a year is the valuation.  15/- in the £ would be £27.  £27 from £120 leaves £93.  £93 represent the annual income from property, the income tax on which would be charged on £36 per annum.

      <P>The £3,000 is usually beyond the market for the ordinary public.  The Deputy will admit that.  We run from about £1,000 up to £1,500.  I would like to take this class of house not because it will prove my case but rather because it has a ready market.  £3,000 houses have not ready markets.  To some extent for the last couple of years the people who would purchase such houses are not disposed to invest money in such property now. They are either not here or are considering the purchase of smaller houses, but my case for the £1,500 is sound.  If it is not sound I will take £1,000.  In any case I know people who would be willing to pay £100 per annum for such a house.  The valuation of that house was not more than £30.  That leaves £70 on the £1,000.  The income tax in respect of that particular investment is on the £30, and the case that has been made by Deputy Good and, I think, made as ably by Deputy Good as it was in the Seanad, here or elsewhere, is that we should allow one-sixth of that <Col N="1586" /> £30, which has a potential value of an income of £70 per annum.  I may be out 10 per cent., but even if I am, it is only £60 you would get for that house.  I would take three or four of such houses, £1,000 houses with a valuation of £30, for people who want them if such houses are available.</P>

      <P>No, I am not; but the case that the Deputy put up and which was put up in the Seanad is that we are interfering with the basis of assessment of income tax, which did not prevail during the time of the British here, which was unfair to people with an income, and which was placing a burden on people with house property. On more than one occasion I said that while our taxation is heavy, most of those who know it is heavy bear a burden which would not be borne in England by the same class of person.  It must be admitted that while that is the case, the actual taxation per head here is relatively less than it is in Great Britain, but it falls on a certain order here by reason of the fact that they are the plutocrats in this country.

      <P>Would the President allow me to direct his attention to the point which is at issue, namely, why he permits the anomaly that when you let a house you are allowed one-sixth, and if you live in it yourself you are not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was proceeding to do that, but owing to the remarkable strategy of Deputy Cooper he got me off the point by pointing out the value of his £3,000 house.  If I live in a house and own it, and the value of that house is £1,000, I have mentioned that I am actually in possession of a potential £70 <Col N="1587" /> per annum.  On the other hand you may let that house, and get £120 per annum.  I have mentioned already that I know three persons who will take such houses at such a price.  What do they get?  The difference between the rates to be paid on that house, and the £120, that is £90 per annum.</P>
      <P>We are charging income tax on £30 per annum in respect of that house.  Take the case of a person who is paying that £120.  He is paying out £120 from his income.  He negotiates the purchase of a house, and he pays £1,000 for it.  He pays £60 for the house, and £30 in rates, £90 in all.  That is his whole outgoing. But he has something which is worth £120 per year to him, and he has the advantage in consequence that according as he pays off the amount the asset becomes very much more valuable; even if he has to borrow the money in the bank, and pays six per cent., he still has an advantage, and that is the reason for the difference between the two. You will not find in many cases that a person who has to rent a house will get it at the economic value that a person who can afford to put down the money will get it at.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, although there is remarkable wisdom in the Seanad, and although I would accept Deputy Good's advice upon matters of business, in this case, looking at it from the point of view of the revenue of the State, and from the point of view of distributing the tax as equitably as possible on the shoulders that are best able to bear the burden, I think it is not a sound amendment.  The people who pay can square their chests and say: &ldquo;We are the citizens of a great State, and we bear the burden.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am not able to follow the complexities of this kind of argument.  I was not able to follow it on the original discussion.  But the Minister has involved me in intricacies that I cannot see my way through at all.  I have two friends living next door to each other, in houses built together of the same type.  One pays a rent to his landlord.  The other has become infatuated with the philosophy of Deputy Good, and thinks it is a most <Col N="1588" /> glorious thing to be the owner of his own house.  But he is not the real owner of his own house.  He has borrowed the money and is paying interest on it. Now, I cannot for the life of me see from the President's argument why the alleged owners of these two houses should be treated differently.  The man who has borrowed the money and is paying interest on it is presumed to be the owner.  He is called the owner.  He is living in the house, and therefore has to pay more than the man who is the owner of the house next door and lets it.  I cannot understand that for the life of me, and I hope the President will be able to make much clearer than he has why the owners of these two houses should be treated differently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I was not in here to hear my learned friend advocating the advantages of the resolution that has come down to us from the Seanad.  I do not always agree with resolutions coming down from the Seanad.  In this particular case I have heard the President evidently trying to controvert the arguments advanced in favour of this recommendation.  Of course, the President, and prior to that, the Minister for Finance, have dished up the case to bear out their arguments that the man who owns his own house should be deprived of the privileges he had in the past in connection with income tax.  The President talks about houses of a £1,000 valuation, and I think that Deputy Cooper must have been talking about houses of £3,000 valuation.  But from my point of view at the present time, to talk about houses and their valuation is practically an absurdity.  Take a large house in the neighbourhood of Dublin or in the County Dublin, or in the other parts of the country.  The value of that house is in inverse ratio to its size.  In fact, under the present order of things a large house is an incumbrance rather than of any great value to the owner. And correspondingly on the other side, owing to the great shortage of housing, a small house is a very distinct asset, inasmuch as there is a very great scramble for the prospective tenancy of any such house that becomes vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when you talk about the valuation of houses you are talking about a thing that is quite out of the <Col N="1589" /> ordinary as far as business is concerned. We all know that in the past couple of years, people who have had to buy their houses have had to pay preposterous prices for them simply because they required accommodation for themselves.  The precariousness of a man being tenant of a house induced people to look upon an investment in the nature of houses to cover their heads as something out of the ordinary range of business proposition.  Therefore, when the President comes to talk about the values of houses, he is talking, I think, of a thing that at the present time is in a chaotic state and in which the relative values have ceased to operate.  In this matter what is the law of the land, and what has been the law of the land?  Income tax and rates are chargeable on valuation. Whether that valuation is right or whether it is wrong, the valuation is based on something that purports to be the value of the thing that is being made chargeable for rates and taxes. A man pays £1,000 for his house and gets the money from the bank at 6 per cent., which is £60 a year.  He pays on a valuation of £30.  Does he by any means get rid of the obligation under which this allowance has been made for the repair and wear and tear of the house, or is that one-sixth allowed in the past for that purpose by any manner of means excessive? If the valuation is lower in the case of these particular houses it must be equally low in relation to houses that this does not affect at all or does not operate in connection with. But as I think I heard my friend, Deputy Good, say, if you want to go and alter the whole system of taxation as regards the valuation, it is not right, in my judgment, to take one isolated instance and one particular class of people and penalise them, because you are penalising them in respect of a thing that has been in operation for a very large number of years in this matter. When men or women purchased their houses over a period of years, I take it that they did so with full regard to the allowances that they would get off the payment for income tax in relation to the repairs that they were going to undertake.  When you try to assess the relative importance of these <Col N="1590" /> allowances as compared with the different people, I say you are trying to individualise in your taxation&mdash;a thing that has not been recognised in the past as being a reasonable attitude for the State to take.  In taxation the State is impersonal.  I claim that this recommendation that has been passed by the Seanad is fully justified and that the action of the Minister for Finance in removing or trying to remove by his financial measure this allowance that has been operating for years past, is not alone unjust but is done in an entirely irregular fashion.  He introduced his Budget.  There was no statement with regard to this matter in the Budget.  He introduced his Budget resolutions and there was no reference at all to this in them.  But now at a certain stage in the proceedings he comes in with this.  Who put him up to it?  Why is it more important now than when he was framing his Budget, and on what grounds does he bring it up at this stage?</P>

      <P>It is with considerable trepidation that I join in this debate.  Like Deputy Johnson, I do so in order to get some information, after the confusion into which Deputy Good and Deputy Cooper plunged us. I understood Deputy Cooper to sum up the situation in the way which I will presently describe and in which he, I think, reproduced the force of Deputy Good's argument.  He has a house, and he occupies it.  He pays income tax on the valuation.  Deputy Good is in a similar position.  In order to get the benefit of this one-sixth reduction, they let the houses to each other.  They then get the benefit of the one-sixth reduction. That is the problem, so far as I understand it.  I think the ordinary person who has ever looked at the list of houses of any house agent in the City of Dublin will be faced with the fact that houses of this valuation of £45 are charged for at the present time at £2,000.  What happens in the hypothetical case put up by Deputy Bryan Cooper is, that in order to get the value of the one-sixth rebate, he will have to pay income tax on £120 instead of on £45.  I know he will get something off for repairs, but in any event the net income of that house to the person letting it will be, at the very lowest, £80. <Col N="1591" /> In order to get the sum of £45 reduced to £37 10s. he will plunge himself into the necessity of paying income tax on £80.  That, so far as I understand, is the result of the paradox Deputy Cooper presented to us.  And that, so far as I understand, is the justification for the original recommendation that was sent on from the Seanad and which the combined wisdom of what I may call the aristocratic House&mdash;I heard one of the Senators refer to this body as the democratic House the other day&mdash;sent down to us.</P>

      <P>Still seeking enlightenment, may I put the case as it appears to me, and may I ask the President if he will explain the apparent injustice in a concrete case I will put to him.  There are two men living in houses alongside each other.  They each pay a rent of £70, the valuation being £35.  The second of these two men decides to purchase his house.  The original landlord of the first house gets an allowance of one-sixth on the valuation.  In the case of the second house, the man having bought it, and become the possessor of his own house, loses that reduction which the landlord of the house, prior to the purchase, received. In the case of these two particular houses, why should that disparity be created by the resolution, and where is the value received by the man living in his own house for that extra £5, which represents the difference between the two?</P>

Deputy Johnson has put up the case of two small houses.  The owner lives in one and sets the other.  He does not get any rebate of one-sixth in respect of the house in which he lives.  In respect of the house which he sets, he gets a rebate of one-sixth.  Will the President deal with that case?</P>

      <P>I think the President's figures are right to a certain extent, and I want to take his example.  But I do not think his figures are quite complete.  As illustrations have been put, I will put one.  Deputy Alton and myself are setting up house, and we decide to buy two houses.  We can afford to buy two identical houses.  Instead of my living in my own house, I live in Deputy Alton's house, and Deputy Alton lives in mine.  We pay the same money and we pay equal rents, one to the other. Therefore, we are just clear.  Now, we can deduct one-sixth part of the valuation, as each of us has let his house to the other.  If, on the other hand, I had lived in my own house and he had lived in his own house we would not have been allowed to deduct the one-sixth. That illustration puts the case as well as I can put it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to make the matter clear to Deputy O'Sullivan by giving him a case in point.  If he can show I am wrong I will sit down.  The landlord letting his house to a tenant does not pay income tax on the rent he receives but on the valuation.  Deputy O'Sullivan is quite wrong, because he assumes that the landlord is paying income tax on the rent he receives.</P>
      <P>I now come to figures.  Before I come to the President's own figures, I want to take a concrete case.  I admit it is very difficult to argue from concrete cases just at present, owing to the abnormal situation as regards prices and rents.  But this was an actual case.  A man was living in his own house that was valued for £70.  He was obliged by the landlord to buy out that house, and he bought it out for £1,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, being his own landlord, he pays £46 for rates; he pays £12 for ground rent; he pays £17 for income tax; and he pays £6 for insurance on a house of that kind.  And you will have to allow &mdash;and this is a point which the President <Col N="1593" /> really omits&mdash;at least £15 for repairs. I think that would be really a small allowance.  That means that although that man owns the house he really pays about £96 a year for it. Suppose he did not buy it and that he was paying rent for it, what would his position be?  At the time that he was compelled to buy, the rent was £120. If he had not bought he would have his £1,800 capital, and he would be getting £90 a year on that at 5 per cent.  He would have to pay on that £90, say, £23 income tax.  That leaves £67.  And the net result of that is that he would have £67 with which to pay his £120 rent, and he would have to pay £53 out of his pocket for his house as compared with £96.  That is the way a concrete case works out under the new system.  It is all against the man who owns his own house.</P>
    <P>Take the President's own case.  He assumes the case of a house the valuation of which is £30, and it is sold for £1,000.  It works out very simply.  I allow £10 for repairs; £5 for ground rent; £20 for rates, and £8 for income tax.  That works out to £43 a year, although he owns the house himself. Supposing he was renting that house, I do not think he would pay more than £60 a year for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

Again, it is against the man who owns the house.</P>
      <P>The whole matter is really a very small item.  I admit that.  But my real feeling against this proposal is that it is about the last link in the general trend of taxation in modern times, that it is absolutely against encouraging any sort of thrift.  I say that deliberately.</P>

      <P>Yes, he ought to be encouraged.  I do think that this is a very regrettable feature in the tendency of modern taxation.  You penalise the man who has put a little by; you make him pay extra taxation on unearned income whether that unearned income is the result of his own economy or is given to him by his predecessors. You penalise the man who makes provision for a rainy day.  It is the general trend of modern taxation.  By it the State does not give encouragement to the people not to live up to their means but to make some provision for the future.  And one of the best ways in which they can make provision for the future is to buy their own houses. The State should give a little encouragement to the young man who has started house to pay a little more at the commencement, perhaps by borrowing money, in order that he may be in a position to meet the responsibilities that come later on.  Under present circumstances it is the man of small means who is hit most.  It is not the labour man; it is not the rich man; it is more or less the man with a fixed income, who is not organised, who has nothing to protect him on the one side and who is crushed by the burden of taxation on the other.  It is for reasons like that that I would urge the reconsideration of this matter.  It is a little matter, but it, after all, involves an important principle.</P>

We must have, in building up a State here, a definite social policy; we must have particular principles behind all our legislation and behind our financial policy; and it would, everybody will agree, tend to the stability and tend to the wealth and happiness of the State if every citizen in the State owned his own house.  It seems to me that the President's exposition of the proposal, as a blackboard exposition of perfect financial equity, may be all right, but I submit that it is no more than that; and I submit that on the face of it what the proposal in the Finance Bill would mean is that if <Col N="1595" /> every house in the State was occupied by its owner the Revenue would stand to make a good lot out of it under the proposal.  Now, I submit that if you have a State here of the stability that a State would have if every house in it was occupied by its owner, it would be unnecessary to attempt to increase the revenue in the way that it is suggested here now.  And I would urge the dropping of the proposal, because it is a very definite propaganda against the principle that we should endeavour to get established in the State here for the purpose of building it up, and that is, the principle that as far as possible every person should own his own house.</P>

The ordinary man who owns a house and is now refused the concession of a one-sixth reduction on the assessment of income tax will not look at the figures at all.  He will not be troubled with the figures when he sees that this one-sixth reduction has been conceded in England and Scotland, and also in the Northern area.  And I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that a great deal of propaganda will be made out of this; and I would strongly urge the President and the Executive Council associated with him to agree with the Seanad recommendation.  The ordinary man in Donegal or Cork, or anywhere else will not trouble himself calculating the figures.  He will know that the one-sixth concession that he used to get has been refused to him by the Free State Government.  I would strongly urge the Free State Government to agree to the change made by the Seanad in this matter.

Deputy Wilson described it as an anomaly <Col N="1596" /> when he stated that the owner of a house was refused the abatement of one-sixth, and that if the owner of the house had let that house to a tenant he got that abatement.  But that is not so. The landlord does not get the abatement of one-sixth if the house is let at an amount one-sixth more than the poor law valuation.  For instance, if the poor law valuation of a house is £36 and the house is let at £43&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Undoubtedly there was an abatement before this Bill was introduced, an abatement of one-sixth to the owner of a house who occupied it himself, and that has been taken away in the Bill.  But it is not fair to compare the assessment with the assessment in England, where it is made on a different valuation.  It is made on a rental valuation.</P>

Jesting apart, this section will do a lot to discourage many an individual from attempting to become the owner of his own house, and, as has been pointed out very clearly, it will be another mark against us that we are inferior to the Six Counties, and are not able to manage our affairs as well and that we had to put this little burden on the already over-burdened taxpayers.</P>

He finds himself with a diminished income, and is called upon to subscribe to the civic spirit by paying more and more to the country's exchequer. I want to approach the question from that angle.  We are overtaxed, and we should begin to get back to where we ought to be, to where the people in the Six Counties are, and I contend this is a fresh imposition on us and should be resisted.  We on these benches are going to vote in favour of the Seanad's recommendation.</P>

      <P>I can only say that in hearing some of the arguments I was reminded of Euclid who, when exhausted by a proposition, said that could not be because it was absurd.  A couple of Deputies have mentioned houses, particular houses.  Deputy Alton, I think, mentioned his, but he <Col N="1598" /> did not tell us what he paid for it, and he did not tell us what he paid in the way of rent before he bought his house.  Deputy Thrift has mentioned the case of the £1,800 house.  That house can only be in Merrion Square, Fitzwilliam Square, or possibly Harcourt Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not far away.  Now, the man in occupation of that house had to pay £120 a year.  I suppose he was ordered to get out.  We were not told if the £120 a year rent would continue.  He was compelled to buy.  What compelled him?  The fact that if he did not buy he would have to pay a rental of £160 or £170 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>A rent of £70 a year keeps him out of the benefits of that Act.  If my recollection of that Act is right, a rental of above £50 or £60 a year is not within the scope of the Rent Restrictions Act, so that this man was fair game, and I think I am backing a sure thing when I am backing Euclid in that particular proposition. Now, in the figures produced the £70 valuation, we are told that the ground rent was £12, and the income tax £17 on the £70.  When I had to discharge some responsibilities before I came here my recollection is that you were allowed to deduct from the income tax whatever amount was paid to the ground rent landlord.  Therefore, the actual amount in that case would be calculated on £58.  The landlord bore it in respect of the £12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor THRIFT Professor THRIFT">
      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not affect the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it does, for it reduces considerably the amount that has to be paid for income tax, and as regards the question of £6 for insurance on the £1,800 property, my recollection is that the price is 1/6 per £100, and eighteen times 1/6 would be £1 7s., and £6 is an estimate that would not be passed by a business man.  I notice that Deputy Good's face is getting longer as I am disposing of these figures one after another.  We have an <Col N="1599" /> inflated case put up, and the case must be weak that needs such extraordinary figures to back it up.  If this man did not buy his house he would not be allowed to continue in it at £120 a year. He would have to pay £170 if he was going to stay there, so that it is not against that £120 that you have to consider this particular outgoing of £80, and the difference between this inflated £80&mdash;we can reduce it very much below that figure&mdash;and the £170 would be £90. That bears some relation to the interest on the money which he would sink in it.  The fact is that a great number of persons have bought their property within the last few years, and they have benefited by it.  Deputy Johnson cites the case of a man who had to borrow money and is paying £60 interest on it, but he can put down that £60 in order to reduce the £500, and he is assessed on £440.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It would more than wipe out anything he would be responsible for in connection with the house.  If the valuation of the house is £60 and he pays £60 as interest on £1,000, that particular item of £30 assessment for income tax on that does not concern him.  He not alone gets that off, but £30 off his gross income tax assessment as well.</P>

      <P>Regarding the man who lives in one house and who is charged in respect of that house on the £30, as I said before, he has potential value invested there for £50.  He is charged only on £30.  The £1,000 that he paid for the house is worth £50 per year to him.  But, suppose he is not occupying the house and that he lives in a hotel or a tent.  He has £50 per annum sunk in that house, and we only charge him on £30.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case it is more than possible that he would be charged on the exact value of his income. That was the case I was making. The basis of the case that is made against it is that he had some advantage, and we are taking it away.  As to the case mentioned by Deputy Good, I have yet to come across a case of that sort where the house is let at such a price that it is only worth the actual valuation.  I admit at once that this is something that is unusual.  It is unusual by reason of the peculiar circumstances in which we find ourselves. Where a person has bought premises and borrowed money, in most cases I believe the sum that is asked to be put down in respect of such a property is half the amount; half the amount will be found, at six per cent. interest, to wipe out this particular liability on the whole of the valuation, apart altogether from the one-sixth.  In the circumstances, I cannot see my way to recommend the Dáil to adopt this recommendation from the Seanad.</P>

      <P>On last Friday when I was interrupted for the last time I was endeavouring to deal with Deputy Johnson's point, phrased by him in this way, &ldquo;that non-university students would by the schemes proposed by the Minister for Education be deprived of certain opportunities.&rdquo;  My answer to that I wish to divide into two parts, because it appears to me to raise two misconceptions. The first is that there are at present people who are described as non-university students and that they are getting education in a university which is described as not a university, and that for the future in order to get the same education in the same subjects they will have to be included in a university, and will, therefore, be <Col N="1608" /> university students.  In so far as the point deals with the personnel attending the College of Science, I have already dealt with it in answer to another Deputy, that these students have for years been attending an institution that is in reality a university, and that they have been, to all intents and purposes, of university calibre, and that they have been receiving university instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other point that here is an institution with certain special teaching faculties and that it seems to be now proposed to do away entirely with this and to leave a certain gap, a gap previously filled by the College of Science. Examples, I thought, would have been drawn from other countries to show that technology had been segregated from ordinary university subjects. That, of course, was the fact in Ireland. It grew up out of the historical circumstances around the foundations of the College of Science where it was a fact that in other countries there were other accidental circumstances which explained the reasons why technology was a thing apart.  There were certain instances&mdash;Manchester was one case-where special developments in particular subjects&mdash;and in this case it was engineering&mdash;led to the establishment of a faculty or school of engineering, mechanical and electrical, prior to the foundation of the University, and it was incorporated in the University when the University came along.  The whole modern trend is to incorporate in a university system any such technological establishment.  It is obvious that in ordinary countries that did come about.  The universities took up whatever first came.  Pure science made its appearance prior to the application of that science and all the chairs belonging to pure science and research in pure science were incorporated in the universities at a time when the application of science, especially, was not being attended to.  But when the applied sciences came to be studied, then as the university grew and adapted itself to its environment it took in these subjects. That has been the case with even the older universities which had to be reconstituted.  The German universities, in 1826, incorporated various <Col N="1609" /> things and placed them in their Departments, I think, of Science and Philosophy.  Now this whole point, and it is an important point, raised by Deputy Johnson was dealt with in a Commission and there was a report from that Commission, a brief paragraph of which I had on Friday intended to read to the Deputy before concluding. This was the Royal Commission on University Education set up in London, and the sittings of that Commission extended over the years from 1910 to 1913.  It had to take cognizance of all the aspects and relations of technology to the universities and it especially had to attend to the manifold ways in which this problem presented itself to the Imperial College of Science and to the London University.  The conclusions of that Commission were very far-reaching and the following is a brief summary of what they were, if I may just read one paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Technological studies should be included in a city university.  The principles underlying the sciences rather than their application are needed by the masters of industry, equally with the doctor and lawyer, and the spirit of the university are necessary to permanent advance in the application of science to practical needs.&rdquo;&ldquo;A separate technological university for London, claimed by the Imperial College of Science, is condemned.&rdquo;  They further point out that &ldquo;The Charlottenburg Technical High School (Berlin) has no true analogy with the Imperial College.  Many Germans of standing now regret the exclusion of a technological faculty from their universities. The practice of including technology in many university studies is not confined to England, or the United Kingdom, but it is to be found in all the universities of the Dominions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The University of Louvain, since its re-establishment in 1830, has included all the applied sciences and agriculture. The University of Liege similarly in the mining and iron-smelting districts, has developed the technological faculty as a leading feature; and now in England, the University of Cambridge has great departments of mechanical engineering, and is developing <Col N="1610" /> similarly in respect of agriculture and applied chemistry.</P>
    <P>All the great universities of the United States of America and of Canada from the long-established Colleges of Yale and Harvard, to those of more recent formation, such as Pennsylvania, John Hopkins', Illinois, Michigan, Toronto, and the other universities of the Middle West have large technological departments dealing with civil, electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering, and in many cases also with architecture and agriculture.</P>
    <P>No line can be drawn between chemistry pure and chemistry applied.  It has been urged here that if you send an agricultural student to the university, or as Deputy Good even urged to-day on another question, an industrial student, he becomes unfitted for his work, and that he cannot be brought down again to practice.  This is a point that is very often raised, and when it is raised no attention is paid to one big fact, that the medical student is destined to be a practitioner.  He must be a practical man, and it has never been suggested that the medical finds himself unfitted by his university association for the very practical work which he has to do afterwards.</P>
    <P>Industrial research in this country will for a long time centre around the subject of agriculture, and I think it must be apparent to anybody that any agricultural research that will have to do with the proper feeding of animals, and matters of that sort, will best be done by a man who had a training more in the medical line and more in association with medicals than any other man.  I am sorry that Deputy White is not here now.  The veterinary profession seems to be a special concern of his and the veterinary surgeon, with his scientific training, is the man in Ireland who is most ordinarily brought into communion with agricultural people. He is not at the moment held in the esteem in which he should be held, mainly because his whole training and his whole research has been directed towards one beast, the horse.  But any development in this country in the veterinary branch should be such as would bring the scientifically trained men more into communion with agriculturalists, and in this way they can be taught very definitely <Col N="1611" /> newer things, or at least they can be put in the way of learning newer things, with regard to the methods of feeding of cattle and the feeding of all sorts of animals.  I would not like to have it thought by introducing this subject that I am casting an envious and predatory eye on the Veterinary College also.  That may come later.  But at the moment I notice that the veterinary surgeon is not held in the estimation he might be, and the reason of that is because his education has not proceeded along broad lines, and has not had a proper scientific basis.  The real point so far with regard to the College of Science has been this, that the Department of Agriculture seemed to be content to take into it men who had not got a chance to perfect their education, and they turned these men into what has been described as jerry-built summer course experts, and these experts were sent down the country to teach others. For proper scientific work in this country you must get people who have a wide culture and a broad grasp of scientific principles, and that is going to be got better in the University in association with higher scientific training than in the College of Science, separated from the whole University life and outlook.</P>

      <P>The question further has been raised here of a State laboratory, and it seems to be implied that the College of Science should be set apart and that its main functions should be to carry out certain Government scientific services.  There ought to be a physical laboratory for the standardisation of weights and measures and the testing of machines and fabrics; a chemical laboratory to analyse foods and drugs, paints and such things; a biological or agricultural laboratory for the purposes of seed testing and the tracing of diseases peculiar to animals, and a meteorological station, and not merely wireless, but possibly some sort of aviation equipment.  All these things can be done, but in research no definite separation of these things from a university is immediately called for.  The <Col N="1612" /> men working in these various laboratories are servants of the State.  They will have time free from their duties, and they will have certain laboratory equipment and they may do certain work, but it is not part of the work they would be paid to do.  It would be for their leisure hours.  These men can get the opportunity in the university quite easily.  To return to the serious contribution which Deputy Johnson made to this debate, there are people who are not merely in a university, as we understand that term in its relation to the College of Science at the moment, that is to say, who are not in a university because they are not attending something called a university.  But if there be others who are, if I may put this gloss upon Deputy Johnson's phrase, people who never would attain university standard, then the question is, what is going to be done with these people?  I take, for example, the men at present in the College of Science who are attending the short courses. These will get attention in the University College, which has got the equipment of the College of Science.  Arrangements can be made in any university. Arrangements are made at present in University College, Dublin, for the granting of short courses leading up to diplomas, but not to degrees, in various subjects.  The same thing can be done, and will undoubtedly be done, if the College of Science be put completely at the disposal of University College.  I have been reminded that I used a particular phrase last Friday.  It has been put to me rather as a mistake, but it appears I did call the College of Science &ldquo;a perfectly useless institution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taken in the context, the phrase is one that I would stand by, but I desire that there should be no misconception about what I mean.  I did not mean that there were useless men teaching there or that they did no work there. I should have used the phrase that &ldquo;it is a perfectly and completely redundant institution.&rdquo;  I do not want to cast any aspersion on the staff in the College of Science, either on the professors, the lecturers or the demonstrators, or even on the students who went through the college.  All I do say is, <Col N="1613" /> and I reiterate this, that the College of Science is a University Institution, but there is no room in the country for it as such.  It is redundant.  In saying that I do not mean that the people there are of no use.  Let me just return to what I commenced with.  I view this problem in this way&mdash;as I said before, I take the view of the Minister for Education on it&mdash;that there is no case for the continuance of the College of Science as a separate institution. For the betterment of education in this country the College of Science should, in my opinion, be incorporated with a university institution; that having concluded so much, and looking around, I see that there is a university college with a claim on the exchequer of this country, and that some of the claims of that university, but only some, may be met by the incorporation in that university of the College of Science.  The College of Science means a lot.  As far as I am concerned, and I believe the Minister for Education agrees with me, or rather I agree with him, I believe that its funds as set out in this Vote, supplemented by whatever fund is set out in the Vote for the Office of Public Works for the maintenance, cleaning, upkeep, etc., of the buildings of the College of Science, are to be transferred to the two Colleges of the National University of Ireland, and that the buildings are to be transferred. I stress that because one newspaper on Friday last seemed to have a doubt, which I am sure was not shared by Deputy Hewat, that the buildings were to be left as they were.  I allude to Deputy Hewat, because it was on a remark of his that I founded the series of remarks I made on the buildings to which he alluded as &ldquo;the magnificent range of buildings outside.&rdquo;  This includes the handing over to the National University of the funds of the College of Science, which amount to about £40,000 with the buildings, and in addition, I believe it will finally mean the giving to the two University Colleges in Cork and Dublin of certain farms, so as to enable them to carry out properly the agricultural work which they will have to do when they get the money to set up faculties in agriculture. That, however, will arise upon another Vote, and is not included in the <Col N="1614" /> Science and Art Vote.  I hope that the Dáil, by its vote on this Estimate, and by any further remarks that Deputies may make, will show sufficient appreciation of the scheme propounded by the Minister for education as to enable the heads of the University Colleges in Cork and Dublin, to proceed immediately to get courses ready for such students as may come to them next year in the new faculties of Agriculture and Engineering.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point.  The Minister for Education dealt with Galway College.  He threw out certain suggestions about certain work which might be done in that University College. His suggestion appears to have been taken to mean that the particular work indicated by him was to be in substitution for all the work at present done by that University College.  I do not believe that that was the Minister's intention.  I think he meant, if it came to anything, an addition to the work, and I do think that when the Vote for the University Colleges comes along the Minister for Education will show that the funds at present voted to University College, Galway, are to be continued to that college, so that there is at the moment no question whatever of minimising the work that is to be done by University College, Galway. All the Minister meant by his suggestion is this: that there will be an enquiry into that college.  It is in a miserable state at present.  Its finances are absurd.  No work can be done, although people are struggling to do work of a university character there, and are succeeding in doing that.  They are doing that work under circumstances which cannot be allowed to continue, and that college must have a thorough examination to see how or in what way it may be continued.  It may have additions made to it, or possibly may have to exchange certain of its present functions for other additions. I am completely in support of the project outlined by the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>It was with feelings of deep regret I heard the remarks of the Minister for Education in reference to the position of the Galway College of the National University in his speech in the Dáil last Friday. This speech, when read in the newspapers, caused grievous disappointment to very many people in the West whom I have the honour to represent in this Dáil.  Additional grants were promised by the Minister for Education for the Colleges of Dublin and Cork, but no provision, beyond a vague promise, was made for University College, Galway.  Since the time of the passing of the Universities Act the position of Galway as regards funds was far inferior to that of Dublin and Cork.  We in the West have no objection to more money being given for university education, and we think that Dublin and Cork are entitled to these grants; but what we do object to is that the disproportion between the relative positions of Dublin, Cork and Galway should be made more marked. In Galway we also have facilities for agricultural education, and I regret <Col N="1616" /> very much that an Agricultural Faculty has not been established in Galway as well as in Dublin and Cork, because we have within an easy distance of University College, Galway, a model farm at Athenry.  As I said when speaking in Irish, there is no man in this Dáil who has been more closely connected with higher education and the universities than the Minister for Education.  He was for some time the honoured representative of the National University in this Dáil, and at the present time he represents the County Clare, one of the six counties in the West that go to support University College, Galway.  I am not a believer in Six-County Government, but if the continued neglect and indifference shown as regards the position of University College, Galway, is to go on, we, the representatives of these six counties, must take seriously into consideration the question of establishing a Six-County Government for the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in the West of Ireland, have a distinct civilisation and distinct culture as compared with the people of Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland, and although some people may smile at that civilisation, we are not prepared to barter it for your civilisation, and we are determined to maintain our position in the West.  Additional funds should be placed at the disposal of the Western University College.  Deputy O'Connell said in his speech from the Labour Benches, on Friday, that Galway was in a very favoured position as regards teaching the Irish language, because it is situated in the heart of the Gaeltacht.  That cannot be said for any of the other university colleges, and I expect that any Government that will be elected in Ireland will do what it can towards fostering and spreading the Irish language.  One of the best ways it can do that is to help higher education in the West.  The many students at present attending Galway College would, if by any accident the college were done away with, not go to Dublin, Cork, or the other colleges, so that they would be lost in the field of higher education.  It seems to be apparent from the speech of the Minister that his Ministry stood for a policy of centralisation in higher education.  If <Col N="1617" /> that is their policy, why do they not begin with Dublin and leave the Western College alone?  The Western Deputies representing all parties in this House will call hands off University College, Galway, unless the hands are friendly ones.  We know the position the college has taken up in Irish public life and its close association with Galway and the West.  We expect great things from the Minister for Education, and we hope before this debate closes that he will be able to give a definite assurance of strengthening the position of Galway University College, and bringing it into line with the other university colleges.</P>

      <P>Very well.  Some years ago a German veterinary surgeon came across here to investigate the cause of scour in calves.  I hold that if sufficient money was placed at the disposal of the College in Ballsbridge there would be no need to get outside experts at all.  These things could be conducted in the laboratories there. If research were made in the foot-and-mouth disease its origin would probably be discovered and a remedy found and the country would be saved millions of pounds.  I maintain that the Veterinary College has been starved by the Department of Agriculture, because sufficient money has not been expended on the college or the college laboratories.</P>

      <P>I wish to say with regard to this Vote that we in Connaught take the deepest possible interest in the welfare of Galway College. We are aware of the good work done there on a very small income; in fact, so good is the work and so small is the income that the Minister for Finance might be tempted to say that the best way to get work out of the College is to starve the staff.  You cannot expect Galway College to continue doing excellent work on only one half or one-third the income which the other colleges get.  Galway College has, in fact, been treated in a very mean way in the matter of income.  I am sure that even the Minister himself will admit that.  When that point is pressed on the Ministry of Education, and when they are asked to give a generous endowment to Galway College on behalf of the people of Connaught, they say that they do not and need not be expected to finance a college in Connaught in the same way as they would finance one in Dublin, both to carry out the same all-round programme. There may be something in that point, but they have a college there with splendid buildings and grounds, and if their predecessors of foreign Government thought that the educational needs of Connaught deserve that college, and gave it an endowment, I am sure that we can look for better terms from a home Government.  I, for one, have no doubt that Galway will, on reconsideration by the Ministry, get <Col N="1619" /> better terms than it has got at present. It is half-starved at present.  We are told that Galway College has not a proper programme, and that the whole question of university training in the Saorstát must be looked into.  This matter is causing the greatest uneasiness and unrest in Galway College, not alone amongst the staff, but amongst everyone in Connaught interested in the college.</P>
      <P>Galway is ready to do its share of the university work of the Saorstát if it is given its fair share.  It has a staff that can compare with any staff, and what we say with regard to Galway College is this, that its future is left in the gravest doubt, and that it should have some assurance that its future is to be secure.  If there is to be a Commission on this question the sooner it sits the better, and the sooner the future of Galway is marked out the better.  At present there is great uneasiness in the province, and I would urge the Minister to say something reassuring on that point when he comes to reply.  The present state of Galway College is a very unsatisfactory one.</P>

I took part in the discussion, but what did take place was that Deputy Magennis and Deputy Thrift came to the Dáil, and told us they had been present at a discussion between the Minister and certain members of the staff, I think of the professorial staff, and that the professorial staff were satisfied with the promises of the Minister with regard to arrangements made for their work, and that the Minister had promised the professorial staff that any changes that were made would not take place until consultations took place with those interested in the College of Science.  I am not quite sure that the Minister did not on that occasion deny the statement made by the two Deputies to whom I have referred. I am quite sure that if the Minister did not deny the statement on those occasions he is quite prepared to carry out the promise which he gave.</P>

      <P>I did not use the word Commission or Committee of Inquiry. I used the word, I think, Deputy Thrift and Deputy Magennis had used, namely, consultations with those interested in the college.  During the speech of the Minister for Education he referred to matters with which I am quite in agreement.  He told us that his policy was not to impair in the future the educational value of the College of Science in this country.  He told us his policy was to change the conditions of the past in carrying out the work, and that that is to be done by the abolition <Col N="1621" /> of the College of Science, whose work is to be passed over to the University Colleges of Dublin and Cork, and he pointed out that the College of Science was doing a kind of university work with limitations in its scope, and pointed out that the State could not support an incomplete from of university education in this case.  With that also I am quite in accord.  He pointed out also that his Department was to develop all the economic functions of national life.  He has urged on the Minister for Finance the necessity of relieving the needs of the University of Dublin on previous occasions.  He desired on his part that no Irish student could get a better education than he could get in Ireland.  With that I am also in accord.  He said that the National University represents the agricultural community of the country. I am not in entire accord with this statement.  I partially agree with it.  I think I am right in stating that there has always been a fair number of the agricultural community, who were anxious and willing in the past to go to Trinity College, and I think will probably be willing to pass through Trinity College in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take a little exception to the statement that the National University alone represents the agricultural community of the country.  He spoke about the co-ordination and amalgamation of the work, and pointed out that by passing over the College of Science to the University Colleges in that way they would bring the National University within the needs of the economic life of the country by establishing a fully-equipped Faculty of Agriculture in Dublin and Cork.  While the Minister was making the statement it was clear to me that he meant to pass on to the University Colleges the endowment or money spent on the College of Science so as to place University Colleges on a sounder financial basis.  Now, with that statement and that policy I also have no fault to find.  At the same time I would like to say that we were not discussing altogether the financial status of this or that university.  What was before us was rather the education of the agricultural community, I take it.  The point, therefore, is, whether the educational facilities offered to the <Col N="1622" /> agricultural community will be improved by passing the College of Science over <i>in toto</i> to the National University.  Let me say that, in my opinion, what we want, as far as education is concerned, is research, very particularly research that will be done in the college laboratories.  This research work can, in my opinion, be as well done in the University Colleges as it could have been done in the College of Science.  But we want more than research work.  We want experimental work to be done in the model farms or in the fields, and then we want, in my opinion, the application of the work done in research and the experiments made in the fields.  We want that brought to the knowledge of the farming or agricultural community&mdash;that is to say, the application of the knowledge gained from research and from the experiments in the field.  We want that conveyed in the readiest and easiest way to the agricultural community.  Now, I have a very strong feeling that in catering for university education, as far as the agricultural community is concerned, we are perhaps going beyond what is in the best interests of the agricultural community themselves.  I have a feeling that the better class of the farming or agricultural community are fairly well able to give educational advantages to their sons and daughters. But I feel that what we want in this country is the education of the sons and daughters of the smaller farmers. We may bring to the larger farmers the result of the research and experimental work, but if we pass over the small farmers who form the larger part of the population of the country, then, I think, we are doing an injustice to this class of the community.</P>
    <P>What I would like to impress upon the Minister is the necessity of what was alluded to a few moments ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce namely, that we must elaborate a good deal more the teaching that is going to be done in the Model Farms. Now, as regards the College of Science, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that the entire buildings, as far as he knows, are to be handed over to the University College, Dublin.  I want to point out that the building and lighting of the College <Col N="1623" /> of Science cost £170,000.  Another £100,000 was spent on the equipment of the institute and the purchase of land for the building.  That is to say, that even without the instruments or appliances that were put in, £270,000 worth of property are to be handed over to University College.  In addition to this grant of £270,000 worth of buildings, there is also, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out, going to be handed over a yearly endowment of £40,000. Now, the Minister, I expect, would interrupt me when I made that statement, because there has been some little confusion with regard to the staff.  The professional staff of the College of Science are civil servants, and, I take it, they will not be transferred to the University College.  I take it when the change is made these professors will be pensioned, and that the pensions will not be paid out of this grant that was made to the College of Science, but will come upon the Central Fund.  I do not know how many of the staff are civil servants or how many will pass over in that way. There is £28,000 set aside for the salaries of these professors, and there must be a very large amount of this money that would be capable of being passed over for the furnishing of the professorial and teaching staff of the agricultural department that will be established in University College.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt Deputy Craig, as I suffered many interruptions myself, but I did distinctly say there would be about £5,000 their money; the rest was earmarked and I had no conception of pensions being paid out of the Central Fund after the money set aside for salaries had been contributed to the University.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there would be a large number, unless the Minister says they are going to take over the professorial staff in connection with the University College.  If they are not going over with the College of Science, then, I take it, like other civil servants they will receive their pensions, and that, to my mind, will relieve the grant that is given <Col N="1624" /> annually towards their salaries.  I regret very much that the University of Dublin, which had maintained for a number of years a fully-equipped agricultural college, and even afterwards an agricultural college which put the students through two or three of their years, so that these students could pass on and get finished in the College of Science, will now lose that opportunity.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible to make any arrangement by which students would go for, say, a couple of years to Trinity College and then pass on to University College for the finishing of their course.  I wish to say that I, for one, am extremely pleased that University College is going to get this grant of a building worth over a quarter of a million of money, and that they are also going to receive this annual endowment, the sum of which we are not certain about at present.  In no way do I grudge University College this grant.  I alluded to the fact that a certain number of students passed through Trinity College, and I regret that it has not been possible to give a sufficient annual grant to Trinity College to allow these students to have the full curriculum in the college, because I feel sure a certain portion of the agricultural community would still prefer to pass through Trinity College than any other.</P>

I put the question the last day to the Minister for Agriculture, and he did not answer it.  I suggested, for instance, that the farmers, through their organisations, would be interested in this matter, and I asked the Minister whether he consulted the farmers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do blame the Government for the two years' delay in coming to a decision on the matter. I think it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who used, as an argument, that in transferring this to the university they were doing a sort of levelling up.  It seems to me that they have gone a very strange way about it. They purport to be removing a disparity, but as between the different colleges of the National University they are creating a very great disparity.  We have heard what Deputy O Máille and Deputy Sears have said about Galway. It is proposed in order to make suitable provision for the National University to transfer to it the buildings, the funds, and the endowment of the College of Science.  But it is proposed only to transfer those to Cork and Dublin. That is the proposal, as I understand it.  I want to know why Cork and Dublin only?  Why should not Galway get its share of what is going? Why are Cork and Dublin selected and why is Galway left out?  No explanation of that has yet been forthcoming, although three Ministers have spoken on the matter.  What was the basis of selection?  As between the three colleges, Galway was undoubtedly the one for which least provision was made. <Col N="1626" /> All we are promised, so far as Galway is concerned, is an inquiry.  But I should say we are to have a little more. We are told that when the Votes for universities come on we will find that nothing will be taken from us.  I suppose we ought to be thankful for that. To my mind, it is like the story of the wolf and the lamb.  We should be grateful for not having our head cut off.</P>

      <P>I do not want to deprive the Deputy of a good debating point, but that statement should be taken in its context.  The Minister for Education referred to a suggestion which had been made that something was to be taken from Galway and somwthing else given in substitution. I said that the Vote for the Universities would prove that that suggestion was not correct.  I do not want to put that forward as benevolence; it is merely justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>All I wish to say is, that we are thankful that we are to be left what we have got.  Agricultural faculties are to be established, and I gather from the Minister that this will mean the provision of agricultural farms in connection with Cork and probably in connection with Dublin. I think it was mentioned by Deputy O Máille that there is a farm which could be used in connection with Galway.  There is no explanation forthcoming from the Ministerial Benches as to why agriculture should not be specially provided for in the Western College.  Agricultural pursuits, as practised in the West, are very different from the type of agriculture practised, say, in the South of Ireland.  I think it might be well if <Col N="1627" /> the conditions suited to that particular type of agriculture in the West were taken note of.  As I said the last day in connection with the College of Science, I am in agreement with the general principle enunciated by the Minister of having the work which was done in the College of Science done in connection with the University.  But I do not think that after two years they should come along with terms of inquiry with regard to one of the colleges and face us with an accomplished fact so far as the others are concerned, apparently without inquiry.  That is what I think the Government are to be criticised for.  That is what I criticise them for&mdash;their treatment of the Western College and the fact that they have now admitted that an inquiry is necessary.  Inquiry is necessary as far as Galway is concerned, but evidently it was not necessary in order to enable the Government to come to a decision so far as Dublin and Cork are concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have very little to add to the speeches that were made by the other Deputies from the West on this question. But I certainly do claim that if the policy of the Ministry of Education is to Gaelicise the country, well, we must Gaelicise it, in my opinion, from the top, and not from the bottom. In Galway we have the real Gaeltacht, the most Irish-speaking district beyond all shadow of doubt in Ireland.  That is one point that has been made by Deputy O'Connell, and I should like to reinforce him.  The third year's teachers' course should be certainly concentrated in Galway College, because there you have an Irish-speaking district all round.  Fifty per cent., certainly forty per cent., of the people of the town of Galway are Irish speakers, but go half a mile outside the town on any side&mdash;to Moycullen, Barna. Castlegar, Claregalway, or any of those outside districts, and you are into <Col N="1629" /> the Gaeltacht.  If the policy of the Ministry is&mdash;and I have no doubt that it is&mdash;to Gaelicise education in this country, why should the teachers go to Dublin or to Cork or any other place when they have such an opportunity of learning Irish as they have in Galway?</P>
    <P>On the question of the College of Science, all I can say is that from all I have heard in the West&mdash;and I have been down all over the County Galway and I have also come into touch with the people in Mayo and Clare&mdash; the idea of transferring the College of Science to the National University has the hearty endorsement of the people. They recognise that the proper way to have applied science is through the university, and not through a college like the College of Science.  I have not quite made up my mind as to whether it would be advisable to have an agricultural faculty in Galway College, but I certainly would like to hear some reasons why it is not advisable. If I heard any tangible reason&mdash;and I think I have been here for the most <Col N="1630" /> of this debate and have not heard it&mdash; why there should not be a faculty in Galway, I certainly would not advocate that there should be; but I certainly have heard nothing yet that convinced me that there should not be. I think the position has now become clear, and I am quite sure that the Minister when he concludes the debate will set at case the grave doubts that have arisen in the minds of the people of the West of Ireland, and in the county of Clare, as to his intention as regards Galway University College.</P>

      <P>This case came before me on appeal in April, 1923, on the ground of age.  The claimant was recorded as 22 years of age when married on 9th February, 1880, and would, <Col N="1517" /> therefore, have been only sixty-five years old in February, 1923.  She was duly notified of the appeal.  The only evidence submitted in proof of her age consisted merely of informal written statements by four neighbours which could not be regarded as conclusive proof of age.  No affidavits were received. No allusion was made to the applicant's appointment as a monitress. In view of the marriage record and in the absence of more definite or conclusive evidence of age, the claim was disallowed on the 12th June, 1923.</P>
