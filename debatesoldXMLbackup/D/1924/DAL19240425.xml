      <P>I am aware that firearms were taken from people by Volunteers prior to the Truce, and that a number of such firearms have not yet been returned to their owners.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that Mrs. A. Repetto-Byrne, occupying tenant of premises at 29 Henry Street, Dublin, suffered serious hardship and financial loss owing to the destruction of the premises in 1916; whether it is a fact that the tenant, having already expended on partial rebuilding a compensation grant of £1,100, together with a further sum of £480, out of her own resources, would have been entitled <Col N="4" /> to a loan of £1,200 under the Dublin Reconstruction (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916, in order to complete the reconstruction of the premises, but was prevented from obtaining this because the British Postmaster-General purchased the premises in 1918 and as landlord opposed the loan; and whether, in view of the fact that the Irish Postmaster-General has since taken possession of the partly reconstructed premises and has collected the rent payable by a sub-tenant, and that as a consequence of the loss of the premises Mrs. Repetto-Byrne has suffered further financial loss, the Minister is prepared to take action, by way of ex-gratia grant or purchase of the tenant's interest or otherwise, as will prevent any technicality as to the rights of the Crown or the State operating so as to inflict hardship on this tenant, while all other tenants in the same area have received the full compensation for their losses to which they were entitled by law.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is the intention of the Government to maintain the application of the National Health Insurance Act to farm workers, in view of the fact that it is an opinion generally expressed by both farm workers and their employers that they would prefer to get outside the provisions of the Act, and if the Minister is aware that during the fight against the British forces farmers and workers were asked not to continue paying their contributions towards this fund, and if measures will be taken to prevent legal proceedings being taken against those parties who acted on the instructions of the then <i>de facto</i> Government.</P>

      <P>The Government is about to appoint an Inter-Departmental Committee of Inquiry into the working of the National Health Insurance Acts in the Saorstát, and the Deputy will have an opportunity of making out a case before the Committee for the exclusion of farm workers.  The present system of contribution is based on a flat rate for all workers, farm or otherwise, and the experience of the Irish Insurance Commissioners is that agricultural labourers draw as much in benefits as do other workers.  It is not correct to say that during the fight against the British, farmers and workers were asked to discontinue paying their contributions; on the contrary, during that period employers were directed to comply with the National Health Insurance Acts pending the formulation of a National Scheme.  It is not the intention of the Government to direct that no legal proceedings shall be taken against employers who have failed to comply with the Acts.  The decision of the Government as given <Col N="6" /> on more than one occasion, has been that all contributions due since December 6th, 1921, must be paid.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>The statute leaves it to the guardians to decide whether the provision for relief shall be made in or out of the workhouse.  The Commissioners are now in the same position as the guardians in that respect.  I am prohibited by Section 3 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1838, from interfering in particular cases for the purpose of ordering relief.</P>

      <P>I can give particulars only where my consent is required or where the allowances are disputed.  The principal cases disputed are those of the officers of Killadysert and Kilrush Unions.  As regards the former, a letter setting out the proposed superannuation awards was addressed on the 6th ultimo to the solicitor of the officers concerned, to afford him an opportunity of making any representations he considered necessary.  A reminder was sent on the 10th instant, but no reply has yet been received.  In the case of Kilrush difficulty has been experienced in collecting the appropriate accurate particulars, and I am in correspondence with the Board of Health in the matter.</P>

      <P>The undisputed awards of superannuation made before the passing of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, do not require my sanction, and payment in respect of them is entirely a matter for the County Council.

It is understood that the arrangement agreed to was to allow the clerk £60 a year for providing clerical assistance. The graded scales of salaries were designed to cover all expenditure from the rates in conducting the Council's clerical business, and a condition of their being applied was that temporary absences of permanent officials would not involve payments to substitutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of unemployment in the city is serious at present, and the passage of this Bill will help to relieve that.  Dublin has suffered its share in the recent turmoil, particularly in the way of destruction of property.  The destruction of property in Dublin ran into several million pounds.  Some of that property is of a kind that probably can never be replaced.  We cannot completely undo all that destruction, but we can see to it that whatever we do we will do well. Where it is possible to put things back as well as they were before, or where it is possible to improve upon them, we should not hesitate to do it.  Dublin in the old days was justly proud of her great central thoroughfare&mdash;one of the finest streets in Europe&mdash;and we should allow nothing to stand in our way in restoring it to its former proud position, whether by the straightening or widening of the street, or by controlling the general architectural design of the buildings that are going to take the place of the old buildings.  Where we can effect an improvement in the street, we should do so.  It is with that object in view that rather wide powers are being given to the Dublin Corporation. Power is given to acquire the sites of destroyed property, not only along the borders of streets which it is proposed to widen, but also at the back of those sites, in order that lots of a suitable size and shape for re-building may be acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object of the Bill is to compel the owner, before going ahead with the building, to send a copy of his plans to the City Architect, who may require him to make such alterations as he deems necessary, in order to bring the building into harmony with the general <Col N="32" /> architectural design of the street. Power is given to intending builders to borrow money from the Dublin Corporation. The amount of interest charged shall not be more than ten shillings per cent. above what the Corporation can borrow the money for at that particular date, and the term of repayment shall not be a longer term than that for which the Corporation itself can borrow the money.  Where an owner neglects to rebuild for a period of two years, the Corporation will have power to sell the property by public auction, with a proviso for re-building, provided a suitable price is obtained. Sites of destroyed property will be exempt from the payment of rates up to the 31st March, 1925.  This exemption will not apply in the case of temporary buildings.  There is also a provision dealing with licensed premises, that damage to, or destruction of, such premises will not be held as a bar to any renewal of licence.  These are the main provisions of the Bill.  It is not necessary to discuss them in any great detail, because the Bill is mainly a replica of the 1916 Act, which was introduced in the British House of Commons, and which was an agreed measure in that House.</P>

      <P>I am curious to know what the Minister has to say about this Bill in respect to its urgency.  I confess that I have not examined the Bill, but I was impressed by the Minister's statement that the chief feature about it was its urgency.  I gather that the reason why reconstruction has not been proceeded with up to now is that such a Bill as this had not been in operation. It is quite a long time since the destruction took place, and there have been very many demands made for the work to be begun.  Now we are told it is urgent, and that the Bill must be passed into law as an Emergency Bill. It would have been interesting to know from the Minister why this Bill was not brought forward earlier, and to assess the blame for the work not having begun earlier.  It seems now that the blame lies with the Department of Local Government for not having brought in this Bill six or twelve months ago.</P>

There are a great many interests concerned in reconstruction here in Dublin, and very many proposals were made.  This Bill is a Bill which has come to us practically from the Dublin Corporation, and we received it only a very short, time ago.  We had to consult with a great many different agencies before we could agree to introduce the measure.  Of course this Bill will facilitate building, but it is not the only obstacle to re-building in Dublin, as I am sure Deputy Johnson is aware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. E. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. E. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement which I am now about to make to the Dáil has in view primarily the proposals which, subject to the approval of the Dáil, it is intended in due course to embody in the Finance Bill.  These proposals will be concerned essentially with the taxation to be borne by the country during the coming year, but in order that they may be seen in their proper perspective it will be necessary to look at them in the light of the general financial situation.  That situation I will consequently touch upon in the first instance, and I will begin with a brief survey of the finances of the State during the year ended on the 31st of last month.</P>
      <P>At the opening of the financial year 1923-24 there was a cash balance in the Exchequer amounting to £197,000, and there was a total State debt of £2,531,000.  At the close of that year and the opening of the present financial year the Exchequer balance was £3,395,000 and the State debt had grown to £13,912,000.  At the end of the year, therefore, as compared with the beginning the cash balance had increased by £3,198,000, and the debt had increased by £11,381,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total revenue received into the Exchequer during the year was £31,414,000.  The corresponding figure in the original Budget estimate put <Col N="34" /> forward a year ago was £26,096,230. As was explained at that time by the President, who was then Minister for Finance, Saorstát Eireann had not previously been administered as a separate fiscal unit, and exact data on which to base reliable estimates of revenue were not in existence.  In the light of later information I was able to indicate to the Dáil in my statement of the 2nd November last that the tax revenue of the year would substantially exceed the first Budget estimate, and this has, in fact, occurred.  The actual increase of tax revenue beyond the figure given in the original estimate is £4,765,500.  Income tax, owing largely to the efforts made to collect arrears, is two millions in excess of the estimate of a year ago.  The Excise duty on beer shows an excess of £1,600,000.  The greater part of the latter is in the nature of a windfall, attributable to the fact that drawback on exports in this case did not commence to be payable until some time after the beginning of the financial year.  This has been an advantage of a kind that cannot occur again.</P>
    <P>The Excise duty on home-made spirits was £330,000 below the Estimate. Customs duties, taken as a whole, have produced over £900,000 beyond the original Estimate, the main increases being&mdash;Tobacco, £512,000; New Import Duties (including Customs duty on Motor Cars), £258,000, and Imported Wine and Spirits, £386,000.  The Customs duty on Sugar was £300,000 below the Estimate and on Tea £158,000 below the Estimate.  The Motor Vehicle Duties, the equivalent of which is payable to the Road Fund, exceeding anticipations by £145,000.  Miscellaneous Revenue in the aggregate, although affected by some disturbing factors as regards details, was approximately in accordance with the Estimate.  On the whole, and especially in view of the conditions through which the country has passed, there is every reason for satisfaction with the proceeds of the revenue in the year in question.</P>
    <P>Turning now to expenditure, the Estimates passed by the Dáil for the year 1923-24, both original and supplementary, covered a net total amount of <Col N="35" /> £45,750,817.  This amount is over ten millions in excess of the sum which it actually became necessary to issue from the Exchequer to meet corresponding expenditure.  In general the Exchequer issues have approximated fairly closely to the estimated requirements, and the unused balance of ten millions is attributable largely to two Votes in which the course of events could not have been foreseen.  These Votes were Property Losses Compensation and Land Purchase Annuities. In the case of the Compensation Vote the hearing of applications under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act did not begin as early as was expected when the Estimate was prepared, and in consequence the awards under that Act, except to a small extent, did not mature for payment within the year 1923-24.</P>
    <P>Also the awards made by the Compensation Commission in dealing with pre-Truce damage did not involve such large payments as was at one time expected, while in cases where payment is due only on fulfilment of a building condition applicants have been slow in taking steps to carry out this condition. There has in consequence been a margin of £6,380,000 on the Compensation Vote of the year.  In the case of Land Purchase Annuities the law in force at the commencement of the year contemplated that the annuities would come into the Exchequer as revenue and be issued through a Vote to the appropriate Land Purchase fund.  The provision of new machinery by the Land Act passed during the year has removed the need for this Vote, and caused the greater part (about £2,000,000) of the money provided in the Vote to remain unissued.  Next to these two principal items the chief saving was £300,000 in the Vote for Local Government, owing to grants for Housing Schemes not falling due for payment to the full extent within the year. Besides Exchequer issues of £35,413,156 for Supply Services there were payments of £3,226,199 for Central Fund Services.  The latter figure is approximately in accord with the original estimate after allowance is made for the fact that the payment to Great Britain <Col N="36" /> in respect of the attributable revenue of 1922-23 was £300,000 less than the original British claim.</P>
    <P>Taking Supply Services and Central Fund Services together, and leaving aside capital issues for the Telegraph Acts, the Unemployment Fund or repayment of debt, the total expenditure of 1923-24 may be taken as £38,639,355.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the revenue of 1923-24 was about £31,414,000 and that the expenditure was about £38,639,000. These figures reveal a deficit of £7,225,000 on the services to which they relate.  The whole of this deficit is less than the net issues during the year for compensation and for what may be regarded as the abnormal fraction of the Army charge.  This is a result which I am sure the Dáil will regard as satisfactory and tending to confirm the favourable estimate, which has steadily been growing in responsible quarters, of the financial position of this country.</P>
    <P>In using this result, however, for testing the true budgetary position for the present and the future, it is necessary to beware of drawing conclusions which might be unduly optimistic.  The revenue figures which I have given for 1923-24, although quite accurate in every respect, have been abnormally inflated from various causes, some of which I have indicated, and they do not afford a reliable indication of the probable revenue of 1924-25.  This will be seen to be reflected in the Estimates of Revenue for 1924-25, already published. Moreover, on the expenditure side the annual charge in respect of borrowing, which will be substantial in 1924-25, and later years, had not yet begun to be an appreciable burden in 1923-24.</P>
    <P>I come now to the debt position during 1923-24.  At the beginning of that year the total debt of the State amounted to £2,531,000, of which over £2,000,000 was in the form of Irish Free State Bills.  A further amount of £385,500 was in the form of Ways and Means Advances, so that we may be said to have had almost entirely a floating debt at that time.  The problem of borrowing to finance Exchequer requirements was the leading financial question which the Government had to <Col N="37" /> face during the year.  It is not necessary for me now to dwell upon the manner in which the problem was met. It is sufficient to note that the succesful flotation within the country of a National Loan of £10,000,000 on terms at least as favourable to the State as those enjoyed by several long-established Governments of good financial repute, was an event which deeply impressed financial circles throughout the world, and placed the credit of this country on an impregnable basis.  The full amount of the loan at 95 per cent. was received into the Exchequer during the year.</P>
    <P>Before the issue of the National Loan steps had been taken to raise funds by the issue of Savings Certificates. These Certificates began to be issued during July, and had brought in the substantial subscription of £950,000 by the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>Apart from borrowing to meet the cash requirements of the Exchequer, a beginning has been made with the creation of debt in the form of 5 per cent. Compensation Stock, which is issued in part discharge of awards under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act. That is awards in respect of furniture, fittings and things other than the actual buildings.</P>
    <P>The details of the total debt of £13,912,000 outstanding on 31st March last are as follows:</P>

    <P>*Against this debt may be set off an asset of £877,700, representing advances which the Unemployment Fund is liable to repay to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the figures for 1924-25, which were circulated before the adjournment.  There is little to be said by way of comment upon the published Estimates of the probable Revenue of 1924-25, except to observe that <Col N="38" /> they have been prepared upon the basis of existing taxes, and have taken no account of the proposals which it will be my duty to lay before the Dáil in the later part of my statement.  So far, however, as this point is concerned I may perhaps anticipate matters by stating that, while the existing basis of taxation will be modified by these proposals as regards the distribution of duties under their several heads, yet in the aggregate the result of the new proposals will be such as to leave the total published Estimate of Tax Revenue substantially unaltered.</P>
    <P>The published figures represent the best attempt which can be made to forecast the situation during the current year after making full use of the data yielded by the experience of the past year, and allowing for such factors as general observation of the economic position appeared to require.</P>
    <P>The total tax revenue is expected to amount to £22,543,000.  The non-tax revenue has been reckoned at £5,144,300 &mdash;both heads of revenue together yielding a total of £27,687,300.</P>
    <P>The estimates of expenditure which have been circulated indicate a need for providing £31,873,791 in respect of Supply Services, and £4,472,482 in respect of Central Fund Services&mdash;that is, a total under the two heads of £36,346,273.  This is not the occasion for the review of the estimates of expenditure, but I think it well to mention that the provision for the Army in 1924-25 is about £4,000,000&mdash;that is, six-and-a-half million less than in 1923-24, and that the provision for Property Compensation is reduced by three millions.  The expenditure on Central Fund Services includes full provision for the Sinking Fund on the National Loan.</P>
    <P>For determining the relation between revenue and expenditure in 1924-25 the two main figures are the revenue of £27,687,000 and the expenditure of £36,346,000.  These indicate a cash de ficit for the services concerned amounting to £8,659,000.  If the entire charge for Personal and Property Compensation and the abnormal part of the Army charges are set-off against this figure there would remain only a deficit of about £500,000.  This, so far as it goes, tends <Col N="39" /> to indicate that the Budget position is not unsatisfactory in a certain sense. As, however, I indicated earlier, when speaking of 1923-24, great caution must be exercised about drawing inferences from these figures.  On the revenue side the income-tax collectable still includes a large amount of arrears, and there is reason to fear that the productivity of taxes generally may be adversely affected for some time to come by the prevailing depression.  The Excise duty on beer, which is one of the most important sources of revenue, has already begun to show signs of a trend of this kind.</P>
    <P>Again, on the expenditure side, the debt charge has not yet reached its full development, and in particular a substantial addition to the burden under this head may be expected through the creation of Compensation Stock in settlement of awards under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Act.  That Stock will be redeemed in ten years by annual drawings.  Again, no allowance has been made in the figures I have given for inevitable additions to expenditure by reason of supplementary estimates and for new charges likely to result from legislation now going through, or soon likely to be introduced. On a fair view of the whole situation it is, I think, permissible to claim that with a little further progress such as it should be quite feasible to attain in administrative economies, the Budget would be brought within measurable distance of equilibrium.  Even this, however, with a distinct gain from the purely financial point of view, is not, in the opinion of the Executive Council, the ultimate goal to be aimed at.  It is further necessary in the economic interest of the country to reach a stage at which the present excessive burden of taxation can be eased, and the productive industries of the country thereby afforded a fair opportunity of developing at home, and competing on level terms with rivals in outside markets. Retrenchment is the only means that at present promises a fair prospect of bringing relief from the weight of taxation that now presses on the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> It is plain that in the present circumstances it is not possible to remove any of the existing burden of taxation. The Executive Council have, however, given anxious consideration to the question how far they could, consistently with this general attitude, assist the economic interests of the country by readjustment of the existing fiscal system, and they have determined to propose to the Dáil certain measures designed to that end.</P>
    <P>As stated by the late Minister for Industry and Commerce in a debate which arose out of the reports presented by the Fiscal Inquiry Committee, the Government takes up no doctrinaire attitude on the question of Free Trade and Protection.  It regards the matter as one of expediency which may be variously decided in different circumstances.  During the past year it has been incessantly urged upon the Executive Council that a large number of protective duties, amounting, in fact, to a general tariff, should be imposed for the purpose of supporting the many industries in the Saorstát which are suffering acute depression, and of relieving the widespread unemployment which exists.  The Executive Council is convinced that the matter is one on which the country should feel its way. We are not prepared, on the one hand, to recommend anything approaching a general tariff, with the substantial rise in the cost of living which would inevitably follow, bringing other and serious economic problems in its train. Neither are we prepared to let the industrial drift continue, and content ourselves with preaching efficiency and the virtues.</P>
    <P>After careful consideration we have decided, as the best means of dealing with the situation which exists, to recommend to the Dáil the imposition of certain duties which will give us a limited but sufficient experiment in the use of a tariff for the stimulation of Irish industry.  By the end of a year we will have a clearer idea of the efficacy and all the reactions of protection as applied to Irish conditions than could ever be obtained by mere discussion and speculation.  Actual experience will teach us what fiscal policy is suited to our conditions.  We propose <Col N="41" /> to deal with only five categories of goods.  We think the number is sufficient for a trial.  We have a Customs staff which was organised only a year ago, and only a portion of that staff consists of experienced men.  A number of others have very little experience. Practically no Customs work was done in this country until last year.  The men who have been administering that service have been working at high pressure all the time, and they have been working without leave.  These proposals that we make now will cast a very heavy burden upon them, because, even with the recruitment of staff, it will be some time before new men are efficient and are able to relieve those who have been continuously working, carrying on under great difficulties, and working extremely hard since the inception of our own Customs system.  It would be impossible to have a greater number of new duties than are now proposed collected without grave delays, dissatisfaction, and dislocation of business.  I think at this point I should say that the Customs staff during the past year have done very good service to the State by the way in which they carried on under the difficult circumstances that existed.</P>
    <P>We have selected as the main case for the proposed experiment the Boot and Shoe Industry.  This industry is one which should flourish in the Saorstát; and if it were strongly developed should lead to the resurrection of an important tanning industry which would link it with the main agricultural industry of the country.  At present the manufacture of boots and shoes is carried on to some extent in the Saorstát, but about fourteen-fifteenths of our requirements are imported, the annual value being over £2,000,000.  The proposal I have to make to the Dáil in this case is that there should be imposed a Customs duty of 15 p.c. <i>ad valorem.</i>  It will be readily seen that with the limited capacity of Irish boot factories there can hardly be any great diminution of the importation of boots and shoes in the present financial year.  A considerable time must elapse before Irish factories can extend their plant and increase their output, or before British boot firms, which might desire (like British <Col N="42" /> tobacco firms) to retain Irish trade, will find it possible to acquire sites and erect factories and plant and begin to produce on any considerable scale.  Consequently, it must be anticipated that the duty will yield a large revenue in the present year, and must even continue to yield substantially for a further period.  It is proposed, therefore, that the possibility of an increased burden on the taxpayer should be obviated by a reduction of the duty on another necessary commodity which is already taxed.  In addition to the tax on foot-wear it is intended to impose protective duties on (1) confectionery, (2) soap and candles, (3) glass bottles, that is, black or green bottles, (4) commercial motor bodies.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that sugar confectionery should be subject to Customs duty at a flat rate of 3 3-5d. per lb., and that preparations made from or containing cocoa or chocolate in any form should be subject to Customs duty at a flat rate of 6d. per lb.  As confectionery is largely a luxury commodity, this tax is one which is not open to objection from any angle.  It will, moreover, relieve the Revenue Authorities of a great deal of troublesome work which was thrown on them when confectionery was taxed on its sugar or cocoa contents.  Even if no experiment in Protection had been determined upon it is possible that some such tax as this might have been proposed for convenience of collection.  The new tax will give a measure of protection ranging from ½d. to 1¾d. in the case of sugar confectionery and from 2d. to 3 2-5d. in the case of cocoa preparations, that is, allowing for the tax on the raw materials. Deputies are, of course, aware that confectionery is already manufactured to a considerable extent in the Saorstát, but the imports are nevertheless large, and it is hoped that with the assistance of the duty now proposed firms already engaged in the industry here will expand their business and that outside manufacturers may possibly deem it advisable to establish factories within the country, so that an appreciable increase in employment may be provided.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the duty on soap and candles should be ten per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  If manufacturers and workers <Col N="43" /> are prepared to give a square deal to the general public practically all the soap and candles required in the Saorstát should be supplied from home factories at no added cost to the consumer. The value of these commodities imported annually is something like £340,000 to £350,000.</P>
    <P>The duty on black and green bottles will be 33? per cent <i>ad valorem.</i>  Bottle-making is a very old Irish industry which, because of the present unfair competition from certain foreign countries, seems to be on the verge of extinction. The Executive Council felt that in this limited trial of Protection the bottle-making industry might fairly be given an opportunity of getting on its feet again and perhaps extending its scope, especially as the duty now proposed will not afford any justification to retailers for increasing the price of porter or stout in such bottles.</P>
    <P>The tax on motor bodies will be 33? per cent. Chassis and vehicles designed for use in commerce or husbandry will be free of tax, as heretofore.  The tax will be on the body and parts of the body solely.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the revenue likely to be derived from the protective duties which I have outlined, is difficult to estimate, as apart from other considerations, the statistics of past imports of the commodities in question are not available in a sufficiently concise form on which to base calculations.  In no case, except that of boots and shoes, from which perhaps £250,000 might be expected this year, is the revenue likely to be substantial.  Next to boots and shoes, the Confectionery Duty should produce the largest yield, and the amount in that case might be something in the neighbourhood of £40,000.  In the aggregate not more than £300,000 to £350,000 can safely be anticipated, and this figure should, of course, undergo much contraction if the duties realise their protective object.  Having regard, however, to the possible immediate effect of the duties, the Executive Council have thought it right to afford relief from existing taxation by reducing the Tea Duty from 8d. to 5d. per lb., which, allowing for Imperial preference, means that most tea will be <Col N="44" /> 4?d. less than pre-war, when it was 5d. As tea is a valuable source of revenue, and particularly suitable to be the subject of indirect taxation, I am bound to put it on record at this point that, in the event of the new duties leading to any cessation of import of the commodities affected, and a consequent loss of revenue, it may become necessary at some future time, on budgetary grounds, to restore part, at least, of the tea duty which is now being remitted. However, that is a matter for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain a little further the effect of this reduction on tea?  Is it to apply all round, to Imperial preference tea, as well as outside tea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The duty on tea now is 8d.  Indian tea comes in on account of Imperial preference at 6? pence.  The 8d. tax is being reduced to 5d., and the other tax will be reduced accordingly to 4? pence.</P>
      <P>I now pass to a proposal of a somewhat different type, which will also have a certain protective effect.  At the present time the application of Imperial preference to the duty on unmanufactured tobacco enables such tobacco from British Colonies, like Nyasaland, to compete against homegrown tobacco in a manner which does not arise where manufactured tobacco is imported from countries like the United States.  The import of the tobacco enjoying this preference is, in comparison with other tobacco imports, comparatively slight in amount, but it, nevertheless, prejudices seriously the possibility of disposing in the market of home-grown tobacco at a price which would be remunerative to the grower and curer.  For some years the unsatisfactory position of the home-grower in this respect has been partly remedied by the grant of a State subsidy.  The Executive Council have now decided to propose that this subsidy should be discontinued, and that the preference afforded to Colonial unmanufactured tobacco should be abolished.  That gives the Irish grower a protection of about 1/6 per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A slight change, which has no protective significance, is proposed to be made <Col N="45" /> in the existing table water duties by altering the amount of Customs duty on sweetened table waters from 4d. to 8d. a gallon.  At the present time, while the Customs duty on sweetened table waters as such is 4d. a gallon, a further duty is charged in respect of the dutiable ingredient contained in the table water.  It is now proposed to simplify the position in this case by applying only a single Customs duty to the commodity at the rate of 8d. a gallon.  It will scarcely affect the position, except from the point of view of convenience.</P>
    <P>Considerable administrative difficulty is caused to the Revenue Service at the present time by reason of the excessive number of small parcels of dutiable goods imported into Saorstát Eireann. In the three months ended 31st January last, out of a total of 110,000 dutiable entries, the duty paid in respect of nearly 24,000 of them was less than 1s. in each case.  To obviate the need for assessing duty on small consignments of this kind it is proposed to endeavour to check the importation of such consignments by imposing a minimum charge of 2s. 6d. on every dutiable consignment. It will be seen that this proposal is not put forward for the sake of obtaining revenue, and it will probably, in fact, produce little yield because of the tendency which it will create for goods to be imported in larger consignments. An indirect effect of this proposal, which may be of advantage to trade in Saorstát Eireann, is that it will operate as an obstacle to retail trade in small parcels across the land or sea frontier.  Minor proposals as regards indirect taxation are that the excise duty on playing cards should be abolished, and that the Customs duty on chloroform, ether, and similar substances should also be abolished.  No revenue has ever been collected from playing-cards.</P>
    <P>The Safeguarding of Industries Act, of 1921, imposed duties on certain specified goods from foreign countries which were liable to be sold at prices below the home cost of production. Optical and scientific instruments have, under this enactment, been subjected to a tax of 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> to the prejudice of users in this country and without any appreciable <Col N="46" /> gain to the revenue.  The powers that are given under Part II. of the Act have not been found to be such as could be used with any advantage in the circumstances of Saorstát Eireann, and it is proposed that the whole Act should be repealed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A statistical tax of 6d. per individual consignment is proposed.  This tax, like the minimum charge of 2s. 6d. on small consignments of dutiable goods, is intended to discourage retail trade across the Customs frontier, to curtail the clerical and other labour at present involved for the Revenue Department and Statistical Section of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and to encourage retail distribution being carried out from within the Saorstát.  I might add that a statistical tax is at present imposed in several countries. The tax will be imposed on imports by sea and rail, but domestic articles bought by householders across the land frontier will be excluded.  The extent of the traffic in small parcels may be gathered from the fact that, according to figures for September last, 44.2 per cent. of the number of consignments imported by sea were under £10 in value; 45.2 per cent. of the number of consignments imported by rail were under £5 in value; and 55.4 per cent. of the number of consignments by road were under £3 in value.  The total number of entries of £1 and under in value by road and sea was 13,780 for a single month.  I may say that the extent to which imports are brought in in small parcels imposes a charge of almost £12,000 per annum, beyond what was anticipated, in connection with the compiling of our trade statistics.  The small parcel of very little value involves practically the same labour right through as a consignment of a thousand times that value.  It is difficult from every point of view, and it does seem to be a corollary of fiscal independence and the setting up of a separate Customs system, that this retail trade should be discouraged as being inconvenient and expensive to the State.  The imposition of this statistical <Col N="47" /> tax will involve certain changes in the Post Office charges.  It will be necessary to take steps to prevent the Post Office being absolutely flooded with a parcels trade.  It would not be a paying trade, and the terminal charges which it will be necessary to impose in connection with postal parcels will enable us to effect certain changes in the charges on home parcels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be collected by an adhesive stamp, which will amount to the value of 6d. for every item of Customs entry.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act of last year grants exemption from Saorstát Income Tax to incomes arising in the Saorstát and falling to charities in Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the 5th April, 1923.  The exemption was part of a reciprocal arrangement whereby the British Government gave a similar exemption to charities of Saorstát Eireann deriving any income since the same day from Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  It was not intended to agree to any renewal of last year's arrangement. The Executive Council, however, has been convinced that if the arrangement were not extended for another year, undue hardship would be inflicted upon a considerable number of Saorstát charities having investments in Great Britain and liable in the absence of such an arrangement to British Income Tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the duties under the head of Inland Revenue.  In regard to this no proposal of any far-reaching consequence will be brought forward. A couple of modifications are, however, suggested.  They will in effect lighten the charge upon individuals, but their object is not a reduction of taxation, but an increase in revenue.  We feel that from the ethical point of view it is quite correct that the heaviest burden of taxation should fall upon the rich, and that there should be no reduction of that taxation unless we can reduce taxation on the poor first.  However, <Col N="48" /> we propose changes which we believe will be beneficial to the Exchequer, will get an additional yield from Super-Tax, although they will lighten, as I said, the charge on certain individuals.</P>
    <P>At the present time the Super Tax is applicable by graduated rates to that portion of an individual's income which is in excess of £2,000.  It begins at 1/6 in the £ on the first £500 beyond £2,000, and gradually rises with the income by steps of 6d.  It is charged at the rate of 6/- in the £ on the excess above £30,000 income.  The number of persons in Saorstát Eireann paying Super Tax at the maximum rate, or at the rates immediately below it is, of course, extremely limited, and no great loss to the Revenue would be entailed by reducing the maximum rate from 6/- in respect of excess above £30,000 to 4/6. in respect of the excess above £8,000. On the other hand, it is anticipated that the change in Super Tax, together with the proposed change in Estate Duty, would lead to a number of wealthy taxpayers at present outside the Saorstát becoming residents, and probably domiciled within this country.  Even a very slight degree of success in this direction would give an appreciable increase of revenue.  At present the range of Estate Duty rises by graduation to a maximum of 40 per cent. on estates over two million pounds.  On estates over one million pounds the rate is 28 per cent.  It is about twenty years since any person died in Ireland leaving estate valued at one million pounds, and he was a resident in the Northern area.  The rate of duty on estates of half a million is 25 per cent.  The number of persons who have died in the area of Saorstát Eireann in recent years leaving estates of half a million has amounted to only about two or three. Accordingly there is no direct fear of a loss to the Revenue by reducing the maximum from 40 per cent. to 25 per cent; the rate of 25 per cent. being applicable to every estate beyond £450,000.  If the change induces even one millionaire to become domiciled in Saorstát Eireann, the advantage to the Revenue would be very substantial As a matter of fact, if we could only induce one millionaire to come here to <Col N="49" /> die, the advantages would be very great.  This concludes all the substantial changes that we propose to make. There are certain minor changes in details of the law, but these are the principal alterations.</P>
    <P>We last year adopted the British scheme of taxation which we found, without any alteration.  That system of taxation had been devised without any regard to the special needs and conditions of this country.  We are now setting about adapting that system and altering it to suit the requirements of the Saorstát.  We do not believe it is wise to make any sudden or any sweeping changes which would cause dislocation and probably a certain degree of economic instability.  We desire that we shall proceed cautiously, that we shall make the changes, that we shall test the powers we have got and use them as satisfactorily as they can be used for the country's good. There can be no doubt, speaking in general terms, that the systems of taxation which this country has lived under in the past have had a great deal to do with its economic backwardness. It might be difficult to attribute the causes to any particular tax, or form of tax, but we have had that one factor that these taxes were devised without regard to the requirements and without regard to any special effects they would have here.  From this time forward we may expect that the Budget and the system of taxation in Ireland will perhaps year by year differ more widely from that which they have in England and which is suited to British conditions.  I think that looking at our whole position from the financial and budgetary point of view that we have every reason to be satisfied and to be confident as regards the future.  The balancing of the Budget, we can at any rate clearly see, is a matter which we ought to be able to accomplish in the year upon which we are entering.  It ought to be possible without an increase in taxation if the taxes yield anything like their yield in the past, or the yield that is anticipated, having regard to the various factors to which I alluded, without any increase of taxation to balance the Budget this time next year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> I feel that the changes that we propose in regard to taxation will have a very important effect.  I believe they will, at any rate, destroy the apathy and do away with that lack of thought which exists very widely in the country in regard to economic and industrial matters.  I believe that they will indicate to those who may desire and who may be able to develop the country that their needs will have attention from the Government of the Saorstát, whatever that Government may be; that they can rely upon any changes that are consistent with the public benefit being made in the system of taxation in the country, and in the incidence of taxation to allow the development of the country to proceed unhindered.  It will be impossible, I am sure, for any Government to meet the demands of various people who are in difficulties, and I do not think it would be wise to have too much regard to individual applications, but we should try only to actually use our powers of taxation in such a way that the burden will not fall where it could least be borne, that it will not fall in such a way as to choke enterprise and to leave the country drift along without any industrial arm at all, depending entirely on its agriculture. We know that this country is an agricultural country.  We know that agriculture must be our main cry for the future and for the present, but we also must find some way of stopping the continual tide of emigration which has been going on.  We must find other activities and other opportunities for the young people of the country who cannot find a livelihood in agriculture. We must aim at doing what we can to develop those industries, particularly those industries that are directly or indirectly related to agriculture, and for which the country is fitted.  We have certain big industries in this country. There is no reason why there should not be many other big industries.  There are industries for which, perhaps, this country is unfitted, in which it could never succeed; there are many in which it might succeed.  It might be that the failure of industries to prosper might readily be laid at the door of those who are in charge of them; there might be inefficiency, there might be ignorance, <Col N="51" /> there might be apathy, there might be lack of enterprise.  We feel that the question is really up to us what are we going to do about it.  We feel that we should not be content with placing the blame, even if we know where the blame is due, but that we should use these fiscal powers, as other countries have used them, to benefit the whole State, taking care, at the same time, to proceed with all due deliberation and all due care, so that we shall not produce permanent injury of any sort, so that we will not let ourselves slide into some policy, and be unable to pull up if it is a wrong policy.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Dáil that the proposals that we make in regard to a trial of Protection are proposals that will commend themselves to the country; they are proposals which will let us see really what can be done.  They will enable us, when another year comes around, to talk with an amount of certainty, with an amount of knowledge, and with a degree of intelligent public opinion watching us that we cannot have at the present time.  They are so devised that they will not inflict, having regard to the big reduction in one duty, hardship, and will not result, certainly, in any appreciable rise in the cost of living.  I would commend them to the most sympathetic consideration of the Dáil.  I do not know whether the Finance resolutions have been circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall oppose this Resolution, partly on the grounds that this is camouflage, as anybody in reading the Resolution would consider that it was only concerned with dried fruits, which nobody takes much objection to, and partly on the grounds that there were certain recommendations made by the Fiscal Committee with regard to parts of motor cars.  These recommendations <Col N="55" /> have, apparently, been ignored by the Minister.  It was suggested that it was desirable to allow the import of parts of motor cars in order that an assembling trade might be created here in the Saorstát.  We know that in Cork such an assembling trade in the case of Ford motor cars has been created, and that it has succeeded in building up a very considerable industry and is giving a large amount of employment in Cork.  I think that that might be carried further.  There is a car in England, a popular car called the Morris-Oxford.  That car is not made in Oxford, it is only assembled there.  The engines are made in Coventry and the body in Birmingham.  The parts are put together in Oxford, and it is called a Morris-Oxford car.  I should like to see a Morris-Dublin or a Morris-Kilkenny car.  A continuance of these duties on parts of motor cars rather checks anything like that. Again, the Fiscal Committee made certain recommendations in regard to the parts of musical instruments, parts for the repairs of musical instruments, gramophones and things of that kind. All these things are hampered and checked, and will be more hampered and checked by the imposition of this tax, which amounts to a half-a-crown on every dutiable article coming in.  They entail great hardship on the average man, the man who takes his pleasure in the evening with a gramophone or things of that kind.  A duty on gramophone records is an unreasonable duty.  If music is of advantage to the State, and if it is an essential part of culture, as I believe it to be, we should encourage the popularising of music and the cheapening of music, and therefore the continuance of these duties, in opposition to the reports of the Government's own Committee, and without apparently any justification, or any argument on behalf of the Minister that they should be continued, should not be assented to by the Dáil.  He never referred to them in his Budget speech, but he has formally proposed this Resolution. Speaking for myself, if I find there is any support of my action in the Dáil on this, I shall go to a division against this Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Deputy Cooper said and to add this to it.  There has been a great deal of argument as to the incidence of the motor tax.  I think representations were made to the Minister which, I regret, have not apparently met with his approval.  I was hoping that the question of this motor tax generally would be gone into and that the Minister would have been able to put before us a satisfactory scheme by which the incidence of the tax might fall much more fairly according to the way in which the car is used.  Instead of a general tax on a car there is a great deal to be said for levying the tax in proportion to the use that is made of the car by means of petrol, for example.  Though there may be certain administrative difficulties in the collection of such a tax, I think the gain to the community from such a mode of taxation would be of quite sufficient magnitude to outweigh that difficulty.  I had hoped that the Minister would have referred to that point and had strong hopes that he would have been able to bring in a scheme to that effect before us.  Perhaps he will be able to tell us his reasons for not being able to accede to the representations which were made to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would help the Committee in coming to a judgment on this point by telling us what is the amount of the revenue derived from these duties, particularly on motor car parts and on musical instrument parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty derivable from the new taxes is £324,000.  Most of it, £256,000, comes from motor cars and motor car parts, but I could not give any figures for the parts alone. It seems to us that this is, in the main, something in the nature of a luxury tax.  It is certainly not a tax that bears very hardly on the poorest. The greater number of cars that come in are used in part, at least, for pleasure, and are something in the nature, even if they are a utility and a convenience, of a semi-luxury utility in the great majority of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, as I say, a good type of tax since we must have a tax.  I think it is <Col N="57" /> much better we should take duty off some articles of common use rather than off such an article as this.  If I felt we could afford to make sacrifice of revenue of anything like this amount, I would far rather consider such a thing as abolishing the tea duty altogether, or seeing whether we could not give some sort of reduction in respect of sugar. I am not very much impressed with the case made for the reduction or modification of the tax in this particular regard. The question of motor parts is one about which a good deal might be said. The industry in Cork is not an assembling industry.  It is really a manufacturing industry.  The parts are manufactured there, and I do not think there is anything to be said in that regard for taking the duty off parts.  I think, in fact, the opposite would apply.  We would probably, by taking the duty off parts, sacrifice a great deal of revenue, and give very little employment, because it would be possible to take out certain valuable parts, which might be fitted, without a great deal of trouble, into cars, and import them separately. In that way we would lose revenue and do very little in the way of promoting industry here.  As a matter of fact, there seems to be not very much to be said at the particular moment in favour of trying to encourage that industry. You could encourage others with less disturbing effects from the revenue point of view, and with a great deal less difficulty from the point of view of administration.  You would have cars coming in with certain parts taken out, and the question of valuation would be very difficult in those particular circumstances, if you were to have regard, not to the value of the individual parts that would compose the bulk of the car, but to the value of the car as it stood.  The same thing applies to musical instruments. A great proportion of the musical instruments are certainly not articles of absolute necessity, and any relief that would be given in that matter would prevent us giving a proportionate amount of relief to other articles to which it would be more desirable to give it.  We really felt, when considering this matter, that articles like tea and sugar ought to be the <Col N="58" /> articles to which relief would be given, and not those of the other type.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer my point at all.  I was not suggesting in any way a remission of taxation on motor-cars.  I accept the point of view that they are luxuries and liable to taxation.  I was not suggesting at all that the total amount of duty received by the State from motor-cars should be diminished.  The course I recommended would possibly have effected an increase in revenue from motor-cars.  The present incidence of taxation is such that the man who wishes to use his car for half an hour&mdash;</P>

      <P>I quite understand that, but what I have to say applies to this as well as to the other tax.

I think the argument is applicable to one case as well as to the other.</P>

      <P>I suggest that it would be hardly possible to arrange that Deputy Thrift, who pursues a peaceful and learned occupation, should pay a lesser tax on his tea than I pay on mine.  The same thing seems to be urged, in respect of motor-cars, that one man should pay less duty on his car than another.  The man who got in his motor free of Customs duty would be able to sell out and make a little on it.  I do not think you could possibly distinguish between individuals and classes in dealing with this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get back to Customs duty, and to the statement made by the Minister for Finance that he did not think a strong case had been put up in connection with the motor tax.  I agree with him that as strong a <Col N="59" /> case has not been made as might have been made, if this very important section had not been put in the second place in the Resolution.  We have dried fruits first, so that a casual observer would think the Resolution dealt only with dried fruits, and not with this taxation on imported motor-cars and musical instruments.  That is the reason we have not been able to make a strong case.  After all, we only got these Resolutions an hour and a half ago, and we had very little opportunity to frame a case in that time.  I was fully prepared to hear the Minister say that these things were luxuries.  I have been trying for a long time to find a true definition of &ldquo;luxury,&rdquo; and I have come to the conclusion that a luxury is whatever the Minister for Finance wants to tax.  No doubt we shall hear later that soap is a luxury.  In talking about motor cars, it should be remembered that quite a large number of men possess motor cars at present, and we may come to the condition of affairs which obtains in the United States, where the average workman has a little motor car in which he goes to work and which he parks outside the factory.  Even outside a motor car, musical instruments and the gramophone are signs of saving.  They indicate an attempt to make the home a little better, a little more cultured, and a little more artistic, and they are signs of a desire of parents to see that their children will have accomplishments that they themselves did not possess. I cannot help thinking that these duties are a backward step and are mistaken, particularly in so far as the small musical instruments and things like gramophone records are concerned.</P>

      <P>If these are luxuries, they are not luxuries to any great extent.  I would not oppose the Minister if he put on a sliding scale, and if he taxed a £60 or £80 piano more highly than he taxed the small <Col N="60" /> things.  But these are not only not taxes on luxuries but they are taxes which are troublesome to collect, because such things as gramophone records, which practically have to be up-to-date&mdash;dance music and so on&mdash;come in in very small quantities.  All these things involve an enormous amount of trouble and expense in tax collecting. I honestly think they are not worth all the time and trouble and expense involved in collection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor THRIFT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what I have to say is relevant.  I submit it to you in this way.  The outcome of my remarks would not lead to the difficulty which the Minister for Finance foresees, but it would lead to an abolition of the Customs duty altogether, and, therefore, I think it is relevant to this Resolution.  My suggestion is that the revenue rate for motor cars should not be raised by a Customs duty, but should be derived from the use of motor cars, and he should make that revenue equal at least to the amount which is at present derived from the Customs duty. I think it would be far fairer, and would not cost the State anything, and would be much more just and equitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I think, is another matter.  We have some of these difficulties in connection with the Road Tax, and I think that that is a tax really made for the use of cars.  I am happy to be able to inform Deputy Cooper that mouth organs are free.  The reason why these duties were brought in in one Resolution is that when they were first imposed they were brought in in one Resolution.  They were lumped together, but there is no reason why they should be lumped together in the future.  It was not done in that way for any deliberate purpose.</P>

      <P>Allowing for the dutiable charge on raw materials used by the home manufacturer the preference would range from a halfpenny a pound in the case of some sweets, sugar, and confectionery up to 1¾d. in other cases, according to the quantity of sugar employed in the manufacture.  The amount of protection given depends entirely on the quantity of sugar used. In the case of sweets of that sort constituted almost entirely of sugar, the amount will be small, not more than a halfpenny.  In other sweets it comes up to 1¾d.</P>

      <P>I think when the Minister mentioned this proposal in his opening statement he said that he regarded confectionery as a luxury. Now, he may regard it as a luxury. Personally, I regard it as a luxury. But I do think that, for young children, confectionery is not a luxury, but almost a necessity.  Sweets, having sugar in their composition, are a very essential portion of a child's food.  I regret, personally, that when the Minister was considering the reduction which he has brought about, and which I am very glad to see in the duty on tea, that he did not make some reduction in the sugar duty as well.  I think it would have been better even if he could have divided the amount of reduction between tea and sugar instead of having it all upon tea.  Now, in this resolution which we are discussing, certain kinds of confectionery are to be protected.  I do not know, and the Minister has not informed us, as to the extent of the importation into Ireland of the various forms of confectionery. Neither has he informed us in answer <Col N="64" /> to Deputy Johnson's question as to the estimated revenue which will be derived from this extra duty on these forms of confectionery.  I think that as far as I know it is fair he should inform the Committee upon these points.  As far as I am concerned, I would be inclined to oppose this resolution on the ground that confectionery is to my mind not a luxury for the growing youth of the country, and I would be in favour of a smaller reduction in the tea duty, with some reduction, at any rate, in the sugar duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a reduction in the sugar duty was, of course, considered.  But a reduction of a farthing a lb in the duty on sugar would cost the Revenue £200,000.  Now, a farthing reduction in the lb would be unlikely to be passed on to the consumer, and, especially, as sugar is a commodity in which there is a good deal of speculation and fluctuation of prices.  Even if we had made it a halfpenny in the lb. it would be to lose an amount of revenue greater than we expected, and it is even then doubtful if the consumer would benefit very much.  The amount of revenue involved in sugar is really too large to give any reduction in the present circumstances. In the case of boiled sweets the actual protection given to the Irish manufacturer will be only a halfpenny in the lb., so that really, speaking of children who eat sweets there should certainly be no increase in the prices of ordinary boiled sweets.  In fact, I anticipate this duty would enable the confectionery industry here to expand so as to supply the needs of the country.  The amount of revenue obtained during the coming year from this tax is estimated at £40,000.  That would depend upon the degree to which the Irish manufacturer will respond to the stimulus.  There may be a rapid increase in the manufacturing confectionery here, and the revenue may be less than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has given the Dáil sufficient information.  He speaks of a halfpenny in the lb. in boiled sweets as a protection.  I take it that that means that while there is a certain duty <Col N="65" /> charged upon sugar, there will be a certain higher duty charged upon manufactured boiled sweets.  To that extent there is protection upon the boiled sweets to the extent of a halfpenny or so.  Then we have in paragraph (2) &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;sugar confectionery&rsquo; means confectionery made from or containing sugar or other sweetening matter and not containing cocoa or spirits, and includes breads, cakes, cake mixtures, puddings and powders (other than medicinal powders) sweetened with sugar or any other sweetening matter except saccharin, and not containing cocoa, and also sweetmeats, caramel, jams, marmalades, jellies,&rdquo; and so on.  I do not know whether the Minister has at his command an analyst, but I suppose if he has, he would find that the analyst would tell him that the proportion of water in a lb. of certain jams is very high, and the proportion of sugar in that lb. of jam would be already taxed at the sugar rate.  Then I take it we have three and the three-fifth pence additional.</P>

Because this will mean that the price of jams and marmalade will be 1d. more.  The price of jams and marmalades is controlled by the importations of the British stuffs, so that the local manufacturer will merely increase <Col N="66" /> his price 1d.

I intend to vote against this resolution unless we get some guarantee that there will be some such reduction, even if it was only 1d. per lb., although it may cost the Exchequer £300,000 or £400,000.

      <P>There is a question I would like to ask the Minister.  Possibly it arises on this Resolution more than any other, as sugar is one of the important items in the manufacture of this article.  I am referring to coffee essence.  I do not see any reference to it in this Resolution.  Whether it is intended to deal with it otherwise I do not know.  I might remind Deputies that this matter has been before the Dáil on several occasions.  The position is that while this product can be imported into and purchased in Great Britain and in the Six Counties, it cannot be imported into the Free State, and is not obtainable.  I mean such a product as Camp Coffee.  As many Deputies are aware, this is a product of which in pre-Treaty days there was a considerable consumption.  When it was prohibited the matter was brought before the Fiscal Committee.  That Committee inquired very fully into the matter and recommended that it should be admitted under a tax.  That seemed a fair and reasonable recommendation. The matter was brought before the Minister on a previous occasion, and I think it will be the view of the Dáil that the recommendation of the Fiscal <Col N="68" /> Committee is one that should be adopted rather than exclude this particular commodity entirely.  I would be glad to know if the Minister has had time to give any attention to the matter, and if he will see how this grievance can be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension when he says that coffee essence can be imported into the Six Counties or Great Britain.  It cannot. We simply took over the prohibition that the British had imposed.  Camp coffee apparently is made in Great Britain, and can be sold anywhere in Great Britain and in the Six Counties. It is not made here and, consequently, it cannot be sold here.  On the other hand, there are coffee essences made here which could not be exported to Great Britain.  They would be prohibited. It seems to me that there is no reason for removing this prohibition. It would involve loss of revenue and trouble, and would give a set back to an industry which has developed here as a result of the prohibition&mdash;the making of coffee essences.  The taxation of coffee essences presents difficulties, and it is largely because of these difficulties that the prohibition was first put in force in Great Britain.  I expect that certain individuals have suffered as a result of the prohibition, but we would have other and more numerous individuals suffering probably by the removal of the prohibition at present.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, this particular Camp Coffee can be obtained quite easily in the Six Counties, and when those who are accustomed to use <Col N="69" /> it cross the border they cannot obtain it at all.  That, to my mind, is a grievance. I do not think that the answer of the Minister is satisfactory.  His idea is that there are small manufacturers of this commodity in the Free State.  I understand that the number of people engaged in the manufacture of somewhat similar commodities in the Free State amounts to the large total of 19, so that the industry could not be looked upon as a very important one in the Free State.  This is a specialty which has been manufactured for a considerable period, and has been used by a very large number of people.  I have heard from a great many sources that it is a very distinct grievance that people have not been able to obtain this Camp Coffee.  The matter was inquired into very fully by the Fiscal Committee, who recommended that it should be admitted into the Free State under a tax.  That is a proposal that the Minister ought to consider favourably. Possibly he was not in possession of the information which I am in possession of, that the total number of hands engaged in the industry at the moment in the Free State is nineteen.  That being so, possibly he will reconsider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has considered this Resolution in all its bearings.  Sugar and tea are consumed by the rich as well as the poor, but imported jam is almost altogether consumed by the working-people of the country.  The best jam is home-made jam, but it is only people of a certain position who can afford it.  They have the fruit, as a rule, and buy sugar, with which they make high-class jam. Imported jam is largely, if not exclusively, used by poor people.  They are not able to buy butter, so that jam is one of the principal foods used at breakfast and supper.  It is proposed to take 2½d. per lb. off the tea, but the duty on jam is being increased by one penny per pound.  I would like to know how many pounds of jam would be used in the ordinary home where one pound of tea is used.  Taking the two items together, I do not think the proposal means any boon to the workingman. I think it is the reverse, and that this is throwing dust in his eyes.  That <Col N="70" /> may not be the intention, but I think it will be the result.  I would like the Minister to consider all the implications of the Resolution, as I do not think it will mean what it appears on the surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I have no reason to believe that the result will mean any increase in the price of jam.  I believe there will be a very big increase in the production of jam and also in employment.  It is one of these industries that can be started on a comparatively small amount of capital. It does not require a very expensive plant.  I believe the resolution will not mean an increase of a penny per lb. in the price of jam.  It will mean an additional penny tax on imported jam, but not a penny increase in the retail price. It is one of these cases where the industry can expand rapidly, and I believe that it will certainly extend and give a considerable amount of employment. As a matter of fact, I believe that we will have outside firms coming in to hold their market here, as was the case with cigarettes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's certainty that there will not be an increase in the price of jam, it would be quite easy to arrange that there will be no increase.  I think the opposite, that there will be an increase in the price.  The whole history of trade in the past confirms the belief that there will be an increase, at least, equal to the total amount of the duty. I am in agreement with Deputy Gorey as to the inadvisability of taxing jam at all.  It is really a staple article of food, and one that is very important for the poor people.  I am pretty certain that the actual tax taken off tea will be more than imposed on the people by the tax on jam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the way this discussion is proceeding. We are expected to discuss details of these various Resolutions and then go on to the general question.  After <Col N="71" /> all, nearly every question that is raised with regard to the new duties, at any rate, will have to be discussed in respect to the general principle.  I feel that the Minister is not helping the Dáil sufficiently in his explanation of the effects of these Resolutions as they come forward.  If we are to deal with the Resolutions separately, before coming to the final Resolution, which involves the general discussion, then I think we should ask the Minister to give us a full exposition of the effect of the various Resolutions he is proposing. I would like to know, for instance, why there is a different date fixed for the imposition of the new duties.  The duty on confectionery is to begin on the 26th April.  The other new duties come on at later stages in May.  The effect of this duty upon prices is very likely to be an immediate one.  The expectation of the Minister that it will not mean an increase in the prices of confectionery, will, I think, in the immediate result, not be fulfilled unless shopkeepers and traders generally here are very different to what they are in most other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really thinking of the effect for a month or two, but over the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect there will be a definite increase of a penny per lb. within a fortnight on all jams.  If the Reports of the Fiscal Committee are to be considered the expectation that Irish manufacturers will be able to increase their output quickly enough to meet demands, without increasing prices, will be very long delayed.  This is again a case where I think the Minister could give us more information.  If there is to be an increase of a penny per lb., say for six months, in the price of jams, the greater part of the advantage arising from the reduction in tea will be swallowed up, certainly for six months, without considering the increased price of boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will forestall what I have to say on the main question by saying that the whole effect of these new duties seems to me to be to impose an unfair burden upon the poor.  That is only in accordance with the general state of the <Col N="72" /> Minister's mind, I think, as recent developments show.  We have had the Ministry's policy expressing itself in a demand for a general reduction in wages.  The effect of his new finance policy is going to be to add to the burden of prices on workers in towns. Those who do not make their own jams, for instance, are for some months, at any rate, to be charged an extra penny per lb. for jams and confectionery.</P>
    <P>And assuming 2 lbs. a week, which is quite moderate, I think, for a very small family, you have 8/8 in the year, against a tea duty reduction of 10/10. You have only got 2/2 then, of an advantage to meet an increased cost of boots for the family of, probably, 13/- or 15/- per year.  This is a very rough calculation, but it seems to me that without taking into account any possible increase in the price of soaps and the like, the effect of these various proposed new taxes will inevitably be an immediate increase in the costs upon the poor, without any assurance of the protective effect having value for the working people.  However, I do not want to anticipate the general discussion, but I want to ask the Minister if he is prepared, in introducing every new Resolution, to give a statement of the effects of the new taxes, the amount of revenue that is expected, the probable increase in prices that it may involve, and generally to explain the resolution. After all, in some of these motions we are asked to pass, we are referred to certain previous taxes, and it is not easy to understand the effect of them without some explanation.  I think it would facilitate the discussions at a later stage if we had a statement of the kind I am asking for, at the initiation of Resolutions.</P>

      <P>I propose an amendment to this Resolution, that in the case of jams the date be changed from the 26th April to the 26th August, and I do so for the reason that the raw material to make jam will not be available until that time, and, therefore, it will not affect any Irish produce.  The jams that will be consumed between now and then are already in stock, and, therefore, it cannot be an encouragement to this industry.</P>

What occurs to us is that the few people in this country who are interested in jams or marmalades, or who are now in the industry, will have protection from this on. They have bought in their supplies and have them in stock.  The Minister expressed a pious wish that there will not be an increase in prices, but he is not prepared to say that he will see that there will not be.  There can be no justification for an increase in prices until the new crop has been purchased by these people.  I think if the Minister is reluctant to accept the amendment, the least he can do is to say that he will see that there shall not be any increase in the price of the article that has been or is being manufactured from the crop that has been purchased.</P>

      <P>Will Deputy Gorey say that they will be riper in August than they are now?  My impression is <Col N="74" /> that this is the moment when they are ripe.  The same thing applies to marmalade; this is the time when oranges are ripe.  I am opposed to the resolution and I will vote against it, but I do not think that, unless Deputy Gorey can give me a more specific definition of what jams are made of, based, if possible, on his own experience, that I will be able to vote for his amendment.</P>

      <P>The old saying used to be: &ldquo;We had jam yesterday, and we have jam to-morrow, but never jam to-day.&rdquo;  As far as I can make out in this case we will have an increase, <i>hic et nunc</i>, immediately after this Resolution passes, in the price of jams.  But I am afraid I will not be able to support Deputy Gorey, because I would be in favour of deleting the whole Resolution. I think it is not only a question of jams, but also a question of sweets of the nature described in this Resolution. As I said previously, sweets, to a certain class of people and to those of certain ages, are not a luxury, and, as my friend behind me remarks, the people that this Resolution will affect have no votes, and therefore it is going to be passed over their heads without their being consulted in the matter, or as Deputy Magennis says, over their mouths.  Joking apart, I do think that it is a serious thing to propose that there should be a considerable reduction in tea&mdash;and, goodness knows, there is enough tea, if not too much, drunk in the country&mdash;and no reduction in sugar.  Sugar is as essential as, if not more so than, tea.  It really comes to this.  Taking, as Deputy Johnson did, a wide survey of the whole of the Minister's proposals, the father of a family will say to his child one of these fine days: &ldquo;Now, my dear, which would you prefer that I get you, a pair of new boots or sweets?&rdquo;  because where the family of the poor man will gain on the swings they will lose on the round-abouts. I do suggest, not only in regard to jams but also in regard to all the items contained in this Resolution, that the Committee should not assent to the Resolution being passed in its present form.</P>

We have strawberry jam, plum jam, and there are several other jams.  There may be little additions that Deputy Cooper might know more about than I do.  But I do stand over this particular item of jam, because to my mind&mdash;and I am sure of what I am talking about&mdash;it is one of the articles which affect all the poor in the community.  Others are more or less luxuries, but jams are one of the things they do use, and for that reason I stand over this amendment.</P>

      <P>I think there is a good deal in what Deputy Gorey says, unless the Minister is looking for revenue in this matter.  If the Minister is counting on revenue out of the sale of jams and sweetmeats, then I can understand it, but if he is imposing this tax for protective purposes it will not have any protective value until later in the year, certainly in regard to jams and marmalade.  There can be no immediate value from a protective point of view in the case of confectionery. I differ from Deputy Gorey and others in their general view of this. I think on the whole it is probably quite satisfactory to have a protective duty on confectionery and jams. There is far too much confectionery imported, and too little manufactured here, but the protective value could be obtained if the Minister would agree to a reduction in the sugar duty, where that duty is being used in manufacturing. The Minister dissents from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about that.  He ought to know better than I do, but one does know there is a practice of rebates for sugar used in manufacture, and I think possibly in regard to manufacture of this kind, the kind of sugar that is used, or the saccharine, could be comparatively easily checked, and if it is the Minister's intention that there should not be an increase in the retail prices of sweetmeats of this kind, then the way to <Col N="76" /> get the protective value out of his duty is to reduce the duty on sugar which enters into these manufactures.  In the Fiscal Report, which the Minister has not taken very much notice of&mdash;I am surprised Deputy Milroy is not here to congratulate him&mdash;there is a paragraph touching confectionery which says, in the end: &ldquo;These witnesses asked for a protective tariff to secure them in the possession of an Irish trade, and expressed their willingness, in the event of such a tariff being granted, to submit to a public and official fixing of the prices of their products.&rdquo; I think that is one of the paragraphs the Minister ought to take notice of.  If those interested in the trade are quite prepared to submit and have expressed their willingness to submit to a public and official fixing of the prices of their products, the Minister ought to take advantage of that, and there should be some means of preventing the present stocks being increased immediately.  Further, I think also the Minister is quite capable of regulating the importation of confectionery as between now and August, if he were to assent to Deputy Gorey's suggestion of postponing this duty, certainly the duty in respect of jams, until the fruit year begins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is undoubtedly a likely consequence of the passing of this Resolution that for the six months during which the Irish manufacturers will be preparing to deal with the preserving of fruits we shall have a tax placed on the consumers of jams, and those who buy jams to avoid the buying of butter, which is very, very important.  As a matter of fact, in the cheaper sweets that is what happens&mdash;syrups, treacles, jams and the like are bought by the poor people to avoid having to buy butter, and these are the people who will be hit by this tax, and for this next six months, which is going to be a poverty-stricken six months from all signs, the very people who are obliged to pay the extra charges for jams are not to get any advantage, and no one is to get any advantage but the Exchequer&mdash;neither the manufacturers, for they will not be making jams, and therefore will not be protected, nor any other person except the Exchequer. <Col N="77" /> The Exchequer, for six months at all events, is the only factor which is to be benefited by the imposition of this duty on jams.  It is the poor people, the poorest as a matter of fact, who will have to pay.  I think it is unfortunate that in this general Resolution jams should have been included, and that the whole effect of the Resolution is to be spoiled, and an extra burden placed on the poor by virtue of the duty coming into operation immediately before any protective value can be got out of it, and before the new manufacturers who would come in are to have the chance of preparing for protection, and so keep down the prices in accordance with the Minister's expectations.  I hope he will consider this matter of jams and marmalade.</P>

      <P>I am in opposition to this Resolution, and I support Deputy Captain Redmond's ideas, but not for the same reason.  I think this is the wrong kind of protection, and I am of the opinion that if protection is to be introduced at all it must be introduced to deal with those kinds of manufactures which are difficult to build up, which require a good deal of technical skill and nursing in their infant stages. We have it on the statement of the Minister that confectionery and jam manufacturing does not require very much plant, is not an expensive form of manufacturing, and does not require much technical skill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is the case, we have had for years past a large supply of the main raw material, fruit.  I know for a fact that our fruit has been going to waste down in the country, apples, plums and pears rotting on the trees.  Why have not the Irish manufacturers got busy to get these cheap fruits?  Why have not they been able to compete with English manufacturers, who have no special advantages whatever?  They have to import their sugar, and also very often their fruit.  Is it because of inefficiency?  In my opinion, that explains why the Irish manufacturers are not able to compete, not because of any special advantages which English manufacturers have, but because Irish manufacturers have not shown business aptitude or efficiency.  What the Minister <Col N="78" /> is really going to do now is to give a bounty to inefficiency.  Certain manufacturers of confectionery in this country have been able to compete in the foreign market.  Why cannot the others do the same thing?  What one firm can do why could not other firms do?  I think if we are to allow the principle of Protection, which I think is a wrong principle at the present time, it certainly should not be applied to industries of this type.  They are exactly the wrong type of industries to apply it to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I differ with Deputy Heffernan in the statements he has made comparing the Irish manufacturer of jam with the British manufacturer of jam.  He says the Irishman's want of success is due to the Irishman's lack of business, to deficiency, I dare say, in Irish managership, and to lack of energy in the Irish worker. That is a style of argument that is very fallacious.  I think if Deputy Heffernan turned his attention to another important point he might see that it has a greater bearing on the case.  He forgets the large market the British manufacturer has.  There are large industrial centres around him; there is a large population of wage-earners earning good wages&mdash;a splendid market for a jam manufacturer.  This attitude of pouring contempt and derision on the Irish manufacturer is very unfair, if you do not take into consideration the different markets.  It reminds me of a story that is a bit humorous, but perhaps has some point in it, about a British tourist travelling in Connemara. He met a woman who was carrying some milk to the town in a very poor can on a very poor cart.  He said to her: &ldquo;Why, goodness, woman, in London they have very nice little milk carts and better class of tin cans than you have.  They convey the milk in an altogether better style, and they get a better price, too.  I am surprised at your turn-out altogether.&rdquo;  She was so disgusted with him that she drove off saying: &ldquo;I dare say if I had it in Hell I would get a better price for <Col N="79" /> it than if I had it in London.&rdquo;  It is the market that Deputy Heffernan&mdash; that was an unintentional compliment, but I think his argument deserved it&mdash; referred to.  He has omitted the point about the market.</P>
      <P>Unless we in this country aim at preserving the Irish market for ourselves, we will never get anywhere.  If you go into any shop in Dublin to-day, you will find the proprietor of the shop and the assistant holding Deputy Heffernan's views about jam.  I went into a shop in Harold's Cross the other day for jam; I asked the assistant had he Irish jam.  &ldquo;I would not keep the damned stuff,&rdquo; said he.  That was his attitude. I could point to a pot of Irish jam behind him on the shelf, perhaps as good jam as he was selling.  The Englishman has a larger market.  He is able to concentrate on his home market, and when he has that captured he is able to dump in Ireland, and the Irish manufacturer gets no chance.  Owing to the Deputy Heffernan attitude all over the country, the maker of Irish jams has to go over to England.  We are exporting our jam makers over to England to work there for us, instead of keeping them at home.</P>

      <P>I must object to the tone and the misleading arguments used by Deputy Sears.  He has attacked Deputy Heffernan for the theories he advanced.  The facts are that the English manufacturer of those articles has to come over here to Ireland, or has to send agents over to the Irish gardeners and Irish hedgegrowers to procure the raw material that is at the door of the potential Irish manufacturer if he wanted to manufacture it.  He has to pay the cost of collection in Ireland.  He has to pay the railway freight to England, which is no small matter, and he has to send back the manufactured article.  In addition to that, Deputy Sears wants some extraordinary form of protection for those poor innocent Irish manufacturers, who have no enterprise or very little business ability evidently. Otherwise they would be able to build up a trade.  The Irish manufacturer has the custom.  He has the raw <Col N="80" /> material, and what is to prevent him being successful?</P>

      <P>They manage to get butter in County Tipperary; they get along very well with it, and they get along very well with the farmers there too.  I cannot agree with Deputy Johnson's views.  If, as he wishes, the tax does not come into force until the fruit season comes on, you will have foreign jam stocked in Ireland, and the Irish manufacturers will not feel like going into a market that has already been fairly well flooded.  I certainly think that the penny in the lb. cost to the Irish worker who uses those jams will be of great assistance to people engaged in the industry.  The additional work provided in order to supply the home market and, perhaps, afterwards for exportation, I think, would more than counter-balance any hardship imposed on the workers generally.  As one interested in the workers, that certainly is my feeling.  Deputy Heffernan says he is against all Protection, but the Irish farmer found that Protection was necessary when he took steps to brand his butter, and to put it in a <Col N="81" /> proper place on the market.  The same thing applies to Irish bacon.</P>

      <P>Yes, but that may not be sufficient.  Deputy Heffernan referred to the fact that a large amount of fruit is going to waste in his own county.  It is quite true that a very large amount of apples are grown in the Suir Valley and that they are going to waste, and I think it would be a pity if the Minister for Finance did not give some incentive to the people who grow this large amount of apples and pears and rhubarb, going to waste, to preserve and manufacture it.  We know all about the large amount of strawberry jam that is sent into this country, and that a great deal of it consists of Swedish turnips.  It consists of very little strawberries and a good deal of turnips.  It is turnips and chemicals, pretty well like a good deal of the cider.  In all the jams made I can assure Deputies that there is a very large amount of Swedish turnips used.  Swedish turnips are grown in Ireland, so I do not see what injury it would be to the Irish farmers to insist on home-made jam if there is a large percentage of Swedish turnips in it, which would mean a large market for these turnips.  I think it would be a great pity if everything that would help to foster any industry, even at a small cost to the worker, was not done, or was prevented from being done.</P>

      <P>This question of the regulation of imports to prevent the flooding of the markets, preliminary to the operation of the tax in six months' time, is surely a simple one, when the Government is already preparing to regulate imports by taxation.  If that is the only difficulty it is not a great one.  There can easily be regulation of the quantities imported so that the market would not be flooded preparatory to the manufacturers being ready to put their supplies on the market.  I take from the January report of imports that there was £21,000 worth of confectionery, £8,000 worth of fruit in thin syrup, £15,800 worth of fruit in sugar and jam, £9,000 worth of condensed milk sweetened, and £23,000 worth of other articles of food containing sugar.  All those, I assume, would be brought in under this Resolution. Perhaps the Minister would say whether I am right in assuming that condensed milk would come into the category of confectionery.  If so, and I think it would under this Resolution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>True, I am trying to show that jam and condensed milk will be in the same category so far as the Resolution is concerned, and that the effect of the Resolution as a whole, with jam included, will be to impose a tax upon the people which would be less if jams were omitted.  The Minister gives us an assurance that condensed milk, at any rate, will not be involved in this new duty.  I take it only the old sugar duty will apply.  The articles which are to be affected by this duty are all kinds of confectionery, including breads, cakes, cake mixtures, puddings and powders sweetened with sugar, also sweetened commodities such as caramels, jams, also peels and fruits candied, crystallised, or otherwise preserved with sugar.  That, of course, allows Messrs. Jacob and Co., who protested against protective duties, to be protected, and I think it is very good for them, and I am quite in agreement with that portion of the Resolution because it does not affect the poor man and the poor woman and their families to any appreciable extent.  Children who buy sweets are paying in taxes one halfpenny in the pound as additional tax, but when we are dealing with jam we are dealing with an article which, in many cases in the city of Dublin you will find is the only relish that is used in the family. It is bread and jam, bread and jam two or three times a day for four or five children of the family.  Four or five or six two-pound jars will be bought every week.  Now, the additional tax of 1d. per pound may very easily, in many families, mean an additional tax of eightpence or a shilling per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gives us a confident assurance that the ultimate effect of this new duty, in so far as it affects jams, <Col N="84" /> will be very little on the price.  I am inclined to agree that it will not be very great.  But there will be a period of at least six months, during which the imposition will be felt very seriously. And, as I said already, the manufacturers are not going to get any benefit. The shopkeepers may get the benefit, but the Treasury will get the benefit of it at the expense of the poor.  I would like the Minister to consider, seriously, the possibility of his meeting the case made by Deputy Gorey that, for the period during which the new works may be prepared, during which the new season's fruit is growing and ripening, that there should be some check put upon the rates of import, and that this tax will not begin to operate.  So far as jams are concerned, I think that would go far to meet the case I am making; that for the present and for a period of six months the effect of this duty will be to impose too heavy a burden upon the poorest of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on the subject of jams, and I think that in the discussion that has taken place we seem to be inclined to give a very unenviable advertisement to Irish jam.  We have heard, in the course of the discussion, that Irish jam contains no fruit, but rather that it contains Swedish turnips, wooden pips, and things of that kind. Possibly if the debate goes on long enough we will learn that Irish jam has no sugar.  As regards the amendment proposed by Deputy Gorey, I do not know whether he is going on with it or not, but it seems to me that the effect of it would be to flood the country with jam to save the increase in the taxation that was foreshadowed for last August. That is the only effect it would have, and I do not think that is very desirable from the revenue point of view. As regards the main Resolution, the Minister for Finance is bowing more or less to a storm when he puts in the forefront of his budgetary Estimates the question of Protection.  As a Free Trader I rather welcome the experiment, for this reason that I do not think that the demand, as expressed by Deputy Sears, will be met until some form of Protection is instituted, and we see the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, I welcome the Budget <Col N="85" /> and the question of Protection within the Budget, on the lines of giving a certain amount of rope which will hang the people who put the proposition forward. I do not wish to be so sanguinary as to say that I actually want to hang the Minister for Finance, because I think we could ill do without him, but in the comparatively mild form in which Protection is instituted, I think it will give us a little experience that will be very helpful in the future.</P>
    <P>On this question of jam, the Minister for Finance bases his whole argument on the extension of jam manufacture within the Saorstát.  That may arise, and may have the effect that he anticipates, in which case his remedy will have been a quite efficient one, but on the other hand it is quite on the cards that the consumer will have to pay the extra money for his jam.  From the view-point that I approach this subject, even though he has not to pay exactly the penny per pound, I do believe that he will have to pay more.  This is a question of Free Trade versus Protection. That arises, to a large extent&mdash; almost altogether.  The question has to be settled, and therefore I welcome the introduction of it in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. SEARS Mr. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Johnson's argument against the increased cost to the workers' Budget if the tax is imposed, that argument, although it is raised on this amendment for an adjournment of the tax for six months, applies equally to all Protection. I submit he should consider the opposite argument, which is that if the tax is imposed, instead of having the jam made by foreign artisans, you will have it made by Irish artisans, and that is the important point that should be considered.  I do not see why we should defer this tax for six months. There is no lack of material.  Deputy Hewat said that if it is deferred for six months there will be no revenue.  Quite so.  Neither will there be any Protection, because you are giving the foreign dumper six months in which to flood the country.  The Irish manufacturer will have to get additional machinery, he will have to make other preparations, and he wants the encouragement of that Protection from the present moment.  Deputy Hewat <Col N="86" /> kindly offered us certain rope, but he need not be afraid as to whom the rope will hang.  It will hang the dumper and not the home manufacturer.  Experience in every country in the world shows that wherever people were sensible enough to use their fiscal powers to protect their home market, they never dropped those powers afterwards, and Ireland is not an exception to that great rule.  There is no argument advanced to show that it is.</P>

      <P>If they are defeated on this amendment I wonder will they think of increasing the workers' wages by a few shillings a week in order that the workers may be able to pay the extra penny on the jam and in this way help to swell the Exchequer of the Saorstát? I am sure that is one of the last things that members of the Farmers' Party would think of doing.  I suggest that the Minister for Finance should take into account in his Budget an answer he gave in reply to a question of mine about a fortnight ago when he <Col N="87" /> told me he could not anticipate the coming Budget with regard to the price of liquor and that consequently the other part of the question did not arise. At that time he must have taken into account the increase that he was going to place on the workers, on the common individual who is the prime supporter of jam manufacturers in this country. Several Deputies have explained that the working man cannot possibly afford to buy butter and consequently the next best thing he can obtain is jam.</P>
      <P>I am sure every Deputy on the Labour benches and on the Farmers' benches, not forgetting some of the Deputies on the Government benches, know very well in their heart and soul that the working men of the present time cannot afford even to buy jam with the wages advocated by the Minister for Local Government in the case of the County Councils&mdash;30/- per week to support a wife and six or seven children, while paying 1d. a lb extra for a lb. of jam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am, I can assure you that what I say is correct.  At the same time, I did not mean what I said to be in contradiction of Deputy Johnson. It was, I think, Deputy Johnson who mentioned confectionery as being a luxury for the worker.  I am sure Deputy Johnson will agree that it is not unreasonable that the worker should be in a position to have such a wonderful luxury as a piece of currant cake or seed cake for tea.  Take a 7lb. seed cake for the worker, and it means 1d. a lb. extra.  Seven lbs. of jam at 1d. a lb. extra means another 7d.  That is 1/2 extra.  Then we cry out and tell the people that we are going to reduce the cost of living, that we are going to see that when the wages of the worker come down, so shall the cost of living come down.  The wages of the worker have come down more than the worker can afford, and surely the cost of living should come down.  The Minister for Finance should see that the cost of these necessary commodities should be reduced by reducing the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in favour of the amendment <Col N="88" /> as it stands&mdash;to delete the word &ldquo;jam.&rdquo;  I intend to vote against Finance Resolution No. 3.  But to delete the word &ldquo;jam&rdquo; is not going to benefit very much the person who consumes jam.  As regards the fruit which we are told is going to loss each year, I am surprised that these large quantities of apples and plums should be allowed to go to loss.  There is such an industrious body as the Farmers' Union in existence and surely the least they could do, in that part of the country where fruit is so plentiful, would be to start a co-operative jam factory to give employment.  I do not agree with the amendment as it stands, but I will vote against the Resolution because I think the Minister for Finance is only getting in the thin end of the wedge.  He has reduced the old age pensions; when Minister for Local Government he sent out circulars reducing the wages of the workers, and now he is going further to crucify the worker by taxing the little luxuries he was able to get.</P>

      <P>There is no possible means of checking the flow of imports, except we get legislation to do it.  That would occupy sufficient time to enable a good deal of the damage to be done. I think that it is almost certain that whatever little the consumer might suffer owing to having this tax put on immediately, he would probably lose more if it were deferred.  I think that when we are putting on the tax the thing to do is to let manufacturers, either home manufacturers or outside manufacturers who have come in here, have a clear field and know that the market is not going to be flooded against them when ready to produce.  If we do allow flooding to take place, there is no doubt we will not have the same rush to get extended capacity for production.  We will not have the same employment given during the year.  It is quite possible we may not have output capacity to supply the entire country, and consequently have a great deal more jam paying tax for the remainder of the year than would be the case if the tax were put on at the moment.  I think there is not a really good case for postponing the tax.  The disadvantages of <Col N="89" /> postponing are considerable, and it is not reasonable to talk about six months. There will be a great deal of the small fruits from which jam is made ripe in three months, not to speak of six months.  The period during which any possible extra burthen might be borne will certainly be a good deal less than what was suggested by the various speakers.  If there is any hardship, it is simply one of the transitional hardships, and if we tried to avoid it we would probably not lessen the total extra charge, if there is an extra charge to be put on it.</P>

      <P>I propose:</P>
      <P>(1)  That a Customs duty at the rate of sixpence on the pound shall be charged, levied and paid on all preparations made from or containing cocoa in any form imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after 26th day of April, 1924, in addition to any duty which may be chargeable in respect of any spirits contained in any such preparation, but in lieu of any duty which might otherwise be chargeable on any other ingredient contained in any such preparation.</P>
      <P>(2)  The provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this Resolution, with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and as though preparations made from or containing cocoa in any form were included in the Second Schedule of the Act in the list of goods to which five-sixths of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
      <P>This is the duty under which a large amount of confectionery imported into this country will come.  As I have already said, along with the sugar confectionery, the revenue expected from this is about £40,000.  The degree of protection will vary from twopence to sixpence.  The goods are certainly a luxury type of goods.</P>

      <P>They are not exempt from the tax.  The average rate paid at the moment on cocoa&mdash;that is cocoapowder&mdash;is just over threepence, so that this will mean an increase on the cocoapowder <Col N="95" /> imported into the country.  As a matter of fact, it is simpler to make than many of the other preparations which will be taxed by this.  It is already made in the Saorstát, and there seems to be no reason, in view of the comparative simplicity of manufacture, why the output should not be very greatly increased here.  It is not a luxury, but it is a minor part of the commodity so far as taxability is concerned, and I think there is no good reason for excluding it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">

      <P>Broadly speaking, the Minister wishes to encourage us to drink tea and discourage us from drinking cocoa, because cocoa is going to be taxed at a very much higher rate than tea, even China tea.  Deputy Johnson on a previous Resolution asked the Minister if he had an analyst whom he could consult.  I wonder whether the Minister has a doctor whom he could consult, because I think the general verdict of the medical profession is that cocoa is beneficial and that tea&mdash; particularly taken in large quantities&mdash; is not.  Cocoa helps to build up the strength, while large quantities of tea&mdash; particularly the lowest taxed tea, strong Indian tea&mdash;is not good for the health of the people.  I remember when we were discussing the Old Age Pensions Bill Deputy Lyons spoke of the Minister dragging the poor old age pensioners out and drowning them in bog holes.  I am not quite certain if the Minister is not now taking all the people of the Saorstát, not excluding the old age pensioners, and driving them into lunatic asylums, by this encouragement of the consumption of tea to the detriment of everything else.  I really am at a loss to see any principle, other than the narrow financial principle, that has guided the Minister in putting these proposals before us.  I do not believe that the country will be happier or more healthy if this Resolution is carried.</P>

      <P>That the Customs duty now chargeable under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1916, on certain table waters specified and defined in that section, at the rate of fourpence per gallon, shall, on and after the 26th day of April, 1924, be charged, levied and paid at the increased rate of 8d. per gallon.</P>

      <Col N="97" /> It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    <P>This Resolution is practically providing for a new method of calculating the duty.  At present table waters pay the table water duty of fourpence, and in addition pay on the sugar and essences they contain&mdash;that is the ingredients. The duty, as I said, is fourpence.  The duty on the ingredients amounts to threepence or fourpence.  It varies, of course, in different table waters.  It necessitates analysis, and the trouble that analysis gives.  This will result in there being simply a specific duty on table waters, and it will in some cases involve no increase at all.  In other cases it may involve an increase of a penny per gallon.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give us some sort of specific definition of the term &ldquo;table waters.&rdquo; He has spoken about containing ingredients which were previously taxable, and which will have an increased tax in future.  I would like to know whether such waters as Apollinaris, Honyadi and Vichy, which are used for medicinal purposes, were taxable previously, and, if not, whether they are to be taxed now.  Does the Minister think it advisable to put a tax on these waters? I do not know whether &ldquo;table waters&rdquo; includes raspberry vinegar or ginger beer.  We should know what the term refers to, and if it does refer to waters of the description I have mentioned, I do not think that it would be advisable for the Government, in the interest of the health of the country, to impose a tax upon them.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain why he should make it the 5th of May?  We have a possibility within the next few days of having the country flooded with boots and shoes.  Anything that was said about flooding respecting fruits will surely apply to boots.  If advantage can be taken of the next five or six days to buy thousands of pairs of boots and shoes at an advantage of 3/- to the £1, it would be very well worth doing and a very good speculation.  I would like the Minister to explain why he should set out the 5th of May in this Resolution when it is the 26th of April in previous Resolutions. There must be some reason, and I think the Minister should state the reason, and why he would like to invite all the shippers of boots from Leicester to flood this market, when he raised objections against flooding the market with jams.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The 5th day of May had been fixed in preference to the 27th of April, which is the day we would like to fix because of the knowledge that there would be attempts to flood <Col N="99" /> the market.  The duties being imposed and charged on the 27th April are simply alterations of existing duties. The staff is there for dealing with them, and in some respects the instructions are in their hands, so that the matter can be dealt with at once.  In the case of boots and shoes the staff are dealing with an entirely new matter. For instance, it will be impossible actually to collect revenue to-morrow on boots and shoes.  It will not be difficult to collect it on confectionery, which will be paying duty anyway on a different calculation.  It would not be difficult to collect duty on table waters that are already paying a duty, but in the case of boots and shoes it will involve a very heavy burden of work on the Customs staff, work with all the difficulties that surround a new tax and with all the disputes that will arise.  It would be impossible to deal with them for a few days.  We feel that the 5th of May is the earliest date that we could deal with this particular tax.  If we were to put it on as from to-morrow the only result would be a hold-up and a very great amount of confusion, as arrears would accumulate against a staff that will be heavily enough taxed in any case.  We feel also that the time is so short, if there is going to be any great amount of forestalling, they will have to look very sharp about it.  There is only a week.  Undoubtedly a certain amount of forestalling is bound to take place, but we do not see that we can help that.  Of course, there is the fact that a considerable number of importers may not be able to pass the ordinary Customs entries even on non-dutiable goods in the interval that will elapse between this and the 5th May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the English boot manufacturers ought to be more grateful to the Minister for Finance for offering this respite or to Deputy Johnson for calling attention to it.  I would deprecate the last argument used by the Minister, because his suggestion that boots may not get through the Customs in time is turning business into a gamble.  It is simply inviting the retailer to put up his price at once because he does not know if he will be able to replenish his stocks, or <Col N="100" /> whether his new stock will have to pay duty or not.  Any uncertainty of that kind is most injurious.  I think the Minister adopted the argument on the spur of the moment, and, on reflection, will not, I hope, adhere to it.  If we are going to adopt the principle of a protective tariff&mdash;as to which I shall say more in my general remarks&mdash;I think a better case can be made for this duty than most.  I would like to suggest to the Minister, however, that he has made the duty a little too steep.  For the first imposition of a duty of this kind 15 per cent. is rather high.  It is bound, as he said, to be passed on to the consumer, because the Irish boot trade cannot deal with all demands at the present time, and English manufacturers have had no time to put factories here. That being so, would it not be desirable to adopt a slightly lower duty at present? I would suggest ten per cent. for three years.  Of course, the Minister cannot bind his successors or the Dáil, but if he would let it be known that it was his policy to levy ten per cent. for the first three years, then when Irish manufacturers have had time to increase their output, and when English manufacturers have had time to put up works here, as they probably will, I would not quarrel with a duty of 20 per cent.  I think 15 per cent. coming immediately on all classes and on everybody in the community who wears boots will be felt as a somewhat severe and onerous tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass from that to the second point. Has the Minister considered at all the possibility of exempting children's boots from this tax?  Any father of a family knows that if his children are not growing out of their boots they are wearing them out.  It is one incessant process, and no amount of admonition will persuade children to be careful with their boots.  This tax weighs as heavily on the wage-earner and the working man as on anyone else.  I notice in my own district that the game of &ldquo;hop-scotch&rdquo; is becoming extremely popular amongst children.  That game, I think, must be subsidised by boot manufacturers, as it is one of the most expeditious methods of wearing out boots that has ever been known.  I admit there would be a certain difficulty in defining children's boots, and that <Col N="101" /> some ladies whose feet happen to be unusually small would probably be able to reap the advantage of any concession. But I would suggest to the Minister that he might consider the exemption of boots below a certain price, even a low price-say, 10/-.  An <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 15 per cent. on ten shillings would not be a very great deal.  The revenue would not lose very much, the Irish manufacturer would not lose, because I believe that children's boots are not manufactured in the Saorstát at present; and, that being so, I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration to an amendment on these lines, if one is moved on Report.</P>
    <P>The third point is the tax on shaped soles, shaped heels and shaped uppers. That again is not protection at present, because I believe these parts are not made in Ireland, and it will be very injurious to a comparatively large number of people who carry on the trade of boot repairing.  They have to import the material, and they are small men, with usually what is known as one-man businesses, without any great capital behind them.  I am thinking of a certain number of men discharged from the Army after the European War, trained in boot repairing, and encouraged by the British Government to set up in this business.  They have no capital; the fact that they have to buy, and possibly keep the goods on hands for a considerable time before they can dispose of them, will hamper their operations, and they belong to a class that the Minister for Finance dislikes, and naturally dislikes, because they give him trouble.  But, nevertheless, they deserve consideration.  It will mean a constant loss of 6d. and 2/6; it will mean all the impediments that the Minister desires to place in the way of the small importer, and the result will be, I am afraid, that many of these men, who are earning an honest living now, will be driven out of it and will have to be given the dole or turn to some other occupation already overstocked. I suppose I am a reactionary, but I would sooner see a man repairing boots in his own neighbourhood than to see him in a big English factory here.  I believe he is a happier man and a better citizen.  I would ask the <Col N="102" /> Government to reconsider the duty on shaped soles and heels.  I am not concerned so much about shaped uppers, as that is a matter of assembling, but the shaped soles and shaped heels are the raw material of this boot repairing business, and I think they should be exempted, even from this protective tariff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Cooper that fifteen per cent. is too much.  I would like to know if, before introducing this, the Minister for Finance had an interview with the boot manufacturers in the Saorstát to find out whether they were in a position to manufacture the same class of boots both for adults and children, and at the same price as those sent into the country.  Certainly it is a fine thing from the workman's point of view to preach Protection, but not to give with one hand and take away with the other.  It has been adopted by many in the Dáil for the past three or four months.  But you will find that a person who has suffered from Protection is not really a sincere Protectionist.  I think the only men who will suffer from this Resolution will be the working men.  A pair of boots costing at present twenty shillings will cost twenty-three shillings.  I wonder where the extra three shillings are to come from.  Deputy Cooper has explained the question of children's boots, and I am sure the Minister for Finance has some experience of what it costs to keep children in footwear for twelve months.  I do not think this Resolution should be accepted by the Dáil until some arrangements are made, or some guarantee given that prices will remain as at present, or, if possible, will be reduced.  To my mind, this fifteen per cent. is another tax upon the citizen.  Everyone must have some kind of footwear.  If a tariff is necessary I think five per cent. would have practically the same result as fifteen per cent.  I would like to know, if this is agreed to, whether the Minister will prevent traders throughout the country who have large stocks of boots on hands from charging the extra fifteen per cent. on their present stocks, which would certainly be profiteering. I wish to propose an amendment, <Col N="103" /> that is, to delete the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; and to substitute the word &ldquo;five.&rdquo;  I think five per cent. would be plenty to charge, at least for the first twelve months.  I believe it will have the very same effect as the fifteen per cent., and it will be as much as the ordinary man can possibly afford to pay, taking the prices the farmers are getting for the produce of their land, and that the manufacturers say they are getting, and the workers' scanty wages from both.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel obliged to oppose this resolution.  The Minister has taken off, as far as I can gather, about ten shillings or ten and sixpence in the year in the case of an ordinary family by reducing the tea duty, but by this protective duty on boots he imposes a duty on a family of five people, wearing, on an average, two pairs of boots each per year, of £1 10s. per year.  If there is any form of Protection that I would be inclined to support, it would be in the boot and shoe industry, because it seems to me to be almost the ideal industry to start on a protective basis.  But I maintain, with the present situation in this country, that it is not right or advisable that people should be taxed to this extent. We hear every day&mdash;we heard it to-day from the Minister&mdash;about the dire condition of agriculture, and if you have protective duties imposed upon articles of everyday consumption by the farmer you will have an increase in his cost of living, a direct increase on the price of boots of at least £1 10s. a year.  You will have an increase in the price of confectionery for his children, if he can afford to buy any, which I very much doubt, an increase in the price of his cocoa, and, possibly, an increase in the price of his bottle of stout by the increase in the price of bottles. What are you giving him in place of these increases?  You are giving him absolutely nothing.  The main industry, which we have heard so much about, and which has to be bolstered up and helped, is getting absolutely nothing, and I maintain that if the members of the agricultural community have to bear costs directly, and, eventually, indirectly, they will have <Col N="104" /> to bear still further expense, because if these tariffs increase the price of boots, jam and other things, the index figure of the standard of living will be higher, and naturally the workers&mdash; perhaps rightly so&mdash;will refuse to accept any reduction in their wages while the index figure remains high, with the usual result which we have got quite accustomed to, that the whole cost will be eventually forced upon the farmer, who will have no option but to pay.</P>
      <P>He has to sell his goods in an unprotected market.  I notice that even the one article which might be protected is ignored altogether, and that is barley. The Minister did not deal with the question of barley.  He never said for a moment that barley could be protected, and apparently all we are to get is his pious recognition of the fact that agriculture is in a dire condition, and we are to be asked to pay directly or indirectly for these protective duties.  With regard to boots, I am sure this protective duty will increase the price of boots by that amount.  It is quite evident that the manufacture of boots cannot be enlarged to such an extent that the Irish manufacturers will be able to meet the requirements of the population for some time, with the result that imported boots will be coming in for a long time, and costing the consumer an extra amount.  There is the further matter, that is well known, that English manufacturers of boots specialise in different grades.  One factory in Northampton will make one form of boot, and another factory will make another class of boot. They specialise in that manner, and it seems to me, with the comparatively small demand we will have, that it will not be possible to specialise in this way, or if it is possible the articles produced will be inferior in quality or else higher in price.  That means that the Irish manufacturer will have to make a great number of grades which will be of inferior quality, and can never hope to send these goods to the foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will always have to depend on the home demand for these grades.  If they do that they can concentrate on one, two, or three grades, and specialise, but that will mean the balance of the grades will have to be <Col N="105" /> imported, and the Irish consumer will have to pay the 15 per cent.  I think the Minister suggested that the hide and tanning trade would be improved by this protective duty.  If that is the case he should have imposed a protective duty on hides, because hides are tanned in England and they will be sent here.  I see no possibility of tanning being revived here by this tariff.  If he imposed a protective tariff on tanned hides it would to a certain extent encourage agriculture, and that would possibly mean there would be an increase in tanning, an increase in the prices which the Irish farmer gets for his hides, and possibly a fillip would be given to the dead meat industry.  Factories could be established, and hides might be used in these tanning factories. Taking all these considerations into account, and the present condition of agriculture, which has, to my mind, mainly to bear the extra expenses of these tariffs, I think it is not an advisable time for the imposition of such a tariff as this.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely opposed to Protection, although I must admit there is not much protection in this Resolution.  The Minister for Finance is anxious to encourage Irish industry.  I would suggest that he would reach his goal far quicker if he reduced the income tax 6d. or 1/- in the £.  He proposes to put 15 per cent. on boots, and other manufactured articles.  Even though I am opposed to Protection, I can very well see that 15 per cent. at present amounts to nothing at all.  Irish boots are always 15 per cent. dearer.  I would rather advise the Minister to put on 33? per cent., and then he might succeed in encouraging the manufacture of boots in Ireland.  Fifteen per cent., I think, does not go far enough.</P>

It is a counterpoise to the 3d. he has allowed in tea.  He is going to get it all in the boots.  I hope the Finance Department will see that the people who gain on the boots&mdash;that is, <Col N="106" /> the people who hold the stocks to-day &mdash;will have 15 per cent. added to their incomes for the purpose of income tax next year, for they will have gained it by a stroke of the pen.  He has admitted that 11-12ths of our boots have to be imported.  That is one pair out of twelve is made in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson pointed out that at present for every fifteen pairs of boots Ireland uses she produces only one pair.  He pointed out that as the miserable position in which the Irish boot industry stands, and asked is that the sort of industry we are to support.  I say that is an extraordinary way of looking at it.  What Deputy Wilson should say is, that so poor is the encouragement and support that the people of Ireland gave to the makers of boots that Irish factories, one by one, factories where Irish boys and girls were working, had to close their doors because the Irish people would not buy their boots, and for every 15 factories that were working 14 had to close one after another, and Deputy Wilson's money for boots has gone across to England, to Nottingham and other places, where these boys and girls who were working had to go to follow his money, and he said it with a sneer at the Irish manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We always have a sneer at the Irish manufacturer and the Irish artizan.  It reminds one of the scathing sneers of the landlord twenty years ago.  &ldquo;The <Col N="107" /> Irish farmer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is contemptible, ignorant, lazy.  He is not able to sow his land.  He has not machinery or anything else.&rdquo;  It was not the fault of the Irish farmer.  It was the fault of the system.  I say the Irish artizan, the Irish works manager, and the Irish manufacturer are of the same cloth as the Irish farmer.  They are no worse if they get a fair chance.  And the Farmers' Party ought to recognise what the Minister means by putting on this tariff.  We want boots for Irishmen to be made in Ireland by Irish artizans. Then we will have a prosperous Irish tanning industry.  The Irish tanning industry only wants a fair start to get on its feet.</P>
    <P>During the war, when we had some sort of Protection, the Irish tanning industry was working up to the full extent of its capacity.  The moment the amount of Protection that the war gave was withdrawn dumping began and the Irish tanning industries were closed one by one.  Ireland is to-day without any boot industry worth talking about, but it is not the only country that was in that position.  Australia was as poorly off some years ago with regard to this industry as Ireland is to-day, and it had to face the opposition of men like Deputy Wilson and others.  Australia had the good sense to put on a tariff, and to-day it has captured not alone its own market but it is going over the seas, and it has captured the South African and other markets.  As Australia has done, first try to capture your own market for your own people, and do not be regarding the Irish manufacturer as one having all the sins of the world.  He is just as good as you are yourself and just as honest.  Give him a fair chance and he will make boots that will be good enough for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>If you go to France you will handle a cigarette that is not as good as the British cigarette, and when the British young fellow or girl asks for a better cigarette he is told by the sensible French people: &ldquo;The cigarette that is good enough for the French artizan is good enough for you.&rdquo;  If you go to America you will get bicycles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is not the point that is taken into consideration. If we are going to hold this nation together we must give employment to the youth of the country.  The farming Deputy here is the owner of his farm.  What about his brothers?

      <P>I would like to assure Deputy Sears and the Minister for Finance that the farmers of Ireland are quite prepared to wear Irish boots and to buy Irish boots.  What the farmers object to, and what I think the workers of Ireland generally will object to, is that they will be forced, if this Resolution is passed by the Dáil, to pay three shillings for every pair of boots in which they invest a pound more after the 5th May than they could buy them at to-day.  They will object to paying <Col N="109" /> that three shillings extra simply because they are unable to pay.  Agriculture in Ireland was never in a worse position, and Deputy Sears knows it just as well as any Deputy in this Dáil. The workers of Ireland were never worse off than they are to-day, and in spite of that fact they will be compelled to go into the shops to pay three shillings a pair more for every pair of boots purchased after the 5th May. We want to see where this extra money is going to come from to enable the purchaser to do this.  Unquestionably it will raise the cost of living.  It must raise the cost of living.  It will certainly raise the cost of production for the farmers of the country.  And what effect must that inevitably have on the agricultural industry?  Agriculture is in as much need of protection to-day as any industry in the country, or any industry that you seek to have in the country.  What way are you proposing to protect agriculture?  You are proposing to protect it by raising the cost of production on the agriculturists.  If there is any Deputy or anybody outside the Dáil in earnest in supporting agriculture, prepared to give agriculture its due, the protection that they can best give it is to do everything they can to enable us to reduce the cost of production. That is what we want to get in order that we will be in a position to compete with the farmers of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of production for the Irish farmer to-day is so high that he is not in a favourable position to compete against the farmers of other countries. Now it is proposed that the cost of production for the Irish farmer must be still higher.  Every pair of boots that comes into his house henceforward will cost him three shillings more&mdash;and perhaps more than three shillings&mdash;than he would have to pay if this Resolution were not passed.  That is really a revenue tax.  It is going to increase the amount to the Exchequer.  It is not, to my mind, a tax that will first assist an Irish industry.  Its first effect will really be to increase the revenue.  It must be for that object this resolution has been introduced.  I think it is not right that it should be put to this House that the motive is to assist Irish industries <Col N="110" /> that to-day are not able to live. The main point of view must be to increase the revenue.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education says that it is nothing of the kind, but whether that is the intention or not, that will really be the effect, and the people of this country, who are the purchasers of this article all over the country, will really be the people to pay this increased tax and to pay this amount into the Exchequer.  Deputy Sears may say, and perhaps there is reason for his saying it, that the Irish manufacturers are not able to compete, and that Irish manufacturers want protection, but does Deputy Sears suggest that one section of the Irish people, and that the greater section of the Irish people, must be penalised so that another section may prosper?  I think that will really be the effect of this Resolution.  The great majority of the people on the land and all the people who are not on the land but who are depending upon the land for their living, will have the cost of living for them increased.  The articles they have to buy and the necessaries of life are going to cost them more.  Deputy Sears may say that manufacturers cannot live under present conditions, and that employment must be found for the extra women we have on the land.  I agree that extra employment must be found, but I think it would be well for those people who have been managing those industries up to the present to explore every possible means before having a tariff on one of the articles which is one of the very essentials of life.  I think, as I said before, that if better business methods were employed by our people, and perhaps if there was a better spirit shown both by the workers in the factories and the managers and the owners of the factories there would be no trouble whatever in the Irish people procuring as good boots to wear and as cheap as those which come from Northampton.  I am not satisfied that the possibilities in that direction have been fully explored, and I am very much afraid there has <Col N="111" /> not been the efficiency we would all like.  It is doubtful whether we will have that efficiency now, and it would be a better way to try to establish that standard of efficiency first and that our people should have made every possible effort to establish that standard of efficiency.  To look to Protection at all now is, to my mind, a very dangerous principle and a principle that we will have established and will want to have administered all round to every industry, great and small, in the country that can really find an excuse for saying it is not able to live against foreign competition.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter's speech was a speech against protection in any form, and this is not the time to go into that question.  I agree that the best service you could do to agriculture would be to bring down the cost of living.  I also agree&mdash;I am not going to repeat the figures again&mdash;that the farmer is in an extremely bad position at the moment.  But the point I wish to make is that you cannot oppose this particular Resolution on any other basis consistently except by opposing any attempt, any experiment now in the nature of protection.  Any speech against this Resolution in the circumstances is simply stating we cannot in any circumstances&mdash;good, bad, or indifferent&mdash;make any experiment in protection. That is what it comes to.  If that is the official policy say so, but I have been listening to speeches&mdash;I listened to the speeches of Deputy Heffernan and Deputy Baxter&mdash;and I think that is what they amounted to.  I also listened to the speech of Deputy Wilson, and I had a question to-day about offals, and it comes to this: Deputy Heffernan wants an import duty upon barley, and in the next breath he wants to cheapen production&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is, it was good enough as an argument for the moment.  The Farmers' Union considered the matter in Congress, and passed a resolution against the protection of barley, quite sensibly.  Deputy Wilson is on sounder lines, and wants to cheapen food stuffs, but you cannot have it both ways.  I understand Deputy Baxter's attitude, which is no protection in any circumstances or under any safeguards; that is what his speech amounts to; but do not try to have it both ways.  Do not ask for cheaper food stuffs in one breath, and dearer in another.  I know perfectly well the greatest service you could do the farmers at the moment would be to lower <Col N="113" /> the cost-of-living figure, and the cost of production.  That undoubtedly would be the greatest service.  But I do not take up the attitude that we cannot make any experiment of any kind in the direction of the development of the commercial and industrial side of this country.  I think experiments are necessary. I think you will never get the question of Free Trade versus Protection properly understood, and appreciated, in this country, until you make experiments, and I do say we will have a far more educated electorate and Dáil and Government this time next year when we come to debate the question of Free Trade and Protection as a result of these experiments.</P>
      <P>I think that is worth a certain amount of money.  In fact it is the only way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that, but I think that is the only way you can get this question of Protection versus Free Trade faced squarely. Anybody will admit that if you withdraw this particular duty, this duty on boots, the whole experiment falls to the ground.  It is not worth while going on with the rest.  I do not accept Deputy Heffernan's figures, which are, I think, that the ratio between what the farmer loses by this duty and what he gains by the rebate on tea would be thirty to ten.  I do not think that is so at all.  Take the figures in bulk.  The best estimate which the Minister for Finance can make is that they will about balance.  I think when you come down to the case of the small farmer, and the small farmer is the man who holds the greatest area of land in this country, you will find that there will not be very much difference between what he will gain and what he will have to pay.  That is the reason I support this resolution, that I believe the difference between what he will lose by this duty as against what he will be recouped by the rebate on tea will be very little, if anything.  It is hard, of course, to dogmatise on an estimate of this sort, but I do think that the event will justify the prediction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are undertaking a substantial experiment, an experiment that will, I <Col N="114" /> hope, lead to somewhere, teach us something and give us some results.  At the same time you are not to any extent increasing the cost of production to the farmer.  I would be sorry to think that the farmers of the country would be so short-sighted as to say: &ldquo;Whatever effect it is going to have on us we are not going to allow any gambles, if you like, any experiments, no matter how unimportant, in the interests of any other class.&rdquo;  I am fully aware of the importance of agriculture.  It is the most important industry in this country.  I agree entirely with Deputy Baxter when he says that there is no other industry that needs so much Protection, and, I go so far as to say, has got so little.  But opposition to this Resolution or to experiments in the direction of developing the commercial and industrial side of the country is not the way, I say, to help agriculture.</P>

      <P>You have got the agricultural grant, and the general taxpayer pays for your special education in colleges here and in Agricultural Colleges throughout the country.  The College of Science, this big building here near us, was erected by the Department that had charge of your interests.  You have colleges scattered all over the country with more professors in them than pupils.  The cost of experiments in testing seeds, in dealing with the breeding and feeding of cattle, is borne out of funds provided by the general taxpayer. Money is poured out on you from the general taxpayer in a way that it has not been poured out upon any other section of the community. And even now Deputy Baxter says he would be satisfied to vote for this Resolution if he could get a <i>quid pro quo.</i> Really when the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="115" /> delivered his fatherly advice to you to be satisfied with what you have got we were all very edified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesOMara" hpid="Mr. O'MARA Mr. O'MARA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MARA</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  For my own part, and this is my principal reason for intervening in the debate, I must confess that it is with a good deal of hesitation I am supporting these Resolutions of the Government.  I accept what the Minister said on behalf of the Executive Council.  I am sure what he said was said in good faith, that these taxes are now being put on imports as experiments, and purely as experiments. As experiments, I am quite willing to support the proposal of the Government, which has all the information at its command.  At the same time I cannot get out of my mind that what Deputy Baxter said is perfectly true, that every tax that is put on imports is going to raise the cost of living.  That increase is going to create a greater difficulty for the poor to exist.  I do not know whether, when Deputy Johnson opposed these Resolutions, the evidence given before the Fiscal Committee, if not by himself, by other leaders of the Irish Transport Union, in favour of Free Trade, was before his mind, He quoted from the report of the Fiscal Committee, and I think he has a copy of the report now before him.  The five Professors who sat on that Committee decided that this country could prosper on nothing but Free Trade, and Deputy Johnson, I think, agreed with them. The Deputy will contradict me if I am wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesOMara" hpid="Mr. O'MARA Mr. O'MARA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MARA</NameTxt>
      <P>If not, the Deputy himself will find in the book that lies open before him, and perhaps on the very page of the book that is open before him&mdash;I have not got the book myself&mdash;that the leaders of the Transport Union were entirely in favour of a policy of Free Trade in this country, but that afterwards&mdash;the Deputy does not contradict me now&mdash;when the Trades Council met they decided that they wanted Protection.  Now, when experts differ among themselves it is quite natural that a mere private member <Col N="116" /> like myself would be rather doubtful, especially when I see here below me, five Professors each and all of whom unanimously voted for the first resolution enforcing Protection in this country, while their five colleagues who sat and inquired into the subject equally unanimously declared that Protection would be the ruin of the country.  Now, which way are we to have it?  When the leaders of the Labour Party go before the Fiscal Committee and say they are in favour of Free Trade and afterwards meet their friends and say they are not, and when five Professors meet and receive evidence, and say they are in favour of Free Trade, and five other Professors express the opposite view, it is natural that any Government would be puzzled to know what to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesOMara" hpid="Mr. O'MARA Mr. O'MARA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MARA</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so long as they get the Protection that suits them.  It is natural that no Government would introduce any such measure as a purely experimental matter, and it is purely as an experimental matter that I am going to support this resolution.  I know that the effect of these resolutions will be to increase the cost of living.  I know that they are going to result in raising the prices on the poor, and I know that boots are going to cost more than the 15 per cent. they will be taxed, because everyone who is dealing in boots will take advantage of it.</P>
      <P>But I equally well know that in this country, at the present time, there is widespread unemployment.  I equally well know that if a boot industry is started and can get on its feet, it will be able to remain here, and that in addition to supplying boots to this country, the tariff being removed, we will be in a position to export boots to other countries.  Let us hope that that will be so, but it will not be so if the tariff is left on for longer than an experimental period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to another question. Why did the Minister say this is a purely experimental business, and then invite native and foreign manufacturers to come along and start boot manufactories? How can his statement, that it is purely experimental, be in good faith <Col N="117" /> if he invites native and foreign manufacturers to come along and start boot factories here?  Having started the boot factories, he (the Minister) might find that the experiment was not a success, and we would be left without boot factories. I think the Minister owes it to himself to say exactly what he means. Does he mean the tariff to be kept on longer than a year, because it would not pay anyone to start a boot factory, and, if it were not a success, to close it up in a year.  I think the Minister owes it to the House to say what exactly he means.  That is the only comment I would make on his speech.  I think his Budget will be well received in the country.  The fact that the Government have the courage to take the matter in hand and make this experiment will be received by the people of the country in a way that they have not received any act of the Government up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister for Finance, in his opening statement to-day, say that the viewpoint from which both the Executive Council and himself approached this important question of Free Trade or Protection was not a doctrinaire one.  I was subsequently glad to hear him state that this proposal was in the nature of an experiment.  I confess that I sympathise largely with the Deputy who has just sat down in regard to his qualms of conscience in supporting any proposal such as this, which will inevitably and immediately increase, to a certain extent, at any rate, the cost of living, which, at the moment, is so exorbitantly high.  At the same time, I also agree with him that the Government ought to be commended for <Col N="118" /> the courage they have displayed in taking this step as an experiment and acknowledging it as such.  It is perfectly true that what they give with one hand they take away with the other.  They have proposed to reduce the existing tax upon tea, and now they are proposing to put a new tax upon boots.  The proposed reduction upon tea is supposed to be for the benefit of the community.  The proposed new tax upon boots is not so much, they say, for revenue purposes as in the nature of an experiment for the protection of an existing, though small, Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly do not agree with the statements that have been made from the Farmers' benches, that the fault lay entirely with the Irish manufacturers or the Irish workmen in the past.  They have never had either the market or the facilities, or the opportunities of people in similar positions in Great Britain. What Deputy Sears said is undoubtedly true in regard to other Dominions, Australia in particular, that they were in almost precisely the same position as we were, in regard to certain articles which are only manufactured in a small way in their country, and that when they took the lead, as we are taking it now, they were successful.  I am not saying that we shall be successful, but I am saying that it is a wise thing, at any rate, at some time, to make some experiment in the direction we are going.  If I may be permitted to say so, I agree with most of what the Minister for Agriculture said in this regard, with the exception of the statement he made that any speech made against this particular Resolution was against any experiment in Protection.  I disagree with him in regard to that statement. With respect, I suggest that though we may not agree with the exact and precise terms of this Resolution, at the same time it does not follow that those of us who have expressed those views are entirely against any experiment in Protection.  As regards this particular experiment, I am not against it.  I think, with Deputy Cooper, that possibly this is one of the best items that we could have made an experiment upon.  It is true that, as the Resolution now stands, it will inflict serious injuries and hardships upon <Col N="119" /> large classes of the population.  But then, the Resolution need not pass as it now stands.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary that every word proposed in this Resolution should be subsequently adopted, to make the experiment. I would strongly support Deputy Cooper's suggestion, that if we make this experiment, we should do it in a more modest way, and that we should not commence by putting fifteen per cent. upon imported boots and shoes and parts for the making thereof, but that we should start with, say, ten per cent. for the first three years, as he suggested, with a guarantee, or, at any rate, an expressed intention, that the duty would be increased thereafter. Certainly, in regard to boots, shoes and slippers worn by children, I do think Deputy Cooper has made a strong and almost irresistible appeal, even to the Minister for Finance, who has shown himself exceedingly hard-hearted, as he is supposed to do, in these matters.  I do think that Deputy Cooper has made a strong case that shoes and boots under a certain size should be exempt from this experiment, because that is what it is; and, furthermore, that these various portions, such as shaped soles and shaped heels, should also be taken out of the Resolution.  If that were done, it would in no way interfere with the experiment.  There is no reason why the experiment would not have as good a chance if it were altered on the lines suggested by Deputy Cooper.  I certainly will support a Resolution to the effect adumbrated by Deputy Cooper.</P>
    <P>In doing so, I am glad to have the opportunity of welcoming this step because I think it is a step towards showing the people of this country that we are not bound hand and foot either to Free Trade or Protection, but that we are here in practically a new State, and that we must regard ourselves as we find ourselves, according to all the circumstances which surround us, and that we cannot be bound and fettered one way or the other by the success of England as a Free Trade country, or by the success of America as a Protectionist country.  I think that it is a step, therefore, in the right direction.  As it <Col N="120" /> stands, I think the resolution would go too far.  I think it would inflict too great hardship at the start.  If amended I certainly would support the Resolution, and I can see no reason why the Minister for Finance would not yield to the argument put forward by Deputy Cooper in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Mara has indicated to the Dáil that he is prepared to support this Resolution, and all the other resolutions which embody a Protectionist policy, although he is against Protection.  He has been persuaded that as a matter of experiment this policy should be put into operation, but apparently he does not desire that the experiment should be for a very short time.  It should be continued long enough to ensure that those engaged in the businesses that ought to be protected would have a fair opportunity to develop.  I am not quite able to follow his reasoning in that But it is easily understood when one also heard him say that I may have taken a certain line of policy before the Fiscal Inquiry, and the leaders of the Transport Union took a different line.  It would be well if Deputy O'Mara, one who had experience in another place, as they say, would be quite sure of his facts, before he makes pronouncements in An Dáil.  I simply say that the statement is not correct. I leave it at that.  The Minister for Agriculture said what I think is an unfortunate thing.  Deputy Redmond drew attention to it.  He said that those import duties upon boots, shoes, slippers, etc., were to be a test of the merits of a Protectionist policy, and if it failed, then, that was the end, and that one could go no further upon this policy.  I suggest that it is not the best item on which to have a test of the merits of a Protectionist policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> As a matter of fact there may be disadvantages accruing to this particular duty which would outweigh the advantages. There may be advantages accruing to similar duties upon other commodities which would not be outweighed by the disadvantages.  And it is unfortunate, I say, that the Minister for Agriculture should add the weight of his opinion and responsible position to a statement that the whole question of protective tariffs would stand or fall by the result of tariffs upon boots and shoes.  I think, for instance, that this duty in itself would have been much more likely to be effective without carrying with it some of the disadvantages, if the duty had been modulated, shall I say, so that a heavier scale of taxes would fall upon the higher priced boots and shoes, and a lower scale of taxes, <i>ad valorem</i>, would fall upon the lower priced boots and shoes.  By such means the burden of taxes would not fall upon the working man with a big family. Notwithstanding that, I am going to support the motion.  I have said that I believe that with certain conditions that import duties were at this stage of the country's development, probably the best way to ensure that development continuing or to arrest decline.  I am not going to run away from that proposition when the first experiment is being mooted, even though it falls upon a commodity in a manner which I do not think is the best manner that could be applied.  I have made a rough calculation as to the effect of these taxes.</P>
    <P>I find from the report of the imports and exports for January there were imported 8,806 dozen pairs of men's boots, and 13,041 pairs of women's and children's boots.  The value of the men's boots was £61,942, and of the women's and children's boots £65,927. That is, speaking roughly, 11s. 6d. per pair for men's boots and 8s. 4d. per pair for women's and children's boots on the average.  Deputy Heffernan made the mistake in assuming that the duty is leviable upon the retail price. Unless the Minister is going to adopt entirely new methods the duty will be leviable upon the declared prices at the ports.  One may fairly say that the retail price would be double, or very nearly double, the declared price at the <Col N="122" /> ports.  So that the 15 per cent. does not fall upon the retail prices.  It will be only about 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I have made this assumption, that speaking of the average working class purchase of boots, the duty will amount to, say, 1s. 3d. per pair, rather below the average, and on women and children's about 1s. per pair.  Assuming that each member of the average family of five persons purchased two pairs a year, we have a duty borne by them of round about 10s. or 10s. 6d. per year.  That fits in fairly well with the approximation of the saving upon the tea duty, assuming that the average purchase was one pound of tea per week.  Unfortunately the saving on tea may be counterbalanced by the extra cost of boots, and we are being asked to assent, and in some cases we have so far assented, to the additional charges upon the workman's family in respect to confectionery, jams and cocoa, and, as will come a little later, on soap and candles.  Though, as I said a little earlier, the balance in this Budget is weighted against the working-class family as a consumer, I think it is unfortunate that at this initial stage the Minister should have taken the line of making the cost of living inevitably higher by virtue of his new taxes.  I am one of those who never pretended that protective duties did not raise prices.  I believe it is inevitable in five out of seven cases at any rate that the protective duties would have the effect of raising the prices, but I would be prepared to meet that and to accept the fact, because I believe that the advantages may, subject to certain conditions, or if certain conditions are applied, redound generally to the advantage of the community. Deputy Heffernan and those sitting with him made some play about the cost to the farming community, and pointed out how necessary it was that if there were to be duties of a protective nature, then agriculture should get some of the benefits.  Some hours ago Deputy Heffernan put a question to know whether the Minister for External Affairs had done anything to provide new markets for agricultural products on the continent of Europe.  I want to suggest to him and <Col N="123" /> those sitting with him that we may be finding a new market in Ireland.</P>
    <P>According to the report of the Fiscal Inquiry Commission a little more than one out of fifteen pairs of boots and shoes purchased in Ireland was of Irish manufacture&mdash;it is slightly over 1/15th &mdash;and also the aggregate number employed at present in Irish factories is 700, while the possible capacity is over 1,000 hands.  If 1/15th of the present consumption employs 700 people, and if the series of duties does bring into effect what the Minister and others hope, we may find that the market which Deputy Heffernan has been looking for on the Continent will be at his doors.  Let us assume that the effect of these duties would be to raise the manufacture of Irish boots to half the total instead of 1/15th; supposing 7 out of 15 were home manufactured instead of 1 out of 15, and the number of persons engaged in the manufacture rose accordingly, we should have, instead of 700, approximately 5,000 people working at that industry. With 5,000 people working at that industry at an average wage, let us say, taking the various classes, ages, and sexes of, £2 a week, you have £520,000 a year of an additional market, about half a million of an additional market, for Irish grown agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>You need not then go to Paris or Belgium&mdash;where you will not find a market by the way&mdash;you will have it at home. I suggest that there you will find a direct benefit to Irish agriculture. While it may be true&mdash;I think it probably is true&mdash;that the tax would not immediately have the effect of raising to the extent of half the demand for Irish-manufactured boots, there would be a steady increase.  I am prepared to believe that the workers in the country &mdash;and the farmers in the country ought, too&mdash;will be agreeable to pay the extra price for boots when they see a steady encroachment upon the number of the unemployed.  If they see 4,000 or 5,000 people taken out of that unemployed market they will know that there will be less competition for the jobs that are waiting, that their benefit would arise from the fact that the competition for jobs would be less intense, and that the position generally would be thereby improved. <Col N="124" /> I believe that it is a good thing for the country&mdash;quite apart from the immediate effect&mdash;that there should be employed in the manufacture of the things that are required in Ireland as many people as can be within a reasonable amount of expenditure-even a reasonable amount of additional expenditure, even a reasonable burden upon the country, if it is to be a burden.</P>
    <P>I think it is a good thing for the country that that burden should be borne, so that there will be a variety of occupations, and that we shall not be entirely dependent upon quality, or fashion, or style, but that we shall be able to manufacture things that we desire of the kind that we desire.  I am prepared to advocate, at any rate, that we should be prepared to pay something for that benefit.  I do not think that in the long run it will be an actual loss.  I believe that in the long run it will be a benefit all round.  I think the fact of employment being more general and more varied will remove this deadweight of unskilled, unemployed labour from the community's back.  If you have 4,000 or 5,000 people at present waiting for employment they are not living on air.  They are consuming something of the substance of the country. Whether they are getting it out of unemployment pay, living upon their neighbours, or robbing or begging, they are living somehow.  I say it is better that we should have to bear the cost of this possible £300,000 per year and employ regularly in actual productive operations another 5,000 persons than that we should have them hanging upon the necks of the community.</P>
    <P>While saying that, I would demur to the method of application and suggest, owing to the fact that home-manufactured boots are very much more likely to be in the rougher grades, that the incidence of the taxation should be heavier upon what may be called &ldquo;luxury boots.&rdquo;  The Minister may reply that the fact that it is an <i>ad valorem</i> duty will make it have a sliding-scale effect.  I would make the super-tax scale come into operation, and let the scale be higher when we come to the higher-priced boots, and lower when we come to the lower range of boots.  With that modification I would think the tax was quite satisfactory <Col N="125" /> as an application of a principle which I have been prepared to support.</P>
    <P>But there is another condition I want to touch upon, and upon which I shall have to enlarge at a later stage, and that is to ensure, that the conditions under which these protected boots are to be produced will be of a kind which will not mean the protection of a sweated industry.  There will of necessity have to be some provisions made to ensure that the proprietors of the boot factories which are to be protected shall be bound to adhere to a certain minimum standard of wages and conditions.  Unless that principle is applied, then the protective idea is going to be destructive and not helpful.</P>

      <P>I understood from the Minister's statement to-day that his object in imposing a 15 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty was to encourage the making of leather boots in the country. I see no reference to leather in the Resolution.  I do see that &ldquo;fifteen per cent. of the value of the article shall be charged, levied and paid on all boots, shoes, slippers, goloshes, sandals and clogs.&rdquo;  Goloshes are generally made of rubber.  Is this to be a protective tax on the rubber industry? Will &ldquo;rubbers,&rdquo; as they call them in America, be charged 15 per cent?  Can the man in the rubber trade avail himself of the rise in prices in order to impose that upon the consumer?  Will the Minister accept an amendment to the Resolution that will make it read this way: &ldquo;That a Customs duty of an amount equal to 15 per cent. of the value of the leather in the article shall be charged, etc.&rdquo;?</P>

If we are going to make an experiment I am very glad of it, and I will vote for the Resolution even as it stands, but it is <Col N="126" /> well that the Dáil should know what we are going to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Finance previously was he including rubber soles in this Resolution. Deputy O'Mara in a previous speechhis maiden speech, I believe, in the Dáil&mdash;began by telling us what this country has been doing for the agricultural community.  I think he said that the State had been showering out money on us and that we were the pampered element in the community. Any pampering that the agricultural element has ever got from the State has been in the nature of oil put on the agricultural machine so as to make it produce wealth, which the industrial element of the community&mdash;including the bacon curers&mdash;took particular, care to swallow up.  The Shaws, the Dennys, the Lunhams, and, I believe, the O'Maras, have all grown fat on the agricultural community.  The grants made and the monies expended were not for pampering the agricultural community, but for making the industry more efficient and a better wealth-producing machine.  That was the effect, and nothing else.  The Minister for Agriculture, speaking on this matter, referred to it as an experiment, and asked us would we be prepared to agree even to an experiment. We are not prepared to oppose it as an experiment, but we are certainly prepared to oppose it from the viewpoint contained in Deputy Sears' speech.</P>
      <P>His speech amounted to this&mdash;subsidise the poor bootmaker, the poor sweetmaker and Irish industries of every description.  It seemed to me to be more of the usual whine than anything else.  If Deputy Sears or if the Dáil agrees to subsidise all the industries in the State, then I agree.  This is not subsidising all the industries in the State.  It is not even an attempt to do it.  There are some industries that this State by tariffs cannot subsidise. They can only do so by direct taxation from the State, and except we are prepared to do that the agricultural community would have no return whatever from any tariffs the State can impose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> This, I take it, is an experiment, and as such we are not so bitterly opposed to it as we would be if it was a considered policy or the first instalment of such a policy.  As far as I see it, this is a question where one section of the community is subsidising another without any return.  The Minister for Agriculture was not quite fair to Deputy Heffernan when he referred to some of his remarks about barley.  Deputy Heffernan, I think, said that when the Minister was introducing these protective measures, he did not attempt to do anything for agriculture, not even for the one article that he could protect, if he chose, barley.  The Deputy made no demand for its protection.  He just instanced the fact that no attempt was made, even if the Minister could do it to subsidise anything in the nature of an agricultural product.  Any subsidy given to any industry ought to be a State subsidy, and not a class subsidy. That is what we object to.</P>
    <P>We have no objection at all to taking our part in subsidising anything that the people of the country decide to subsidise in the form of a State subsidy. When it comes to be a class or sectional subsidy, we will not have it if we can help it.  Professors say, &ldquo;we wear shoes as well as you.&rdquo;  They do, but it is the wealth-producing element of the community that directly or indirectly pays for the shoes.  We pay for our own shoes directly, and for other people's shoes indirectly.  We say that nobody has any right to force one section of the community to subsidise others. If this nation is prepared to subsidise one industry, then it had better begin by subsidising the industry that deserves to be subsidised more than any other, the industry that is almost starving at the moment.  That fact will be more apparent in one or two years' time when there may be a more serious proposition before the country.  Anyone who knows the country at the moment and any business man who knows the position of agriculture, realises that the people engaged in it are not able to pay their way.  The sooner that matter is taken up the better.</P>

Whatever money they have they made it by their own ability, and the farmers are in a position to sell their produce in England alive or dead to anyone they please.

      <P>I am afraid it is very unusual, but I want to say a word about Deputy Lyons' amendment.  It has been before the Dáil for more than two hours, but no one said a word about it, not even Deputy Lyons.  I am afraid the Minister for Finance when he comes to reply will overlook it.  In case it should be still-born I want to recall it to his mind.  I want to know whether the 5 per cent. that Deputy Lyons proposes will give effective protection to the boot trade.  Will it be sufficient to enable boot manufacturers to undertake new obligations and to induce British manufacturers, perhaps, to set up works over here?  I do feel if that is the case that there is a great deal to be said for Deputy Lyons' amendment.  This is an experiment which should be confined within limits.  It is admitted to be an experiment, and, therefore, provided the experiment is a fair one, one that will <Col N="129" /> give a proper test, we ought not to impose a greater burden on the consumer than is absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has always been absolutely frank when dealing with this fiscal question, and has always admitted that the duty has to be paid by the consumer in increased prices. I am very much afraid that the price will not only be increased by the duty but by something more; that the retailer will say, &ldquo;Our sales have been reduced, we are selling fewer boots; therefore, we must make a greater profit, as people are making their boots last longer.&rdquo;  While the duty may be 15 per cent. the price to the consumer may go up as high as 25 per cent.  That should be reduced as far as possible, and, therefore, if a protection of five per cent. will be effective in carrying out the object of the Government, then I hope they will see their way to accept Deputy Lyons' amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gorey would lead one to gather that his objection to the Finance Minister's proposition is that he has not applied Protection generally as a principle, but rather that he has applied it simply to one or two small sections, and I rather gathered that if he were to apply it generally as a principle he would have Deputy Gorey as a supporter.  The one thing that I did admire about the Minister's statement was the caution with which he used this two-edged sword known as Protection.  Those who are connected with, and have any experience of industry, are generally to be found of the opinion that, while Protection would be helpful and necessary in some industries, it would be ruinous in other industries, and to attempt to apply the principle of Protection generally to industry would, I am certain, have most disastrous results in this country of ours.  In this discussion it appears to me that Deputies have fallen into an error in assuming that because a protective tariff of fifteen per cent. is imposed in certain industries, the products of these industries will necessarily be raised in price by that amount.  Deputy Johnson did not go that far, because he said that it is the charge at the port that will be <Col N="130" /> subject to the duty, and he argued, very fairly, that the charge at the port would be approximately only 50 per cent. of the retail charge, and, consequently, the item would only carry 50 per cent. of the duty.  I cannot go that far with Deputy Johnson, and I will tell you why.</P>
      <P>We have, in our city and in certain districts in the Free State, manufacturers of boots.  These boot industries which are old established, are able to compete at the moment with the Northampton products.  If you go into their shops in the city you can buy a boot or a shoe that will compare favourably in quality and in price with the imported article.  There can be no question about that, and I can refer Deputies, if they have doubts about it, to these shops.  Let us take a very useful illustration. What has happened in other industries?  The putting of a duty on manufactured tobacco has led to the starting of a number of factories here. Before these industries started the selling prices of the particular items to which the duty applied was increased by the amount of the duty.  The moment the local factories got working the selling prices were reduced to what they had been before the duty was imposed.  I think Deputies will agree that that is so in connection with the tobacco industry: that we are now purchasing, as a result, at the same rate as before the factories were started.  On the face of that argument, is it fair to state, as a result of this tariff, which we hope will have the same effect in the boot industry, that the price of the products will be increased by the amount of the duty?  If so, what would be the use of setting up local factories at all? All the manufacturers would have to do would be to add the amount of the duty to the present price, and not set up any factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the point is really this, that in order to compete with the local industries the makers of boots and shoes on the other side will have to establish factories here and sell at the same rates as the local factories.  Therefore, I think on that argument it is hardly fair to say that you will add to the price of these commodities the amount of the duty.  In this discussion we have lost <Col N="131" /> sight of what I think was really in the mind of the Minister when he put forward this proposal.  It was not put forward with the object&mdash;though it may do so in the current year&mdash;of producing revenue.  It was, I think, put forward with the ultimate object of finding work for the many unemployed in the Free State, and that is what we hope will be one of the results that will accrue.  Taking that point of view, I cannot follow the logic of the Farmers' Party.  As a result of this unemployment, numbers are at present in receipt of outdoor relief through local taxes, and possibly also, in some cases, in receipt of unemployment benefit&mdash; some people will tell us, of course, that these things cannot happen, but they do happen in an extraordinary way in Ireland. You have unemployment a charge on the State funds, thereby increasing taxes.  You have also, through the Unions, charges on the local funds, thereby increasing rates.  Have not the farmers to pay both of these?  Is not one of the burdens they are suffering from at the moment the high local rates and high State taxes they are called upon to bear?  These taxes&mdash;both the local and the State&mdash;are considerably inflated by unemployment.</P>
    <P>Schemes such as this reduce the amount of unemployment; consequently they reduce the charges on the local authorities and the charge on the Stale, and thereby ease the farming industry of a heavy burden. Therefore, I say to the farmers, that this will benefit them, and possibly will benefit them very much more materially than some of them are aware of.  Suggestions have been made whereby this tariff could be modified.  I think Deputy Cooper suggested that the rate could be modified to ten per cent. for three years, and I take it his idea is that after three years it should disappear.  A modification, to my mind, would defeat the object that the Minister has in view, that is, that in setting up a protective tariff, if you do not make it a real tariff you will not effect your object, and rather than set up a local industry and give local employment, you will find that many of the manufacturers would be in favour of paying the lower tariff. <Col N="132" /> Another proposal, which I think came from the same Deputy, was that the tariff should not apply to boots and shoes selling at a price less than ten shillings.  What would be the effect of that?  We would have our shops flooded with poor, cheap, shoddy stuff, because it could come in free from the tariff.  Neither of these proposals, to my mind, would be wise.  I am against a lowering of the tariff, and I am against fixing a price below which the tariff would not apply.</P>
    <P>The question of Australia has been mentioned.  I think Australia is an excellent example to quote in connection with this particular proposal, because Australia, as we all know, is an agricultural country.  Australia, ten or fifteen years ago, was one of the best markets for the Northampton boot industry. Australia at that particular time exported practically all its hides. It decided that it was an unwise policy to export this raw material, and as a result it set up a protective tariff against leather goods of thirty per cent.  I happened to be a member at the time of the Council of the Associated Chambers of Commerce in London, and I remember very distinctly the strong protest that was made by that Council on behalf of the North-amptonshire boot industry against this Australian tariff.</P>
    <P>We brought all the pressure it was possible to bring on that Dominion, and the only advantage we could get from them after strong pressure had been applied for a considerable time was that they would give a preferential tariff to the mother country of 10 per cent., that is, they charged 20 per cent. tariff against goods from the mother country, while they charged 30 per cent. against goods from other countries.  What was the result of the application of that tariff?  Inside of ten years Australia is manufacturing all her own boots, and, in addition, a large quantity of leather goods.  One of the last things I had to do with on the Council on the other side was to make a protest against the Colony of South Africa for lowering its duty in favour of Australian leather goods, which shows that not alone had Australia supplied its own markets, but <Col N="133" /> that it was now becoming one of the most formidable competitors for leather goods in the South African market.  I do not say the same would apply to the Free State, though we would like it to apply; but it is an argument that occurs to one, and I think the experience that they have had there in a country similar to the Free State is an experience that possibly would be useful to us.  While I am using that argument, I want again to make it clear that I am not a supporter of the principle of Protection as a general principle.  I want to finish up with the statement I made when I started, that Protection is a two-edged sword.  It would materially benefit certain industries, and should be applied to those industries, whereas if applied to other industries it might be followed with disastrous results.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to supplement the very able statement that has been made by Deputy Good, with whom I find myself very largely in agreement on this very important subject.  If my recollection is correct, there is an earlier example than the one he quoted.  I think some five years previous to the time he mentioned the same experiment was made by Australia with regard to matches.  The result was that no matches were imported into Australia, and the Australian people benefited accordingly. While I agree with what he said when he spoke of the farmers, I think he might have developed that a little more.  In this matter of fiscal policy it is not a question of Free Trade or Protection, one way or the other; it is a question of what are the needs of the country, rather, and how best the Parliament of the country can serve these needs.  I take off my hat to the farming industry.  I represent two counties, which are examples of very good farming industrialists; but I would like to point this out, that it is not by placing yourselves under the umbrella of the farming industry in the one case or the brewing industry in another, or the boot and shoe industry in a third, but in considering the whole needs of the entire country that we can get anything like a conception of what the country needs.  Is <Col N="134" /> it the contention of the Farmers' Party that the industry itself is to be considered, irrespective of the persons engaged therein?  Is it contended that if we have a farming population of two millions this year, and that in three or four years' time that population increases to, say, three or four millions, that the increased population is to be condemned, if we might say so, to the farming industry?</P>
      <P>It is well known to those on the Farmers' Benches that that is not the case, that there are a large number of farmers' sons and daughters who take on other occupations, and taking on other occupations their needs, requirements and rights as citizens must be respected.  In that case, then, we must look to industry, or some other form of occupation, for the surplus population of the farming community.  If you are going to do that, then I think you cannot say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You must not look after any other industry than ours, as we are the largest wealth-producing industrial population in the country.&rdquo;  Some four or five years ago a very prominent Pressman in England, in reviewing the Irish situation, pointed out that one of the real causes of complaint on the part of Irishmen was that they had no opportunities in their own country of getting a decent livelihood, and while the farming community are entitled to every consideration, and, I think, they get a fair share of that consideration, they ought not to shut their eyes to the fact that we have Universities instructing a great many members of their families, and exporting them; and the question, after all, is whether, reviewing and reconsidering our fiscal problems and position we might not enable the sons of farmers to get a livelihood in their own country, by which they would be of much better advantage to this country as a consequence.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that we in the Farmers' Party, and I think I know the Party fairly well, are not absolutely confirmed Free Traders.  We believe that in certain conditions it might be advisable for the country to institute a measure of protection, and we would be prepared under certain conditions to support such a measure, being perfectly conscious all the time that we were paying for it out of our own pockets.  Putting <Col N="136" /> the interests of the country before the interests of our particular section, we would be ready to bear the necessary expense, if we considered it to the interests of the country.  But, we believe that in the present condition of agriculture we are quite unable to bear even a halfpenny extra expense, and we believe, rightly or not, that agriculture will have to bear the expense of Protection. A lot of talk has taken place about this being an experiment.  It is all very fine to talk about its being experimental, but I think no instance can be found of any country that once started Protection being able to give it up.  I say no country was able to give it up, not that &ldquo;no country wanted to give it up.&rdquo;  We are like a man who starts toboganning down a steep snowy hill.  Once he gets started he will gather speed as he goes along.  I believe once we start Protection we cannot pull up.  You start by an experiment on boots, an experiment on confectionery and bottles.  What will you have next?  There will be a clamour around the lobbies of this House.  You will have every manufacturer of every article that was ever thought of lobbying in this House to get special protection. Can you stop it?  I do not believe you can.  I believe we have definitely embarked on the protective issue, whether for good or evil, and back of it we never can go.  The Minister for Agriculture talked about the question of barley.</P>

      <P>I will skip that. Deputy Good was able to produce an instance of a boot manufacturer in Dublin who was able to compete with the English manufacturers, thereby showing that it would be an excellent thing for the boot manufacturers to have protection.  I would like to ask him if these manufacturers are able to compete with English manufacturers, why do they ask for protection? If they can compete, why not enlarge their factories and still go on competing and selling in the English market? No protection at all is required in such an instance.  Deputy Good is also <Col N="137" /> very anxious to relieve unemployment by a system of protection.  I was very glad to see that he recognised that the farmers by means of rates and taxes have to bear practically the full burden of unemployment.  What Deputy Good means to suggest is that we should change the burden from one hand to the other&mdash;that instead of bearing it by means of rates and taxes we should in the future bear it by means of protective duties.  I suppose we might as well pay it by one means as by the other.</P>

      <P>I did not misunderstand the Deputy at all.  I acknowledge that, but it will not reduce the burden.  We are told that we ought to look after the population that will be here in ten years' time.  Where will the farming community be in ten years?  Where will their banking accounts be in ten years?  What financial condition will they be in in ten years? I think it is quite enough to look after the population we have got without worrying about the population we will have in ten or twenty years' time. There is ample room for development in the farming industry and for more employment, provided it gets a chance, provided it is relieved of the burden it has to bear and provided the farmers are not crushed by excessive taxes, excessive rates and excessive protective duties, and that they will be able to carry on their business in a productive manner, but not under the conditions that are obtaining at present, and to increase the volume of output at the least possible cost, doing without labour, doing without everything that can possibly be avoided.  I believe these conditions will continue if this protective tariff is placed on the country.</P>

      <P>When I proposed the amendment to delete 15 per cent. and substitute 5 per cent.  I understood it was only necessary to give a class of protection to Irish manufacturers.  If you can raise £300,000 by a tax of fifteen per cent., surely the £100,000 <Col N="138" /> that you would raise by a tax of five per cent. would be sufficient in the coming year.  Deputy Johnson advocated tariffs.  I agree that it will be necessary to protect every industry in the country that it is possible to give protection to.  If a tariff of 15 per cent. will mean the giving of employment to 25,000 people, I do not see why a tariff of 5 per cent. would not have the very same effect.  I cannot see why all this farming question has to be brought into the question, of tariffs on boots.  We have heard enough this evening about the taxes that have to be borne by the poor farmers.</P>

      <P>I can speak of the boots they wear, I suppose.  If a pair of boots that farmers wear in the Saorstát cost 3/- more than a pair a farmer wears in the North, I do not see how that is going to give the farmer in the Saorstát an opportunity to pay the dole to the unemployed.  If these people would only give more employment in the way of extra tillage, I do not think we would have to pay so much.  for the unemployment dole to labouring men. The amendment I propose I certainly think will meet with the good wishes of the Minister for Finance.  The object of the amendment is to reduce the tax to 5 per cent. for the protection of the trade.  If that is accepted it will mean an increase of £100,000 spread over the small amount of citizens of the Saorstát.  It would be an extra tax upon them, and surely if up to the present moment we have done everything in our power to try to economise and to make a few citizens the direct victims of economy by a reduction of salaries and wages and pensions, it is only right now that we should be given some opportunity of saving a little, but in place of this we are proposing an increase to their expenditure.</P>

      <P>I am sure that 5 per cent. would be sufficient to meet the wishes of the workers.  I quite agree <Col N="139" /> with Deputy Johnson when he said that the working community of men and women in the Saorstát would be quite prepared in order to see 5,000 fellow-workers in employment and taken away from the tantalising system of the Labour Exchanges, to pay an increased duty of 15 per cent.  But we must first find some method of putting the 15 per cent. into the pockets of the people that we are desirous of taking it from.  At present the workers in Ireland cannot possibly afford to pay 3s. in the £ extra for their boots.  I sincerely hope the Minister for Finance will seriously consider the question of this amendment, and that he will reduce the 15 per cent. to 5 per cent., which, in my opinion, will meet the wishes of the majority of Deputies.  It would not in any shape or form reduce the revenue which the Exchequer is so very anxious to increase at the present time by reduction of wages.</P>

      <P>I want to take particular exception to the statement made by the President with regard to our attitude upon this matter.  He said our attitude was that we always say you shall pay no attention to any industry in this country except ours.  No one knows better than the President that that is not our attitude.  We have never complained that you should protect every industry but ours, or put forward any contention that no industry but ours should be protected.  We say to him now, and we say it all the time, you are not able to protect our industry, and protection is not able to protect our industry.  We have made no claim, and the statement that he made is absolutely misleading and absolutely wrong.  It is not our attitude, and he knows it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is that this tax should be reduced from 15 to 5 per cent.  I do not think a 5 per cent. duty would be anything more than a revenue duty.  It would not lead to the Irish bootmakers taking steps to increase their output, or lead to the bootmaker from outside coming in here and establishing factories. I believe 15 per cent. is the least figure that would give us any good prospect of the extension of the <Col N="140" /> industry that we desire.  It is undoubtedly a fact that this tax imposed for protection purposes will have a considerable value as a revenue tax in the beginning, but we have set that off by a reduction of the tea duty. So far as we are able to calculate, the two amounts will about balance, and the figures that have been given to indicate that the average family will pay about three times as much in the increased price in boots as will be set off by the reduced price of tea, do not give a correct view of the position. The difference will not go into the Exchequer, and as the possibility of the extension of the Irish boot industry inside a year is not so great, it will not go into the pockets of the boot manufacturers.  Some particular families may gain more by the reduction of the tea duty than they will lose by the increased price of boots.  In other families where there are young children who will be playing hopscotch they may lose more by the increased price of boots; but, taking it all round, the family budget will not be appreciably affected one way or another.  Deputy Good has dealt with the point of an <i>ad valorem</i> duty and with the point of excluding a certain class of boots.  I do not think that that is possible or desirable, and I think the only thing to do is to let the tax fall upon the entire range of the commodity. Later on it might be possible to make some further adjustment in taxation, but I think that it would not be practicable at the moment to do anything but to put a 15 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> tax on all classes of goods. We cannot say how long the experiment may last; it must certainly last for some years.  It would not be possible at all to get any results if the experiment was to end at the end of a year.  On the other hand, this is an industry for which this country seems to be suited.  It is an industry in which this country should be able to compete with any other country, and, consequently, we must look forward to a time when it would be possible to remove this tax and when the Irish boot industry would stand upon its own feet.  Possibly we may always have to import a certain class of boots, <Col N="141" /> but, on the other hand, we may extend our manufacture and export trade.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a Customs duty of an amount equal to thirty-three and one-third per cent. of the value of the article shall be charged, levied, and paid on all empty bottles of glass coloured green or black, imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 12th May, 1924.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the Dáil, in moving this Resolution, that it would, I think, be more convenient, if it were possible, to get an agreement to finish to-night.  I think it will be very inconvenient for some Deputies to come here to-morrow.  If it were possible to finish to-night, so far as 18 Resolutions were concerned, Resolution No. 19 could be adjourned until the Dáil would next meet.  That would mean that a discussion of the general question could be held over, and it could be dealt with later at length.  Then individual Resolutions could be dealt with on Report, when Deputies would have more time to consider them, and when they could bring forward reasoned amendments. If any Resolution is not confirmed, even if the duty is collected in the meantime, that duty will have to be repaid, so that no one is prejudiced in the matter.</P>

      <P>What I would like to know, speaking on this Resolution, is what is the present value of the output of bottles and the present value of the bottles at present imported into Ireland?  There is one other matter about this glass bottle resolution. I am not a sufficient judge of antiques, but I am glad that the Deputy for Waterford is in his place.  He can tell us about the Waterford glass industry. I think if glass is to be protected at all, it seems a pity that the Waterford glass, which was a very valuable industry in the old days, should be omitted from this Resolution.  It seems that we have now an opportunity, in a very easy way, of resurrecting a very old and profitable industry, and I am glad that the Deputy for Waterford is here.</P>

      <P>I agree with the general proposition of the Minister that we should get the Resolutions formally passed to-night.  But I think that while that is desirable that we should not merely pass them without any consideration.  I think it would help the discussion at a later stage if the Minister would give us some information, when he is moving the Resolutions, as to the effect of the various proposals, that is, that he should give us what is the quantity and the value of these imports, and what is likely to be the effect of the Resolutions.  I am afraid that the method of treating these Resolutions, especially when dealing with new duties&mdash;of merely moving them in a formal way&mdash;is not going to assist the Dáil and will not make it easier for the discussion on the Report Stage.  The Minister and his Department are the only persons who know <Col N="144" /> anything about the glass and bottle industry so far as it may be affected by Customs duty.  We have certain rough estimates of what may be counted the glass bottle industry in the Saorstát. But they are only guesses.  The Minister probably knows something on the matter.  Will he tell the Dáil what he knows about the possibilities and about the number of dozens or hundreds of bottles that are likely to be affected? What is the consumption?  What is the value, and, for instance, why does the Resolution confine itself to glass coloured green or black?  It was suggested to me, for instance, that the object of this Resolution may be very well evaded or destroyed by other or differently coloured bottles being imported, and that while green or black coloured bottles may be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The importers, to save their trade, will immediately turn to other coloured bottles inasmuch as Belgian, or perhaps German, bottles can be produced of different colours, and it will be simply a matter of price and advertisement, as to whether the Irish customers will continue purchasing green, black, blue, white or any other colour.  It will be entirely a matter then for the kind of competition that the German or Belgian maker will put into the market.  The Minister may have a perfect reply to this, but surely he has got a right to tell us something about the duty before he asks the Dáil formally to pass this resolution.</P>

      <P>I wanted to ask something of the same nature as Deputy Johnson has raised, because one is accustomed to see blue Winchester quartz bottles, and what I would call white or colourless Winchester quartz. What I want to ask is would the ordinary medicine bottle be exempt?  That has a greenish shade connected with it. Would that come under the resolution? I would require more information as to the kind of bottle that he calls green or black.  There are bottles that are different from the Winchester quartz. Many of these Winchester quartz are coloured blue.  Then there are others <Col N="145" /> that are used for poisons.  I think it is quite possible, as Deputy Johnson said, that the Germans or the Belgians may come in with their bottles tinged with these colours.  If the Minister would say what type of bottles he means, I am quite in agreement with the Resolution to put on the customs duties so as to bring back the bottle industry here. We heard a great deal about this when the Food Commission was sitting. We heard that there was great trouble in getting bottles of this kind.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw attention to the wording of this Resolution. I do not think it is quite clear. Take the word &ldquo;empty.&rdquo;  I would like to know would bottles containing water be exempt from duty?  The omission or inclusion of the word &ldquo;empty&rdquo; may make a big difference. In its present form it will mean that they will be duty free, that is if the bottles were filled.  Is it a matter of indifference what the bottle contains? The implication is that if you filled bottles with water or anything else, that, then, they would come in duty free.  I suggest as an alternative to strike out the word &ldquo;empty,&rdquo; and to add the words, &ldquo;except such bottles as contained <i>bona fide</i> commodities.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention governing the insertion of the word &ldquo;empty&rdquo; was to exclude bottles that were imported merely as containers and to let the tax fall on bottles that were imported as bottles for purposes of being filled when they arrive.  This is one case in which it is particularly difficult to give accurate information to the Dáil in regard to the quantity of bottles that will be affected.  The import figure for bottles and jars shows the value of £9,000 in the month of January last, or about £96,000 a year.  However, that might include, and does include, a considerable number of bottles which would not come under this particular duty.  The purpose of confining the duties to glass coloured green or black was that protection might be given at any rate in the first instance to the type of bottle which existing bottle manufacturers <Col N="146" /> can make, and which they say they can make satisfactorily and hold the market with, if they were given a degree of protection.  That protection is required mainly from the bottles manufactured on the Continent, not from English bottles.  In the case of this particular duty, when it comes up for reconsideration next year, if it is felt then desirable to continue the experiment, it might be regarded as desirable to extend the charge to all bottles, so that if possible not only the bottle industry, but the glass industry, might grow up in the country.  I do not know whether it would be possible at all to revive an industry such as the Waterford Glass Industry.  But in the meantime there are factories here which make a particular type of bottle.  It seems as if this industry, which has existed for a long time in the country, was destined, if something is not done at the present moment, to go out of existence completely. The duty is imposed to prevent that, and to give an opportunity for the extension, and for the opening, perhaps, of new factories in other parts of the country, and ultimately we hope to lead to the extension and alteration of the scope of the entire industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of revenue to be derived from this particular tax, it is anticipated, will be very small.  The industry dealt with is not a large industry, and the tax may be reckoned as a minor one.  I would not like at the moment to risk stating to the Dáil what would be the value of imports of bottles that would come under the title &ldquo;green and black.&rdquo;  I will be able to give that when the Resolution will be under discussion on Report.  It is not a very large sum in any case.  The question of whether we shall alter the description so that other bottles which might be coloured, say, purple, might be included in case there was danger of the tax being evaded will be carefully considered. It is not intended that the term &ldquo;green&rdquo; should include ordinary medicine bottles, or bottles that are really clear glass, but which may have a greenish tinge.  There was formerly a tax on bottles of green and coloured glass.  The phraseology was adapted, and it may in present circumstances be <Col N="147" /> necessary to extend that, perhaps, to all coloured glass.  But the reason we do not put in &ldquo;coloured glass&rdquo; at the moment is, that there are bottles, I think, imported for the purpose of holding poison which are blue and of peculiar shape, and we do not desire that these particular bottles should be taxed. It may be possible to amend the phraseology of this Resolution in some particular way, though I think that it probably will stand and it probably will serve its purposes sufficiently.  The competing firms are not likely to find it profitable to manufacture bottles, especially for a small market like this, and colour lots of bottles in any particular way.  The market here is unlikely to be big enough to make that possible to be done.</P>

      <P>I regret, from my reading of this Resolution, that it does not refer to the Waterford glass industry, which has, unfortunately, been extinct for at least half a century, but it was not in any way concerned with the making of bottles.  It was rather of a more high-class distinction, and went in for chandeliers and decanters. However that may be, that fact will not make me oppose this Resolution as such.  But I think we are entitled to a little more information, and I cannot see why, if green or black bottles are to be taxed coming into this country, white and yellow and green ones should not also be taxed.  If this resolution is to bring about a revival of the bottle-making industry, as I presume it is meant to, it looks very like as if it was in some way a sort of subsidy towards Ringsend, and I say good luck to it.  But I do not see that any reason has been given to us why it should be confined to green or black bottles.  Green or black bottles, we are told are made mostly on the Continent, and white and other colours probably come from England.  But because white and other coloured bottles are made in England is not, in my opinion, sufficient reason why we should put a tariff on them.  However that may be, I think we are entitled, at any rate, to know in the first place the extent of the industry in Ireland at present, what has been the decrease, if any, for the last few years, what have been the reasons for that decrease, and what hope there is, by this imposition, of reviving an industry which is now almost, I think, upon its last legs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain that a little later.  The Minister, I suppose, <Col N="149" /> is expected to go round the country examining industries, see how they are getting on and find out how much they need to keep them open.  What is likely to be the result of a policy such as that?  In the first place there is going to be no great effort at local efficiency. There are improvements which may be effected in business, but they will be postponed, so that there will be still greater advantages derived when the taxes, which local interests will bring to the notice of the Minister as a necessity, are imposed.  For something like two years the Ministry has had many representations from business people engaged in manufacture, industry, and so on, and every argument and every reason that could possibly be imagined was put forward for subsidies or tariffs, or some other advantages being given to these industries or manufactures, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case we do know that during the war a very considerable business was done in Ringsend.  My information during the last ten years was that a very considerable amount of machinery was installed there and considerable employment given, because at that time it was impossible to import glass bottles.  Now, when commerce is free from the restrictive influence of the war, we find that with a normal currency here and an abnormal currency in other countries, the industry of this country, in some respects, is at a disadvantage. We are seeking to remedy that.  But it is not possible, and it will not be possible for many years, for a Minister for Finance to make the exhaustive inquiries that are asked for here as a reason why he should impose tariffs or give subsidies.  What is likely to happen?  The Minister sends down somebody into a factory.  Somebody will ask, &ldquo;Who is that who was here to-day?&rdquo; and it will come out ultimately that he was from the Government. Then it will be said that the Government is going either to subsidise the industry or to impose a tariff. That will get out amongst the persons who purchase the goods, and it will spread to such an extent that when the tariff is imposed, we are imposing it on a three or six months' supply, instead of a twelve months' supply.  It is not <Col N="150" /> possible to make the necessary exhaustive inquiries without disclosing what-your purpose is.  Anybody who has had any experience of Budgets and of their effects, knows that quite well.  I remember on many occasions hearing of small fortunes being made by people who anticipated a Budget correctly.  I am sure Deputy Good or Deputy Hewat, who are business men, must also have heard of that.</P>

      <P>And I think Deputy Redmond also.  It is a fact that this particular industry in Rings-end&mdash;the last of its kind in the country perhaps&mdash;is in grave danger through no fault of its management.  I understand that its management is good, that the output is good, and that there is no real fault to be found; but that it is due to the peculiar circumstances of our time.  It is for those reasons that the Minister put forward his proposal. He has not been in communication with the firm, and the firm knows nothing of this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Minister has had access to the facts and figures placed before the Fiscal Committee. I congratulate the Minister upon this Resolution.  What the President has said is quite true.  You have here an industry which for many years was behindhand in attempting to compete against the machine-manufactured bottles with hand-made bottles.  In recent years they have seen the error of that and have established a very efficient bottle-making industry.  It may surprise certain Deputies that the employer in this business says that the men are perfectly satisfactory.  He has not one fault to find with the men in their output or their rate of wages or their demand for higher wages. That is a form of business that ought to be commended and encouraged. What I want to make sure is that <Col N="151" /> while it may be necessary to introduce this Motion in its present form, now that the cat is out of the bag, we can surely look for some kind of collaboration on the part of the people engaged in the industry so that the final Motion will be of a kind which will not allow the purpose of the Motion to be evaded.  There should be some change made either in the final Resolution or in the Finance Bill so that there cannot be any evasion.  I hope the Minister will consult with those concerned with a view to arriving at a formula which will ensure that the object sought for will be attained.  One other question I would like to ask is: whether this Resolution is to come into operation from the 5th or the 12th May?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>From the 12th.  The actual amounts involved are not very large.  We really will not be ready to bring in the other duties so soon, but there are large sums of money involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself this evening clothed in sackcloth and ashes because I have been placed in the position of supporting the Government in entering on the slippery slope of protection. As things have developed it would seem that having started on that slope the Government will be compelled to go the whole hog for protection all round.  On this question of glass bottles it is true that during the war there was a very considerable boom in home production.  The slump that took place following the war in this industry is a slump that has been equally detrimental to the very big bottle industry in Great Britain.  In other words, there has been a collapse all round in that industry.  That, I think, is largely due to competition brought about by depreciated currencies.  I do not think that any tariff we can impose will act as a protective tariff against the importation of foreign bottles.  The difference in price is so great that even a duty of 33? per cent. will not, in my judgment, shut out foreign bottles. Deputy Johnson was congratulating himself on the harmony that existed in the industry in Ringsend.  May I inform <Col N="152" /> him that one of the two bottle industries in Ringsend was shut down owing to a strike, when the men left about £400 worth of glass to be wasted in the tank.  That does not show such a happy position as Deputy Johnson would have us believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>The position as far as Ringsend is concerned is this: The Ringsend Bottle Company were blowing with the lungs of the gentlemen engaged in that occupation, and it is that bottle industry that was shut down by the strike, the men going out at a moment's notice, and leaving about £400 worth of hot glass ready for use in the tank.  I dare say the effect was a very good one.  If strikes had always the good effect this strike had, perhaps we would encourage strikes.  The actual effect was that the directors of this company have since installed modern machinery, and are ready to start work at any moment.  The other firm, at an earlier stage, in fact during the war, installed modern machinery, but have not been in any better position so far as the prosperity of the industry is concerned. I take it that the reason the Resolution specifies glass coloured green or black is because in Ringsend they confine themselves to the making of what is commonly known as the porter bottle.  It is very familiar by the colour being black or dark green.  I hope the effect that the Minister for Finance expects to achieve by this duty will materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make my position clear, as in voting for this and the other Resolutions I am voting against my better judgment.  I am voting for the experiment, as the Minister for Finance put it, but I am very much afraid&mdash;and I hope it will be a warning to the country&mdash;that in this Finance Bill we are entering on a course of protection which will tend very largely to increase the cost of living as a whole. Whether that is good or bad, I think <Col N="153" /> as an education the experiment will be a very valuable one.  I hope it will result in people realising that the experiment cannot stop where it is.  I may say that this evening, after the adjournment, I was met by a man who asked&mdash;When bottles and other things were being protected, why not matches?  According to the information I received, it is much more important that matches should be protected. That will apply to every industry as far as I know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words in reply to the President. The case made for the institution of this duty is that the Continental Exchanges are operated in such a way as to blot out this industry.  You would imagine that the President, who is looking after the interests of the nation as a whole, would not differentiate in favour of a small, insignificant industry like this one, and neglect a large industry against which the Exchanges are operating adversely.  At the present time the Danish krone is 27 to the £, with the result that the Danish pig is selling at £3 in England. £3 is paid for the Danish pig in England, and when that is turned into krones it becomes £4 10s.  Paddy's pig, when it is sold in England, brings back only £3.  There is no word about the effect of the foreign Exchanges on our agricultural industry.  For a small, insignificant industry we have a Customs Resolution that will impose a duty of 33? per cent.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That a Customs duty of an amount equal to 10 per cent. of <Col N="154" /> the value of the article shall be charged, levied and paid on all soap, soap substitutes, and soap powder imported into Saorstát Eireann on and after the 1st July.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This date has been fixed so far back because of the actual difficulties of administration that these new duties will involve.  I believe that the staff will be put to the pin of its collar to deal with the other duties that come into operation at an earlier date.  The amount of protection is not very much, but there is no possibility of making the duty operative sooner than the date fixed. The imports of soap are valued for something like £200,000 per annum, and it is not anticipated that a very considerable revenue will be obtained. A revenue may be obtained on the fancy varieties of soaps.  The various types of toilet soaps may still continue to be imported.  It is not anticipated that the imports of ordinary household soaps will continue to be very large after the imposition of the duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The President spoke with great eloquence on the last Resolution about people who have made money by importing goods in anticipation of a duty, with the result that only three or six months' revenue was obtained.  As a result of the postponing of the coming into force of this duty until the 1st July, I can prophesy that the Minister will get no revenue at all.  Soap is not perishable.  There is ample time between now and the 1st July for the retailers of the country to import the whole of the soap that is needed for the next twelve months and to store it here.  But though the State will get no revenue and the manufacturers will get no protection, the retailers will put on the price and say: &ldquo;Of course, there is a duty now.&rdquo; Really, I think if the Minister's machinery is not ready he should not introduce these duties.  He should prepare his machinery and introduce the duties next year.  It is absolutely farcical to say we are going to start levying a duty more than two months hence.  That duty will be forestalled and anticipated, and the revenue will not gain.  The only person that will gain is the middleman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is confident that very little soap will be imported, and that the manufacturers will manufacture sufficient for the requirements of the country, does it not follow that the traders should be obliged to sell the imported soap at the same price as they paid for it before the duty was put on? That is that the duty would not affect the price of soap at all.  That is the argument we have been hearing all night, and should it not apply in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>If a manufacturer can manufacture soap here as cheaply as the imported stuff, why does he not do it now?  He would save the cost of transport.  He obviously imports soap because the soap is cheaper, but what he will do will be to import a whole year's supply without paying the duty, and he will reap an additional profit.  That may be one way of encouraging Irish manufacture, but I submit it is a very bad way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MARA</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know the sources of the information from which the Minister has picked soap out of a thousand and one other things that could be selected.  The soap industry is in the hands of Lord Leverhulme and Lever Brothers.  They have, I think, bought up a soap factory in Cork, they bought up two or three in Dublin, and they have bought them all over the place.  A tax of 10 per cent on soap means putting 10 per cent. into Lord Leverhulme's pockets.  The number of men employed in making soap is very small.  Why should soap be picked out over and above a hundred other articles, in the manufacture of which a number of men could be employed and unemployment could be substantially relieved, in order to put 10 per cent. into the pockets of a trust?  As I understand the soap industry, there is only one real competitor for this firm, except <Col N="156" /> the small soap boiler, of which we have one or two here, who pick up fats from the local butchers, and that is the manufacturers of the soap so largely advertised, Palm Olive, made in America. There are two world-wide trusts, and the effect of this tax will be that it will put 10 per cent. into the pockets of one trust in order to keep up the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some point in Deputy Cooper's statement. The Dáil as a whole would be reassured if it could have some prophecy as to what was to be contained in the proposed Profiteering Bill.  It may be that the Minister has in mind that that will be the method of preventing these excessive charges being imposed upon the community in this interim period.  If he has not intended to do so, I hope that the hint will have effect.  I believe in the case of soap manufacturing this, again, is a wise imposition.  I take it that the Minister is satisfied that 10 per cent. will effect his purpose.  I am told that, as a matter of practice, while certain of the soap factories in the Saorstát belong to the same firm as Sunlight Soap, the factories in the Saorstát are merely used as a means of preventing anybody else manufacturing; that they are used for by-products, and so the best use is not being made of them; that they have been kept at a kind of trade which is not to the advantage of the Saorstát, and have only employed one-fifth of the people formerly employed when they were in the hands of Barringtons. The effect of this tariff may well be to turn the scale as to whether the soap shall be manufactured in Cheshire or in Dublin.  I think it will have the latter effect, and as a consequence this country will benefit.  It is not an amount that will make much difference to the actual consumer.  I think it is a small tax which will have the effect of improving the output here without adding much to the consumer, and I commend the Minister for this proposition.</P>

    <P>This, again, is a tax that cannot be imposed immediately, but the amount of the duty is small.  It is, of course, an industry that is associated with the soap industry, and it is anticipated that the result will be that a considerable manufacture of candles will be transferred to the Saorstát.

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I want to make a protest against the imposition of a tax for which the machinery of collection does not exist.  It is, as far as I know, an absolutely unheard of procedure that people should be given two months' warning that a tax is to be imposed, and encouraged to import, and anticipate and forestall it.  This is simply an encouragement to the profiteer to import.  I agree with what Deputy O'Mara, in one of his series of maiden speeches delivered to-day, has said, that it is well that we should know what we are doing.  We are taxing the most backward parts of the country.  We are not taxing the city dweller, who has gas or electric light. We are taxing the poorest parts of the country where they have to light a candle to go to bed.  I think that consideration should have entered into the mind of the Minister before he suggested the imposition of this tax.  I myself am a very old-fashioned and eccentric person, and I have a certain affection for antique furniture.  I personally have an affection for candle light, and I burn candles whenever I can.  I prefer them to gas, and I do not mind paying the tax.  But it is a very different proposition where you are dealing with mountainy men, who must either use lamps or candles, and it is more economic for them to use candles. I think we should consider the incidence of the tax as well as the encouragement which it may give, because we have no assurance that any encouragement will <Col N="158" /> be given to the candle-making industry in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall cease on and after the 26th day of April, 1924, to apply to unmanufactured tobacco, and on and after that date the Customs duty on unmanufactured tobacco shall in all cases be charged at the full rate of duty applicable thereto.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> The quantity of tobacco affected by this is but a little more than one-tenth of the total tobacco consumed in the country, and is something less than one-tenth in value of the total amount of unmanufactured tobacco.  It is mostly the coarser sort of tobacco that competes with the home-grown product. There seems to be no very good reason why we should continue the Imperial preference in regard to this particular product, and, on the other hand, if we have given one-sixth off to the growers in Nyasaland, without any direct return, or any consideration of commercial good-will being involved, there seems to be no good reason why we should not continue the one-sixth off what our home growers have, so that they will in future have something like 1/6 in the £ protection, and we will thereby be giving the Irish tobacco industry, I think, all the chance that should properly be given to it.  If it cannot flourish or get going with this particular preference, then there seems to be no hope of any real permanent future for it.</P>

      <P>I desire to congratulate the Minister on this Resolution. For many years, in another place, I was associated with those who were endeavouring to secure what he is now trying to bring about, namely, that the Irish growers of tobacco should be given preferential rather than equal treatment to those in other parts of the British Empire.  I think there is no reason why we should favour tobacco grown in Nyasaland, and from my knowledge of even the small amount of tobacco grown in this country, we are able to grow as good a tobacco of that class and character as we get imported from that country. It is true Irish tobacco is not suitable for the manufacture of all classes of cigarettes and cigars, but it is also true that it is quite suitable for admixture along with other classes of Virginia tobacco for pipe-smoking. I think it is a very desirable Resolution.  I trust it will meet with the acceptance and approval of the Dáil, and I hope it will prove, as the Minister stated, that we can grow tobacco in this country, and grow it <Col N="160" /> profitably, for the benefit of producers and consumers.</P>

      <P>That sub-section (4) (which exempts certain motor cars and component parts of motor cars from the new import duties therein mentioned) of section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, shall not apply</P>
      <P>
        <i>(a)</i>  to any motor cars constructed and adapted for use and intended to be used solely as motor omnibuses or in connection with the conveyance of goods or burden in the course of trade or husbandry, or</P>
      <P>
        <i>(b)</i>  to any bodies or component parts of bodies, for any such motor cars,</P>
      <P>imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 1st day of July, 1924: Provided that where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that any motor car, imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the said 1st day of July, 1924, and on which customs duty has been duly paid, is constructed and adapted for use and is intended to be used solely as a motor omnibus or in connection with the conveyance of goods or burden in the course of trade or husbandry, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to such conditions (if any) as they may think fit to impose, repay such proportion of the customs duty so paid on such motor car as they shall determine to have been paid in respect of the chassis and accessories (if any) of such motor car.</P>
      <P>It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Resolution means that the tax will be paid on the car coming in, but that a rebate will be given in respect of the value of the chassis.  I do not think that there is likely to be profiteering <Col N="161" /> in this respect.  The sort of people who will be buying these vehicles before the tax comes into operation will know exactly what they ought to pay, and I think you will not have any cases of people here overcharging before the tax comes into operation.  On the other hand, I do not think that we can anticipate that as many vehicles as may be required for the year will be rushed into the country in the next month or so. These are not the sort of commodities that are so rushed in.  Last year, I think, about a month elapsed from the time it became known that the duty on ordinary motor cars would apply in the Saorstát, and in spite of the fact that there was a considerable rushing in of motor cars, there was still enough imported after the tax came into operation to enable us to collect £256,000, so that even if there is an extra month, when there is only the body involved and not the chassis&mdash;and, of course, the body of many commercial vehicles, is a comparatively small part of the value of the whole vehicle&mdash;I do not think there will be a very great amount of forestalling, but there will be a certain amount.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Every customs entry form required by law to be furnished by an importer, or the agent of an importer, of goods into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 15th day of July, 1924, shall bear an adhesive stamp of a value equal to the amount of sixpence in respect of each consignment, parcel, or package of goods mentioned in the entry form, such stamp to be affixed to the entry form by the importers or his agent before the same is furnished to the customs officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is for the purpose of reducing the great import trade that goes on in very small consignments.  As I said earlier in the day, the Customs people in this country have to deal with almost as many consignments as I think the Customs authorities of the late United Kingdom had to deal with.  The individual consignments were very small; but the number of actual transactions to be dealt with was out of all proportion <Col N="162" /> to the value of the total volume of the trade of this country so far as mere recording of the statistics is concerned. The estimates that were made, having regard to the volume of the trade, were exceeded by about £12,000 per annum, when it came to a question of providing a staff.</P>
    <P>I think undoubtedly, as I said earlier, when we have a separate Customs entity, it follows as a corollary that retail trade across the Customs frontier is an inconvenient trade from very many points of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have now worked for twelve hours to-day.  I began by attending a Committee of this Dáil at 10.15 a.m.  I want to ask a question about the machinery of this Resolution because it will be necessary in order that we might frame amendments.  The stamp which is to be affixed on each parcel has to be affixed by the person who makes out the entry form.  If I am right, the person who makes out the entry form is not resident in the Saorstát. He is a shopkeeper or householder in England or Northern Ireland.  How is he going to get a Saorstát stamp? Is the Minister prepared to accept a British stamp and give the British this revenue?  If not, what is to be done? It is all very well for a man in Belfast who has a big wholesale business.  He can send to his agent here and get Saorstát sixpenny stamps.  That is not very difficult.  But take my position.  My children occasionally visit relations in England.  They invariably leave something behind them.  How is my mother or my sister, living in the country in England, to obtain a sixpenny Saorstát stamp?  It is absolutely impossible. Therefore, I hope the Minister will give some consideration to the scheme.  I do not like this scheme at all; I would sooner not see it introduced, because I believe he is going violently to disturb the natural currents of trade, the currents of trade that have existed for many years.  Assuming it is necessary, and I am not going to argue about it at this hour of the night, would the Minister be prepared to consider an amendment to affixing the stamp by changing it to payment on delivery, because that is even a much more practicable <Col N="163" /> scheme.  The Post Office has already adopted a scheme of payment on delivery.  When I get cigarettes sent from England out of bond, I invariably pay duty on delivery.  Could not the same thing apply to parcels sent by post?  It will cost much less than the scheme laid down in the Resolution, which is really impracticable. What will happen in case the parcel does not bear the sixpenny stamp?  Has it to be returned to the sender?  If so that would involve an amount of office work.</P>

      <P>Does not this mean another bolstering up of inefficiency and the obstruction of all possible trade by post in small parcels from English shops?  I know that there is a very large trade carried on at present with the English stores.  In my opinion it is not a very advisable thing or a very good thing from the point of view of the country, but I think the remedy does not lie in this system of imposing an obstructive tax.  The remedy lies with the traders or shopkeepers who stock goods required by the Irish people, by advertising the goods and giving the people an opportunity of buying them in Ireland, and not to seek for a special tariff to enable them to sell the goods at higher prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Resolution 13:</P>
      <P>Where, on or after the 1st day of June, 1924, the Customs duty on any individual class of goods liable to any customs duty, contained in the one consignment or parcel would, when computed according to the laws for the time being in force in relation to customs duties, amount to less than two shillings and sixpence, such customs duty shall be charged on such goods at the fixed minimum sum of two shillings and six pence.</P>
      <P>It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I explained earlier in the day that the number of dutiable parcels coming in on which the duty collectable is less than a shilling, means about one-fifth of the whole.  It is very undesirable that Customs Officers who have to be highly paid should have to spend the <Col N="165" /> amount of time that is necessary in dealing with these very small packages of dutiable goods, and it certainly is very desirable in the interests of the revenue, in the interests of the State, and in the interests of economy, that some tax should be levied that would induce the sending of larger consignments, and that would give some recompense for the trouble that is involved when a dutiable parcel has to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume this tax is largely applicable to the Border. I would think it would be very advisable for the Minister to consider the question of imposing a real Border tax, instead of the ordinary tax on the Border-land. I think you will require to have a prohibitive tax on the Border while leaving the ports open.  I cannot see anything-wrong as to the question of half a crown being deemed as a standard in trifles, but I think you must have a prohibitive Border tax if it is to be effective, and leave the Saorstát Ports, which are to serve the mercantile community, open, because if you have the Coastal access free and the Border taxed, you would remove from the Border much of the pressure that is presently operative there, and keep the trade in the areas within this State.  I think the Government will find it will be in their own interest that this should be done.  I think it is necessary for the Minister to take it into account, and consider and carry a really prohibitive Border tax on the land frontier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are losing sight largely of the fact that all these import and export duties are detrimental to trade.  There is no doubt that these things cannot be taken at their face value.  Trade, as a whole, is a very sensitive thing, and if you are going, as the Minister for Finance seems determined to do, to pin-prick trade in every possible direction, such as is done here, it may be a very serious matter.  I do not object to 2s 6d. as an extension if it should be necessary, but I do object to the interruption of the facilities of the flow of trade which is indicated by the spirit in which the thing is to be done. What in years past we have been trying to develop is the free flow of trade and <Col N="166" /> commerce between different areas and different countries.  Now we are going to go back of everything in that line, and as one Deputy said, we are trying to surround the Free State with a stone wall where nothing will come in and nothing will go out, and where we will live by taking in one another's washing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want, in regard to this particular tax, to restrict the flow of trade and commerce, but simply, so far as the tax will be effective to have that trade flow in some substantial volume, and not to have it between Great Britain and this country coming in sixpenny parcels.  If we are to keep our trade statistics recorded and examined, and to protect our revenue, these small parcels are undesirable. In the altered circumstances, where trade comes in in substantial consignments, this tax will not affect these substantial consignments that will take the place of these smaller parcels.</P>

      <P>I would like to emphasise to the Minister for Finance that all these trade restrictions are bad. Even at the present time, with all the new regulations and all the bother they entail, in the getting in of different commodities, a great many merchants and other people, as well, have come to the conclusion that the game is not worth the candle, and the more we embark on a policy of putting restrictions on our trade, the less trade we are going to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Hewat&mdash;that he who has been voting for these Resolutions the whole day should now come up at half-past ten and say that there must be no restrictions on trade and upon the flow of trade, as if trade were a demigod that had to be upheld above everything, as if the principle that a man across the water must supply a man here, and a man here must supply a man across the water for the sake of trade, is to be considered sacred.  I deny that at once.  I say unless trade is going to <Col N="167" /> facilitate the better living of the people here let it go.  Deputy Hewat's proposition is to revive trade for the purpose of maintaining traders who may be doing nothing useful at all.  The fact is that Deputy Hewat wants really to maintain trade by taking stuff out of one pocket and putting it into another and <i>vice versa</i>, as if that was any good in itself.  Deputy Hewat has been quite sensible all day, but now he is going back upon himself; he is going back to his vomit.  This proposition of Deputy Hewat, that he makes so frequently, is that trade is something that must not be affected by a single breath of opposition or opinion of any kind, that it is something sacred and must not be touched.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat has been denying his own warning the whole day.  I had given him credit before now for being consistent, but he has been most inconsistent here to-day. I had hoped he had learned some little lessons; now I find he is going back upon them, too.  I want to make that protest, because it is essential to make it.  Sometimes from the Government benches we hear echoes of the same bad doctrine, although they have improved on that by the proposition now before us.  If Deputy Hewat is allowed to make these statements without protest we may find next week the Government saying, &ldquo;trade is a thing that is sacred and must not be interfered with.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>(3)  That the several statutory and other provisions which were in force during the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1923, in relation to income tax and super tax shall, subject to the adaptations and modifications made in such provisions by or under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922 (No. 2 of 1922), and subject to the provisions of the Double Taxation (Relief) Act, 1923 (No. 8 of 1923), have effect in relation to the income tax and the super tax to be charged as aforesaid, for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1924.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    <P>This resolution, which fixes the super tax limit at 4s. 6d., is practically one with a proposition which does not require a resolution, that is, the proposition fixing the death duties at a limit of <Col N="169" /> 25 per cent.  As that is purely a remission of a permanent tax a provision will appear in the Finance Bill, and a resolution at this stage is not required.  It is required at this stage that Income Tax be renewed this year.  I may say in passing, with regard to the first part of the resolution that we found it impossible to reduce the 5s.  Income Tax rate.  We realise that if it were possible to bring the income tax down it would have a stimulating effect in many directions in the country, but it would mean a 6d. reduction, and that would be practically half a million pounds, which we could not by any means afford.  This particular proposition, even allowing that the Death Duties proposition did not lead to anybody coming here to pay us taxation, would only cost about £14,000.  We really anticipate that the two propositions taken together, should give us some appreciable increase in revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope before the next consideration of these Resolutions we shall have circulated some statistical information which may be at the Minister's disposal, and that whatever is available will be circulated.  Otherwise we are not able to consider the effect of these Resolutions at all satisfactorily or intelligently.  This particular Resolution is one in point.  If we take the Minister's word for it, as no doubt we must, the effect of the remission of the higher ranges of super tax is not going to cost very much, and it may be, and likely it will in the Minister's view, rather add to the national revenue.  But for that assurance I should oppose the Resolution as strongly as possible.  May we have some information as to the incidence of the income tax generally and the number of persons who were paying it at the different rates, or the total incomes that may be payable at different rates or the total revenue derivable, from last year's experience of the different rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the Minister has not the full amount of information, but he may have some, and I think it is time that we received some statistical information. When we are dealing with the imposition of taxation, we ought to have as much information as he can possibly give us.  In this case we have more or less to take the Minister's word <Col N="170" /> for the effect of the alteration in these taxes, but we would like to have as much information between now and the next stage as it is possible for him to circulate, so that we will know exactly where the shoe pinches, and where we can make it pinch more severely on one person than on another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is an admirable proposition of Deputy Johnson. We ought to get all the information we can.  We would like to make these income taxpayers squirm.  Let us realise what the poor devils are going through. Let us examine the effect of this income tax on trade, which is so repugnant to Deputy Johnson.  And let me assure you that a little relief in income tax would do more for the furtherance of trade than anything in the way of Protection, covered by this Budget.  Income tax at its present level, with the variation in income tax in Great Britain, where a lot of securities are held, is a matter of very great importance to this country.  I do not know whether we all realise its importance or whether we realise the number of people who have left this country, not for the country's good, but largely because of the differentiation in income tax in the two countries.  The farmers say they are not making any money at all, that they are in a bad way.  When the State has done with some of the incomes knocking about, those incomes are not of much use to anybody.  We are all living for the State, and when we die, we die for the State.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry the Minister did not take his courage in his hands and reduce the income tax by 6d. in the £ to the English level.  For the first time to-day, I am at one with Deputies on the Independent Benches. I really think, even from the point of view of revenue, it might actually pay the Minister to reduce the income tax to the level of the British income tax. The volume of business which would result and the number of people who would come here to reside owing to the lessened income tax, would be considerable. Another point of view which, I am sure, the Minister cannot have possibly overlooked, is the effect it would have on our relations with Northern Ireland, and the possibility that it would <Col N="171" /> make the negotiations which may take place in the future much easier, and make the business people in the North much more anxious to amalgamate and come into union with the South.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I am sorry the Minister did not see his way to introduce some clause dealing with the position of the farmers in connection with income tax. Farmers have been paying income tax on the valuation or annuity, whichever happens to be the lowest, and I know from my experience that many farmers are paying income tax who are not making any money at all.  The option is given to them of making a return of profits if they wish, but I would like to point out to the Minister that a great many farmers do not happen to be accountants and do not happen particularly to be accountants of the type which the Income Tax Authorities would acknowledge.  I know from my slight acquaintance with the income tax people that a man must be an expert accountant to get even abatements that he is ordinarily entitled to.  That is altogether beyond the ability of the average farmer.  It is my opinion that if a farmer be a good farmer, it is as much as should be expected of him, and that it should not be expected that he should be a good accountant at the same time.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider the advisability of reducing the standard on which the farmer is charged to at least half the valuation.  Even if it cost half a million and if the Minister thought it wise to take off the extra 6d. from the income tax, he might very well find that the chance was worth taking and that he would be amply repaid at the end of next year.</P>

      <P>To begin with, I think there are unfortunately not very many farmers paying income tax.  In my opinion it would not do a farmer any harm if he studied accountancy and kept accounts.  If the income tax were reduced 6d., there is no doubt we would not lose the value of the entire yield of 6d., but we would lose substantially. We would probably regain most of the value of that reduction ultimately.  But we are now in the position of having <Col N="172" /> an unbalanced Budget&mdash;an actual deficit&mdash;and we could not face a reduction of tax which would increase that deficit at the present time.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister has considered the fact that there are many people who have waited twelve months to see if this increase in income tax was likely to last, and they will now probably decide it is going to be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONLAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is very badly informed as to the number of farmers paying income tax.  The income tax authorities have spread their net so widely that they take in every substantial farmer in the country, so that in addition to paying excessive local rates they are further burthened by income tax.  In support of what Deputy Heffernan has said, I would urge that it would be a great relief to the farmers if the Minister could see his way to make a concession in the direction of fixing a new standard on which income tax would be payable.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my regret that the Minister has not seen his way to make a reduction in the income tax.  I do not speak for any personal reasons, because the amount of tax I pay is not very considerable. But I know a great many people in receipt of pensions, who have no business connections here and who have gone over to the other side simply because of the additional income tax here.  I know that one of the things cast in my teeth in the North was that they have no intention of coming in where they would have to pay an additional 6d. in income tax.  Therefore, from the point of view of even the political situation, I think it would be an advisable thing for the Minister to reduce the income tax. From the point of view of revenue, I think he would have been a great fool to make any reduction owing to our present financial position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few more words on another aspect of this question.  There has been a great deal of discussion as to whether people who had British investments were going to get back a share of the income tax from England.  I have a little money invested on the other <Col N="173" /> side, and I sent in a claim on the 6th April.  This morning I received £7 more than I had made a claim for.  It had been thrust down my throat over and over again that I was going to pay double income tax, and that I need not think otherwise.  But I did not pay double income tax.  Within three weeks of the sending in of my claim, I received an amount in excess of the amount I claimed.</P>

      <P>I move the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1894, shall, in the case of a person dying on or after the 1st day of April, 1924, be read as if there were added after paragraph (d) thereof, the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>(e)</i> Any personal or movable property situate out of Saorstát Eireann taken as a <i>Donatio mortis causa</i> made by any person dying domiciled in Saorstát Eireann, or taken under a disposition made by any person dying domiciled in Saorstát Eireann and purporting to operate as an immediate gift, <i>inter vivos</i>, whether by way of transfer, delivery, declaration of trust, or otherwise, which shall not have been <i>bona fide</i> made at least three years before the death of the deceased, and any personal or movable property situate out of Saorstát Eireann taken under any gift, whenever made, by any person dying domiciled in Saorstát Eireann, of which <i>bona fide</i> possession and enjoyment shall not have been assumed by the donee immediately upon the gift and thenceforward retained to the retire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  That in the case of property passing on the death of a person dying on or after the 1st day of April, 1924, sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1894, shall be read as if there were added thereto the words &ldquo;or but for the provisions of &ldquo;Section 38 of the Stamp Duties &ldquo;(Ireland) Act, 1842, or of Section <Col N="174" />&ldquo;18 of the Succession Duty Act, &ldquo;1853.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At present, as the law stands, if a person domiciled in Saorstát Eireann within three years of his death, makes a gift of personal or movable property situated in Saorstát Eireann, it is taken into account for the purpose of calculating death duties.  If, however, the personal or movable property is situated outside Saorstát Eireann, it is not included for the purpose of death duties.  That means that if a man has, say, Guinness's shares, Guinness being a British company registered in London, and he makes a gift of those shares within three years before his death, the amount is not counted for the purpose of calculating death duties. If, on the other hand, he makes a gift of, say, Great Northern Railway shares, the Great Northern Railway Company being a Saorstát company registered here, that is counted for the purpose of calculating death duties.  A distinct anomaly exists there.  This change in the law that is proposed, for all practical purposes, will have the effect of making the law in practice the same as it was before the setting up of the Saorstát.  There might be a question of property which was situated outside the late United Kingdom, and there will be a change in respect of that, but that is a much smaller amount than the property which is situated in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  There is really no reason why an anomaly should exist such as this, that Great Northern Railway shares should be counted for the purpose of death duties and that Guinness's shares should not be counted.  I think it is right it should be removed.</P>

    <P>
      <i>(a)</i>  Section 47 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, shall not operate to exempt from any taxation to which but for that section <Col N="175" /> as adapted it would be liable, the capital or interest of any of the securities therein referred to so long as they are in the beneficial ownership of persons who are either domiciled or ordinarily resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, and</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i>  Section 63 of the Finance Act, 1916, shall not operate to exempt from any taxation to which but for that section as adapted it would be liable, the capital or interest of any of the securities therein referred to so long as they are in the beneficial ownership of persons who are either domiciled or, being British subjects, are ordinarily resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In this case if a person holds certain British securities registered, say, in the Bank of Ireland, and he is domiciled in Ireland, those securities are not exempt for the purpose of death duties.  If, <Col N="176" /> however, he holds those same securities registered in the Bank of Ireland, and he is domiciled, say, in the Six Counties or Great Britain, he is exempt from Saorstát tax, although he is liable to British tax.  Now, the change we propose here is to make him liable to Saorstát tax.  Then, the Double Taxation Relief Act would come into operation, only one duty would be charged, but we would get our share of it, which we do not get at the present time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Section 53 of the Finance Act, 1921, from the beginning of the section down to the words &ldquo;Finance Act, 1920, and&rdquo; (being so much of the said section as enacts that the interest <Col N="177" /> received by a company on certain British Government securities shall not form part of the profits of the company for the purposes of corporation profits tax) be repealed as regards any accounting period ending after the 31st day of March, 1924.</P>
    <P>It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913.</P>
    <P>This Resolution practically explains itself.  At the present time there are certain British securities, the income from which is not taken into account when assessing.  Corporation profits tax on a company.  This is one of the things which probably should have been dealt with in last year's Finance Act, but was overlooked.  It is desirable to do it now.  There is absolutely no reason why we should take no account of income which a company derives from these securities when levying Corporation Tax.</P>

      <P>I think the Dáil would be better pleased if it received a little more information as to the actual position.  We are not to meet for a week or ten days.  Could the Minister tell us whether it is quite understood that the Commission will be set up, whether it will consist of two or three persons, whether there has been any definite understanding that the Northern nominee will be appointed by the Northern Government, and, if not, what will happen?  If the Minister is not able to tell us that because he does not know, I think the Dáil ought to be informed of the fact that he does not know; and I think also it would be well if we had some intimation from the Minister himself as to what the intentions of the Saorstát Government are in the event of any failure to set up this Commission.  I think that it would be a pity to allow the Dáil to adjourn for ten days without some further information than the Minister has given us.  The country is very much interested in this matter, and those who are immediately interested are waiting to know their fate, because for many hundreds of people that is what it means.  They want to know whether they are to be permanently considered within these Six Counties&mdash; within the Northern Government, or whether there is any possibility of their being brought under the Government of their choice.  The general question is one that excites a great deal of interest, and I think the Dáil and the country should have a little more information, if it is at all possible to have such conveyed to us.</P>

So far as I know, no meeting of any of the three Governments in question has been held since.  Certainly, I can say positively, as far as this Government is concerned, no meeting has been held.  Consequently, no decision has been arrived at.  I have not yet received an answer from the British Government with regard to the question put by Deputy Baxter.  But if it is any case to his mind, I would like to tell him that the Government appreciates the necessity for speed in this matter as much as he does, or as anybody in Ireland does, or as anybody in the Six <Col N="180" /> Counties does&mdash;where they have a claim to come in here.  I do not know that there is anything else I can answer on the subject.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state what steps have been taken, if any, by the Land Commission to enable tenant holders under fee farm grants to purchase their holdings; if it is a fact that these tenants are not put on the same level as other tenant farmers, and if tenants under this category will be facilitated by putting them on the same level as other tenant farmers; and, further, if he will state what reduction fee farm grant tenants are entitled to under the Act of 1923.</P>

      <P>Order 22 of the Rules <Col N="23" /> issued by the Land Commission on the 5th February, 1923, sets out the procedure which enables fee farm grantees to redeem their rents under Section 38 of the Land Act of 1923.</P>
      <P>Persons holding under fee farm grants do not come within the definition of &ldquo;tenanted land&rdquo; under Section 73 (2) of the Land Act, 1923, and consequently are not entitled to the reduction given under Sections 19 and 20 of the same Act to tenants of holdings to which the Act applies, but instead thereof they have the special facilities given them in Section 38 of the Act to redeem their rents.  To put fee farm grantees on the same level with tenants who come within the Act would require special legislation, which is not deemed necessary, as their case is considered to be adequately covered by the foregoing section</P>
