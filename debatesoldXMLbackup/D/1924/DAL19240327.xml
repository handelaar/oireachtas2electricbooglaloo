    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. HOGAN (Clare) Mr. HOGAN (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring last night to extract from the Minister some information as to how the Board of Works assessed damages long after the occupation of premises by the military.  I pointed out that the military occupy the premises some six or twelve months before the Board of Works Inspector or official goes around.  It is usually the case that there is no valuation made of the premises, and there is no inventory taken of the furniture and fittings at the time of occupation.  During occupation the general opinion is&mdash;and I think it is fairly well founded&mdash;that the premises deteriorate in value, and in some cases it would require an expert to tell the condition of the premises and the furniture at the time of occupation.  An official of the Board of Works goes to assess damages and to see whether the claim is just or otherwise.  He has no data as to the value of the premises and the condition in which they were when handed over, or of the nature of the furniture in the premises when the military took them over.  He has to go purely on guess work, and I do not think any Board of Works official would be capable of saying what was in the premises in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the official is concerned, it is not a question of what furniture was there, but what furniture should be there.  The official says:&mdash;&ldquo;We must assume you had furniture of this or that value&mdash;tables and chairs, sideboards and mirrors, of this or that value.&rdquo;  The tastes of the official and <Col N="2476" /> the owner of the premises in regard to the furniture might be totally at variance, but according to the official mind, their taste must be supreme, and they assess damages accordingly.  Take the case of a house being commandeered in the country, and the fuel in the place is used up by the military. The Board of Works Inspector then comes along, and there is a dispute as to the actual amount of fuel used.  How can any assessment be arrived at in that case?  The real position is that the Board of Works official is sent down to reduce the claim for damages, and something on the Sherlock Holmes principle, he suits the problem to fit the solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an admitted fact, I think, that a great deal of very unnecessary and wanton damage has been done in buildings that have been commandeered. For some time little was done&mdash;in fact, nothing was done&mdash;towards dealing with these cases at all. It was only some time ago when the matter was taken up by a sort of Committee representing the Board of Works and the Army authorities that progress was made.  So far, they have dealt completely with only about 800 cases. There are 1,207 cases outstanding, and, of course, there are other cases coming in.  I can promise that every effort will be made to expedite dealing with these cases.  Deputy Cooper drew attention to the fact that buildings, having been damaged to a certain extent, suffered very severely through not having that damage to any extent attended to while the troops were there, which tended to deteriorate the houses at an increasingly rapid rate.  It is impossible, of course, for the Board of Works to do very much in the matter. From the 1st April next, under the present arrangements barrack maintenance will be dealt with apart from new works.  This would be dealt with by the Army Corps of Engineers.  I will take up with the President the question of having the Army Corps of Engineers to do repairs to commandeered premises.  That will prevent greater deterioration than is necessary, and it will be done with a view to saving in the ultimate the State funds.  I see no reason at all why efforts should not be <Col N="2477" /> made, even while the premises are in the occupation of the troops, to do some temporary repairs that would prevent permanent damage to the property being greater than it otherwise would be.  I think we could undoubtedly save a great deal in that way.  The number of commandeered premises in the occupation of the troops is decreasing.  Of course, the object of the Government and the object of the Army has been for a considerable time past to withdraw troops from as many stations as they could possibly be withdrawn from, and to concentrate them in places where there are buildings in the nature of barracks for their accommodation. It has been in some cases found that where they were withdrawn from posts certain activities by the outlaws at large in these districts have recommenced and made it necessary to reestablish the posts.  I am afraid that for some time to come it will not be possible to have the clearances of commandeered buildings that we would like, but there will be a diminishing number, and I can promise that the work of dealing with commandeered premises, from the point of view of settling claims, will be expedited. There was an enormous accumulation of arrears when the work was actually taken in hands, and it is only now that the back of the work is beginning to be broken.  A great many claims sent in in respect of commandeered premises are very difficult claims to deal with Because they do not deal merely with the question of rent for the premises while these premises were in the occupation of the Army, and a charge for the damage done to the premises while so occupied.  You will have claims that will include such items as these&mdash;(1) rent for the period during which the Irregulars were in occupation; (2) damage caused by Irregulars; (3) damage caused by attacks on premises by Irregulars; (4) damage caused by troops resisting attacks by Irregulars; (5) looting by Irregulars; (6) looting by the public; (7) looting by the troops; (8) consequential loss arising out of the occupation of the premises; and (9) wanton damage caused by troops.  Some of these are properly payable under this particular head by <Col N="2478" /> the Ministry of Finance.  Others would come under the Damage to Property Act, and would have to be assessed in the method provided by the Courts, so that the claims are extremely complicated, and they are rather difficult to deal with.  The Board of Works have no instruction to cut down claims unduly. Their instructions are to give what is fair so far as they can estimate it.  But we must remember that in this particular sort of case the claims will be exaggerated.  People are hurt in their feelings, and if £500 worth of damage is done to his house the owner feels and asserts that he would not take £2,000 for what was done.  It is necessary that some impartial outsider whose sentiments are not involved should review the case.  It is also natural that his review should not be fully accepted by the injured party.  If any case is brought to notice in which there is genuine dissatisfaction with the award made by the Board of Works, and some clear statement is put in, indicating that that award in all the circumstances of the case is not a fair award, the matter will be investigated and reconsidered. As far as we are concerned. we have no desire that people should be cheated in the matter, but we have to see that exaggerated claims are not admitted and that people are not awarded compensation for anything of the nature of what you might call sentimental damage.  This wanton damage by troops is largely a matter of discipline.  There have been officers who have been efficient and conscientious and who have prevented damage.  There have been other officers who took no efforts to prevent damage, and we read in the paper some time ago of the case of an officer in the early part of the Four Courts fight who took off the stuff to his own premises.  I hope we will have none of the latter sort in the future, and that so far as any officer who does not show some conscientiousness in the matter of safeguarding property under his charge is concerned, when further demobilisation will have to be considered, that officer will be amongst the demobilised. We sometimes find officers being demobilised because of certain personal acts of indiscipline and so forth.  I think <Col N="2479" /> that the officer who allows a house of which he is in charge to be wrecked is also a person whose case should be considered if there is any surplus of officers to be disposed of.</P>

      <P>I think it is admitted that there has been great delay in the payment of arrears of rent.  I have a case in mind in which there were sixty-four weeks' arrears due in November last.

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Compensation will, I take it, have to be given for these the same as for private houses.  I might say that rents are actually being paid in a large number of cases where the military are still in occupation.  We hope to arrange to pay rents in all cases very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOMahony" hpid="Mr. O'MAHONY Mr. O'MAHONY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'MAHONY</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases a large amount of public money has been lost as a result of an early decision not having been come to with respect to vacated premises.  No agreement as to the amount of damage done to commandeered private premises has been arrived at in some cases.  In others an amount unsatisfactory to the claimants has been arrived at.  The result is that the premises still remain vacant, I assume at the public expense.  The premises, as Deputy Hogan said, are deteriorating and rents are accumulating.  The Deputy also suggested that there was a sort of Sherlock Holmes method of estimating value.  I acquiesce in that suggestion. Men who were sent to make a valuation of damage to premises never took the trouble to consult those who made the valuation on behalf of the owners, <Col N="2480" /> and assessed the damage without being in possession of all the details that would have been available if the person first called in to make the estimate had been consulted.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there were no instructions given to Boards of Works officials in respect of valuation.  I have made valuations in some of these cases, and my experience is to the contrary. I know of one particular case where the Board of Works officials said that they had specific instructions with respect to painting and paper, that the tenant would not get by any means the value of making good the damage.  Paper had been destroyed and painting injured, necessitating renewal. The suggestion put forward was that as it was assumed the paper and painting had ten years' life, if it had been five years since they were renewed, compensation for five years only was due to the tenant.  He was, however, compelled five years before the time which, on their own statement, it would be necessary to renew them, to do the work and was to get no compensation for the sinking of his capital during those five years.  I will go further than Deputy Hogan, and say that there is a rule-of-thumb method of valuation in a great many cases.  If these cases were brought into Court and competent witnesses produced on behalf of the owners, the Government would have to pay a great deal more than if the officials acting on their behalf adopted the commonsense method of consulting those concerned in the valuation in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can understand and appreciate the difficulties confronting the Government in dealing readily and effectively with these matters.  At the same time, I submit that there is a great deal of room for improvement in the methods employed.  I was called in to make a valuation in respect of a house fitted with high-class joinery of exposed pitch pine.  The shutters had to be removed from the windows, and instead of getting a turnscrew to take the screws out, the troops pulled the shutters down and destroyed the joinery. The door was treated in a similar manner.  They could not get a key for the lock, and they put a common <Col N="2481" /> padlock on it with nails and screws. They would not even take these out carefully when leaving, but dragged them out.  You could not replace that door and these shutters in the condition in which they were before this avoidable damage was done.  You have big plug holes in the door and big slices taken out of the shutters, In a case of that kind the question is whether the person would not be entitled to absolute renewal, and I believe that if he went into Court he would get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>After the evacuation of premises by troops there is no further liability either for rent or damage.  I would hope that there are not many cases where every effort is not made by the representatives of the Board of Works to find out all the facts of the case.  I certainly would not approve of any assessment of damages without the fullest effort being made to find out exactly what the amount of damage was.  I do not agree entirely with some of the things that Deputy O'Mahony has said.  It seems quite reasonable that the State should not bear the whole charge of providing new wall-paper instead of other wall-paper which was, perhaps, nearly due for renewal.  You have to deal with these cases in a reasonable manner. We took care in the Damage to Property Act to see that if people were going to be given a new building in place of one destroyed, account should be taken of the greater value of the new building than of the old one.  I think that is reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which has not been met by the Minister, that the officials who have been valuing on behalf of the Board of Works have not had time to do the work properly, and, as a consequence, have given awards unsatisfactory to the claimants, and probably not satisfactory to the State, because of the ill-will that such awards generate.  I suspect that one explanation is that in the zeal for economy sufficient men have not been made available for this work, and that they have been forced to do work in that rushed manner because of shortage of staff.  They <Col N="2482" /> have to go from one place to another and be inefficient in their work in all the places.  The Minister has not met the point that the methods of valuation and the time spent in inquiries have not been adequate.  I would like to hear the Minister speak with some information at his disposal on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major BRYAN COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to the question of painting and paper that Deputy O'Mahony raised, because I cannot accept the Minister's reply as entirely satisfactory. In these times of heavy taxation people having houses are making paint and paper last much longer than they used to in the past.  If it was only a question of ordinary wear and tear while in occupation of houses, and a question of the paper being a little dirtier, I should say that there would be no claim against the Board of Works at all.  The complaint is that the paper has been covered with cigarette pictures, although I suppose the Board of Works would write that off as an asset, and also with the kind of rhymes you see written in places I will not mention.  It is a horrible thing. Some of these things have been written in my house in the wing where my children normally live.  I could not let any child go into that wing until it is papered and painted.  Where that sort of damage is done, wanton mischievous, filthy damage, I think the owner is entitled to full compensation for the expense he will be put to in having the place painted and papered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I could only consider individual cases if they were brought to my notice as to insufficient time being spent in doing the work in a proper way by any of these inspectors. Certainly, I have no reason to believe that that is the general practice.  They are not being forced to do work in that way.  It is no part of Government policy to do that.  A complaint was made about the amount of travelling expenses incurred by the Inspectors. Probably they got over a very considerable amount of work, and paid a very large number of visits; but there is not and will not be any pressure on them to take less time at work than is necessary. <Col N="2483" /> I will go further, and say that I am prepared to see that they shall do the work in a proper manner.  I would not refuse to have any staff that is necessary so that the work might be done properly, and at the same time with some measure of expedition.  It is undesirable to have these claims dragging over any longer than can be helped.  I would not get that expedition at the cost of not doing the work in a reasonable and fair way.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has dealt with the question of expedition, and as I suppose every Deputy is more or less concerned, I know of cases to which my attention was first drawn a year ago, and where I sent letters to the Minister for Defence.  I am still receiving letters in respect of them. In one particular case, in the West, I had a letter about six or seven months ago, and I sent it to the Minister for Defence.  This lady had written three or four times respecting the matter.  Apparently, her repeated demands were so exasperating that she was raided to see if there were any Irregulars in the house, and further damage was done. I do urge that if a certain sense of injustice is to be created, as it will be created in all awards that are given, let that fact be recognised&mdash;at least, let the sense of exasperation be brought speedily to an end where it is now only being continued by delay.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister if he remembers that last night I referred to premises that are not yet handed over, and if it is possible for the owners to get payment on account?  I would like to emphasise the necessity of having inspections carried out in a thorough manner so that the proper amount will be paid and also that precautions will be taken that excessive amounts are not paid.  My experience is that the amounts demanded bear no relation to the amount of compensation that should be given for houses that are injured or destroyed. In most cases the claims are excessive, not by 20 or 30 per cent., but sometimes by three or four times the amount of actual damage done.  I do not say that <Col N="2484" /> applies to all cases, but it applies to some cases, so that I think it is essential that every precaution should be taken so that excessive claims are not paid.</P>

If it were an hotel that had only a short season, and was half idle or shut up during the remainder of the year, the amount of rent would have to be gradually lowered.  I could not, at the moment, give in detail the factors that would be taken into consideration, but in a great many cases the rent has been arrived at by agreement.  Certain claims have been put forward by proprietors of premises for rent.  Negotiations have taken place, and in a large number of cases agreement has been arrived at as to a fair and reasonable rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £10, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1924, for the Cost of the Army.&rdquo;  I think that this matter is really sufficiently explained in the note on the Supplementary Estimate itself. The purpose of taking this Vote is to create a sub-head under which these gratuities may be paid.  The amount already voted for the service of the Army is sufficient to discharge these particular payments without any additional sum being granted by the Dáil.  However, as these are gratuities which are not in the way of pay, it is necessary that the Dáil should actually pronounce on them.  I think it will be regarded as only reasonable in all the circumstances that officers who have given a very long period of service pre-Truce and in the National Army should have some special grant made to them when they are being <Col N="2486" /> returned to civil life.  Many of these have sacrificed their ordinary prospects by their National service.  Many of them gave up their business or occupations, or when leaving school failed to take up business or occupations, because they entered the Volunteers and were engaged in active service.  They have gone into the National Army, and now there are some of them who in the new circumstances would not be suitable for retention as officers.  Many of them would not be willing, in view of the past, to go into the ranks or non-commissioned ranks of the Army.  There are cases of men of this sort who resigned, and it is intended that even those who resigned rather than wait for demobilisation may be eligible for these particular grants that would enable them to do something in the way of preparing themselves for business or undertaking business in civil life.  It may be asked why these grants are only being made to officers.  The officers are being demobilised.  A man with pre-Truce service can, if he chooses, remain in the Army, but the officer, for all practical purposes, is being discharged.  There may be officers who have gone down to the noncommissioned ranks, but others cannot and would not, and there might be men who would not be very good noncommissioned officers.  A man might have given great service to the country and been a very excellent fighting man, and a very good patriot.  Still, for lack of education or other reasons, he could not really be retained with any satisfaction in the Army.  It would not be for the good of the Army or for his own happiness and welfare that he should be retained.  I have heard of men who had very good fighting records and who had become officers, but who were on the verge of illiteracy.  I heard of the case of a man, who was actually illiterate, becoming an officer.  It would be impossible under ordinary conditions to retain such a man as an officer.  A great many have gone.  As far as possible men who gave pre-Truce service, having regard to the requirements and their own capabilities, have been retained.  Mistakes may have <Col N="2487" /> been made, but, apart from mistakes, any man who would make a suitable and capable officer, who had given pre-Truce service, will be retained in the Army and given an opportunity of serving as an officer in the Army. A considerable number have gone, and it is desired that it should be possible, in addition to demobilisation pay which they will get, that these additional grants should be given to them.</P>

      <P>I think what the Minister has said now in a very few words, is the first information which the Dáil has had of the principles which have actuated the Ministry in the matter of demobilisation.  We gather now that officers with pre-truce service, who are literate and capable of performing the duties of officers, have been retained.  We have also been told that soldiers of the rank and file with pre-truce service and willing to continue service, have all been retained, I take it, unless they had a bad character.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>And who are medically fit.  That again is information which we have not had before.  I wonder then what have been the principles on which the gratuity has been paid. Gratuities vary from £50 to £250.  I think we should require to have some information as to the principles on which amounts have been allocated.  Is it only service or is it service and rank or is it the conditions under which the demobilisation has been applied to the particular officer?  I am inclined to think that we should be told here what we have not yet been told, what was the reason which led the Executive Council to say that there were circumstances connected with the activities of mutinous officers which somewhat tended towards at least minimising the <i>prima facie</i> offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been rather led by public rumour to believe that questions of demobilisation had something to do with it, that other principles had been at work besides those of bitterness, and that there had, as a matter of fact, been many officers who were qualified by experience, <Col N="2488" /> by pre-truce service, by intelligence, and by education, to retain their position in the Army, but who, nevertheless, had been demobilised.  I say that public rumour, and more than public rumour, private, well-founded information, has been conveyed to Deputies, that other principles had been at work than those the Minister has touched upon.  I desire that before proceeding with the discussion on this Estimate, we should have from the Minister a fuller statement.  I hoped that we should have had a full statement yesterday, but it was not forthcoming. This, again, provides an opportunity to study the position with some exactness, and without involving discussions of a character which rather cut across the question.  The granting of gratuities does not seem to meet the case of an officer of education, proved ability, pre-truce service, and against whom nothing can be alleged of defamatory character, and yet who has been demobilised.  I say we require to have more information, and further, we require to know whether we are right in assuming that the immediate factor, apart from the predisposing causes which led to the eruption in the Army, which led to the Executive Council treating that eruption with more leniency than otherwise would have been applied, was dissatisfaction with the scheme and methods of demobilisation of officers.  I say these things in, perhaps, a quieter atmosphere to give the Ministry an opportunity to go more fully into this question, and to satisfy the Dáil on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the general question of reorganisation and demobilisation, the Army Council brought up each one of the nine General Officers Commanding the various commands, and together they sat down and considered both the reorganisation scheme and a list of officers for appointment to the various commands, battalions, brigades, and so on, in the entire scheme.  With regard to that matter I should say that very few people will criticise the personnel of that establishment, that is, the Army Council or the Defence Council, consisting of the ex-Minister for Defence, General Mulcahy; the ex-Adjutant-General, <Col N="2489" /> General O'Sullivan; the ex-Quartermaster-General, General O'Muirthille; and the Chief of Staff, with the other G.O.C's.  I will mention the names:&mdash;General McKeon, General Sweeney, General Peadar McMahon, General Prout, General Dan Hogan, General Brennan, General Reynolds, General Michael Hogan, and General Daly.  Of that number, I think I know personally that certainly ten of them, possibly more, perhaps the whole lot, were men who had been associated with military matters for a number of years, and it was on presentation of the lists of officers to them that their recommendations came before the Executive Council.  A list of something like 2,500 officers was submitted to that meeting of the Defence Council and of the General Officers Commanding.  It will be admitted it was a very large list, and subsequently their recommendations came before the Executive Council, where some very slight alterations were made.  It would be a physical impossibility for the Executive Council to review a list of that sort with any degree of satisfaction from the point of view of alloting to commands different persons from those who were recommended, but taking the thing in its actual setting, I would say it does not appear to me that more satisfactory methods could have been adopted.  That there were, and there are possibly, infirmities in the matter there is little doubt, having regard to the large number. The recommendations of the General Officers Commanding the nine various commands were placed before this body, and their recommendations came before us.  Further than that, the Executive Council knows no more than those recommendations that were made to them, and I am sure that the fitness, the suitability, and the records of the various officers were considered by that Council sitting together, for a number of days.  I believe for something like a week, that matter was under consideration. When I say a week I mean seven days of sitting.  It may have been under consideration for a very much longer time.  It may be that certain recommendations were made that ought not to have been made.  I do <Col N="2490" /> submit, from the point of view of the method of dealing with it and of the capability of the persons so engaged, that I fail to see how any better selection of persons to deal with it could have been made.  I do admit, as I have already stated, that the recommendations may not have been, in all cases, the best.  The percentage, however, would lie, I think, having regard to all the circumstances, in favour of the best selection having been made.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I put the question the wrong way.  I do know that General Vize was not consulted, but in view of the fact that his was a very important Department during the trouble last year, I am of opinion he should have been.  As I know General Vize had two men under him who would be looked upon as two of the most important men who took part in the war between Great Britain and Ireland.  One of them lived practically all his life in Liverpool.  He was an Irishman, but had to go to Liverpool to earn his livelihood, and that man sacrificed all he had in the interests of the Irish nation.  At Liverpool he took charge of the ammunition and sent it out to this country.  There is another man, I daresay the President knows his name, but it would not be right to mention his name now.  He gave up his place, and his successor now is in receipt of 10 guineas a week.  These two men have been thrown upon one side.  These men made representations to the Government, but they had not the courtesy of a reply.</P>

It is certainly the intention, as far as I can gather, of the Executive Council to see that that person shall not be dissatisfied by reason of demobilisation.</P>

He occupied responsible and dangerous positions in the late war between Great Britain and ourselves, and his grievance is that his communications were not even acknowledged.  I am now very glad to hear the assurance given by the President.</P>

It is generally in connection with technical services where the heads are not sufficiently consulted as to different officers that should be retained and those that should be dispensed with. I have heard that complaint made in connection with services at the other side.  There are cases of men where their immediate superiors, knowing their work, were very anxious to keep <Col N="2492" /> them, but nevertheless they have been demobilised.  Now, I think that the various cases have been disposed of, we should get on the general question.</P>

      <P>I wish to address a few words to the general subject.  I think the statement made by the President a little deepens the general mystery.  I agree with him entirely that the tribunal appointed was, I will not say the best, but there was really no other tribunal that could be appointed to deal with the subject. Nevertheless, complaint has been made and fairly widely circulated, and has been brought to the attention of several Deputies, that discharges and demobilisation did run along the lines of the earlier party cleavage&mdash;the kind of party cleavage which the Minister for Home Affairs referred to last Wednesday. That, and the letter that was described as the ultimatum, seemed to give countenance to that general rumour and that circulation.  How exactly did that come about, in view of the fact that in addition to the members of the Army Council, as it then existed, the general officers commanding should have been called into consultation, I frankly confess I am not able to see.  But there is that suggestion, and it is made and widely circulated, and in view of the fact that the tribunal operating decided which officers should be retained, was a tribunal of the kind mentioned by the President as the only possible tribunal, it would be interesting to have some fuller information as to what led to the dissatisfaction that has been expressed, and which is that the demobilisation was not impartial, and where it has actually been said, and said fairly publicly, that officers that have been demobilised have been drawn from the ranks of those who endured the contest as between England and Ireland pre-truce, rather than from those who joined since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, for Finance spoke of the rank and file, and rather tried to anticipate criticism that might come in regard to the gratuities to officers and not to the rank and file. <Col N="2493" /> He said that those with pre-truce service and good character were free to remain in the Army, and then said provided they were medically fit.  There is the rub.  Many of these men are medically unfit because of Army service; many of these men are being demobilised and are not allowed to remain in, although they may desire to do so, because of Army service; many of them also sacrificed possibilities in trades, and, perhaps, professions, and joined and served in the Army pre-truce, and have been rendered medically unfit, and yet are not sufficiently unfit to go into the category of wounded; they are medically unfit from a service point of view, but not medically unfit from a medical point of view.  There is, I think, required equal consideration for members of the Army who were not officers.  We have not had an answer to the question as to what are the principles upon which this gratuity is going to be allocated. Is it strictly confined to length of service or length of service plus rank, or are other considerations allowed to enter?  Is it family requirements or dependency?  I think we should be told what are the general principles to be applied in the allocation of these grants which will range from £50 to £250, and are we to understand that every officer who has been demobilised after having prolonged service, is to receive a grant in addition to the three months pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President told us that there was a Council appointed, comprising the Army Council and the General Officers Commanding the various districts.  It met for a week to go through a list of 2,500 names, with a view to selecting those who should be demobilised, and those who should be retained.  One might naturally assume that that was the reasonable, almost the only method of selection, but unfortunately, it depends upon whether the General Officers the Army Council brought in to consider this matter, are entitled to the confidence that would be required to consider it.  It appears in the sequel that the Army Council was not entitled to that confidence, and I want to know whether it is a fact that one of the reasons for lack of confidence was the method of selection of officers for <Col N="2494" /> demobilisation?  Something has not been told us that ought to have been told to us.  The Army Council was scrapped, and the Minister for Defence was scrapped.  The incidents which led to that scrapping appear to have been of long standing, but it appears, although we are not being told it, that the immediate cause was dissatisfaction within the Army as to the methods of demobilisation and the methods of retention, and as to the principles which actuated the Army Council in demobilising certain officers and retaining certain other officers.</P>
    <P>I am raising this because I have a fear that unless we are told something more than we have been told that the rankle will remain, and that many officers who have not resigned will still feel a grievance, that men are feeling a grievance, and are showing the grievance, and are exhibiting dissatisfaction and discontent because of the retention of certain officers and the demobilisation of certain other officers.  It may be said that this is one of the matters that will be the subject of enquiry. Is it?  We do not know.  If the methods on which the Army Council proceeded in demobilising is to be the subject of enquiry, how soon will that enquiry be concluded in that section of its work?  Can we have some knowledge as to what the intentions of the Government are regarding the scope of that enquiry, and is this one of the questions for submission?  I hope that the Minister will give the Dáil some information on this point.  I am not raising these matters for the purpose simply of rooting out putrid matter, but because I feel it is essential to an understanding of the situation, and that the Dáil should understand it, and that there should be some confidence within the Army that the interests of the soldiers in the Army who have given service in the Army have been considered by Deputies in the Dáil&mdash;in the Dáil, I say.  If there was confidence that that interest was being considered and conserved, I have little doubt that the kind of, shall I say, sedition, that kind of sedition which has been bruited about, would not occur and would not continue. It is essential, I maintain, that we should have matters of this kind <Col N="2495" /> fully ventilated, and where a reasonable ground for complaint arises these complaints should be made publicly.  As it appears reasonable grounds of complaint have been made and have been accepted as reasonable by the Executive Council, we should have some explanation of what these complaints were, and whether in view of them they are satisfied that the principles upon which the Army Council, after consultation with the General Officers Commanding in the various areas, were fairly applied, and that injustice has not been done in many cases, and that regard has been paid to the circumstances of the country and of the Army and the public requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson was speaking when I entered the Dáil, and I just heard his references to those who joined the Army in pre-truce days.  I just want to lay emphasis on the fact that to say that men joined the Army in pre-truce days is hardly a correct expression to use, because, properly speaking, there was no Army in pre-truce days.  The men who served gave their services freely to the country. Many of them, as a result of the services they rendered at that time, took big risks and lost their limbs.  They made these sacrifices without payment of any kind.  That is a thing that should be taken into consideration and remembered.  It was not as if they had joined the Army and were paid for their services.  There was no payment for what they did, but they went and did their duty as they conceived it in the interests of their country, and many of them made big sacrifices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, they must be and should be treated in a different way altogether than as if they were paid soldiers who suffered as a result of their action. I do not want to, and certainly will not, say anything that would stop, or block, these Estimates, nor am I going to use any information I gained when I was a member of the Executive Council, but I certainly will say this, that I have gained information since, within the last couple of days, and I do not think it is possible that the President, in his capacity as Minister for Defence, can answer this, but it is well that I <Col N="2496" /> should mention, and if possible, get him to promise that he will make inquiries as to how the sums of money granted by way of gratuity, were arrived at in the different cases.  My information is this&mdash;and it may help him&mdash;that certain sums of money were allocated to the G.O.C's in their different commands, and they gathered around them one, two, three or four officers, and they sat down solemnly and divided that money.  In the end, they found there was a sum over, and they went back and gave a fiver here, a tenner there, or £20, as the case might be.  If my information is correct, something like that has happened.  I will keep away from the particular area where I got the information.  We will take Kildare, for instance, and that the G.O.C. for that area had around him a number of officers and they were going through a list of men that had been demobbed, who had pre-truce service.  The result, according to the procedure that I have been told was carried out, was that none of these officers knew of A. B., and a pen or pencil was drawn through his name and he got nothing.  That man might have had an excellent record pre-truce, but he did not get a penny, while another individual, perhaps with half the record, or with no record at all, was known to some of the officers, and he got money.  I only got that information within the last three or four days. I doubted it very much when I heard it, but I have since had corroboration of it.  I do not expect that the President, in his capacity as Minister for Defence, is in a position to answer that, and I do not think the Dáil would expect it from him, but I think it is well that I should mention it here on this particular Estimate.  Further, if it was possible&mdash;I am not sure how this could be brought about&mdash;the Dáil should get definite information, if not now, at a later date, as to how those particular sums were allocated.  I would not have mentioned that particular matter if I thought it would be part of the promised inquiry.  I do not see how, under any terms of reference, that could come in.  As regards the method of demobilisation regarding efficiency, that is a matter perhaps that might be <Col N="2497" /> developed somewhat by the President, as to who were the judges of efficiency in these matters.  Who are the judges in the case of whether a clerk, a common clerk, ranking as a Captain or Lieutenant, who had pre-Truce service, and good service, service given to the country without any recompense, should be thrown on a scrap-heap, as it is properly described, and another clerk who had no service, who came in with the ruck in the rush when the money was there, and they were to be paid for their services, should be retained?  That is all I want to bring before you, and again I have had to be very careful, and I am not, I definitely say, using any information that came my way while I was a member of the Executive Council. As to whether any of these matters are to be a subject for the inquiry I am not in a position to state, but certainly I do not see how the question about the gratuity and how these men were dealt with regarding efficiency, can be brought in under this inquiry.</P>

The other cases were given at the discretion of the Minister for Defence alone.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister for Finance is responsible&mdash;indirectly responsible, at any rate&mdash;for seeing that these gratuities go to the people to whom it is intended they should go.  But I would like to know what steps he has taken to see that the regulations are such that the state of things which Deputy McGrath tells us is happening could not, and will not, happen.  He has told us what the terms of reference are, but what steps, if any has he taken to see that the conditions laid down there are carried out?  For instance, is it necessary that those who are disbursing this money should get particulars, say, from each demobilised officer, of his pre-truce services, and to have forms of applications filled up, and <Col N="2499" /> which should be before the Council when making the grant?  Surely, if the state of things is as Deputy McGrath states, where a body or Council concerned simply take a list of men and make grants in a more or less haphazard way, I think the responsibility rests in the long run in any case with the Ministry of Finance to see that the grants which are provided for in this Estimate are distributed fairly and impartially to the people for whom they are intended.</P>

These Terms of Reference should be broad enough to take into account these sums that have been paid out to these officers, and in the cases where it is discovered and proved that officers have not been fairly dealt with there should be power to give these officers gratuities according to what they would be entitled to for their service in the past.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell raised a very important issue, and that is as to whether the claims of all demobilised officers were considered, or whether the names were only submitted to the Council referred to by the President or the Committee of Officers, or whether only the names of special officers were submitted to that Committee. I have a case of a demobilised officer in my district, who was treated very badly.  He was a very active factor in the Anglo-Irish war.  He gave valuable services, and as a result of his activity he finds himself on the world without anything but the miserable three months' pay, and his family are suffering so severely that their position as farmers is jeopardised also.  That is the case.  I do not think the man himself wants to push his case.  If only specific cases suggested at the meetings of the Committee of Officers were dealt with, then I say the question of reconsidering grants in favour of officers who were not considered ought to be gone into.  I think the issue raised by Deputy O'Connell is <Col N="2500" /> very important, that all cases of officers who had pre-truce service, ought to be considered, and that their cases should be considered whether they have already been considered or not, and if not considered, that it should be open to the officers to make a case before this fund is finally distributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to press for an answer to my question.  One of the considerations which led to the transfer, or shall I say the scrapping, as the word has been used, of the Army Council, was the method whereby the officers had been demobilised.  Is that a consideration which led to the decision of the Executive Council to call for the resignation of the Army Council, and eventually to ask for the resignation of the Minister for Defence?  If that is so, if that is one of the reasons for want of confidence, then I say you cannot rely on that Council, that Committee of General Officers who were appointed to act under that Council, and of which the Council was presumably the dominant and finally deciding authority. You cannot say that that tribunal which decided the allocation of these gratuities was a fair one, and that fair principles actuated the allocation, otherwise why was the Army Council disbanded, removed?  We have not yet been told, except in a general way, what were the circumstances which led immediately to the disbanding of the Army Council, except the incident in Parnell Street, and we ought to know whether there is satisfaction in the Executive Council with the method of allocation of gratuities, the method applied to demobilisation, and are they confident that that demobilisation is carried out fairly and with full regard to the highest public interests?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring first to what Deputy O'Mahony stated, I think that the amount being voted now will not cover all the gratuities that will be paid, and that an additional sum will have to be found next year.  In regard to the question whether the Army Council was dismissed because of lack of confidence in its method of selection of officers for demobilisation, I have to say that that is not the reason why it was dismissed.  The <Col N="2501" /> decision was come to, as stated by the Minister for Home Affairs, on account of a particular incident, and on account of dissatisfaction in regard to many matters felt by various members of the Executive Council, in some cases for a considerable period, but the question of the method of selecting officers for demobilisation was not one, I think&mdash;certainly not in my mind&mdash; and it was not stated to be in anybody's mind, as one of the reasons for causing the Army Council to resign. Different views may be taken, but my view is, while I believe, and in fact am fairly certain, that there were some cases of men being demobilised who deserved to retain a place in the Army, they represented a very small portion indeed of the total number of officers demobilised.</P>

A large number were reduced from positions they occupied to minor positions, and I would like to know if they would have an opportunity of putting forward their cases.  In the particular area I come from there was one man I am aware of who did service during pre-Truce times and afterwards, and I have no hesitation in saying he did five men's work.  He is reduced from the position of Captain to a Second Lieutenant, and I would like to know if it is the same Committee that made the selection as regards the reduction of status that dealt with the reduction of the number of officers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2502" /> Now, provision is made here for £120,000.  Surely some of those two thousand fighting men must be officers, and they cannot all be scrapped? Therefore, I would like to understand why sufficient accommodation cannot be given to those men who are not continued in the Army, having regard to the amount voted.  There is £120,000 to be voted, and that, amongst 1,000 officers, would mean £120 each.  I can hardly understand how such a number of men, with fighting service in pre-truce times, could be scrapped.  I would like to understand the exact magnitude of the financial operations, and why all these men who had claims could not send them to a Board for consideration. The country is quite willing that they should get proper consideration for the services they rendered, and they undoubtedly rendered good service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Minister for Defence.  Deputy Johnson raised some question about the terms of reference of the inquiry.  The terms of reference of the inquiry are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To enquire into the facts and matters which have caused or led up to the indiscipline and mutinous or insubordinate conduct lately manifested in the Army.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With that statement was the following covering letter:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To enquire into and report to the Executive Council upon the facts and matters which have caused or led up to the indiscipline and mutinous or insubordinate conduct lately manifested in the National Army, and generally to investigate and report upon the state of discipline prevailing amongst all ranks in the Army, and any facts or circumstances adversely affecting discipline, as, for example, <Col N="2503" /> the existence of factions, conspiracies, secret societies, or political organisations or groups amongst the officers and men, the considerations determining the making of promotions or appointments, and to enquire and report whether the discontent amongst certain officers and men shown in the recent threat of mutiny and insubordination is justly and fairly attributable to `muddling, mismanagement and incompetence in the administration of the Army'; and, in addition, to report on such specific matters and reply to such specific queries as may from time to time be referred to them by the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the covering letter, and I assume it disposes of the questions raised by Deputy Johnson and others on that point.  With regard to the next point, the Ceann Comhairle has stated it is rather outside the scope of the matter that we are immediately concerned with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided that there should be a lowering of rank. The original intention was that every rank in the service was to go down one step.  That was altered afterwards.  I think there were eighteen Major-Generals in the Army when it consisted of something like fifty thousand men.  I believe under the re-organisation scheme the number would be seven, so that the real reduction started at the top.  I expect that in any such re-organisation there would be discontent on that account, but because eighteen men had given excellent service as major-generals, to ask us to still continue the same number would be most unreasonable.  The tribunal which dealt with the grants in the first case up to the 7th March&mdash;that is with officers who were demobilised prior to the 7th March&mdash;consisted of Major-General Dan Hogan, Officer Commanding the Dublin District; Major-General P. McMahon, and Major-General Reynolds. The recommendations were in <Col N="2504" /> all cases subject to the approval of the Minister.  I have four such specimen cases here, but I do not think it is necessary to read them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for Finance read them.  They are as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;As indicated in the letter of the 7th September, it is intended the amount of these additional grants would be based on (1) the particular services rendered in pre-Truce days by the particular officer; (2)  the period over which this service extended; (3) the extent and result of his loss, and the consequent upset in the ordinary course of his life; (4) services rendered in the National Forces; and (5), the man's general character, and the good use likely to be made of such amount towards re-establishing him in civil life.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Recommendations for supplementary grants to any officer demobilised on the 7th March were left to the individual G.O.C's.  I must say I am not altogether at home in dealing with these matters, because I have scarcely taken up the duties of the office yet.</P>

      <P>The question I wanted to raise may be a little wide of the Vote, but I think it will be acknowledged as perhaps important enough to allow of a little latitude. It will not take more than a minute or two.  It has been very widely circulated, and is, I think, a quite impossible story, that the present Army reorganisation scheme is based upon an agreement arrived at, at the British Imperial Conference, and was intended to secure that the Irish Army organisation should conform to some well-understood British Army plan.  I think, in view of the fact that that story is being disseminated within the Army, and may be calculated to excite or give occasion for already discontented people to develop their discontent, there should be some definite repudiation of the story if it can be repudiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the very first moment to deny absolutely <i>in toto</i> that story which has been circulated.  There is no truth in it.  I repeat there is absolutely no truth in it, not a shred of truth, not a scintilla of truth.  I make that statement in my capacity as President of the Executive Council.  Not having been present at any but one meeting of the Imperial Conference, I am not in a position to say anything about what transpired there, unless what was intimated to me by the Minister for Education, the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs, and, I think also, General Mulcahy, who was there at one time.  But at no time during the whole of that period was there ever a question raised in connection with that matter.  I am in a sense pleased that Deputy Johnson has raised it, because outside of an Irregular publication I have not either heard the story nor seen any reference to it.  But I do say with perfect candour that it was never raised by the British Government.  There was <Col N="2506" /> no question as to our quota or any interference with us.</P>

I have not heard it from anybody, but, just like the President, I saw the Irregular publication in which it was stated that what I had to say, but refrained from saying in the Dáil, had reference to an agreement entered into by General Mulcahy while in England. All I can say here is, that is absolutely untrue.  I never heard of any agreement being entered into, nor a hint of it from any quarter until I saw the Irregular publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Shall we get back to these Estimates, because I think the question of how the officers were selected for demobilisation was very fully dealt with this morning.  I want to go into the question of the manner in which the demobilised officers are to be assisted.  I agree entirely with the principle of compensation.  I am prepared to vote £120,000 compensation to provide assistance for those demobilised officers, but I am in serious doubt as to whether giving them gratuities is the best either for themselves or for the State.  I have certain experience of this.  I saw a certain number of officers demobilised after the European War, and they received gratuities.  Some received resettlement grants.  In general that money was not well or wisely applied. You must remember that in this instance you are dealing with men who, as the Minister for Finance has said, were very young when they joined the Army.  They are still in their early twenties, and they have not had experience in the handling of even such comparatively small sums as £150 or £200.  If you put that money into their hands without guidance I am afraid it will not be of much assistance to them. Possibly here and there it may be of some assistance, but in many cases they will find that there are people with more experience and less scruples than themselves, who are anxious to obtain possession of that money.  They will run the risk of being swindled out of a considerable portion of the money they have received, owing to what may be made to appear, to an inexperienced young officer, a desirable investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it is a good thing for that reason to give them a lump sum of money, and from the point of view of the State, I think it is inadvisable, because when you give an officer his grant he will probably not be satisfied; he will think that as he has served five or six years and has run risks that other people did not run, he should get more than £150.  There will be the danger that he will feel the State has done with him, and that the State has given him this lump sum to discharge its liability.  He may turn his activities <Col N="2508" /> against what he considers to be an ungrateful country.  I would sooner that the Minister for Finance would make some provision in the way of retired pay or a retaining fee for those officers, and let it be paid monthly or quarterly. That would be of assistance to them, and it would also be a hold on them in the sense that if their services were&mdash; God forbid&mdash;needed again, it would be known where they were, and they could be called back to the Colours.  It would also be a retaining fee in the sense that they would still feel they had something to come from the State, and that the State was still concerned with them.  Of course, there are the cases of men who might like to migrate, or perhaps settle in business, and some who might desire to buy a Ford car and use it for hackney purposes.  In that case it might be reasonable to give a lump sum.  As a general principle, however, it is sounder to give some form of pay or pension in cases where the State has an obligation; it probably would cost more in the long run, but it would be better for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the objections urged by Deputy Cooper in regard to gratuities.  There are men who will not, perhaps, be able to make the best use of gratuities.  There are a considerable number of officers who, in some cases at least, have made use of their gratuities to help to pay off certain debts that their people, who may be small farmers, had incurred on their behalf.  The family might themselves help them in turn.  This proposal that was put up from the Army is the most practicable means of giving some assistance to the officers going out.  The question of providing some special system of training has also been under consideration, but a definite scheme has not yet been agreed to.  I feel myself that in many cases it would be better to give them a course of training that would enable them to undertake some business outside rather than give them a lump sum of money.  The question of retiring pay is a big one.  There are many men going out who probably would not be suitable to be recalled to the Army as officers.  They may be people deserving of a great deal of consideration, but they might not be at all <Col N="2509" /> suitable to be recalled to the Army as officers, and probably this pay and this retention of them in some sort of officer status may not be a desirable thing.</P>
      <P>The Government is prepared to consider anything further that can be done for these men, or anything as an alternative to the present arrangement, in cases to which the present arrangement does not apply.  The main fact is that after consultation with the late Minister for Defence, this was the proposal that came up, and it was agreed to.  It has its faults, but I think it will be a great help to a very considerable number of officers, and it is the best that we could do in the circumstances.</P>

It must be remembered that there was a large number of officers retained in the Army who, from the Army point of view, were unnecessarily retained, but if officers had been demobilised at an earlier period, we would be in the position of demobilising men who could turn around and say, &ldquo;Well, I have been active in such a way that it would not be safe for me to return to my own home district at the present moment,&rdquo; and we therefore had to delay demobilising officers.  We retained officers in the Army unnecessarily.  The Army problem was then to demobilise these officers and demobilise them in such a way that they would not simply be thrown out of the Army with no hope of sustenance of any kind immediately, and it was necessary to make provision, which was made generally for demobilised officers, to give them something like three months' demobilisation pay. In addition, it was felt that it was most desirable that men who had been absent from their ordinary avocations for a protracted number of years, men who had been engaged in pre-truce days, should be assisted in a special way, even at the present moment, to the extent of getting a larger amount of money placed at their disposal, than the ordinary three months' demobilisation pay would mean.  We all realise, and I am sure the members of the Executive Council realise, simply because of <Col N="2510" /> their own circumstances and the general circumstances of the country, that they could not deal in a more effective or a more adequate way with the men who are being demobilised from the Army under present circumstances.  I feel that the Minister for Finance would be prepared to agree that something further remains to be done on the part of the Government with regard to officers who had given certifiable pre-truce service to the country with a view to securing that these men are assisted in every possible way, and assured of being able to establish themselves in the life of the country that they had done so much to serve.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Executive Council will be prepared to agree that a further investigation should be held of the claims of men who have given what I must call certifiable service, because there are many spurious claims which will be put forward.  I trust that those genuine claims to which I refer will be investigated as soon as possible, not necessarily immediately, and that such men will be kept in mind by the Government in order to give them any help that the Government can give so that they may be enabled to re-establish themselves in the ordinary life of the country.  The fact that they are getting now a small supplementary grant of any kind should not prejudice the men themselves or prejudice the attitude of mind of the Government in proposing to do anything further that they possibly can to meet these deserving cases.</P>

      <P>I would like to press a point I raised earlier in the discussion on this matter, and that is to ask what steps have been taken with regard to seeing that the people who get these grants are those for whom they were intended.  Deputy McGrath, in the course of the discussion, made what, to my mind, was a very serious complaint, to the effect that the grants were given in a more or less haphazard manner.  The President, I think, told us that three officers were responsible for disbursing this money.  What I want to know is, what steps were taken to inform officers about to be demobilised that such grants were available? Were they informed that these grants <Col N="2511" /> were available, and were they instructed as to how they should make application, and told of the opportunities that were to be given to those who had pre-Truce service?  I want to know if they got an opportunity of submitting evidence of pre-truce service and so forth.  I think it is most essential that that particular aspect of the case should be attended to.  If the allegation made by Deputy McGrath is well founded, undoubtedly injustice is bound to be done, and, as I said earlier, the primary responsibility in this matter rests with the Minister for Finance. I would like to know what steps have been taken to see that these people were afforded every opportunity of making their case fully before whatever Committee is charged with the disbursement of the money.</P>

      <P>I am not entirely convinced by the Minister's enthusiasm for the scheme.  He has practically admitted that he is making the best of a bad job in accepting the scheme of the Army authorities.  The scheme has been accepted, and I agree with General Mulcahy that some scheme was necessary.  Since a scheme has been adopted of putting a lump sum of money into the hands of men who, as the Minister says, may not be suited to be officers in existing conditions and who may be illiterate, I do think that these men ought to be given some advice as to how they should spend that money; that they ought to have some Department of the State to which they can go for help and advice so as to save them from frittering away the money on bogus schemes.  I would suggest to the President, who is now Minister for Defence, and to the Minister for Finance, that where you are demobilising a large number of officers you should have something akin to the Officers' Friend established by the British Ministry, which would give these men advice and help and offer them suggestions as to employment, pensions and other matters, and generally to give them a helping hand to start in civil life again.  I do not say that that advice should be confined to officers of <Col N="2512" /> pre-truce experience.  I think all officers should have the right to go to a Department of State such as I suggest should be established, which would give them advice and help.  I know that there is a resettlement branch established under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but that may not be able to go far enough, and I think the officers in these cases have a special claim for consideration.  I am not asking for an answer now, but I urge the President to take the matter into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct Deputy O'Connell's statement that three officers disbursed the money. Three officers considered the cases and made recommendations, which in turn had to be approved by the then Minister, General Mulcahy.  He made recommendations to the Executive Council how this money should be paid.  I am not saying that, and the Executive Council does not say that, with a view to throwing upon General Mulcahy the onus of establishing a case for this particular method.  That was his recommendation.  I think few men in this country ever had the gigantic task that General Mulcahy had in connection with the Army.  It absorbed more time than any other Department of the State, and I admit it was unreasonable to place the onus for dealing with this particular type of men, who gave good service to the State, upon him, but that was his recommendation, and we accepted it.  We had no better method of dealing with it.  Perhaps it was our duty to consider a better method, but having regard to the large number of officers concerned, to the necessity of doing something immediately, and to the fact that a good many other problems were engaging our attention at the time, that may be the excuse or explanation of our not having given this matter graver, fuller and much more attention.  But I would not like the House to consider that we were throwing upon General Mulcahy the onus of establishing a case for this.  If better methods of dealing with these cases are placed before us, we will be very pleased to consider them.  We have, however, set up one particular branch of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce <Col N="2513" /> to deal with the case of demobilised officers and men. I do not know whether there is any information given there as to rights under the Pensions Act or anything of that sort, but it is one Department of State anyhow that does consider applications for employment.  And with regard to that, I should say that, although the number which has been placed is relatively small, it is nevertheless a considerable number.  We have, I think, something like 800 recruits now in the Civic Guard Depôt, and I think 600 of these are from the Army.  We have had examinations, certainly one, possibly two, for appointments to Customs and Excise.  In other Departments the same attention has been given to appointing men who have Army service.  If it were not that we were faced at the same time with setting up Government machinery, introducing legislation and so on, it would have been a much easier task to have dealt with this thing, but, with all the other problems that had to be considered, it may not have got that place that it ought to have got.  We are prepared to give fair consideration to any further reasonable demands that are put before us with regard to these people, but I do say in all sincerity that the whole position of the finances of the country ought to be considered with regard to them, not that we wish to do anything niggardly, but that the general needs of the country should also receive some consideration from us, even in settling a matter of this sort.  I should also say that forms of application were sent with notification of demobilisation to the officers concerned, except in the cases of men demobilised on the 7th March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I ought to say, arising out of the point made by Deputy O'Connell, that up to Christmas last 750 officers with pre-truce service who were demobilised got forms to fill up.  They gave references as to their pre-truce service, and reference was made to these in assessing the grants.  You cannot assess grants of this particular kind by a regular rule of thumb.  Certain heads and markings were arranged so that <Col N="2514" /> when a grant was considered on the general statement of claim put in by any applicant for a grant it could be referred to a particular type of formula to see whether the man concerned came under that standard formula as set down.  Between Christmas and the demobilisation on the 7th March about 200 other officers were demobilised. Pre-truce officers of that particular lot got their forms also.  The demobilisations on the 7th March numbered, approximately, 940.  This demobilisation arose out of a conference lasting something like eleven days.  The various officers in the country got full notice of that, perhaps two or three weeks before. That gave an opportunity for sizing up the relative merits of the officers they wished to retain and the officers they wished to demobilise.</P>
      <P>We considered it desirable to wind up all matters in connection with the demobilisation of officers before the end of the financial year, and on the Committee that dealt with demobilisations an officer from each particular command was represented.  He took his own men on the demobilisation list and indicated as far as he could readily do so the pre-truce men.  It made certain recommendations with regard to the grants for these particular men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the recommendations that could readily be made in the case of pre-truce men on that demobilisation list were completed for every Command, the officers who dealt with the demobilisations and nominations&mdash;that is, the G.O.C's, the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General, the Quartermaster-General. and myself&mdash;took each particular recommendation and came to a decision. The decision was not actually final; it was that we would make in schedule form recommendations in respect of a certain number of officers, which probably went up to about three hundred men, who we knew definitely were pre-truce men, whom the G.O.C's had personal knowledge of.  That left on the demobilisation list pre-truce officers in respect of whom no recommendation was then being made, and the intention was that those officers would be sent out the usual form of application for a grant, so that they would <Col N="2515" /> be given an opportunity for making application, and that their application could be dealt with in the ordinary way.  It was proposed that approximately 300 or so would be dealt with in the way I have indicated.  Actually, those recommendations had not been submitted from the Defence Department by the time the recent changes came about.  I do not know whether they are yet in the hands of the Minister for Finance, or whoever is dealing with them, but it would explain why certain officers with pre-Truce service had not got a form of application&mdash;because we were dealing with as many of them as we could in that straight-off method when we had machinery there that was as effective, and perhaps more effective than the ordinary machinery we had been dealing with.</P>

      <P>In view of what Deputy Mulcahy has said, may I ask for an explanation of the phrase &ldquo;gratuities payable on demobilisation to certain officers with prolonged (including pre-Truce) service.&rdquo;  One might think from this that &ldquo;including pre-Truce,&rdquo; was to show that they were not excluded.

I do not know whether I should ask the present Minister for Defence or the ex-Minister for Defence. <Col N="2516" /> With regard to the matter of gratuities, I have heard one or two complaints from demobilised officers that they did not get their gratuities at the time of demobilisation.  I know of one case: the man has been demobilised for two or three months.  He came to me recently.  I do not know why he called on me, except that I am representing his constituency.  He had not got a gratuity at that date.  I think it is possibly due to some defect in the machinery for payment, but these matters should not be allowed to happen.  I would like to know if measures are being taken to avoid delays of that kind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that this vote is like the vote in connection with the Land Commission. It is a re-vote of moneys <Col N="2517" /> already granted by the Dáil under another heading, but which it is necessary to vote again, because of the legislation which abolished the Congested Districts Board and prevented moneys which were voted to the Congested Districts Board for fishery development and for rural industries being drawn from the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Was this £34,000 for the administration of schemes for the development of sea and inland fisheries, dredging, grants to Boards of Conservators, and so on? That surely could not have been a Congested Districts Board Vote.  The Congested Districts Board had nothing to do with Boards of Conservators.  The Boards of Conservators have always dealt with the Department.  It is a remarkable increase.  We have an increase from £3,000 in the original estimate for fishery development to £37,000. Does that indicate a change of policy? At least we might know how much of this money is to go for dredging, how much for the development of sea and inland fisheries, and how much for grants to Boards of Conservators.  I think it should have been shown under the various heads, instead of having the whole thing lumped together.  It is desirable to have some distinction made between sea and inland fisheries.  I think the Minister should give us some enlightenment.</P>

      <P>The Department of Fisheries, as such, is a separate Department and, as a separate Ministry, has now been in existence for something like 16 months.  It was established, presumably, for the purpose of fishery development, and all matters that appertain to fishery development were taken over under the new Department, even though, up to then, they had appertained to other Departments.  The fishery cruiser was being looked after by the new <Col N="2519" /> Ministry.  It would seem to follow in regard to these two items, D1 and D2 &mdash;I leave out D3, because one can clearly follow the change there&mdash;that moneys granted a year ago for fishery development and for the fishery cruiser were moneys voted to this new Department that had been created.  How, then, is it possible to say now that these moneys for these specific purposes, which were being tended by a separate Ministry were, in fact, not the Vote of that Ministry but of some other Department?  Only now, sixteen months after that Ministry or Department has been created, do these moneys come over for the original purpose for which they were intended.  If these two sums under D1 and D2&mdash; £34,425&mdash;for fishery development, and an additional £3,000 for the fishery cruiser, were voted previously under the Congested Districts Board for fishery purposes, then the Fishery Department for the past twelve months has not been tending the whole of fishery work.  Further, it would be interesting to have the exact location of the sums from which these transfers are now being made.</P>

I suppose if that is the figure this £33,000 comes out of the Congested Districts Board and goes into the Ministry of Fisheries.  All the discussions that have taken place as to the need of the Ministry of Fisheries were based on the conclusion that the expenditure was small&mdash; £34,000.  Now it is raised to £51,840, which certainly does inflate the importance of the Ministry of Fisheries. Whether the additional duties that have fallen upon the Ministry of Fisheries, <Col N="2520" /> through the allocation of the duties of the Congested Districts Board to the Ministry, are going to be economically discharged under the new arrangement, is a question we will have to go into at a later date.

I have before me the Estimates for Public Services for the current year, to which these Votes are supplemental.  We have a definite Vote for Fishery Development, and a grant in aid for a Fishery Cruiser.  Let me stick to the first&mdash; Fishery Development&mdash;as being the illustration. A certain sum was voted to the new Department for Fishery Development. Now that is extended; it is enlarged.  Certain additional moneys come in.  Are we to understand that these additional moneys that come in are not the moneys that were voted on a previous occasion to some other Department&mdash;to the Congested Districts Board&mdash;to be used for fishery purposes? Are they moneys that were the revenue of the Congested Districts Board which, with the disappearance of the Congested Districts Board, fell back again into the Central Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no increase <Col N="2521" /> in the money available for fisheries. The money that is being voted now is money that was available either as a result of a Vote to the Congested Districts Board or of an income that the Congested Districts Board had from their endowments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister turn his attention to page 18 of these supplemental estimates&mdash;the Vote for the Land Commission.  There he will see out of a total sum for Development Grant and the Congested Districts Board, £33,000 approximately may be regarded as attributable to Fisheries and Rural Industries, services which now have to be financed from other Votes.</P>
      <P>Now we find that our additional estimate here is not £33,000 but £51,000. There are £34,000 for fisheries development; £3,000 for the cruiser, and £14,000 for rural industries.  I take it the discrepancy is due to the income of the C.D. Board.  Should not that be put down in the Estimates?  Ought not there be a foot-note?  Foot-notes are often the most interesting part of these Estimates.  There should be some indication of that money, otherwise it is impossible for us to understand the Estimates.  We have not the advantage of official knowledge that the Minister has.  We have to puzzle those matters out as best we can.  To begin with, there is no indication that it is a re-vote at all.  It is not fair to place us in the position of coming here and finding the whole situation entirely different to what we had imagined.</P>

My idea is that though in some cases legislation may be necessary, these various endowments should come into the Exchequer, and whatever money is required for ordinary services should be voted out each year by the Dáil.  There was a reason for the existing system in the past.  Sometimes money was voted for a particular service in England, and funds were created in Ireland to ensure that an equivalent amount would be paid. <Col N="2522" /> There is no reason for it now and the intention is to do away with it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>On that point, apart from later discussion that may be necessary, can the Minister for Fisheries, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, tell us what was the total sum available for administration by his Department, say, for this current year, and how that has been spent?  What proportion of the total sum is spent in salaries and what proportion is spent in other works?  If we had that information it would perhaps help us in the discussion of D (1)&mdash;that is, fishery development.  We would perhaps be saved the task of asking how much of that £34,000 is for administration or salaries in connection with administration.  How much money is spent on works or schemes of assistance? Perhaps if the Minister will give us a general survey of his work from that side it would shorten the discussion eventually.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FISHERIES (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to make a statement covering the whole matter. The estimate submitted to the Dáil at the beginning of this financial year amounted to £28,575.  There was a foot-note to that estimate which I succeeded in getting in after a certain amount of difficulty.  I saw that the estimate appeared wrong.  It was explained in that footnote that in addition to the sum mentioned there were moneys available for fishery development out of the C.D.B. funds and out of the statutory endowment of the D.A.T.I.  We estimated at the time that the amount available from these sources was something like £42,650.</P>

      <P>Yes, in addition to the £28,575.  It was thought, as these sums were payable under statute, it was better for the time being to let them go into the accounts of the Departments concerned and merely let it be a book-keeping matter between them and the newly-established Ministry of Fisheries.  That was more or less queered by the abolition of the C.D.B.  Deputy Hewat is desirous of knowing something about rural industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, take that estimate of £34,425.  That is the chief item in the estimate.  Under that sub-heading&mdash;that is one of the things <Col N="2524" /> that has been chiefly raised&mdash; provision is made for the granting of loans, £10,650; for fishery transit and subsidies, £4,500; for grants to the Board of Conservators there is a sum of £5,700.  That will answer Deputy Shaw to a certain extent. That is where the Inland Fishery money is spent.  There is a little more from the point of view of hatchery subsidies at Lismore.  The insurance on fishing vessels is £4,900.  The insured property is valued roughly for about £150,000.  Then there are instructions in boat building, marine motor driving, fishing gear, dredging harbours, and so forth.  That covers practically every item of that £34,425.  There are at the moment heavy arrears due by the fishermen for loans granted them for the purchase of boats in what might be called the boom years.  For the last two or three years many of those boats have remained idle owing to the depressed state of the industry generally, and, therefore, the instalments have not been paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual arrears are between £30,000 and £40,000.  The outstanding loans are about £140,000.  Of that sum £100,000 is not in arrear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they long-running loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>They are spread out over a number of years.  I should say about ten years, with annual instalments. Now, in certain cases of these loans we found that the boats were being neglected.  They were let go, the engines were being neglected, and so on.  We exercised our powers as mortgagees, and took over the boats.  This rather refers to the bigger loans.  The smaller loans for £50, for gear, have, as a rule, been very well met.  These are very important, because they help the very poorest of our people&mdash;that is, the half-farmer and the half-fisherman &mdash;to eke out a livelihood on his little holding, and I have hopes very soon of a definite promise from the Minister for Finance that these will again be available in the very near future&mdash;that is, for the provision of gear for these small fishermen.  There is another type <Col N="2525" /> of fisherman also for whom I hope that these loans will very soon be released. That is, the owner of the yawl, a comparatively larger sized boat.  Sail and motor-boat owners, during these bad years, used up their gear in a rather depressing task.  They have now no money to refit their boats.  These boats could, I believe, make a profit if equipped for going towards the fishing grounds.  I hope the loans will be released to enable these men to refit those boats with gear.  I refer now to transit. We are subsidising steamers in Arran and Galway, and a steamer to Erris, at a cost of about £1,600; that is provided for in the estimate.  There is also involved in that estimate a scheme of ours which last year resulted in a nett loss to the Ministry of £2,000. That was to provide transit from Baltimore to Wales when the railways were broken up at the time of the spring mackerel season.  Now, I mentioned insurance. Provision is made for giving assistance to fishermen to meet the cost of insurance of motors in the Saorstát. Large loans had been granted from £1,000 to £3,000 to provide boats in the past.  There was a rule that some personal security should be had, and really that was of very little account, and the only security the Department had was the boat itself.  Therefore the Department had to see that the boats were insured, and the usual system was to pay half the amount of the insurance premium.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>It was to a company in the North of England.  This thing was inherited from the Congested Districts Board, and from the D.A.T.I.  There was a particular scheme of a certain mutual company formed to provide specially for fishing boats.  The old Department insured with them, and we, of course, continued it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very peculiar arrangement.  The rate was fixed in accordance with the number of boats that were wrecked, and the number of <Col N="2526" /> claims that were on the company during the year.  It was on these that the rates were fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is quite clear.  It was a call on each boat, on the tonnage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  This amount of £5,735 for inland fisheries was principally in the form of grants to Boards of Conservators, for assistance to hatcheries.  In reference to that, Deputy Shaw asks what are we doing to protect them.  That is what we are doing. It is not our function to provide bailiffs as the law now stands.  I do not say that the present arrangement is ideal, but as the law now stands it is not our function primarily.  It is the function of the Boards of Conservators to preserve the inland fisheries and appoint bailiffs to do that work.  We make them certain grants. I hoped to make the grant this year considerably more, but I was unable to do so because of the financial situation, but we give them about £2,000 more than they had been getting prior to this estimate, and we give them something more in that sense than probably ever before, at least under the old regime.  There never was such concentration by the police force on fishery protection as there was last year by the Civic Guard.  In speaking on these estimates, it is only fair for me to pay a tribute to what the Civic Guard has done in connection with fisheries.  I am now referring to the protection of the inland fisheries. Various schemes carried out by the Ministry have also been provided for in this estimate.  They include the dredging of harbours, the improvement and repair of landing places, which cost this year £3,000, providing instruction on boat-building, marine motor driving, fish curing, and kindred vocations, and the management of a salmon river in.  Tirconaill costing £1,000.  A good deal of the expenditure arose from appropriations in aid and is partly repayable. It is anticipated, as will be seen under heading No. 4, that we expect to get back £6,810 from receipts from schemes of fishery development. Now, when we come to the &ldquo;Helga,&rdquo; now called the &ldquo;Muirchu,&rdquo; there was <Col N="2527" /> an additional sum of £8,000 required to improve that vessel.  Last year the estimate we put in was £5,800.  We knew it was going to cost that, but at any rate the Dáil voted £6,000.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hewat asked me about the rural industry schemes. <Col N="2528" /> These schemes involve the employment of 67 teachers and assistant teachers at 47 centres, as well as the cost of maintaining premises at these centres.  The Vote also provided for the purchase of raw material, wool, silk, thread, etc., to the value of £7,300, of which it is anticipated that £6,500 would be repaid to the Vote on the sales to the workers. I have not legally taken over this particular branch of the functions of the Congested Districts Board yet; I am only handling it pending the passing of the Ministries and Secretaries Bill, but that will fairly well explain the expenditure of the money.  Now with regard to questions asked by several Deputies. Deputy Johnson asked for the proportion of salaries to the amount spent, upon development.  Of course the question of salaries does not arise at all on this occasion on this estimate. The figures, as far as I have been able to remember them, are about £21,000 for salaries.  But that question is entirely outside what we are now dealing with.  They are provided for in the proper estimate, whereas this is a supplementary estimate.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask for some information upon the question of loans.  The Minister told us that there was £140,000 outstanding and £30,000 or £40,000 in arrear, and then he is making provision this year for a loan of £10,000 and he hopes to be able to renew the process of giving these loans in the future.

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I am quite satisfied the Minister does administer, but the sums under this Vote are more important than I realised last year, because in my election time I talked of £27,000 for the Ministry of Fisheries and £21,000 for salaries.  I now find that the salaries are £28,000 and that the Ministry is £51,000.  I should like to ask having regard to responsibilities that the Minister has taken over, such as various Departments of the Congested Board, does he mean that he must have a greater staff or is the staff of the Ministry of Fisheries adequate?  With regard to insurance, as far as I can gather, while the Irish Government are putting £4,000 or £5,000 a year into insurance they are getting no benefit, because the industry is in such a depressed condition that casualties to the boats are nil.  The boats are not working, but the English boats are working and meet with accidents and £4,900 is paid a year for insurance. That applies to England where they make the claims and we are called upon to pay the money because our boats are idle.  Of course, I think it is a proper thing to insure them, but we seem to have got the wrong end of the stick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather gathered <Col N="2530" /> from Deputy Wilson that he was uneasy about the loans; which reminded me of the story in the Bible of the man who, when he was forgiven his own debt, went out immediately and collared the other who owed him something. If there is one thing more than another we hear repeatedly from the farmer these days, it is about arrears, but when this question in connection with arrears of fisheries arises the last people who ought to be hard in exacting payment are the farmers.  Now, the Minister told us that, especially in the case of small loans, they were fairly well paid.  I should like to make a plea on behalf of the fishermen to whom loans were granted, that every consideration should be shown to them in the matter of paying these arrears.  The Minister knows, and we all know, that for the past two years or so there has been practically nothing doing in fishery matters, and consideration should be shown to those who have outstanding loans, and every chance ought to be given to them to pay back without undue pressure from the Ministry. Now, in the matter of giving loans, the Minister expressed the hope he would soon be in a position to make loans again.  I hope that will be at the earliest possible opportunity.  I am informed this year that the prospects of the fishing are hopeful, and that it is essential, seeing that this industry is a seasonal industry very largely, that the fishermen should be put in a position to avail of whatever chances and prospects offer in good time, and I do hope, therefore, there will be no further delay in the men getting these loans when they are available.  If they are to be available, they should indeed be made available immediately.  The Minister referred to the subsidy that was being paid to the Arran-Galway steamer.</P>

      <P>I would like to know whether the Minister is going to give any further consideration to the suggestions made from time to time on behalf of the Arran people, especially the fishing people, with regard to the institution of a new route between Arran and the mainland.  The present Arran-Galway route is over thirty miles, <Col N="2531" /> I think.  There is an alternative route where the sea journey is something about nine miles from the land, and if the subsidy available for the Arran-Galway steamer were used in an alternative route I think it would be a very much greater benefit to the fishermen, and would afford many advantages to the fishermen for disposing of their fish which the present route does not offer. It would mean that the Arran fishermen could land their catches at Coshla Bay after the night's fishing, whereas at present they lose a day or two days in the week in going to Galway with their fish. There have been many complaints that the present Arran-Galway steamer service is not at all satisfactory.  I would like to know what the Minister has done in regard to this question which has been raised once or twice for consideration. There are some points in item (D2) which I will raise again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of the loans and the outstanding loans which the Minister has given at a figure something like one-third of the whole, anyone who has had occasion to examine into this matter in the past, or who has read the various reports made by the various Departments responsible for the last ten or twenty years, will know that there is no opinion which is more unanimously held than that these loans have always in the past been punctually repaid, and the smaller the type of fisherman the more punctual has been the repayment. Therefore, when you come to an occasion like the present where you have a large amount in arrear, it is quite clear that the cause is to be found in the undoubted fact that for the last two or three years the whole of this industry has been in a very bad state of disrepair, largely resulting from the state of economic chaos into which the country has been thrown by the recent internal dissensions.  It is this chaos and this disrepair into which the industry has fallen that is responsible for the arrears of these loans, and there will be no likelihood of these loans being repaid until further money is expended in putting this industry into a healthier state than it is in at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has seen, as I have <Col N="2532" /> seen, and as others of this House who have had occasion with me to go around a good many of the fishing ports in Ireland have seen, know that without that amount of assistance the fishing industry in Ireland, which may prove to be one of the richest industries in this country, will never be placed in a healthy state of organisation. I am opposed personally&mdash;and I have always been invincibly opposed &mdash;to anything in the way of doles or gifts in this matter.  This is not a case of doles or gifts.  It is a case of an economic loan.  The fishermen in the past have had advances made to them because of their poverty, and they have always punctually repaid. Now they are not in a position to do so, and the loss is not merely the loss to the fishermen&mdash;the loss is not merely a loss to the industry&mdash;the loss is a loss to the State.  I think, from the fishery point of view, it is required that something definite be done in the way of further advances to help the industry that at the present moment is almost at a standstill. The facts that the Minister for Fisheries has brought before this Dáil are an argument, not merely sound in fishery development, but sound in financial recoupment.  If the moneys that are owing are to be returned, further moneys will have to be expended. I do not notice that the Minister for Finance looks extraordinarily encouraging about it.</P>

      <P>The fact is, nevertheless, as I say, that the arrears will extend until something definite has been done to enable the people who are in arrears to carry on their industry.  If I am correctly informed&mdash;I am continually receiving letters from various parts of the country on this matter, not merely from those who are engaged in the industry, but from those with whom I came into touch in the past, and who are interested now from the point of view of endeavouring to assist their own localities&mdash;the position now with these fishermen, in many cases, is that a crew of four, five, six or seven, according to the different parts of the country where crews vary in size, own <Col N="2533" /> a boat, or one of the crew owns a boat, and the other members of the crew have shares in the equipment of that boat, and owing to the lack of business during the last two years these boats, which have been purchased because of advances made by the State, cannot carry on.  They have not even the equipment and tackle to do it.  They are looking for loans in order to get that equipment and to get that tackle.  Until the State can come forward and assist them to put their boats into such a state of repair that they can once again engage in business, it is not merely a question of thirty per cent. or forty per cent. of the loans that will be in arrears; the percentage must inevitably grow.  Whereas I am perfectly convinced that if the money be forthcoming, that is to say, if steps be taken&mdash;let me avoid the mention of money in that regard&mdash;to enable boats that have been purchased, and that are at present without tackle or equipment, to equip themselves as they ought to be equipped in order to begin in a few weeks the spring fishing, the industry will revive.  And if the industry is brought to renewed state of health&mdash;it was never worse than it is now&mdash;economic advantages will accrue to the entire country, and incidentally&mdash;a matter of much narrower concern, but much more immediate to the Minister for Finance&mdash;the Minister will be able to look with greater confidence to getting back the moneys that have already been advanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word in favour of the line of argument pursued by Deputy Figgis, inasmuch as the money expended or guaranteed by the State in this matter is going to be the most quickly reproductive of any money.  Unless there is a State guarantee, which means a sort of national insurance, the opportunity for fishermen to equip themselves and their boats is gone.  Private enterprise cannot do it&mdash;private enterprise will not do it in the way it ought to be done, because the risk is too great for an individual, and if it is not too great, then the private individual expects so big a return that it makes it uneconomic for the fishermen.  It is <Col N="2534" /> essentially a case for sharing the burden amongst the whole community. The second best course, perhaps, would have been if the Minister for Fisheries had been able to produce to us a scheme of mutual insurance of a very widespread character, which would insure the State against any risk of loss accruing from loans which might be granted.  I would like to have heard from the Minister some more information regarding the schemes of development referred to in D1, which might have had to do with the provision of markets within this country and improvements in methods of transit within the country.</P>
      <P>There have been statements made that the Minister had considered, or, shall I say, spent some of the moneys, under this head, making inquiries regarding the marketing of fish.  I would like to have heard from him what has become of these inquiries. What is the result of them?  How soon may we expect to see markets established in all the smaller towns? How soon may we expect to see a system of transportation through the country, supplying those towns from the fishing stations?  I would like to have heard a little more, too, about the schools for training which he speaks of.  Certain sums have been expended on boat building, net-making, and other matters of that kind, and I would like to have heard something about them.  I would like to hear what are the extensions we may look for during the coming year, whether the cooperage proposals have been undertaken, and we would also like to have some idea from the Minister whether he conceives this industry as one which may be of great national importance, worthy of the establishment of a Ministry.  I am very sorry, indeed, to note that he has not much prospect of getting any larger sums of money, unless special Votes are taken at a later stage.  I see by the preliminary paper that has been issued for the coming year that he is not going to be much better served in regard to finance.  That is to be regretted, but I suppose that regret will have to be expressed on another occasion.</P>

      <P>I would remind Deputy Hewat that there is nothing in this Estimate regarding the Ministry of Agriculture or the dairy stock of the country.  Milch cows are not referred to, though Deputy Hewat appears to think that it is primarily a subject for milking the cow.  I want to urge seriously upon the Minister for Fisheries and the Minister for Finance that the fishery industry is one that has hitherto been too great a gamble, the risk of which has been undertaken by the individual fisherman. It is too great a gamble to be undertaken by the individual fisherman, and it is impossible for any individual fisherman, without assistance from an outside authority, to organise the industry in such a way as to spread the risk.  From the national point of view, where you have an industry of the potentiality of the fishing industry, and where to be successful great risks must be undertaken not merely of life but of money&mdash;risks that cannot be met by any foresight; natural risks that are beyond the risks undertaken by any other industry or calling&mdash;there should be a very wide extension of what might be called mutual sharing of the burden, so that where men do undertake the risks of fishing round the coasts, where they bear some&mdash;as they must&mdash;of those risks themselves, other portions of the risk should be undertaken by the community at large.  I believe it is possible to develop a system of mutual insurance, part of which risk will be borne by the State and part by the fishermen themselves.  I am sorry it is not possible for the Minister to say that under the sub-head D1&mdash;fishery development&mdash;some such proposal as that has not been developed and accepted by the Ministry of Fisheries and also by the Ministry of Finance.</P>

      <P>I forgot to ask the Minister a question in connection with oysters.  There is an inquiry in Arklow as to whether they could supply to the London market oysters of a certain quality.  I am told that on investigation there and in Courtown it was found that the oyster beds had been allowed to get into such a state that they will require dredging and treatment of a peculiar nature to enable the oysters to be marketable in London.  I would like to ask the Minister has he heard anything on that subject, and would he let us know what he is doing in the matter. I want also to remove the impression given by Deputy O'Connell that I am opposed to the granting of facilities to the fishermen.  Having regard to the fact that there are two fishing villages in my constituency, that would be a very foolish attitude for me to take up. Apart from that, where I am not quite in accordance with the method adopted in the past is that where loans are granted some provision should be made for marketing the fish caught. More attention should be paid to the markets, so that when you provide fishermen with boats and they catch fish you will be repaid.</P>

      <P>In connection with this grant for fishery development, the debate that has taken place should indicate to the Minister for Fisheries the absolute necessity of giving us these Votes in much greater detail in the future.  The Minister for Fisheries is, I think, in a peculiar position.  He has now apparently to take charge of an industry, and the claim that is made on behalf of sections of the Dáil is that he should occupy a grandmotherly position in connection with the industries of the country.  It may be quite good and proper that the country should subsidise fisheries, but if so, they should do it on some commonsense lines.  The fitting out of obsolete sailing boats to compete with the modern steam trawler does not appeal to me as an economic proposition for which a levy should be made on the country.  Deputy Johnson, of <Col N="2537" /> course, is consistent.  His ideas are socialistic and are, I think, socialistic to the extent of being carried on at the expense of the State, the State, of course, being Deputy Johnson and myself and others like us.  But it seems to me that he need not in this matter go further than a proposition that the people in the fishing industry, or who run the risks of fishing for the purpose of gaining a livelihood on the sea, might themselves co-operate. There is nothing to prevent their doing so.  As regards the fishing industry as a whole, if you look round other countries you do not see, I think, that the Governments are called upon to provide subsidies.  Private enterprise, in most cases at all events, is quite sufficient to provide not only development of the fishing industry but the carrying on of it in a very active way, so that one of the troubles of recent years has been the tremendous competition that has arisen and that has so affected the industry that the demand has been insufficient for the supply of fish in the markets.  Deputy Figgis and Deputy Johnson, notwithstanding that, want us to fit out obsolete tonnage along the coast with the hope of making money out of it.  Going down to the extreme west of Ireland, there are opportunities for development of the inland fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thing, I think, is that this whole question of fishery development should really be looked on as an economic proposition. It should not be looked upon as a means of getting grants from the Government which cannot be repaid. We see all around the coast boats that have been bought, possibly at the people's own expense, as they were probably to a large extent optimistic as to the likelihood of making a living.  The boats are practically all tied up to-day, and the owners have not even a hope of making a living.  To consider the development of industry on these lines is only contemplating throwing good money after bad.  I would rather foster and encourage, as far as possible, private enterprise in the provision of up-to-date trawlers, which would be more benefit to the fishing industry, in my judgment, than attempting to <Col N="2538" /> spend further money on boats of the kind referred to here.</P>

      <P>In reference to the reply of the Minister with regard to the money allocated to the Conservators, it does not seem to be so much his fault, as that the sum allocated is entirely inadequate, considering the very great importance of the subject.  I think he mentioned that £4,500 were allocated to Conservators.  I hope when the next estimate for this thing comes round, the amount allowed will be very much larger, because the fishing industry, from the point of view of food supply and other things, is one of the most important, and is only second to the cattle industry.  I asked for an explanation as to why there was no money available for the various counties where there are lakes and rivers.  I attach more importance to inland fisheries than to sea fisheries; I am more interested in them. I am now ventilating the subject so that the Minister may endeavour to obtain a very much larger sum when this important matter again comes forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is a matter between Deputy Johnson and Deputy Hewat as to whether the workers or the building industry got it. With regard to the fishing industry, it <Col N="2539" /> is a matter of very great importance that everything within reason should be done to develop fisheries along the coast, and in the rivers and lakes.  I know there are many men who carry on the combined business of small farmers and fishermen.  Their capital is very small, and they have been extremely hard hit during the last two or three years by the bad demand for their products.</P>
      <P>Although I am not in favour of expenditure, still I think expense incurred along the lines suggested by Deputy Johnson might eventually mean a paying undertaking for the Government. Before fishing can be made a successful proposition, it is necessary that some efforts should be made to reduce the freight rates between our ports and the English markets, and some effort should be made to get special methods of transport, such as fast trains and motor services, with refrigerating cars for the fish.</P>
      <P>The inland fisheries are matters of great importance, and I am sure the Minister has given some attention to them.  I think the interest of the farmers who occupy lands through which rivers flow should be considered, and, if possible, the fishing rights which have been recently taken from them should be restored.  Possibly there are certain restrictions in regard to the formation of Boards of Conservators.</P>

      <P>With regard to the fishery cruiser, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to numerous complaints which have been made and in regard to which questions have been asked.  They have reference to the capture of trawlers which were found fishing within prohibited areas.  The allegations are to the effect that, while many of these trawlers have been captured, no prosecutions have followed, and I would like if he would give us a return covering a given period, say, the past six or twelve months, of the number of captures which have been made, the number of trawlers which have been caught engaged in illegal fishing, and the number of prosecutions which have followed from them, if any, and whether a fine has been inflicted, or whether convictions have followed. Now, a further allegation is to the effect &mdash;and I would like to be put right on this matter if I am wrong&mdash;that if a prosecution does not follow within six months, the law is that there can be no prosecution.  I do not know whether that is the case or not, but I would like to have a statement from the Minister on the matter.  The fishermen themselves have also complained that they have reported trawlers which they have discovered within the prohibited area.  They have given their numbers and marked on charts where the trawlers have been found.  They reported these to the Ministry of Fisheries, and still no action has been taken, and no prosecution has followed.  The complaints under this head are very serious and very numerous, and it has even, I am informed, extended to the crew of the cruiser itself.  They say they <Col N="2541" /> have repeatedly made captures, and have made reports, and that nothing has followed, and there does not seem to be much use in capturing those trawlers.  I would like to point to a more serious aspect of these allegations to the effect that the reason that prosecutions have not followed, especially in the case of British trawlers, is that the Free State authorities have neither the right nor the power to order a prosecution.  Now, I would like to have this matter cleared up, because it is being said, and political capital is being made out of it, if I may say so, that while Belgian or French trawlers are or can be prosecuted, that the position is that under the Treaty we are not in a position to prosecute English trawlers which may be found poaching on our fishing ground.  Personally I do not believe that is the case.  But I would like to have the matter cleared up.  I do trust that when these trawlers are captured that a prosecution will immediately follow.  I would further say that a fine of such a comparatively large amount as £50, £80, or £100 does not meet the position.  Because a trawler will not mind paying a fine of £50 or £100 when the value of its catch on that occasion may be £2,000.  Some more drastic punishment than a fine should be inflicted in order to be effective, if it is within the power of the Court to have it inflicted.  I suggest in such cases, and especially in the case of a second offence, that the gear and trawl should be confiscated.  That is the only way I think in which this poaching can ever be effectively dealt with.  It is undoubtedly a very grave evil indeed.  Off the Aran Islands a dozen of these English trawlers may be seen just on the borders of the prohibited area very often, and there is no doubt that they are constantly invading the fishing grounds in that direction, and the Government does not seem to be taking the steps that are necessary and that should be taken in order to afford the necessary protection to our fishing industry.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I will take Deputy O'Connell's point first, and I think it is a far more important point than any point that has been raised here to-day.  I quite agree with him that there is real ground for complaint in this matter.  I happen to have the actual figures in connection with this subject.  Since I came into office it is a matter that has been troubling me considerably. There have been 21 cases of British trawlers since January, 1923, detected illegally fishing inside the prohibited area.  In two of these cases prosecutions were taken and they were brought before the District Justices. The question of jurisdiction was raised and they were referred to the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Were these British trawlers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, British only.  Out of the remaining 19 cases the papers were sent to the Chief State Solicitor in the ordinary way by the Minister, and so far no proceedings have been taken.  In 15 of those cases, as far as I can understand, the right of prosecution has now lapsed through the efflux of time.  In other words, I believe Deputy O'Connell is right in suggesting that after six months' lapse we have no longer the power to prosecute.  In the remaining four cases a prosecution is still pending.  In addition to these offences by the British trawlers, reports of offences by seven Belgian trawlers have also been received.  These cases are still under the consideration of the Law Advisers of the Government.  Now it is not correct, as far as I know, to assume that this Government has no right to prosecute British trawlers, while we could prosecute trawlers belonging to other Powers.  In fact if anything, the reverse is the case.  The <Col N="2543" /> British have admitted our bye-laws. They are bound by our bye-law limits. And with regard to that, therefore their position is the same as pre-Treaty; that is, they can be prosecuted by us for infringing the limit beyond the three-mile limit where the bye-laws of the old D.A.T.I. are in existence.  The position is different with non-British trawlers in this sense, that they can fish between the three-mile limit and the bye-law limit with impunity if they do not land their fish in this country.  If they do land their fish in this country we can seize it, but we have no power to take them once they are outside the three-mile limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. LYNCH Mr. LYNCH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYNCH</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different bye-laws.  The one that this applies particularly to is the one analogous to that of Moray Firth.  The Moray Firth section is identical with ours for Dungarvan. The Belgian and French can come within the bye-law limit and the three-mile limit and fish with impunity and then clear off to France and Belgium.  If they landed the fish in Ireland we could capture it, and we are trying to make arrangements such as obtained in the old days; that is, if they landed their fish in England it would be forfeited.  I admit the present condition is unsatisfactory, and I admit it would be wrong of me to come before the Dáil with a new estimate and to ask for £10,000 to spend in the upkeep of the &ldquo;Muirchu&rdquo; and £10,000 for the purchase of another cruiser and for its upkeep.  It would be wrong and I am not going to put up a case to ask for that money unless there is a change and an immediate change. There is no use having fishery patrol boats making captures if nothing can be done about them, and as far as Deputy O'Connell has raised that point, I am in agreement with him.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement is satisfactory as far as it goes, but it is quite evident the matter cannot be left at that.  We have his statement to the effect that in 15 out of 19 cases the time for prosecutions <Col N="2544" /> lapsed, and that these prosecutions cannot now be brought because proceedings were not started within the specified time.  We have been told that there are four prosecutions pending, but we do not know how long ago it is since these four cases were detected, and probably the period for prosecutions in these cases will lapse in a short time also.  I am glad that the Attorney-General has come into the House, as the matter under discussion is one that would specially concern him.  Perhaps he would be able to inform the Dáil what exactly is the position, because it is quite plain that the position as stated by the Minister for Fisheries is not at all satisfactory.  I do not see how the money under this Estimate can be voted, because the usefulness of this fishing cruiser seems to be nil.  That appears to be the case anyway in the statement made by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I understand that there has been a discussion for a considerable time on this matter, but, unfortunately, I have been engaged elsewhere, and, therefore, I am not familiar with all the matters which have been mentioned here.  The position as regards these prosecutions has been one of considerable difficulty.  The important thing is to try and catch these British ships before they leave the three-mile limit.  If they can be caught and held they can be dealt with, as has been done in some cases.  There is no question that we cannot touch, say, Belgian or French boats which are outside the three-mile limit until we enter into some kind of a convention.  I think there is a convention between Great Britain and France on the subject.  The only thing possible with reference to this was done on one or two former occasions, when the French Consul was approached, and he communicated with his Government.  The French Government did, I believe, on one occasion send a warship of some kind to scatter the offending French trawlers which were injuring the fisheries.  We cannot prosecute these people unless we catch them inside the three-mile limit and hold them until we can convict them.</P>

    <P>As regards the British ships, the position is not clear.  It is clear if we can <Col N="2545" /> catch them within the three-mile limit and hold them.  When I speak of British ships I mean ships registered in Great Britain and whose owners live in Great Britain.  Some of these people have taken up a very defiant attitude.  If they are caught outside the three-mile limit some of them take up an attitude of defiance and say &ldquo;you can do nothing,&rdquo; that the effect of the establishment of the Free State has been to alter the preexisting condition of affairs by which you could pursue them across the water. Similarly the bye-law area has been one of quite considerable doubt.  Questions analogous to those arising with reference to the fisheries have been raised in another case which is at present before the Courts with reference to workmen's compensation, and as to how far the rules set up under the Workmen's Compensation Act enable us still to have proceedings taken here and enforced against a shipowner in England, as was the case before the establishment of the Free State.  These questions are now before the Courts.  Their decision to a certain extent affects the position of these trawlers which are caught in the bye-law area.  I do not know that there has been any admission by any of these people that the bye-law area applies to them, but we have certainly had it under consideration, and it has presented considerable difficulties.  On the whole, we believe that, as far as we are concerned, the old rules and bye-laws continue in force, and it is intended to enforce them, but that question is affected by the case that is put up here.  The value of the Minister's cruiser is to catch the ships and hold them inside the three-mile limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the real explanation of its failure to do so up to the present is that the cruiser is not fast enough.  I notice that Paragraph 6 of the Treaty deals with this question of coastal defence, and states that until an arrangement has been made between the British and Irish Governments, whereby the Irish Free State undertakes her own coastal defence, the defence by sea of Great Britain and Ireland is to be undertaken by the English Government.  The second paragraph of the Article reads:&mdash;&ldquo;But this shall not prevent the construction or <Col N="2546" /> maintenance by the Government of the Irish Free State of such vessels as are necessary for the protection of the revenue or the fisheries.&rdquo;  I suppose, according to the Attorney-General, the vessel is not suitable for the protection of the fisheries.  One that would be suitable, I suppose, would have to be a very fast vessel and well armed.  I think that the cruiser referred to in this Vote is slow, and not very well armed.  I am reminded that it had certain armaments a few years ago, when its present crew, as a matter of fact, were responsible for the performance in 1916 when Liberty Hall was shelled.  I suppose the officers responsible for the shooting were not the navigation officers.  The vessel, at any rate, is not suitable for protecting the fisheries. I am told that she is capable, when put to the test, of doing six knots an hour.  There were, I think, a number of faster vessels, but I understand that some of them have been withdrawn from service&mdash;demobbed.  I understand that they were faster than what was formerly the &ldquo;Helga,&rdquo; and I wonder whether it has not been possible, pending a declaration of the law regarding the protection of the fisheries, to have something done.  This proposition rather suggests that the fishery cruiser had better be withdrawn from service, because if 15 out of 21 cases were in the first half of last year, and only four cases within the second six months, it appears as though there had been no attempts to catch offenders, and as a matter of practice, the offending trawlers are putting their fingers to their noses.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it would not be a very good case to take up and challenge the right of these trawlers in some very drastic fashion and enforce action in the Courts from the other side of the water.  If we are entitled to protect the fisheries according to this Article of the Treaty we are entitled to make due provision for that protection, and we are entitled to take all the steps that are necessary within our jurisdiction.  The explanation <Col N="2547" /> given by the Attorney-General suggests a long period of litigation unless some more satisfactory method of arriving at agreement with the British authorities is come to.  A Convention or Treaty respecting this matter cannot be arrived at quickly.  I wonder whether there has been any consideration given to the proposal to extend the limits of the jurisdiction by international Convention to the twelve miles suggested by two Governments. Perhaps the present state of opinion in America regarding the prohibition area might induce them to come to an agreement to extend the limit to twelve miles, and I believe Russia is of the same opinion.  Perhaps with the United States, Ireland, and Russia in agreement on this matter, we could persuade all the other nations of the world to extend the limit to the twelve miles. I would like to urge, though, that this matter, as well as other matters of the same kind, should be pressed forward very rapidly, and if Conventions or agreements with Britain are necessary that that should be the line to be taken rather than a continuous round of litigation.  It is quite clear from all one has heard that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction around the coast in this matter, and the statement of the Minister for Fisheries is sufficient to warrant the Dáil in supporting his contention that the Executive Council should press this matter of agreement between the two countries forward as fast and as earnestly as possible.</P>

One or two were closed because the buildings in which the industries were carried on were attacked and destroyed by the Black and Tans, and the industries have not since been re-opened.  Some other industries are closed for other reasons.  In these years of depression it is an unfortunate thing in these poor localities that no attempt has been made to re-open these little industries and give employment to the very poor people who were formerly employed in them.  I would be glad to have an assurance from the Minister that they will be re-opened.</P>

It has not yet been legally handed over to me, and I am not quite versed in all the ramifications of it.  I am aware, of course, that at several centres these little industries had to be closed in recent years from one cause or another, and the question of their re-opening is one which will have to be considered on its merits, and, of course, will have to be governed by the amount of money available for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2549" /> I may as well go back to deal with the different points as they were raised.  Several Deputies referred to the loans&mdash;Deputies McFadden, Wilson, O'Connell and Figgis.  I think I answered Deputy McFadden to the extent that I said I hoped, and had a certain amount of assurance, that these loans would be again made available in the near future.  I think that answers Deputy Wilson also.  I hope these loans will be made available.  I agree with Deputy Figgis's argument that giving these loans now is the only hope not only of putting the poorest portion of our population on their feet, but of recovering the amount that is outstanding. He made some point about how I managed the staff.  My staff is really what you might call a coalition staff. It is a coalescing of the Fishery Branches of the Department of Agriculture and of the Congested Districts Board.  I am now getting three or four men who were dealing with the Rural Industries Section of the Congested Districts Board.  All except the Rural Industries were brought into one building under the permanent head of the Department&mdash;the Secretary to the Ministry.  As a matter of fact, as far as the fishery portion of the staff is concerned, a saving has been made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson referred to the question of insurance, and to the fact that we have been more or less throwing money into a sieve.  He <Col N="2550" /> asked are we going to pay for casualties. Yes; where a boat is lying up premiums are refunded.  There have been a few casualties this year where payments were made by the insurance company in this country.  The insurance works out about one and a half per cent. per annum, which is not, I think, very high.  With regard to the question of the subsidy to the Aran-Galway steamer, as an alternative route, first of all this subsidy of £1,100 is also one of our inheritances.  We inherited this from the Congested Districts Board.  The alternative scheme is under consideration.  All that I can really say about it, is that it is being considered.  There are many things against the Coshla route as well as against the Galway route.</P>

      <P>The fact is that we are trying to get out of that position. The Congested Districts Board was, if anything, more or less in that position. I think the new method of the Vote coming on here instead of being as it was before, more or less freely handled by a body like the Congested Districts Board, will remove all possibility of the grandmother element appearing.  He referred to the question of help.  In practically every country in which fishing has made any headway there has been Government help&mdash;in Canada, Norway, Denmark, and so on.  He talked about grants.  I have never raised the question of grants.  There is no question of grants.  They are loans, and loans on reasonable security, and loans which, as Deputy Figgis said&mdash;I agree with him for once in my life&mdash;have been up to the recent slump years most honourably repaid. They have not been able to meet them in the last few years, but many other portions of the community were also hard hit during the last few years, and they have not been able to meet their liabilities.  The farmers asked for time for repayment of their land annuities, because of the position in which they are.  These men were harder hit even than the farmers.  They have such an extremely good record that I do not feel like coming down to bite their heads off at this particular juncture.</P>

I presume by rural industries he means industries like knitting and lace-making, homespuns and things of that kind.  I would suggest to him that these articles have not been anything like sufficiently advertised.  The people do not know where they are made or what is made.  In many cases the articles made are not suitable for the market, as you will find if you go into a shop in Dublin to get a pair of socks for city wear.  The same thing applies to homespuns.  We have a lot of Scotch homespuns advertised and sold, and I would suggest that if portion of the funds of the Ministry were spent in advertising more fully to the Irish public, and perhaps to the English public, these articles which constitute the rural industries that a very big trade might be built up, with great advantage to the poor people concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This estimate is for a new service, and it is presented pursuant to Section 14 of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, which enacts that pensions shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  It is estimated that £120,000 will be required to defray expenses under the Act to the 31st March, 1925, and £10,000 is taken as the figure which may be expended before the 31st March, 1924.  The Army Pensions Board has had a number of sittings for the assessment of pensions and allowances, and has now sat twice this week, and it is expected that at the end of <Col N="2554" /> this week it will have dealt with a large amount of the most urgent and easily assessable cases.  The sum for a supplementary estimate appears to be a very large one for such a short period, but the fact is that in the case of allowances granted in respect of the deaths of persons killed before April, 1922, the pensions are payable from that day, representing two years' arrears.</P>

      <P>There is a matter that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister under this Vote.  It is with regard to the Medical Board and the possibilities of an appeal to a referee.  I think that that has been the practice under the British Pensions Act, and gave, I think, some satisfaction. It seems almost to be desirable from every point of view.  The Medical Board makes an assessment, and I take it that it is still within the right of the Minister to veto that, but it is suggested, and I think with some force, that there should be an appeal made to a specialist in the case of wounds; at least they should be open to an appeal. The existence of such a referee would, I believe, ensure more satisfaction than his absence.  I do not think it would cost very much.  I think it would be a valuable addition to the scheme of administration under this Act.</P>

I am not taking exception to the new Vote, but I thought you would show this as a grant-in-aid from the Army Vote and not in the way of new money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure but that the amount might have been met out of the Army Vote.  But this is really an entirely separate thing from current expenditure on the Army.  The general rule is to keep the Army Pensions Vote a separate vote entirely from the Army Votes, and not to be taking the savings under one head into account in the other.  No matter what <Col N="2555" /> savings we might make in the Army, if we abolish the Army altogether the Army Pensions would have to continue for a certain length of time.  I believe that the amount of £10,000 could have been found within the limits of the present Army Vote only that we regarded this thing as an entirely different matter.  With regard to the matter of the referee, I can see a good deal to be said for the referee, but I would like to have an examination of the matter made before committing myself to agreeing with the suggestion of Deputy Johnson.  I would discuss it with him at some future time if he would raise it.  I see on the face of it, that it is generally desirable to have an appeal in such cases, but I would not be prepared really to discuss the matter now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new service.  The Commission was set up under the Civil Service Regulation Act of 1923, which expired on the 8th February.  A new Act has since come into operation, and the officers of the Civil Service Commission, now that permanent legislation has been secured, will be appointed definitely to their position.  For instance, the salary of the Secretary at present is paid from the vote of the Supreme Court of Judicature, and he is paid an allowance from this vote.  But now, from the 1st April, he will be paid entirely from the Civil Service Commission Vote.  The same applies to the next officer.  The Commission so far has held, I think, 16 examinations of one sort and another, for Customs and Excise, County Surveyors, two examinations for writing assistants, temporary typists, examination of D.M.P. for promotion, an examination for Marine posts in connection with the transport section of the Ministry of Industry <Col N="2556" /> and Commerce, inspectors of weights and measures in the Gárda Síochána, boy messengers in the Post Office in Dublin, and through the provinces, and other examinations of that sort.

The examinations have been held in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Letterkenny, Sligo, Athlone, Limerick, Tralee, Waterford and Dundalk. There has been a great variety of standard.</P>
    <P>This Estimate was prepared two or three weeks ago, and I think the amount is a little more than will be required, but I could not give the exact figure at the moment.  The examiners are drawn from the Universities, and the Secondary Schools and the superintendents of the examinations are generally secondary teachers.  The only figure that I see which would strike one as a bit high is the amount for subsitence allowances and for travelling expenses.  I believe that amount will not be required.  That is an excessive item in the Estimate.  All the other items, I think, are low.  The hiring of examination rooms and so forth does not amount to much.</P>

      <P>Is it intended to make this service a profitable one?  There is, I understand, a considerable charge made to at least some of the applicants before they are allowed to sit for examination. If it is only £1, I can imagine that if 1,608 persons have already been examined, and if each paid £1, that might have covered very nearly all the expenses.  Some, I know, have paid much more.  I do not know what the custom is in regard to the matter, or whether all or only a few pay a fee for sitting for examination.  The Minister has read out a number of classes which have gone through examination.  I was curious to know whether there had been any examination to qualify for Commissioners to act for Local Government bodies.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether there has been any examination for that section of public service?</P>

      <P>I suppose when the examination adumbrated by Deputy Johnson, which, as the Minister suggests, is in the womb of the future, comes into being, there will be a special examination in surcharging.  The Minister rather disarmed me in advance by admitting that the £400 is excessive for subsistence allowances and travelling expenses.  I cannot see why there should be any vote for subsistence allowance and travelling expenses for examiners and superintendents.  At all the places the Minister has named, where examinations were held, I think it is possible to find suitable superintendents.  It is certainly possible in Sligo.  I am sure the Minister for Fisheries could find them in Tralee, and in Letterkenny, I am told by Deputies suitable superintendents could be found.  It is only a question of looking out to find people on the spot who, for the fee paid, will exercise supervision at the examinations.  It is not an onerous task.  It requires integrity and intelligence, but, nevertheless, it is not a very difficult duty to perform.</P>
      <P>As far as the examiners are concerned, I cannot speak with the authority of Deputies on my right, who spend their whole days examining and come back and boast of the number in the bag as if they were out fishing.  I cannot see why subsistence allowances and travelling expenses should become necessary in the case of the examiner, who sets the paper and then it is sent down to the place where the examination is held.  I cannot see the necessity for those expenses in the case of the examiner.  The examiner lives probably somewhere in my constituency, and he goes down to the University, whichever it may be, and in his office he sets the examination paper.  The Minister then sends it down to the place of examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if he trusts it to the post, or if, as is the case in Italy, all examination papers and answers are conveyed by Civil Servants of a minor type.  I travelled with some of them, and I must say they are men of an unpleasant type, who spat on the floor all the time.  The post is not trusted there.  In this country I think the post might be.  I do not see any necessity, not merely for an excessive Vote, but for any Vote at all, for these subsistence <Col N="2558" /> allowances and travelling expenses.</P>

I think it is really impossible to have local superintendents. Would I be in order in asking when there will be a formal syllabus published, that will be accessible to candidates and their instructors?  Perhaps I might incidentally be permitted to congratulate the Minister on the scheme of examination held up to date. I think it is desirable that details and the courses or the curricula of our first and second class Civil Service examinations should be known as soon as possible, and as widely as possible, in the form of a syllabus.</P>

Sixteen examinations were held, that is, it cost £125 for each examination.

      <P>I think it is only fair to point out to Deputy Wilson that this £1,600 provides for a good deal more than conducting examinations. The work of the Civil Service Commission is much wider than that.  Deputy Cooper was trying to draw those who, like myself, have the misfortune to indulge in that peculiar form of torture called conducting examinations, but he will not draw me on this occasion more <Col N="2559" /> than to draw attention to one word.  I think those who are exposed to such obloquy should have the same title throughout the Paper and not be called Examiners in one place and Assistant Examiners in another.  One line in the Paper sets out the cost of Examiners and Superintendents, but the total is made out a little lower down.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an excellent explanation for that which I might be allowed to give.  Senior Inspectors of the Intermediate Education Board set a good many of the examination papers as part of their ordinary work.  Hence a good deal of the fees are fees to Assistant Examiners who examine the papers when there are a big number of candidates.  Usually in cases where there is a University standard, the Examiners are University Professors, and they could, of course, in no circumstances be called Assistant Examiners.  On the point Deputy Alton raised, I do not follow as to what exactly he meant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Mr. ALTON Mr. ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean that we should have a more or less standard syllabus that would hold for year to year so that it might be known what course or standard you would expect from first class Civil Service Candidates and what from second class; that is to enable us to know approximately.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service Commissioners can only hold an examination when requested to do so, and have not yet held a First Division Examination, but one is announced for the end of the year.  The standard has been announced as an Honours Degree Standard.  A detailed syllabus is in course of preparation, and will be published, but the difficulty is to arrange for a course that will give fair play to candidates from the two Universities, and not only from the two Universities, but really from the four institutions, namely, the three University Colleges of the National University and Trinity College.  The intention of the Civil Service Commission has been that examinations conducted by the Commission would never cut across the ordinary educational policy of the country, but would be the same as the examinations held by the Ministry of <Col N="2560" /> Education, and the Universities.  There have been special reasons urged by the departments concerned for certain examinations, and owing to the transition period, I think one departure was made in which an examination was fixed with an age limit beginning at 19, which was very undesirable, but was done for special reasons.</P>

I just thought I would simply emphasise this particular aspect of the Civil Service for the moment.</P>

      <P>That a sum, not exceeding £810, be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1924, to repay to the Contingency Fund certain miscellaneous advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Contingency Fund was established in 1923-24 by the vote of a grant in aid of £20,000.  The fund is placed at the disposal of the Executive Council to defray urgent or unforeseen expenditure not covered by the ordinary Votes and for which it may be impracticable to seek the immediate approval of the Dáil.  The Minister for Finance may make advances from the fund to meet deficiencies on ordinary Votes or for new services.  All advances from the fund will be repayable to the <Col N="2561" /> fund from the appropriate ordinary Votes, if there is a Vote in existence in respect of the service.  Where the service is not covered by an ordinary Vote the advances will be paid from the repayment to the Contingency Fund Vote.</P>
    <P>The Estimate, I think, contains particulars of all the advances made.  Senator McPartlin was in Geneva representing the Saorstát when he died.  The expenses of his funeral were, consequently, very high, and were a proper charge to be borne by the State.  A grant-in-aid of the Irish section of the inter-Parliamentary Union was felt to be proper assistance, and one which would give benefits to the State commensurate with the very small expenditure involved.  The last item is really a book-keeping item.  It is simply a payment to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of stamp duties payable on deeds and other documents.  It is a matter just of transferring money from one pocket to another, but it is put down just to show that things have been accurately kept.</P>

    <P>That a sum, not exceeding £11,000, be granted to defray the charge <Col N="2562" /> which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1924, for payment of grants to schools in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These are grants due to intermediate schools in Northern Ireland.  In 1922, after the setting up of the Provisional Government, an examination was held by the Intermediate Board at which the pupils from certain schools in Northern Ireland sat.  The examination was held in Belfast and other centres in the North.  As a consequence of the pupils from these schools entering for the examination which we held, rather than for the examination which was held by the Government of Northern Ireland, they lost the grants which were payable as results fees for these examinations, namely, £2,500.  Other grants which were lost to the schools as a result of following a certain line of conduct, also resulted from our holding these examinations in the North.  There was also lost a sum of £2,300 teachers' salaries; a sum of £2,400 of what was called an additional grant, and £3,600, science and art grant.  The Northern Government refused to pay any of the grants; they not merely refused to pay the £2,500 which would have been payable on the results of the examination, but they also refused to pay any other grants.  There is no doubt that these schools suffered a loss entirely as a result of our policy in holding that examination in the Six Counties.  Personally, I am not conversant with how the matter arose.  It was at a time when there was a dual system of Government in the country.  You had here a Dáil Eireann Cabinet, and you also had the Provisional Government.  I was member of the Dáil Eireann Cabinet and not of the Provisional Government, and I do not know exactly how the matter arose, but perhaps it could be explained.  In any case, the schools certainly lost their money entirely as a result of the line of action which we took.</P>

I want to say just one or two things with regard to the Vote on Account.  In the first place no money can be paid as a result of passing a Vote on Account on any new service that has not been specifically before the Dáil.  For instance, if these Supplementary Estimates had not been taken for Army pensions, it would have been impossible as a result of putting in a Vote on Account of Army pensions to have expended any money on Army pensions or any similar matter.  Money can only be expended out of a Vote on Account of existing services that have already been before the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a definite rule. I am not sure whether it is statutory or not.  I think it is.  It certainly is regarded as one of the canons that a Vote on Account only provides for the carrying on of existing services on which the Dáil has already pronounced.  With regard to the amount asked for in the Vote on Account, the Standing Orders of the Dáil contemplate that Estimates shall be passed before the 1st August. That is that from the beginning of the financial year, a period of four months shall be allowed during which the Dáil can consider the Estimates and can deal finally with them.  They have to be through all stages in the Dáil before the 1st August.  The practice in Great Britain is to take one-third of the total required as a Vote on Account.  I think if Deputies will reflect on the amount of time that will be required they will see that you cannot well ask for less than one-third of the amount required. I hope that in a day or so the Estimates will be circulated to the Dáil. <Col N="2566" /> They will not come before the Dáil for consideration until about a fortnight or so.  Almost about the same time the Budget and the Finance Bill will come before the Dáil, and will occupy a considerable amount of the time available. If we discuss the Estimates in detail, as we really ought to discuss them, there is no reason why we should rush over them in the way they are rushed over in England.  If we then pass our Central Fund Bill and our Appropriation Bill, and allow the three weeks that will be necessary in the case of Money Bills to elapse, you will see that you could not hope to have the matter finally dealt with before the end of June&mdash;it might very well approach nearer to the end of July, which is the limit contemplated by the Standing Orders of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the disparity in the amount of various Estimates, look at the Ministry of Fisheries.  The net estimate of the Ministry of Fisheries is £56,000, but there are Appropriations in Aid, as will be seen in the Supplementary, of something like £27,000 or £28,000, so that the gross expenditure is nearer £90,000 than £56,000.  These Appropriations in Aid may not come in until well on in the year, so that the amount asked for on account even in that particular Ministry is not much more than one-third of the total.  The general principle is that we ask for what is estimated to carry a Department over a period of three months.  If the Department desires to initiate any new services then we must arrange to take the estimate of that Department early.  It is undesirable, in my opinion, that we should have to rush the Estimates or that we should have to cut in in the middle of our consideration of them with one Central Fund Bill and follow it with another.  In this matter, as in many other matters of financial procedure, I think we are following the British practice. In this particular regard I think it is a practice that is reasonable, although the amount seems to be large.  I would suggest in the circumstances that the Dáil should be prepared to grant the amount that is asked for.  It commits the Dáil certainly to nothing, except to a continuance, during the period of three months, of the existing services. It does not commit them to the <Col N="2567" /> total sums; it enables them to discuss in detail every item that will appear on the Estimates, just in the same way as if the Vote on Account had not been taken at all.</P>

      <P>The first point I want to make is, that we are at a great disadvantage in dealing with a Vote on Account that we saw for the first time when we came into the Dáil yesterday. We sat yesterday for twelve hours with certain intervals for refreshments, during which we were not able to study Votes on Account.  It is unfair to ask us to go on with this Vote on Account with so little notice and so little opportunity of studying the matter.  That is my excuse for not having gone in detail into the figures.  In the figures I have gone into there seems to be an extraordinary discrepancy in regard to the proportion demanded by the various departments.  Taking one or two figures as I took them&mdash;mostly during the speech of the Minister for Fisheries&mdash; arbitrarily I found that we were asked to vote for the Oireachtas £40,000.  The total vote last year for the Oireachtas was £95,000, so that instead of voting one-third we are voting nearly half.  I cannot anticipate any extraordinary expenditure, any increase of staff, even any increase of salary that will necessitate an increased vote of that kind.</P>

      <P>I think Labour Deputies have almost lost hope of any rise in their emoluments.  Deputy O'Connell's Union has, I think, lost hope if Deputy O'Connell has not.  Looking down the list in a most arbitrary way&mdash; I only took out a few items&mdash;Secret Service is less than a fourth of what was voted last year.  I do not know whether Deputy Wilson's discovery last night that Parliamentary secretaries were possibly lurking under cover of Secret Service and have now come out, has had anything to do with that.  But the fact remains that where we voted £50,000 last year for Secret Service, we are only asked to vote £12,000, or less than one-fourth, now. The average of the Vote on Account <Col N="2568" /> is about one-fourth of the year's expenditure.  I look down the list and I find that the Gárda Síochána are asking for more than one-third of last year's Vote, though, as I understand, there is to be a cut in their pay and they will not, presumably, require as much money. On the other hand, an important Ministry&mdash;the Ministry for Local Government&mdash;are asking for less than one-fourth of last year's Estimate.  Whether that is the effect of the criticism of Deputy Corish, and that the Ministry of Local Government is feeling small and drawing in its wings, I do not know Again, Hospitals and Charities are the most surprising of the lot.  Hospitals and Charities last year were £16,000. They are asking for £12,000 on account, or just three-fourths of what they had before.  I can only suppose that the Government is seized with penitence, and is making its soul with charitable donations.  We come then to an extremely important Ministry, the Ministry of External Affairs, which is asking a Vote on Account of less than one-fifth of what it had last year.  The Ministry of Fisheries, on the other hand, is asking for a good deal more than the original Vote.  The Minister for Finance explained that, to a certain extent, but while he explained that appropriations in aid do not fall until late in the year, he told us nothing about those invested funds of the Congested Districts Board in the Church Consolidation Fund, or whatever it is, which bring in a certain amount of income. He did not explain how the balance would be redressed.  I have taken these figures more or less haphazard, and they show no governing principle.  The Government Departments have not been rationed.  I have a feeling that the Departments have been asked, &ldquo;How much do you want on account to carry you on to such and such a date.&rdquo;  That, to my mind, is not the function of the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance have taken these things from the Departments, whether they were excessive or whether they were low.  The Ministry of Finance should have said, &ldquo;You can have so much to carry you on to such and such a date, and not one penny more.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2569" /> I leave out that point of discrepancies, and I come to the other point. The Minister has quoted the practice at Westminster.  So far as my recollection goes, the practice at Westminster is not to crowd discussion on the Estimates into the dog-days.  I understand that they have already at Westminster discussed the Army and Air Force Estimates, and, in practice, the greater part of April and the early part of May are given to the discussion of Supply.  I am speaking from memory, but that is my impression. Only a few odd Estimates, in which people do not take much interest, such as the Scottish Estimates, the Indian Budget, and so on, are crowded into the later days of June and July.  If we pass this Vote on Account in its entirely now, we will be crowding our Estimates, which are probably the most important things we discuss here.  Legislation affects individuals.  Estimates affect taxation and taxation affects every person in the Saorstát.  If we do that, we shall be discussing them as a tired Dáil, in hot weather, languidly going through and trying to keep a House.  I think that would be a misfortune.  Consequently, if we pass this very large Vote on Account&mdash;this Vote on Account which is £909,000 larger than the National loan; which is a quarter of the year's expenditure&mdash;it will be in the power of the Government to adjourn us.  They will have the money they want, and, if our debates are inconvenient, it will be in their power to adjourn us for at least three months.  By doing so we shall abdicate our constitutional function.  I, for one, cannot support that.  I agree that a Vote on Account is necessary, but I think this Vote, produced at such short notice, with no more explanation than we have just received from the Minister, is an excessive Vote.  Therefore, I would ask the Dáil to consider very seriously before they decide upon it.</P>

      <P>With regard to the first point that Deputy Bryan Cooper has raised in respect to discrepancies, I think the query he put very largely answers itself in the White <Col N="2570" /> Paper that was circulated to us yesterday. When these various items that are given on the Orders of the Day are compared with the Votes that were asked and given at the beginning of the current financial year, certain discrepancies do appear.  But when they are compared with the revised Estimates that are to be called for for the coming year, as shown in this White Paper, the discrepancies that were apparent before disappear.  That is to say, one-third, or whatever is the amount required on account, is generally proportionate to the Vote that will be required for the whole figure.  That leaves the last question, which is, whether the vote be or be not too large.  I do not think any Deputy here exactly fears that the Executive Council is going to do what Deputy Bryan Cooper suggested as a possibility&mdash;that is, to dispense with the Dáil because it had got the necessary amount of money which it needed. But the constitutional position remains the same.  It is constitutionally sound that no legislature abdicates its functions to the extent of not keeping the Executive generally in close touch with the legislature in the only possible way &mdash;by voting moneys for short periods only.  If any motion be made, as I understand motions will be made, for a reduction of the Vote on Account, on the ground that the Vote on Account is excessive and lasts for too long a period, I shall support it.  As regards my third point, I asked the Minister a certain question in regard to a statement he made that Votes could not be asked on account where a Vote had not appeared already in the previous financial year in some form, either originally or supplementary.  I asked that because in regard to No. 12&mdash;I can understand what the Vote is; it is an earlier Vote under a new name, but it is a new name &mdash;no earlier Vote did appear in any previous estimate for an item that was called a State laboratory.  How far the rule which is offered to this House is consonant with the existence of this old Vote under this new form is a matter I put to the Minister now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The total sum required under the Representation of the People Act and under the Electoral Act last year, was £54,000.  The total Estimate for 1924 was £41,000, and £27,000 are now asked for.  I wonder whether the Government is expecting a General Election? I understand, of course, there is a Register, and I understand there is a likelihood of local elections.  This is an Estimate for four months which will take us on to July.  Again, I think this period is too long.  I would support entirely what Deputy Cooper has said regarding the necessity for keeping this matter in our hands more tightly, and not allowing control for so long a period as four months to go from our grasp until we have had an opportunity of examining these Estimates more thoroughly.  We have now reached the 27th of March, and we are supposed to get through this Vote on Account, and the necessary legislation to follow, before the 31st of March.  I can imagine some very important matters arising within the next month, and I think there should be an opportunity for a closer examination of these figures, and at least some of the Estimates, some time within the period covered by the Vote on Account.  It is on those grounds I suggested I would move for a reduction of this sum, so as to cover two, rather than four, months.  While on this matter, I want to raise a more detailed point, if it is opportune.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Dáil that the <Col N="2575" /> reasons that have been urged for the reduction of the amount mentioned in this particular Vote should not be accepted.  There is no possibility of the Executive Council dispensing with the services of the Dáil for a period of three months.  The session of the Dáil can only be ended by the consent of the Dáil, and adjournments are taken on a Vote of the Dáil.  The Standing Orders prescribe that while in session, unless otherwise ordered, the meeting shall take place on certain days and at certain hours of the week.  The Dáil can only adjourn for any period by consent, and if that suggestion was made at 8.30 anybody wanting to talk out a motion for an adjournment for three months could succeed in talking it out.  Probably the suggestion is one not put forward seriously at all.  As for the question of giving a four months' supply to this Government, I think I have indicated that no matter how we got on with the Estimates we would be into June before we would be at all sure of having them passed.  Then, after we have done with the Estimates we have to have these Bills.  The Bills will not become law for a period of three weeks unless the Seanad so chooses.  I presume in the present case, where we have a Central Fund Bill dealing with the amount in the Supplementary Estimates, the Seanad will send it back to the Dáil forthwith, and no question like the present one could exist if it sent it back, so that after the Dáil has dealt finally with the matter you would have a period of three weeks lapsing before you had your Bill ready for signature by the Governor-General.  If the Seanad makes recommendations, the Dáil is bound to consider these recommendations, and you may easily have a week spent upon that.</P>
    <P>A month might elapse actually between the time the Estimates are introduced and dealt with; in fact a good deal more than a month.  If we had to take all the stages of the Central Fund Bill it would take something like three weeks to get the Central Fund Bill passed, and it might be something like a month from the time the Central Fund Bill passed the Dáil, until it was <Col N="2576" /> ready for signature.  If we were standing upon all these details, it is quite possible it would not be possible at all to carry on on less than four months' Vote. I suppose we would have nobody in the Dáil, in the case of a Central Fund Bill, after the preliminary stages have been gone through, which must be largely a formal matter, insisting upon the usual notice being given for every one of the five stages of the Central Fund Bill.  The Labour Government in England, which I suppose is no more representative of the general body of the electorate than the Executive Council is here, is trusted with four months' supply, and I think there is really no good argument for reducing the amount asked for here.  If the Executive Council, in the interval, is forced to come to the Dáil again, and to go through all these details in getting a Central Fund Bill, supposing we were to meet with delay in the Seanad, and supposing we were to meet delay in the Dáil, so that notice should be given for such, it would practically mean we should begin all this business of having motions for Supply and a new Central Fund Bill next week.  The points made against giving this four months' supply seems really to be debating points, and good enough as debating points, but I do not think that they are substantial at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that the Vote be reduced by a sum of £5,000,000.  The Minister has built up a story about the various stages and processes, but he has missed the essential matter.  Deputy Cooper pointed out that this is a series of items of Votes on Account that we have had in our hands for a very short time, and when we are almost on the last day. Now, I do not know what the actual facts are in this case, but I would venture with a good deal of confidence, to say that the example quoted by the Minister of the Labour Ministry in England, does not find a parallel here. They do not produce their motions for a Vote on Account two days before the end of the financial year, and expect the Bill to be passed the same night. The Dáil will have to learn constitutional lessons by practice and experiment, and I think it well that we should <Col N="2577" /> feel that we have command of the Ministry through the financial weapon more effectively than in any other way. If the Ministry is granted, without discussion, as it will appear, supplies for four months, they have a free hand over expenditure, and over the various Departmental operations.  Even Ministers External to the Executive Council will have a free hand if the Minister for Finance approves.  At least the Dáil will have consented to the expenditure of money on behalf of these Ministries, and we will not have an opportunity of considering matters of policy or details of Estimates that may come forward, and a Vote on Account may require to be repeated in a month's time.  The Minister says that we will have to go through the process of passing a Central Fund Bill which may mean delay.  It might, but is there any more reason for expecting delay in a month's or in two months' time, than there is to-night? If there is a possibility of that delay then, there is a possibility of that delay now, and if the Ministry is counting upon no delay now because we are challenged to hold up the whole business of the country, then I say it is taking an unfair advantage of the Dáil if that is his view.  The end of the financial year is upon us, and we are to be expected to pass this Vote of Supply and to pass the Central Fund Bill without giving them consideration.  I have no doubt the Minister will get his Bill, and that it will become an Act in due course.  But there is no reason why he should not apply in a month's time or two months' time equally if we have the right to discuss financial questions, so that the fabric of his story falls at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that the Dáil should have command at all times of the finances, and the proposal to reduce this Vote by £5,000,000 simply means that between now and the end of April, or the end of May as the case may be, we can go into these matters, when we will have a little more leisure and a little more time to give them consideration than we can give them to-night or to-morrow.  I want to make at least my protest that we should not be expected to do these things in so short a time, and to assume that the finances are perfectly <Col N="2578" /> right and that we need not have any hesitation in presenting powers to spend £11,000,000 to the Government.</P>
    <P>True, of course it is as the Minister says, that the Dáil is likely to be in session.  But supposing it is not? Even when it is in session the Minister forgets that financial questions can only be raised at the instigation of Minister, so that the Dáil is tied very much if it loses control of its money.  If within the next four months we have not the right to raise these financial questions, then we are giving away some of our authority, without having duly considered the position.  For these reasons I move a reduction by £5,000,000 of the sum to be granted as supply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second that.  I want to make it perfectly clear that there is no suggestion whatever that any member of the Executive Council proposes taking an extended holiday with the money that will be voted.  The position actually is, as I see it, that we have already voted that the Departments concerned will have four months' supply, but inasmuch as there has been no time to consider these things in detail the amendment which I am now seconding is that of that sum which we have agreed to vote, only approximately half will be moved out of the Central Fund.  The other half will remain there in order that on a later occasion these matters might be gone into more fully than is possible at the present moment.  There is no difficulty in regard to it.  It would only mean that in April or in June another motion would be taken in Committee on Finance, and what is now being done in respect of half of the money that it is agreed to vote will be then done in respect of the other half.  I think in view of the fact that these Estimates have only been put into our hands and are now being considered with such haste, in order to comply with the Constitutional provisions, that the amendment is a very fair and just one.  It leaves the Executive Council in the position that it desires.  It also leaves the Dáil in the position that it can at an early date, in case it should then desire to <Col N="2579" /> do so, raise a debate as to the provision of the other half of the money. I second the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to say to the Dáil that I regret that these Estimates have not been produced earlier. If I were to have any responsibility again I certainly would make every possible effort to have the detailed Estimates out in good time before a Vote on Account was asked for.  I certainly did what I could to expedite them this year.  They probably would have been out in a reasonable time if it had not been for some matters such as the Army reorganisation.  We had most of the other Estimates a good while before the Army Estimate.  We only succeeded in getting the Army Estimate at the last moment.  There were other Estimates, like the Land Commission, which presented peculiar difficulties in view of the reorganisation, and there was a delay in the Departments supplying them.  Then there was the necessity for a certain scrutiny in the Ministry of Finance.  I admit quite frankly that members of the Dáil have a right to be aggrieved at not having the detailed Estimates in their hands, some weeks before they are asked for the Vote on Account.  I hope that what has occurred this year will not occur again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we were a great deal later than this.  I think it was the 19th April before we succeeded in having detailed Estimates.  I had hoped that this year we would have them in sufficient time to allow no grounds for complaint, but circumstances and difficulties intervened that caused delay.  We have not yet a perfect machine, as Deputies know very well, and there is a great deal of difficulty in getting things entirely up to time.  I do not think the Government will have a free hand for four months.  It must be prepared to have all its business done in four months.  It must be prepared to have all the Estimates considered in four months, and consideration of the detailed Estimates must begin practically as soon as the Standing Orders allow.  It has been the practice that any members of the Dáil can demand that a particular Estimate be dealt with first.  We agreed last year <Col N="2580" /> that the Opposition should have their choice of the Estimates on which we were to begin.</P>

      <P>What I said with regard to the necessity for introducing a resolution and starting on a Central Fund Bill almost at once does hold in spite of what Deputy Johnson said.  We have now the Estimates.  We were not able to get them up to this.  Consequently we were not able to take steps to put the matter in train.  Now that we have the Estimates there would be no reason for not putting the matter in train at once, so that full time could be given and all the necessary details could be allowed in regard to the second portion of this Vote.  I do not think that if we went to the Seanad with one Bill and asked them in view of the circumstances to take it at once that we could then come back in a short time and again throw ourselves on the mercy of the Seanad in that particular way&mdash;a way which is not fair.  I admit it is entirely undesirable and unfair to rush these matters.  I have tried, so far as I could, in any Bills I was responsible for, not to rush them, but to allow all the time that anybody wanted for their consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the reason the Minister for Finance has given as to why he was not able to put the Estimates in our hands earlier is really the reason why we must consider them.  We have not been given a chance to go into the Estimates in the way we would like to.  We have agreed to vote a certain sum into the Central Fund.  The right to expend this money which the Minister seeks is another matter for us.  There are items in the Estimates which we would like to criticise.  There are matters of policy on which we want information. We are not satisfied with them.  We have not had this evening an opportunity to criticise these items in the way we would like.  Accordingly, we can hardly feel it is fair to expect us to give the Minister for Finance the right to spend money on certain services that we are not perfectly satisfied with at the moment. <Col N="2581" /> The Ministry admits that we have not had any opportunity to consider this matter fully, and the Minister will recognise that it is fair to the House that he should not ask us to consent to grant him the right to spend money on services that we have been denied the right of criticising.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Baxter would be met in any way, I would guarantee, say in the case of the Army Vote, that that Vote should be taken first among the Estimates, and that we should begin discussion of it in full detail, say, somewhere about the middle of April.  The Vote on Account simply enables the carrying on of existing services as they stand.  It does not enable the Executive to launch out in any particular way.  I suggest that the Dáil should give us this amount, which is the usual amount in other places where they have experience, and where there is a good deal of scrutiny, and where Governments have been kept in check. If the Dáil gives us this amount, they will not be giving anything away, and they will be merely facilitating business and allowing a straight run on the discussion of the Estimates, instead of having to come forward again for another Vote on Account, and spending time that that will involve.  Besides, as I have pointed out, once we have got the Estimates we ought really to be going on at once with this matter, and we should do it in a formal way.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will recognise that if he is given the £5,000,000 which Deputy Johnson's amendment permits him, that will carry him on to the date he mentions&mdash; 15th April.  We would then have an opportunity of criticising these items, perhaps, in detail, which we would like to do, and which the House is entitled to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are entitled to agree with the Minister for Finance that he has not given the Dáil a sufficient opportunity of criticising this Estimate before it is passed through. On the other hand, in that very admission, he asks for the consideration of the Dáil, under peculiar circumstances. While I would agree with the amendment as being quite reasonable, I think, under present circumstances, it will be necessary to vote for the Government <Col N="2582" /> to carry them over this period.  It is not a very long period.  In return, I think the Government ought to give us the earliest opportunity of criticising the amount in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very generous of Deputy Hewat.  But Deputy Hewat does not remember the assurances we received last year that these things would all be made right this year, that matters of procedure would be carefully considered, and that due consideration would be given to the constitutional formalities.  I am asking that the Dáil should insist upon refaining control, while allowing the Government as much money as is necessary to carry on, and to ensure that the services would be maintained long enough to enable matters to be considered by the Dáil&mdash;even much longer than is necessary. We have got lump sums put before us, but we have not any details.  If we had those details, we might be able to raise specific questions before this Vote is passed.  Not having those details, I believe that we are bound to hold the Government on short leash, and say, &ldquo;We will allow you to carry on for, say, two months, and you will come to us again for more money.  We will see how you conduct yourselves in the meantime, and if you conduct yourselves fairly and reasonably, and be good administrators, then we will allow the remainder.&rdquo;  But let us, at least, feel for once that we are masters.  Deputy Hewat, of course, need not try to think himself in that position.  But it is new to some of us, and I think that, as a collective body, the Dáil should assert its authority in this matter, and show that it intends to maintain a rigid control over the supplies of money and that it will not allow the control to be handed over for this period of four months, without having had a proper account rendered and a proper Estimate presented of what it is proposed to do with the money.  This is not an unreasonable proposition. There has been no attempt to take advantage on this side in this amendment. I think, as a matter of fact, it is too reasonable.  If we wanted to be very strict in the matter, we should refuse the Vote altogether without a much more definite promise or guarantee <Col N="2583" /> of better conduct.  But when we are suggesting that the Vote shall be reduced from £11,000,000 to £6,000,000, it allows about two and a half's months of expenditure without knowing how the money is going to be spent.  Really that is what it means.  We have agreed to the Vote on Account for certain items and certain Departments. But we only know those as lump sums. We do not know how they are to be detailed, and I submit that the Dail ought to keep a tight hold over this money, and not allow £11,000,000 to be voted out of the Central Fund, because it would carry us on too long without that rigid control that is required.  Let us grant them £6,000,000, and insist upon their coming again for further supplies.</P>

I think that is a serious point, especially in view of the fact that when this Estimate was arranged by the Minister the present Army crisis had not arisen. Things have happened since that might alter the Estimate.  I am not prepared, at any rate, to agree to the passing of an Army Estimate that would not give full details as to the strength of the Army which were not given last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy also that last year I think I mentioned the number of men in the Army when I was introducing the Budget.  I would also remind the Dáil that while we may make promises of amendment they should know that the way of the sinner is long and the penitent is very slow at times.  I am certain that when those who criticise us now come along here and serve their apprenticeship they also in their time will promise amendment and make great efforts, but the amendment in their case also will be slow.  This year we will be at least 18 days ahead of last year in regard to the presentation of the details of the Estimates.  I would also like to draw the attention of the Dáil to the fact that while the sum asked for may seem very large in amount, and in particular cases be of almost colossal proportions, it is not within the discretion of the Executive Council or of the Minister for Finance to say that there are particular amounts which he is entitled to spend or particular amounts which he could divert to other purposes.  Take some of the larger amounts mentioned, such as property losses, for which £2,500,000 is asked.  Let us suppose there was extraordinary activity on the part of the County Courts, and that huge sums were awarded, and that before the end of the month even we had exhausted that sum.  Obviously, we would have to come along again before the end of the month to ask for a sufficient sum to discharge our liability in respect of that item.  Even excluding for a moment the <Col N="2585" /> work of the County Courts and the Recorder's Court in dealing with damage to property, there is the Wood-Renton Commission awards which we have to discharge, and over which the Minister for Finance has got no discretion.  Take the item old age pensions.  Is it within the discretion of the Minister to say whether or not he will interrupt payment on account of that particular item?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies can understand that while saying they will refuse us particular sums of money that it is not the Government they are refusing them to, but the particular services in respect of which we are asking this sum to be funded in order to enable us to discharge duties for which we are at the moment responsible.  It goes on in the same way with various other items.  The actual sum over which the Executive Council can exercise discretion, is relatively small.  For these particular Estimates, in which there should be discretion of that sort, we have, I think, at all times been willing to come before the Dáil and allow them to be discussed at length.  The Minister for Finance has had only six months experience in that particular Department.  He has worked very long hours, and has had to deal with a somewhat different machine to that which we had at this time last year.  There have been alterations in some of the Departments and Votes which appeared under certain heads then will appear this year under other heads.  It is not unreasonable in the first years of Government, in the setting up of a new State such as this, that he should have to come here and say, if you like, <i>Peccavi.</i>  There has been an improvement, as he has saved 17 days this year.  I believe that while he may not reach perfection next year, if he should have the misfortune to remain <Col N="2586" /> in office for another 12 months, at any rate he will make some improvement.</P>

      <P>While I sympathise very much with the attitude of the Government and while each of them may strike his breast and say, <i>Mea culpa,</i> still it is always a very bad business to give a blank cheque or to give a cheque in advance. What surprises me is how the business representatives who come into the Dáil to effect a revolution in business methods, should now openly say they are quite willing to vote 10 millions of money, having regard to the fact that the essentail services of the country come to only 30 millions, and that the reductions they promise the electors were to reach, perhaps, half of the original estimate.</P>

We are not pointing out that they promised us reforms last year.  We are giving them half the time that they asked.

      <P>Before this Bill is read a second time I should like to make my position clear, and, as I take it, the position of other Deputies.  This Bill corresponds to what in another place is known as the Consolidated Fund Bill, and it is one of the comparatively few opportunities that private members have for raising general questions of policy connected with the Government. Now, I admit that in this Dáil private members have greater <Col N="2590" /> facilities than they have at Westminster, that we have more opportunities of raising questions.  For instance, Deputy Corish's motion, which was discussed at considerable length some weeks ago, would probably have to go down as a discussion on the Consolidated Fund Bill in Westminster.  I admit that.  But I am not disposed to give up any particle of the rights of private members, and if I acquiesce in the taking of the Second Reading and the other Stages of this Bill to-night, I do so under protest, and submit that it should not, in future years, be regarded as a precedent: that in future years we should be given a full opportunity of discussing the First and Second Reading and the Final Stages of the Central Fund Bill.  This year, I agree, circumstances have been unusual. The President has been ill; there have been various crises; there have been resignations of Ministers, and so I am not disposed to press my point to-night in opposing this Bill.  But I would urge the Minister for Finance, in so far as he can in the future, to see that our acquiescence now will not prejudice next year, and that he will try to give us more time in which we may raise a general discussion.</P>

      <P>I would not ask for any promise on the part of the Minister for Finance as to what he would do next year, or any other year, though I would say this, that, as far as I am concerned, I have accepted the procedure to-night as a matter of urgency, and I agree with what Deputy Cooper has said on the matter. In emphasis of that I would say that if a similar practice was again adopted in connection with future proceedings I would oppose it from beginning to end.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the President if he is here&mdash;or perhaps the Minister for Finance could answer now or at a later stage&mdash;to give the Dáil some indication as to what is the Government's intention as regards legislation and Estimates.</P>
      <P>We have a long list of Bills, some of them of very great importance, and no doubt of very great length, suggested to us as requisite to be passed.  Since that time we have had quite a number of suggestions of new Bills.  I believe it will be convenient to the Dáil to know whether we are expected to sit right through the year, month after month, without any relaxation or interval, or whether it is intended that there shall be some adjournments. Deputies would like to know a month or two ahead.  I think, and as far as one can see, the prospect is to sit week after week and year after year until the year 1953, according to the legislative programme, if we are to give any reasonable consideration to these projects.  There is, undoubtedly, a very big programme before the Dáil. If the Government intends to press forward this long string of legislative proposals, and I hope they are considering their budget of time as well as their money Budget, then the Dáil should be informed as to what their wishes and intentions are regarding the legislative year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Johnson, and to remind the Dáil of some of the Bills of the Government. There will be a Railways <Col N="2593" /> Bill; that will be a large and complicated measure.  There is to be a Local Government Bill; that will not be very simple or very brief.  There is to be a Defence Forces Bill; that might reasonably be postponed for a time for the convenience of the new Minister; but still it might call for careful and mature consideration.  There is a Bill dealing with the regulation of prices; that will be an extraordinarily difficult matter.  There is a Bill dealing with patents, trade marks, and copyright; the Attorney-General was good enough some time ago to show me a draft of it, and I can only say the Bill was so bulky it concealed the Attorney-General from view.  We shall have to give that full consideration.  There are to be various Bills from the Ministry of Agriculture, a Bill of very great importance, dealing with the grading of butter, eggs, and such matters.  There are all these things, the Budget and the Estimates. How much time does the Government intend us to devote to these things?  I agree with Deputy Johnson, unless the programme is lightened somewhat, we shall have to sit until 1953, or thereabouts, dealing with this comprehensive programme.</P>

      <P>I, too, am anxious as to the procedure that will be taken by the Government with regard to their legislative programme.  Probably the Government, and the Government Party, would know beforehand what the intentions are, the same as in the case of the Army situation.  But other members of the Dáil should know also.  I support Deputy Johnson that we should have some information as to the Government's intentions.</P>

      <P>I think I heard the President say optimistically one day that he hoped to have all these measures passed early in July, and then to let the Dail adjourn for two or two-and-a-half months.  Personally, I do not think we can get all these things done, and we may have to postpone <Col N="2594" /> some of our programme if we are to have any Summer recess.</P>
      <P>I will ask the President to make a statement on the subject as soon as possible. The Cabinet Secretariat have been endeavouring to draw a time-table of legislation, but the work before us is so heavy it has not been possible to do so yet.  We have, for instance, the Railways Bill and the Patents Bill to deal with.  We are up against the appointment of a new Minister for Industry and Commerce, and probably one of those Bills could not, at any rate, be taken into account.  As Deputy Cooper has suggested, the Army Act will again have to be postponed for some length of time.  There is no definite time-table prepared at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

      <P>There is a point that I am interested in.  The business of preparing matter for the Dáil is of a somewhat complicated nature, involving a staff which has had no holidays beyond seven working days since the Dáil first met in September, 1922.  If we cannot get any indication of how we shall stand in regard to a summer Recess, I am afraid that if the Dáil wants to meet in July or August its present staff will then collapse. I do not know how the Dáil will get on without the staff which it does not see, but which, nevertheless, has to do the work.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Deputies to allow a few days?  I think there has been great pressure, which is the reason the Report has not come up for discussion before this. I think it is desirable that that report should receive very full and careful discussion in the Dáil.  Probably there would not be a suitable opportunity for discussion before Wednesday or Thursday next, and if the Government in making their arrangements could fix some day before the end of next week, I think it would be a good time for discussion when that Report comes before us.  I do not want to argue the matter in any way now, but I am expressing my own attitude in that connection and I am trying to get as much information as I can in order that I may be in a position to urge that the Committee did not take into consideration all the possible alternative sites that might be available.</P>

I know it has been in the minds of one or two Deputies, and it is in relation to what the Dáil has to consider with regard to Private <Col N="2596" /> Bill Legislation.  It is that when the Recess is taken for the Summer, if there be a Recess, we have to consider whether that means the end of the session, and what the definition of a session would be.  I think that that ought to be considered in connection with the possibility of a Recess for the Summer.</P>
