      <P>I will be dealing with this matter.  The question raised really is a very simple one, but it has been so complicated by certain ill-advised and unbalanced utterances within the last week that I think it cannot be dealt with suitably by way of a reply to a Parliamentary question. I put it to the Deputy who is responsible for the question that if he would give me an opportunity of answering this to-morrow by raising the question on the adjournment I would be prepared to make a detailed statement on the whole position.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been directed to the editorial in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i> of Saturday, September 6th, regarding the use of fish meal as a food for pigs.  The Department have not issued a leaflet recommending the use of fish meal, but reference is made in one of their leaflets to the subject, and attention is especially drawn to the danger which may accrue from the indiscriminate use of fish meal.  The Department are satisfied that the use in small quantities of fish meal conforming to the composition given in the leaflet referred to will not result in any deleterious effect on pork and pork products. The Department are also satisfied that when injurious effects follow <Col N="2421" /> the use of fish meal this is due to the use of an inferior quality, or to the use of large quantities of good quality fish meal.  The Department's experience in this respect has been borne out by extensive experiments conducted in other countries.  The Department realise that where skim or separated milk is available, no necessity exists for the use of a substitute such as fish meal.  The Department have also proved by experiments that blood meal is capable of replacing separated milk for fattening pigs, and that it is free from the objections that may be urged against fish meal, and they have endeavoured to impress on bacon curers in this country the necessity for manufacturing this product, and making it available for pig feeders.  In view of the fact that when fish meal of the proper quality is judiciously used it does not deleteriously affect the quality of the bacon, it is not the intention of the Department to recommend prohibition of the importation of this article.  It would be impossible also for the reason that fish meal is a very useful food for poultry.</P>

    <P>The reason for introducing these Votes is that, first, in regard to Vote 47, a certain amount has to be provided by way of a grant to meet the charges falling upon the Land Commission owing to the delay in the payment of certain sums in lieu of rent.  The Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce is necessary because of the intended passing of the Unemployment Insurance Bill.  We actually will have to take the Vote in anticipation of the Bill being passed in order to make the payments which the Bill provides.

We have no desire to encroach needlessly or lightly on private Members' time.  It is simply a question of a sense of proportion, and if the nature of public business to-morrow requires it, it will be done.  Equally I am prepared to meet Deputies who desire to avail of the discussion on the Land Commission Estimate or on any other matter by making to-morrow a particularly long day, and sit on as late as they like to-morrow evening.</P>

The Minister surely will admit that the delay in respect to the division of land is of great importance and that it is creating a considerable amount of anxiety in the country, and that it is a much more important matter than some of the matters that have been brought forward. To raise the question as to what will be the programme next week, if there is going to be any programme, on the adjournment to-morrow night, surely is <Col N="2426" /> not paying due regard to the requirements of public business.</P>

It meets my point much better to have a discussion on this motion and not the Estimates.

      <P>It is by no means certain that when the Estimates are introduced members will be afforded any opportunity on the Land Commission Estimates for discussing the matter dealt with in Deputy Lyons' motion.  It may be an estimate that would preclude altogether the <Col N="2427" /> question of delay in carrying out the provisions of the Land Act.  I have not yet seen the estimate, and I do not know, but it may be that the question of Deputy Lyons' motion could not be raised on the estimate.</P>

Probably there will be general agreement as regards the passing of this vote, but will there be general agreement with the Minister's policy in dealing with this part of the Land Act?  That is quite another matter.  It must be treated in a different way.  I think the Minister should welcome a discussion on this matter. He ought to be grateful to Deputy Lyons or any other Deputy who would bring forward a motion, which would give him an opportunity of justifying his policy, if he can justify it.  If he does not accept the motion in that light, the feeling generally will be that the Minister's policy cannot be justified by himself, and that he is making an effort to avoid discussion on the matter.  I am not suggesting that, but I think the Minister ought to welcome the motion, and say that he is prepared to give an opportunity for discussion of it, as it is a matter of great importance to the people of the country.</P>

I have taken the House into my confidence, and I realise that no possible subterfuges of mine can avoid discussion on this motion.  I may go further and point out that the Vice-President <Col N="2428" /> has intimated that the House may sit late to-morrow night to discuss this motion.  I agree that, while the estimate may go through, it will be necessary to discuss this motion.

We were told from the Government Benches yesterday evening that, in order to save time, a discussion could be started in connection with that motion of mine, and could be effectively answered by the Minister.  That would save time to-morrow. This afternoon another complexion has been put on the matter.  It is insinuated that these motions are all frivolous matters.</P>

We are told that four or five hours can be given to this matter to-morrow, but I do not think it is fair to ask Deputies to remain over longer than they are accustomed to do on Fridays.  And the Government ask them to remain over because they are taking the private Members' time.  Private Members should have the time that is allowed, according to Standing Orders.  Instead of that, we are told that this motion can come on to-morrow if the Dáil agree to sit later than 4 o'clock.  That is not right.</P>

That is a right under Standing Orders, and it is apparently a right which was intended by those who drafted Standing Orders and those who approved them, to be an over-riding right to the private member's right to have his business discussed.  To-morrow the Deputy will get an opportunity of moving his motion if we have to sit all night and the Minister for Agriculture will undertake to divide no lands in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion that this matter was before the Dáil, I was the seconder of the amendment to reject the structural alteration clause.  No reasons or arguments put forward since <Col N="2431" /> then have induced me to change the opinion I expressed then.  It is my intention to-day again to second the amendment to reject that clause.  I do not purpose going into the various matters that were detailed on the last occasion. The principal objection to the clause that I make is not on behalf of the big houses but on behalf of the small traders in the villages and the country districts.  I said before, and I repeat, that I do not believe it would be possible to carry out these alterations. We are told that a Commission is about to be appointed to consider the entire licensing laws.  When that Commission reports, they may recommend the reduction of some of the licences in places where there are too many.  Those traders who will be blotted out will receive adequate compensation and the structural alterations will be carried out by the traders left in business.  I do not think there would be any objection to that.  I hope the Deputies who voted on the last occasion to reject the structural alterations clause will vote the same way on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against this structural alterations clause, but I agree that the number of public-houses could be considerably lessened.  There are too many public-houses in the small towns.  But this clause is not going to reduce them.  It may have been the Minister's idea to force a number of traders to choose one or other of the businesses carried on by them.  If they had a hardware, drapery, or provision store they would probably have to give up the bar, if they had no space for the necessary alterations.  I might agree with that if the Minister or the Seanad had inserted a provision that the people thus forced out of business would get some compensation.  But when a man has held a licence for thirty or forty years, and by his industry has built up a business, it is not right to deprive him of that business without compensation. There is no provision for compensation in the Bill.  In the country towns they have not sufficient accommodation to make the necessary alterations in the premises, and this clause would inflict great hardship and injustice on those <Col N="2432" /> people.  I hope the Minister, as on the last occasion, will allow this matter to go to a free vote of the House, and I feel sure that every Deputy who voted before to delete this section will again vote in the same way.  It is all very fine for the Seanad to send back amendments here simply because they extend the time to the 25th September, 1927.</P>
      <P>That is not sufficient time to give the people.  If Senators knew anything about the country, or if they really represented the people, I am sure they would not have sent in this amendment. I fully understand, of course, that the Seanad is only a nominated body.  It is a nominated body of the Dáil, just as the county boards of health, to be set up under the new Local Government Bill, are to be nominated by the county councils.  As the Seanad is a nominated body, the members of it cannot have the same sense of responsibility that they would have if they belonged to a body elected by the votes of the people.  Senators do not, I believe, understand the great hardship that is likely to be caused by the amendment they have sent forward, which proposes to re-insert Section 12 in the Bill.  It is quite true, of course, that traders in cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and Waterford may have ample accommodation to make the necessary alterations in their premises.</P>
      <P>In the country towns it is different. There, ninety-nine traders out of every hundred would not have the accommodation to make the necessary structural alterations if this amendment were passed.  I do not agree with Deputy Johnson that the insertion of this amendment in the Bill would lead to more employment being provided for the people.  I quite agree that if every publican in the country had sufficient accommodation in his premises to make the alterations proposed, the amendment would be a good one from the point of view of labour.  In that way relief might be given to a large number of the unemployed, but as publicans in country towns and villages have not the accommodation in their premises to make the alterations suggested in this amendment it would not help to relieve unemployment but would add considerably to the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2433" /> Its effect would be to add to the unemployment ranks in this way: Take the case of a trader engaged in general business who employs one or two assistants.  All his business, let us say, is carried on in the one premises.  He conducts, for instance, a hardware, general drapery, and provision business, and in addition has a licensed bar.  If this amendment is carried he would be obliged, if he is not able to carry out the alterations proposed, to dismiss one of his assistants because of the limitation of his business activities.  Therefore, the amendment, instead of helping to provide employment, will add to the numbers of the unemployed.  I think, if Deputy Johnson took a serious view of the matter he would agree that this amendment is not going to be of any benefit to labour.</P>
    <P>If conditions were such in the country that there was sufficient money at the disposal of the Minister for Finance to compensate publicans who might be obliged to go out of business through the insertion of this amendment, or to enable others, who desired to extend their premises, to get a grant for the purpose and to purchase sites on which to build so as to be able to have their liquor business completely separated from the other kind of business they carried on, then it might be all right to have an amendment such as this brought forward.  I ask Deputies to vote on this amendment as they did when Section 12 came originally before the Dáil, that is, to vote for the rejection of this amendment.  In my opinion the amendment is not going to do any good to the country.  It is, I think, going to cause a great deal of hardship to many people.  You have not, in country towns or villages wealthy publicans such as you find in a large city like Dublin.</P>
    <P>Men in the country who are engaged in the liquor business are not able to afford to build new premises, nor are they in a position to expend money on the reconstruction of the premises they now occupy.  I think the Minister for Justice would be taking a wise course in not forcing the Dáil to agree to this amendment.  The Minister, so far, has not said much in favour of the amendment. <Col N="2434" /> The only thing he did say was that the Seanad, in sending forward this amendment, did not ask that it should be put into immediate operation. What they suggest in the amendment is that it would not come into force until after the 25th September, 1927. If that is all that can be said in favour of the amendment, it is very little.  If the Seanad had inserted in their amendment the 25th September, 1935, instead of the 25th September, 1927, there might be something to be said in favour of it, because given the longer date people would have had an opportunity of seeing what they would be able to do in the years ahead of them as regards carrying out an alteration to their premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <P>In the country towns, as Deputies are aware, shopkeepers engage in the provision, hardware and drapery business as well as in the drink trade. These traders could not possibly live out of one end of their business.  If a trader had to forfeit that portion of his business comprised in provisions, drapery, and hardware he could not live out of the sale of drink, and if he were obliged to forfeit the bar business he would not be able to get sufficient customers for the other things he sells.  That is the position in small country towns, and therefore I say the insertion of this amendment would do an injustice to those people.  If such an amendment as this were to be introduced in seven or eight years' time, then the people engaged in the trade would be able to see ahead of them, and would, I am sure, make the necessary preparations to carry out the alterations which are now suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>Before, I form any opinion as to how I will vote on this amendment I would like to hear the views of the two Cork Deputies, Deputy Daly and Deputy Beamish, who captured the Dáil here last night on the Seanad amendment dealing with the St. Patrick's Day closing.  My own opinion is, that this matter dealing with structural alterations should be deferred, and that the Dáil should not accept the amendment which has come to it from the Seanad.  I think that <Col N="2435" /> this matter should be deferred until we have had before us the report of the Commission that the Minister for Justice has promised to set up.  That Commission will be charged with a very important duty.  It will, we are informed, deal with the number of licences in existence in the country at the present time, and with the number of licences that are to be eliminated.</P>
      <P>I believe myself that the Dáil would be taking a sensible view of this matter by refusing to accept the amendment which has come to it from the Seanad, and in deferring the further consideration of this question until the report of the Commission to be set up has been received.  The Commission, in my opinion, will have very important questions to decide.  One of these is the number of licences that are to be kept in existence in this country.  Everyone who knows anything about the country is well aware of the fact that we have far too many licences in the country, and I suggest it is a matter of urgent importance that this whole question should be considered at a very early date.</P>

      <P>If I were asked for a reason&mdash;I doubt if one is necessary&mdash;to confirm the vote which I gave on a previous occasion for the deletion of this section from the Bill as originally drafted, I would rely on the speech delivered by the Minister for Justice in the Seanad on this very same matter. If I recall his remarks correctly, he definitely stated that this subject, if not the most important, would certainly be one of the important matters to be considered by the Commission which he proposes to set up in connection with the administration of the liquor laws in this country.  Why, I ask, should we prejudge or prejudice the decision of that commission, seeing that this is going to be one of the important matters which, on the admission of the Minister himself, is to be dealt with by that commission.  That, and that alone, ought, I think, to convince Deputies who gave a vote for the retention of this section in the Bill on the last occasion to vote against the Seanad amendment here and now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2436" /> I am entirely in favour of a considerable reduction in the number of licensed houses in this country.  In fact, I may say I am in favour of a reduction in the number of all kinds of engaged in the distribution of the necessaries of life, because I believe, if you are to try and reduce the profiteering that is going on in this country, that is one of the most effective ways in which it can be done.  At the present time there are too many people engaged in the distribution of the necessaries of life, and I believe that is one of the chief causes of the profiteering that we hear so much about.</P>

      <P>The banks have always been good friends to the publicans as far as I know.  I am in entire agreement with the Minister, and my desire is to help him to attain the object he set out to achieve by the insertion of Section 12 in the Bill as originally drafted.  I think everyone will admit that the publicans are making excessive profits.  Therefore, I think they ought to be in a position to provide suitable accommodation for those who patronise their establishments for the purpose of consuming drink.  I think if the publicans were anxious to do that they could not follow any better example than the way in which such provision is made for the patrons of public-houses, particularly in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Deputies will not be tempted to support the suggestion made by Deputy Lyons.  The suggestion apparently was this: That the Minister for Finance should be called upon to pay compensation to the people who will eventually be driven out of business as a result of the reduction in the number of publichouses in this country.  I would not, for a moment, dream of supporting any Bill which would propose to impose on the taxpayers of this country the financial responsibility of meeting the compensation that might have to be paid as a result of any reduction in the number of licensed houses in this country.  I say that such compensation will have to be found from amongst the people who remain in the licensed trade <Col N="2437" /> and not from the pockets of the general taxpayers of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>If the compensation has to be found out of the pockets of the people who remain in business then the general taxpayer will have to meet it in the end.  It will be passed on to him in the usual way.  The profiteering, therefore, that the Deputy speaks about will still go on.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, if a proposal ever comes before the Dáil to raise money by direct taxation from the people of this country to meet compensation of this kind, I will oppose it, and that is why I referred to the suggestion made by Deputy Lyons.  As Deputy Shaw remarked, there is not very much to be said on this matter.  The question was very fully discussed when section 12 was before the Dáil.  In my opinion, the speech made by the Minister for Justice in the Seanad is justification for now asking the Dáil to confirm its previous decision on this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a certain amount of confusion for the last seven or eight months since this Licensing Bill was introduced.  We were told at that time that we were going to have a commission.  It was a pity we did not have a commission first, so that on the findings of that commission we could have legislation, but when we were engaged in debating the Bill of 1924, about three months ago, the Bill of 1923 came out of its shell in the Seanad, apparently, and killed the 1924 one.  The 1924 Bill that is before us now is going to be a short-lived one also, because the commission is going to kill it.  I agree with Deputy Davin when he points out that it is premature to be talking about structural alterations. Structural alterations in a great many houses that are going to be altered first and abolished afterwards mean a waste of money.  The commission will be very careful, I am certain, judging by the determined way in which people are talking now about structural alterations, to see that in as many cases as possible the licences retained will be for houses that have <Col N="2438" /> been structurally altered.  I am anticipating that.</P>
      <P>We are wasting a lot of time over this Bill.  We should be doing something that would tend towards temperance in a better way than structural alterations would.  We could be building decent houses for working-men who, when they come home could sit down and look around at the little place that could be kept clean, because in some of the houses in which they have to live at present, especially where there are large families, the beds have to be shifted on wet nights.  These men cannot remain inside, and if a man comes to see them on any little business he has no place to take them but to the publichouse. I think that we should leave the whole matter over until the commission is established.  We are threatened that this Bill will now be hung up, and that this abominable torture, the Act of 1923, will be left hanging over our heads during the time that these two amendments will be hatching in the next room.  I hope that the commission will come along in a very short time.  I would like to ask the Minister for Justice will the Senators hang up the Bill on account of our audacity in sending it back to them, and will they also hang up the commission, and thus bar the onward move to improve public-houses and to secure a more temperate country.  Will that be the case, I would like to know&mdash;will they hang up the commission?</P>

They all can see that it would be quite impossible to carry out that clause in the case of a large number of publichouses. <Col N="2439" /> Deputy Lyons pointed out that the change could be made more easily in Dublin than in some of the small villages. I do not agree with the Deputy, as every foot of Dublin is worth something, whereas you could get places in small villages in the country for the asking.</P>

      <P>Like the majority of Deputies, who feel themselves unable to support this amendment of the Seanad, I would like to see these structural alterations carried out if possible and if it could be done with justice to all concerned. I think that the present system should never have been permitted, but it has been permitted and carried out for a great number of years.  I think that in matters relating to licensing and the sale of drink generally, it is very necessary to proceed slowly in regard to anything that is done.  I think that the danger of haste is very great.  <i>Festina lente</i> ought to be our motto in regard to this question.  There is a case in point of over-zealous legislation in regard to this drink traffic which, of course, in my opinion, has been a great curse to every country. The late Czar of Russia, I think, when the Great War commenced, ordered prohibition over the whole of his vast Empire with a stroke of the pen, and what was the result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, again, there is the case of America.  Some people say that prohibition there has been a great improvement, while others say that it has not, and it seems to me in that case that the class who did drink have stopped drinking, and that those who did not drink are now drinking. <Col N="2440" /> Whether that is an improvement or not is a matter of opinion.  It indicates, however, to my mind that legislation should be well considered before it is carried out, particularly as this Bill proposes to make some very drastic reforms, and is a big pill to swallow at once.  The Minister has, of course, gilded it as nicely as it could be, but it is a Bill to be swallowed by many people who do not like it.  We have to consider the interests of a legitimate trade which is in many ways well carried on.</P>
      <P>I have not, and never had, any shares in a distillery or brewery.  I think it is a well-known fact that the trade is well carried on as a rule, and, with few exceptions, is well conducted. I also think that it has its rights, which should be recognised, but there must be just restrictions.  In this Bill there are vast improvements.  It deals with the age at which young people shall be kept from going into public-houses, and it also deals with the age under which they must not serve drink.  Other improvements refer to the manufacture of poteen, to drinking in clubs, and to the regulation of hours.  It seems, however, to be going too quickly in some matters, particularly in regard to structural alterations, which will involve enormous expense in comparison with the means of the people generally who conduct such houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope when the commission is appointed this matter will be dealt with, and if it is necessary to do away with a number of these licences, that these people will receive compensation, not from the tax-payers but from the trade when the houses are closed, as has been done in England.  It is from them the money should come, but until then I hope that this matter of structural alterations will not be proceeded with, as I think it would not be just or fair. The period of a few years, and the commission will probably be a few years, for this commission taking evidence from all classes concerned, will give these people ample time to consider what they will do, and will, of course, give them fair time for making preparation against the day that is inevitably coming.  I regret that I must vote <Col N="2441" /> against this amendment of the Seanad, as I think it would not be fair under the present circumstances to insist upon having this amendment.</P>

      <P>I think if there ever was an amendment of a section of a Bill in which all the Deputies had made up their minds one way or another, it is this section, and we ought to agree that there has been quite enough discussion. If it went on for days it would not result in any one Deputy changing his mind, and we ought to recognise that fact, especially when there is so much talk about the amount of work that has to be got through.  I think it would be a sensible step for the Dáil to arrive now at a decision on this.  The Minister gave his view as to what the attitude of the Dáil would be on this section when it was before the Seanad, and we all know what the action of the Dáil will be.  It would be well, therefore, to arrive at a decision, and go on with work on which argument will be of some avail, but argument will be of no avail on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by the speeches it appears there is a small minority in favour of this amendment. I intend to vote as I did on the last occasion for the insertion of this amendment, and I will run the risk of having the charge brought against me that it is frivolous to force this to a division. The proposition is that structural alterations will take place within the next three years.  That is a considerable time for the people engaged in the business to adjust themselves to the new conditions.  If it is found desirable by the persons concerned to allocate as between the grocery trade and the whiskey, or the drapery trade and the porter trade, that allocation will take place naturally by ordinary pressure of an economic kind, and in making their choice the proprietors will have three years to make the alterations.  I want to emphasise that this actual enactment has been made in this country, and has been carried through without a great deal of objection, without any great opposition, with comparative ease, and without anything like this long three years' notice in counties which are as like, <Col N="2442" /> say, as Donegal and Monaghan, and Cavan are like Tyrone, Derry and Armagh.</P>
      <P>These alterations have, as a matter of fact, taken place to the advantage of the trade, and to the advantage of the general community, and there was no long notice such as is proposed to be given to the proprietors of these businesses. I will ask the Dáil to remember Deputy D'Alton's speech yesterday in this connection, and to take note of the undesirability of allowing children who are going into a grocery or drapery establishment to see their parents take intoxicating liquor at the bar. The proposition to oblige the father of a family to take his drink on St. Patrick's Day in his own home was defeated, so that he is bound now if he is going to drink to take it at the bar, just as he will go to the bar on other days if he wants to save himself from showing to his children the example that Deputy D'Alton said was a bad example.  Now he is to be allowed to go to the publichouse bar, and these very children will go into the grocery or drapery establishment and see him taking drink in the shop.</P>

      <P>The promise of a Commission seems to have affected the minds of Deputies who would otherwise support the proposed new section, and they say, &ldquo;Let us have the Commission.&rdquo; The Commission may have a great deal to do, and we should not have to wait for the Commission to examine every question in connection with the sale and distribution of intoxicating liquor.  There are some questions we are qualified to answer, and I think this is one of them.  I will say in that regard that the Commission might well have the opportunity to advise between to-day and 1927 whether in view of the alterations which may be shown to be necessary as a consequence of this Bill that some kind of compensation for those who deem it desirable to go out of business altogether rather than undertake these expenses might be charged upon the remaining licensees.  I would certainly agree to that being considered by the Commission, but I would not agree that the whole question as to whether a double or mixed business in the same premises, in the same room, should continue is a matter for reference to the Commission.  I think we are quite qualified, and that we have sufficient information and experience to decide on the merits or demerits of that issue.  On these grounds I would ask the Deputies to support the Seanad amendment.</P>

      <P>Although I intend to vote against this amendment, I am entirely in favour of the principle contained in it.  Nobody deprecates mixed trading more than I do.  I know it is responsible for a great deal of drinking in this country, especially amongst my own sex.  Unfortunately, that is true.  Women come in and buy groceries, and very often the publican is a very generous person, after the nature of Deputy Daly, who treats them, and in that way the drinking habit has been acquired.  As I say, I deprecate this very strongly, but I know that it is absolutely impossible to bring about these structural alterations in a great many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2444" /> There is a town in the South of Ireland with which I am very well acquainted, which, I am sure, is typical of the majority of the smaller towns in Ireland.  This town has a population of approximately 3,500.  There are 43 licensed houses in the town and, of these, at least 38 are engaged in mixed trading.  From my knowledge, I can visualise those houses now.  There is just one door and one window, and it is absolutely impossible to make structural changes.  It would really mean that the licensees would have to close their houses altogether, because their business in both branches of trade is small.  It is not their fault, because they inherited the business as a legacy. To insist on structural alterations would simply mean closing the houses altogether and depriving the people of their means of living.  A certain gentleman in the British House of Commons once described the liquor trade in the South of Ireland as a hand-to-mouth business and created a great deal of amusement thereby.  It is absolutely true.  I know it myself. Licensed traders are a very important section of the community, a very respectable body, and I am quite sure it is not the intention of the Dáil to victimise them in any way.  As things are at present, they would be victimised if the amendment were carried.</P>

I wish that Deputy Baxter's suggestion had been accepted, although I do not agree with the principle of it, that because this had been debated before, Deputies would not change their mind.  I hope he does not mean that having come to a certain conclusion, without thinking it over, they would not use their brains and reconsider it.  As to Deputy Johnson's intervention, he is a Deputy for whom I have very great respect and whose views I am often in absolute agreement with, especially as regards the right of the people to live.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I have acted in a way which may be much better <Col N="2445" /> than voting.  Many of the points raised by Deputy Johnson should receive greater consideration than they received in a House which, I fear, to a certain extent was prejudiced for one reason or another.  I say that advisedly. Some Deputies were perhaps connected with the licensed trade and some were concerned with investments they had made in certain industries; more, perhaps, were thinking of their constituents and their votes, not of what they owed to their own self-respect and to the future of the country. There are two or three points made by Deputy Johnson that I wish the House had taken into consideration. One was that it would be a great help to temperance if every licensed trader was compelled to provide food. That would prevent a great deal of the drunkenness that prevails.  In Denmark, Sweden and Germany the workers go into the clubs or the theatres at night and have food with their beer.  Deputy Johnson stressed the point as to the provision of food, and I hope that the Commission will consider that matter: that every publichouse should provide food, whether it is coffee or tea and biscuits, or cheese and bread and butter.  I wish to back Deputy Johnson in that suggestion. Perhaps he did not go as far as I would wish to go.  If the licensed trader did not provide food for his customers, I contend that the licence should be taken from him, just the same as if he had committed a breach of the licensing law.</P>

      <P>This is a very important point as regards structural alterations, with all due respect.  In the houses that are in a position to supply both food and drink, bread and cheese and tea and coffee can be got from that portion set apart for provisions and groceries.  That is why I am so keen that Deputy Johnson's suggestion should be considered by the Commission, as it may be premature now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be allowed, but it is not laid down as a <i>sine qua non</i> that it is to be supplied; in other words, that the licence be withdrawn if the licensed trader is not in a position to provide food when demanded.  That would be in the interests of temperance. In England, in nine cases out of ten, those who go in for a drink ask for a biscuit, or bread and butter and cheese.  That is the reason that intemperance is less apparent there than here.  In this country men attending fairs and markets go into licensed houses fasting and can get no food there.  I want a provision to that effect to be considered by the Commission and inserted in a Bill.  I wish that the Minister would consider that point along with the one I made yesterday, that no whiskey under five years' old should be allowed out of bond.  These are two important points that should be considered by the Commission.  Perhaps I may be diverging, but it is with your permission, sir, if not altogether with your approval.</P>

      <P>I did not try to convince, as it is very hard to do so.  If I have your permission for the time being, that is all I require, I am glad I referred to that point of Deputy Johnson's regarding food.  Certain tax-payers in this country got licenses under certain conditions.  They spent their money believing they had certain rights.  The legal profession, through the courts that were supposed to be courts of justice at the time, led them to believe they had rights, just as the courts of justice of the present day lead them to believe that they have <Col N="2447" /> rights now.  The licensees got the licences under certain conditions, and spent money accordingly.  They paid rates, taxes and licence duty.  Surely their business cannot be interfered with now without giving them sufficient notice and time to arrange their financial position.  I say that they would not have sufficient time to do that by 1927.</P>
      <P>If the Seanad or if the Minister for Justice had made the period ten years, so that this provision would come into operation in 1935, or even 8 or 9 years, I would support it.  I feel that after 8 years it would be no great injustice, because these people would have had time to reconsider their position, and those who are indebted to the banks or to their friends would have had time to arrange their affairs and turn their activities in other directions.  Several Deputies have mentioned that we have too many licensed houses in Ireland.  I am absolutely in agreement with that. While I may, possibly, be supposed to support amendments that do not meet with the approval of other Deputies, I agree that we have too many licensed houses.  I want these houses abolished, but I want it done in a reasonable way. As Deputy Baxter stated, they can be abolished without loss to the general public.  Those who remain in the licensed trade can be made responsible, to a great extent, for compensating those whose licences are abolished, so that it may not be a burden on the public.  I do not think Deputies, or even the Minister for Justice, have been sent here to interfere with the individual rights of a certain section of our people without consulting them.  If the salaries paid to the primary and the secondary teachers are, as some people think, too great, and should be reduced because the education results, according to some people, are not sufficiently apparent, can Deputies come here and say that the salaries should be reduced without consulting their constituents?</P>

      <P>We did not suggest they should be reduced.  Are Deputies supposed to come here without instructions and without authority from their <Col N="2448" /> constituents and by any action of theirs deprive any section of their income?  I think it would be unfair to take 50 per cent. or 75 per cent. away from the salary of any teacher and leave him without the possibility of living.  In the same way, we have no right to take 75 per cent of his income from the licensed holder, leaving him only 25 per cent. of the income he had, and which he was supposed to enjoy for a specified period.</P>

      <P>I did not vote for the abolition of the district councils.  I expressed my own opinion on that matter, but my constituents did not ask me to do so one way or the other.  I had no authority to do so.  Deputy Johnson has raised a point that, to my mind, is important.  He said I was opposed to the children of the workers seeing their parents drinking at home. I have seen workers, such as carpenters and masons, after their day's work, taking a couple of drinks and I never saw any drunkenness amongst them. I say it is infinitely better to let the working man have his couple of drinks with his friends and then go home. The Deputy's remarks are not a true interpretation of what I said.  The Deputy said that these children could see their parents drinking in licensed houses.  According to the law, these children are not allowed to go into licensed houses.  Why should not the question of structural alterations come before the Commission?  Why should not the bars in licensed premises be put at the extreme end of the shop and the licensees prevented from supplying drink at grocery counters?  If Deputy Johnson and other Deputies place these points before the Commission they will really advance the cause of temperance.</P>

      <P>I never make personal remarks.  I am as keen as the Deputy is for sobriety.  If the Deputy does advance these points I will support him.  I agree with the suggestion that licensed houses should be prevented, <Col N="2449" /> where there are no structural alterations, from supplying drink at the same counter as that at which groceries are sold.  If Deputy Baxter's suggestion had been carried out, I would not have intervened in the discussion.  I oppose the amendment returned from the Seanad as it turns down the finding of the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2452" />&ldquo;(11) So much of the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act, 1851, as relates to the case of a public road being prejudiced by the shade of any hedge or tree, or to any obstruction being caused in any public road by any hedge or tree shall cease to have effect.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the consideration of this matter to be left in the hands of the council, or is it to be entirely a matter for the surveyor.  If trees are to be cut down because they are hanging over our roadways I am afraid that a great many beauty spots may be destroyed.  Surely some other measures should be adopted, and I would ask that before anything of that drastic nature is done, the whole matter should be considered by the local authority rather than by the engineer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>You say that the parties are allowed to appeal, but before the appeal can be heard the work might be carried through.  That does not seem a wise way, nor does it guarantee that it will be effective.  The way one would be inclined to deal with a situation of that kind would be to alter the road construction to suit the situation, rather than suit the situation to the road construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) requires that 21 days notice shall be given, and that would give the occupier or owner of the holding time to make any objection he wished.  There is no danger of his being taken by surprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>

What I want to ensure is, that before any drastic action is taken in connection with some of those beauty spots, the matter will be considered by some person or persons in authority who will look upon it from an impartial point of view.</P>

      <P>I am afraid it would be very hard to allow a discretion to any other people.  I am afraid the two things conflict.  There are many nice vistas along roads, created by having very beautiful trees along the roads, and yet these trees may be a very great source of danger to travellers, and a source of expense in the maintenance of the roads.  They may keep them continually damp, and I am afraid in this case beauty will have to give way to utility, no matter what provisions are put into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The way that is met elsewhere is that a different class of road construction altogether is used.  The Minister ought to be aware of that fact. It is what is called a dry surface rather than a wet surface, and it is specially adapted for such a situation as the Minister refers to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think at this stage we can do any more.  Perhaps the matter can be raised in the Seanad. I do not know if it would meet the Deputy's point if the council has a say in it.  My own experience is that the councils have not any more regard for beauty spots than the owners of property of this kind.  As a general rule, quite the reverse applies.  I know of many cases in which councils wished to demolish old castles and ruins of historic importance.  It was very difficult to restrain them from so doing.  I would imagine they would have the very same outlook in regard to beauty spots in general.  If the Deputy wishes <Col N="2454" /> something to be put down bearing out his suggestion, it can be done in the Seanad, but we have no power here at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Have not councils power to notify owners or occupiers of land, the trees or hedges growing on which may be considered very dangerous to the public, to have them removed? Surely it is necessary that such a power should be given.  There is a certain number of very narrow roads in the country and if the hedges or trees are allowed to grow they may overhang the road and become a very serious danger.  If some power is not given under this Bill, the upkeep of the roads will become very expensive on the rates.  Further, I would argue that a period of twenty-one days is too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this matter of trees overhanging the roads, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the case of a long and broad road which has high walls on both sides.  On both sides of that road there are trees at least 200 years old.  Of course these trees are, no doubt, causing some damage to the road, but yet the road looks good enough.  It is in the power of the county surveyor to order these trees to be cut down within twenty-one days.  The expense involved has to be borne by the owner of the land and it is sometimes enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>He need not bear the expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, again, there might be damage caused to the walls. If men are not careful, they may smash the walls to atoms.  A notice of twenty-one days is not, in my opinion, sufficient. A great many people would not know what to do when they get those orders.  They may become flustered and probably they would let the thing slide.  Then the trees might be cut down by indifferent woodmen and perhaps far more damage would be caused than if the trees were allowed to remain there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider the matter further and <Col N="2455" /> see if any provision could not be inserted, when the Bill is in the Seanad, so as to meet this particular point, and ensure that those places would not be damaged.  That is what we are all anxious about, and, if it is done, I am quite satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try, in the Seanad, to met the Deputy's point, but Deputies will realise the difficulty of the position.  Who can you invest with this authority?  It is a matter of discretion.  What one man might consider a beauty spot, another man might have a different opinion on.  Then, again, what one man might consider a matter of utility, another might consider beautiful.  It is really a question of judgment.  However, we may be able to do something in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>In page 19, Section 35, to delete from the word &ldquo;any,&rdquo; line 33, to the word &ldquo;pension,&rdquo; line 40 inclusive, and substitute the following words: &ldquo;the following persons, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any person who, as an officer, has devoted the whole of his time to the service of one or more committees or joint committees, appointed for the purpose of the Agricultural and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, for a continuous period of not less than ten years upon terms which do not expressly preclude him from receiving a pension and notwithstanding that his appointment was or is renewable periodically, and</P>
      <P>(b)  any person duly appointed standing solicitor of a local body before the passing of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  any person permanently appointed before the passing of this Act to be a compounder of medicine <Col N="2456" /> for the purposes of any act relating to the relief of the poor.</P>
    <P>This is to fulfil an undertaking that I gave on the Committee Stage to consider the position of solicitors and compounders of medicine who were the only people under the Bill who lost any pensionable rights.  Solicitors and compounders of medicine who were pensionable and who had more than 10 years' service were provided for in Section 36 which enabled them to opt out of the Bill; but by an oversight we did not take into consideration the case of those solicitors and compounders of medicine who had less than 10 years' service, and who would accordingly have lost their rights under this Bill, and they would be placed in a worse position than previously.  This section would enable those officers to retain their pensionable rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this amendment I was sorry to see that the Minister still retains that portion of Clause (a) which was the subject of considerable debate when the Bill was being considered on a former occasion. It is the sub-section which refers to the Technical Instruction Act of 1899.  I referred on a previous occasion to the damage that the carrying of this Bill would do the work of technical instruction. Since that debate was published I have had expressions of opinion from a great many people as to the injury that this clause is likely to do to the work of technical instruction. As far as I see, the clause is not going to benefit a great many who do not come within the operation of the 1919 Act.  In view of the damage that it is going to do to the important work of technical instruction, I would ask the Minister to consider if some amendment could not be made in the clause.  I know he is anxious that a certain class of officer should be brought within the meaning of this Bill.  That can be done to satisfy a particular claim without injuring the work of technical education.  I would like in view of the injury one foresees under this clause, if it is adopted, to impress on the Minister the desirability of having the matter remedied by <Col N="2457" /> some slight alteration when the Bill is passing through the Seanad.</P>

      <P>In regard to Deputy Good's point, the matter was discussed very fully on the Committee Stage.  It was with great reluctance I agreed to bring in an amendment in favour of technical instructors.  I realised those people were placed in a very difficult position, and it was up to me to see that they should get pensionable rights. After a good deal of hesitation, I agreed to allow them in; really, while not being in form whole-time officers, they are so in practice.  I do not see how I could vary this section dealing with those officers without getting the Minister for Finance to bear some of the burden.  That really seems to be the intention of Deputies.  I have no control over the Minister for Finance. He stated that he was not prepared to consider the matter.  If I knew that there was to be such an agitation over this point, I would not have allowed it in at all.</P>
      <P>I will be completely in the hands of the Seanad.  If they wish to delete it, I will have no objection.  This section will have to stand as it is or else be deleted.  We cannot delete it at this stage in the Dáil.  We will have to leave it to the mercy of the Seanad.</P>

That seems to me to be a peculiar assertion on the part of the Deputy, and I must express my surprise at the attitude that is now taken by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in view of the expression of opinion we had here when this matter was last debated.  From every side of the Dáil an agreement was come to that pensions should be given to those officers whose work was praised through all parts of the country and here in the Dáil.  I think it is rather a strange thing, to say the least of it, to find the Minister for Local Government and Public Health now coming along at this stage, and, practically, suggesting to the Seanad that they should exclude those officers from the scope of the Bill. He knows that they are entitled to certain rights under the 1919 Act, and I take it that if that section of the Act is being repealed, that even those rights which they now have will be taken from them.</P>

The effect of that will be that the local authority will get rid of the liability by not striking any rate. That is what I want to stop.

      <P>Was it not decided that in the matter of these pensions the technical instructors would be paid in the same way as in the matter of salaries? As the Department pays a portion of the salaries given to the technical instructors, <Col N="2460" /> and the county council the other portion, the same thing could be done in the matter of the pensions. Personally I do not think it is fair to ask the local authorities to pay the full pension when they are not responsible for the full salary.  I quite agree that it is not fair to ask them.  I think Deputy Good is right.  When it comes to the striking of a rate by the local authorities I am inclined to think that the rate will not be struck.  I think it would meet the situation if the Minister would insert some proviso to the effect that the superannuation should be paid out of the same fund as the salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Good has been rather exaggerating the effect of what was going to happen under this Bill.  If the provision stands as it is now in the Bill the pensions will be a charge on the local authority under the county committee of technical instruction.  It will be on the county council.  Because they will have to find the pension for, say, one or two additional teachers as the case may be, the county council will thereupon refuse to strike a rate for technical instruction. That is the picture which Deputy Good paints for us.  I do not believe there is a single local authority in Ireland that would refuse to strike a rate for the purpose of carrying on technical instruction in its county and thereby get the advantage of having to spend in the county a sum very many times the amount of the rate which is struck, for the purpose of depriving one or two officers of the right to a pension which is given to them under this Bill. <Col N="2461" /> That is the case that Deputy Good makes.</P>
      <P>The only way to get rid of the burden of these pensions, he tells us, would be to refuse to carry on technical instruction altogether, and to refuse to strike a rate.  In other words he says they would get rid of the teachers and schemes because some officers who have given a considerable number of years' service to the country and to the particular local authority are put on the pension list.  I do not think there is one local authority in the whole Saorstát that would be prepared to throw away the benefits of technical instruction rather than accept this small extra burden.</P>

      <P>It is not his point that the county council will refuse to strike a rate.  I do not follow it.  Usually the county council strikes a rate of 2d. or 2½d. in the pound.  What will happen if you have two or three technical instructors entitled to superannuation? Only 2d. or 2½d. would be struck and, consequently, some other Department must go short and that is what will happen if the technical instructors are looking for a pension.  I think Deputy O'Connell is taking a wrong view altogether. Certainly, technical instructors should be entitled to pension, the same as any other officials.  In fact they are entitled to superannuation more than some people who enjoy that right.  At the same time, it is not fair to put the whole responsibility for that superannuation on the local authority, when the local authority cannot appoint the officer, without the sanction of the technical department.  When the technical department have to pay portion of the salary, why not also pay portion of the superannuation?  I think it is not right to let it go from the Dáil that when I stand up to support Deputy Good it is our intention <Col N="2462" /> to do away with technical instruction. I did support the Deputy's suggestion, that was not to do away with technical instruction, but to encourage it.  The only way to encourage it is to get the Department to pay part of the superannuation. Then the local authorities will be in favour of continuing the scheme and of developing it.</P>

      <P>The whole purpose of the amendment is to deal with the case of an officer who may have been serving in the technical instruction service and who moved from one county committee to another county committee. There may be a break in that service of, perhaps, a month between committee and committee, and if we left the word &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; in, it would deprive of superannuation any person who has had a break of even one week <Col N="2463" /> or a month in the service of one county authority and another county authority. That seems to be inequitable, inasmuch as the whole of the time of the officer may have been given to the service of technical instruction.  But if there were a break at all, he would be deprived of his rights under this section. Inasmuch as we are contemplating a transfer from one authority to another&mdash;one or more committees are mentioned&mdash;we ought to give the credit to the man who happens to be deprived of pay as between the service of one committee and another.  The object of the amendment is to avoid that breach of continuity.  I think it is reasonable, and I do not think it would impose any exorbitant charges.  It would do justice to those who may have transferred from one authority to another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the very many difficulties that confronted me when, in a weak moment, I agreed to introduce this section allowing superannuation to these agricultural and technical instruction officers, was that they were not permanent officers in the right sense of the term, and that there was no real means of deciding when they were permanent officers and when they were not.  Without being permanent officers, I could not make them pensionable. After a good deal of consideration, we decided that the only test by which we could see whether they were permanent officers or not, was the test as to whether they had been in the continuous employment of the authority for ten years.  Ten years is the period laid down for the Civil Service, and we considered that it was the most equitable period for those officers also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you leave out the word &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; there is absolutely no test.  A man may be working for a couple of years or a couple of months and go away to the North Pole on an expedition. If a man can break his service as often as he likes, and if he happens to be a servant for ten years, he will have to be regarded as a permanent officer, and accordingly he will acquire pensionable rights.  I see no possible chance of deciding whether an officer is a permanent officer or not, if we leave <Col N="2464" /> out this test.  As I explained the other day in Committee, a number of these officers are not permanent officers either in theory or in practice.  Of course, the majority are permanent, though appointed from year to year, but there are a number who are not permanent, and it might mean that we would have to include all sorts of officers if we left out these words.  Accordingly I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 19, Section 35, line 37, to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;five.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the last occasion that this matter was under consideration, it was argued that by putting in this qualification of ten years, you were putting in a condition that did not apply to the ordinary officers of local authorities.  The only effect the provision has is to prevent a man under ten years' service who breaks down getting a gratuity, because there is no question of pension unless ten years has been served.  The amendment moved to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; was not carried.  This amendment was put down in the hope that the Minister will see his way to accept five years as a reasonable period to qualify an officer to be made a permanent officer within the meaning of the section.  If a man has given, as the section will now read, a continuous period of five years' service, it ought to be sufficient to enable him to avail of whatever little benefit is to be given under a later sub-section to the section.</P>

      <P>For practically the same reason as I mentioned in the case <Col N="2465" /> of the last amendment it would be impossible for me to accept this one.  We have a precedent for the ten years in the case of civil servants.  Even if we had not such a precedent to go on, five years, in my opinion, would scarcely be sufficient to give permanency to an officer.  In any case, I am not anxious at the present time to allow gratuities to officers with less than ten years' service, which would be the case if I were to get away from the ten years mentioned in the section.  Under amendment 41 it will be seen that the case is met and that provision is made for calculating pensions on the service of those officers during the ten years they have spent in qualifying for a pension. In that way I do not think there will be any hardship to complain of.  As soon as they have qualified by giving ten years to the local authority, then their pensionable service would count from the day of their appointment.  I think that on the whole their case is being fairly met.  The case of these officers was a very difficult one to meet under the provisions of this section.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment 35:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, section 35, line 40, after the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; to insert the words, &ldquo;and also includes any employee other than an officer who has been employed for a continuous period of not less than ten years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to include within the superannuation provisions any employee of a local authority other than an officer, that is to say, a permanent officer who has been employed for a continuous period of not less than ten years.  On the previous stage there was a very evident misunderstanding as to the intentions of an amendment which was put down from these benches regarding the case of a non-salaried employee, a wage-earning employee, who had served a local authority for a long period; an employee who became either incapacitated or who had reached the age of more than sixty-five years.  The phrase occurred in the amendment, &ldquo;three years,&rdquo; meaning that a person would not be able to qualify unless he had three years' service.  Deputies spoke, <Col N="2466" /> particularly Deputy Gorey in his opposition, as though the intention was to pension any employee who had three years' service and upwards.  Of course there was no such intention at all, and yet that misconception&mdash;no other factor, I imagine, could have persuaded Deputies to vote against the proposition in view of their records in the past&mdash;led to the defeat of the amendment.</P>
    <P>Now this amendment seeks to make clearer still, even to give an absolute guarantee, that the employee in question is one who has served a long period.  The period mentioned is ten years in the amendment, but it does not propose even to give a pension to a person who has served ten years.  If a man has served twenty years with the local authority, and becomes sixty-five years of age, he may receive a pension if the local authority votes it, and the Minister approves.  In the case of a person who has served ten years, and who has become incapacitated or infirm in the service, then he may be granted a pension if the local authority decides so, and the Minister approves.</P>
    <P>Again, it is going to be a question as to whether we are to distinguish between the salaried class and the wage-earning class, whether we are going to place that dividing line between these two sections of the staffs serving a local authority.  As I explained on the last discussion, many local authorities have, in fact, under the law as it was understood, granted such pensions, but by the exercise of a peculiar vigilance when it comes to wage-earners the auditors of the Local Government Department decided that the law did not allow such an allowance or pension in those cases. Now, the proposed amendment is specifically to allow local authorities to do in the future under the law of Saorstát Eireann what they were allowed to do under the old regime, even though it is now decided that there was a misconception as to what the law contained.</P>
    <P>We are now asking the Dáil to agree that the new regime is going to be as fair to wage earners of long employment under local authorities as the old regime was.  I say again that any Deputy who is a member of a local authority and who at any time in the past <Col N="2467" /> ever supported a proposition to give a pension to an old or an incapacitated employee, is bound to vote for this amendment unless he admits that he committed a faulty or a foolish act as an administrator in voting for such a pension.  If he has ever done that and was wise in doing it, or thinks he was wise or justified in doing it, he is bound, I say, to vote for this amendment which proposes to allow public authorities to make an allowance or to give a pension to old or incapacitated servants who have served for twenty years and have reached the age of 65 years, or who have served ten years and have become infirm in the service.  I accordingly move the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that Deputy Johnson is arguing on a wider basis than the clause itself allows.  The clause speaks of officers under the Agricultural and Technical Instruction Act of 1899, and it deals only with them.  I take it that his intention is that not alone are the pensions given to teachers to be cast on and paid by the local authority, which at present pays only ten per cent. of their salaries, but that all pensions of the staff paid out of a central fund are to be cast on and paid for by the local authority.  In this case the local authority would only pay a small proportion, possibly one-twentieth of the salary.  The proposal now is that these particular officials are to be pensioned and that their pensions are to be paid for by the local authority. If that is carried there is an end to technical instruction.</P>

      <P>That does not clear the air in any way.  All the time the Deputy <Col N="2468" /> is adding to the liability to which we have objected.  He does not lessen that liability but he is adding on further officials and further expense to the local authority, so that whatever chance we have of getting the local authority to carry the burden cast upon it by the earlier portion of this clause, if this added liability is to be put on, I am satisfied that technical instruction, so far as the local authorities are concerned, is at an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not deal with technical instruction, but with all employees of a local authority.  Really, the amendment is not broad enough when it says &ldquo;for a continuous period of not less than ten years.&rdquo;  Some of these employees work under local authorities up to the age of sixty-five or seventy, and after serving them for thirty or forty years they are thrown out of employment.  As their baptismal lines cannot, in many cases, be found, they are not entitled to old age pensions and the only place for them is the workhouse or county home.  Surely, better provision than that should be made for them, especially for employees who have given long and faithful service to these local authorities.  I quite agree that the meaning of the amendment is that there will be created a large number of extra pensions.  From a broad point of view, I think that every employer, whether he is a farmer, trader or builder, should be compelled to give some superannuation to his employees who have served for twenty-five or thirty years, as a gratuity for the services they have rendered.  If officials in offices, doctors, solicitors, compounders of medicine, and other professional gentlemen are entitled to superannuation, why should we deny it to the people who have rendered services probably not as skilful but as valuable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is only right to explain that the amendment does not seek to provide pensions for road-workers, as may be in the minds of Deputy Good and other Deputies.  It says for continuous service for a period of not less than ten years.  Road-workers are not in continuous service, or at least in very few counties are they in continuous service.  They work probably for six <Col N="2469" /> months on the roads, and the other six months wherever they can get work. I think it only right that something should be done for employees who have served twenty, twenty-five, and maybe forty years, under a local authority. When they come to old age, and are no further use to the local authorities, they are cast out and thrown on the scrap-heap, and replaced by young people, with the result that they have to seek outdoor relief, or go into the county home.  I ask the Dáil to agree that the amendment is a fair one, and will not mean the huge amount of superannuation that is anticipated. The amendment should be seriously considered. If the amendment is inserted it would relieve the ratepayers, and will reduce the estimates of the county homes, and will also reduce the amount of home help.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree to accept this amendment.  The arguments I used on the Committee Stage hold equally good now.  Whether the period is three years or ten years, my objection to pensioning these officers is that it creates a new class of pensionable officers.  This Bill is not intended to make a new class of pensionable officers, but to codify the existing law.  At a later period it may be possible to bring in a Bill to provide for pensions on a contributory basis, and it would then be a question whether employees could not be brought in on a contributory basis.  That is a matter which would require a great deal of thought and consideration, and under no circumstances could I undertake to deal with it in a perfunctory manner in a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 20, Section 37, to insert before sub-section (3) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) A local body may, with the consent of the Minister, grant to a person in their employment other than an officer who either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  has attained the age of sixty-five years and has at least twenty years' service, or</P>
      <P>(b)  becomes incapable of discharging the duties of his employment with efficiency by reason of permanent infirmity of mind or body or of old age, and has at least twenty years' service,</P>
      <P>upon his resignation or the termination of his employment an annual allowance for his life not greater than two-thirds of his yearly remuneration and emoluments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, although on the surface it might appear to be, is not quite the same as amendment 35.  It provides that after 20 years' service, when an employee reaches the age of 65 years, he should be entitled to a pension or, in case of infirmity, after 20 years' service, even if he had not reached the age of 65 years.  The amendment does not give the right to a pension on removal from employment unless the employee has at least twenty years' service.  I do not think there is any necessity to argue the amendment.  It would probably be only repeating some of the arguments put forward in the Committee Stage and on Amendment 35.  Like Deputy Johnson, <Col N="2472" /> however, I would say to Deputies who voted against this principle on the Committee Stage because the term of three years was inserted, that this amendment will ensure that an employee must at least have 20 years' service. It is, I think, a fair thing to ask that an employee, after completing 20 years' service at the age of 65 years should not be flung out and left to charity or home help or, perhaps, forced to seek refuge in the county home, but that he should be provided for by the local authority in whose service he had spent the best part of his life.  The amendment is a reasonable one and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment for the same reasons I gave when replying to Deputy Johnson's amendment re-introducing the principle of pensioning employees.  If that matter is to be considered, we will have to consider it in all its details.  The only conditions under which such a proviso could be accepted would be on a contributory basis, and I am not prepared to introduce such a measure as that at present.  I could not introduce it without going into the matter in very great detail and giving it very careful consideration.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that he could not accept this amendment or the previous amendment for the reasons given before.  I have not heard the Minister give any reasons, except that he cannot agree that men of this class should get a pension at any time.  That is what the Minister's objection comes to.  He is not prepared to admit that men of the working class, no matter how faithful or how long their service, should get pensions under any consideration.  The Minister talks of pensions on a contributory basis.  I am prepared to meet the Minister on that if he will say that he is prepared to introduce a special Bill to give superannuation on a contributory basis to the employees of public bodies.  But the Minister will not say that.  There is no use in the Minister talking about pensions on a contributory basis if he is not prepared to introduce a Bill.  Is <Col N="2473" /> the Minister prepared to introduce a Bill any time next year?  If he is not prepared to say that he will, why bring in the question of contributory pensions at all?  Why not face the thing honestly and say that he does not agree with the principle that these men should get a pension?  That is really what the Minister's reason is, but he does not say it as bluntly as it should be said, because it would show his real mind on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some Deputies who were not present during the discussion on the previous amendment, and I am confident that they cannot have understood the argument for the amendment they were voting upon, or they would not have voted against the proposition.  While Deputy Morrissey is, perhaps, justified in saying that there is no need to repeat the arguments because they were stated on the last occasion, it seems to me that the case is so clear, unless there is distinct prejudice against the wage earner as distinct from the salaried person, that the Deputies who were not present during the last discussion ought to be told exactly what they are asked to decide.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of those Deputies let me re-state it very shortly.  We have been engaged in this part of the Bill in dealing with superannuation for salaried officers.  We have devoted a good deal of time to it; we have made certain extensions in regard to persons who have been employed on salaried rates and become pensionable officers. Here is a proposition which suggests that we should make it possible for a local authority, that employs a man continually for twenty years, to give that man a pension, at sixty-five years of age, not exceeding two-thirds of his annual income&mdash;always subject to the sanction of the Minister&mdash;and that in the case of a man who has served a long period, and become infirm in the service, a grant might be made to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot imagine Deputies who may have gone to their constituents at one time or another and talked about fair conditions of employment&mdash;no distinction between class and class, recognition of <Col N="2474" /> the rights of labour, no discrimination because of birth, who have preached democratic doctrines&mdash;voting against a proposition to place the wage earner in a position, so far as pensions are concerned, somewhat approximating to that of the salary earner.  The position of that wage earner is not going to be really analogous, but I want to place him somewhere in the same sphere with regard to pensionable possibilities.  I ask Deputies if they clearly understand the position; that they are voting against placing the wage earner in a position somewhat approximating to that which the salary earner is already in, and which they have been voting to secure him in, in respect of pensions. Can they, with a clean conscience, and with a good understanding, vote against an amendment of this kind, and then repeat that they make no distinction, that they want to obliterate class interest and want to unite wage earner and salary earner, employer and employee, upper class and lower class, professional and artisan, in one happy brotherhood?  They will vote for this amendment if they ever want to go before their constituents and repeat any phraseology of that kind.  This is a test, and I ask Deputies who did not hear the discussion on the last occasion and who may have heard it now to justify themselves for future notification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson, of course, very astutely brings in a very big question, one that has really nothing to do with a pension scheme at all, except incidentally.  I could not let the occasion pass without saying that the scope of this Bill is not broad enough to embrace this question.  Deputy Johnson has raised the question of pensions for all, but the State has gone so far in admitting the principle, as to provide old age pensions for people beyond a certain age.  It is proposed to broaden that out by giving local authorities power to pension their workmen.  I think they have that power to a limited extent at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>To place it on the local authority is, I think, going only part of the way.  Let Deputy Johnson advocate the principle that every workman should be part and parcel of a contributory scheme, and provide for his old age, and I would support him, as far as possible.  To bring it in as a side issue in a Bill like this, which has nothing to do with pensions except incidentally&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incidental, accepting a position that is already there. As far as I know the Local Government Bill does not extend the principle in any way.  Deputies must recognise that a wholesale scheme for pensions for workmen and artisans should be on very broad lines indeed, and should cover workmen in all trades.  It should provide pensions on a contributory basis for all workmen, apart from workmen in the employment of local authorities.  Obviously the introduction of the principle into this Bill is far too big a question to deal with in this casual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me a difference is made between an ordinary employee and an officer.  To those who advocate pensions other than contributory pensions that is a sound argument to put up against it.  I see no grounds for those who advocate pensions on a noncontributory basis to make a distinction or discrimination between an officer and an ordinary employee.  As far as I am concerned, I am opposed to pensions of all kinds except on a contributory basis.  We are dealing with the Local Government Bill now, and unquestionably in the near future it will have to be scrapped, because the people who are called upon to pay these pensions are people who have no hope or prospect of pensions for themselves.  They have no chance of avoiding the financial difficulties that such a scheme of pensions would impose upon them.  We are legislating that these people shall carry the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not able to carry the burden and will not be able to do so. There is no argument why a distinction should be made between the officer and the ordinary employee.  A scheme of <Col N="2476" /> contributory pensions is absolutely necessary, and unless the Ministry proceed to enact such a scheme and do it early, they will have allowed the country to get into a position from which it will be difficult to emerge, and the economic results of which will be disastrous.  They should take the matter in hands at an early date and formulate a scheme of contributory pensions. If they do not do so there is the possibility that it will be impossible for the community to carry this burden, and the result will be economic disaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss contributory or non-contributory pensions, as they hardly enter into the question of this amendment. I would point out that Deputy Johnson has overlooked one important fact; that is, when an officer takes on a job under a local authority he takes it on knowing that it is pensionable, and for that reason, in many cases, he takes a lower salary than he would be prepared to take in the ordinary way of commerce.  As far as I know the workman or labourer, or whatever you may call him, gets whatever is the trades union wage and is in no worse position than people engaged in similar work. In the same way the officer definitely limits his ambition.  If he went into business or started on his own he might achieve a far higher salary than would ever be his lot under a local authority. He deliberately chooses security, plays for safety and takes the position because it is pensionable.  In that respect the two things are not comparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But while I dissent from Deputy Johnson's argument or some of the implications that issue from his argument, I am bound to say that I am, on the whole, in agreement with Deputy Morrissey's amendment on two very important points.  One is that the local bodies &ldquo;may&rdquo;; that is to say, it is permissive, not mandatory.  The second is with regard to the consent of the Minister.  The Minister has power to overrule the local body in any case, so although it may be working as a machine for a great pension scheme still you would require a majority in every local body, and you would require a Labour Government in office to carry <Col N="2477" /> out this scheme.  No doubt Deputy Morrissey hopes to live to see that day. I wonder will he ever see it?  His amendment, as it stands, gives the local authority the power to pension servants who have done a long service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>It puts them in the same position as every private employer in the country.  No employer has a general scheme for all his employees. Almost every employer has from time to time found some particular servant who has done good work or served him an extraordinary long time and he gives him a pension, or perhaps he keeps him on for two or three years longer than he otherwise would until he becomes eligible for the old age pension. I do not say that we can lay down a rule that in no circumstances should a local authority pension anybody.  That seems unduly drastic but subject to what I shall hear from the Minister I am inclined to support Deputy Morrissey's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything for me to say.  I stated that this Bill does not attempt to bring in anybody who is not already pensionable. The superannuation clause is only intended to codify existing laws in regard to superannuation.  As Deputy Hewat mentioned, if we were to consider the question of taking in new officers and new employees we would have to go into the matter very thoroughly.  As it is, it is presumed that every officer who is pensionable at present has something deducted from his salary.  The same provision would have to apply in regard to employees, and I did not consider that matter in preparing this Bill.  It is a matter that would require a good deal of consideration, and for that reason I cannot accept an amendment introduced in this perfunctory way, at this stage of the Bill.</P>

Deputy Cooper spoke of a Labour Government, and asked me did I expect to live to see it.  I said I do not.  But I might live to see, though I do not expect to live very long another Government here before I am much older if this kind of legislation goes on.

      <P>It has not been possible in the time available to hand in amendments and to circulate them, but I wish to move that the words &ldquo;Chief Justice of the Irish Free State&rdquo; be deleted and to insert the words &ldquo;Minister for Public Health and Local Government.&rdquo; The intention of this is to bring the system somewhat into relationship with the system of registration of voters as applied to local authorities. I have not had the time or the opportunity to look up references, but I think I am right in saying that the tendency in the Electoral Act is to throw the appointment of revision or registration officers on to the Local Government Minister.  The object of this amendment is to bring the revision of <Col N="2481" /> the electorate in respect of the Port and Docks Board in some little direction towards the system in vogue with regard to Local Government elections.</P>

      <P>This is the main section of the Bill, and obviously this Bill seeks simply to correct a position that has arisen and in substituting Chief Justice of the Saorstát for the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, it is in line with the alterations that have taken place in the administration of the laws of the Free State.  It is merely a subsituation. Therefore, what Deputy Johnson would propose to do is to make a complete change.  This Bill is obviously a temporary provision for a state of things that could not have been anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended to be temporary.  The Bill is not designed to be temporary.  It is to perpetuate a situation that has been created by a British Act, with the exception that in future the Chief Justice of the Saorstát is to dispense patronage instead of the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.  One of the faults that has been found with the system of judicial patronage in the past has been that it has tended to give judges certain privileges entirely foreign to their judicial office.  The reviser of the list of electors of the Port and Docks Board is to be paid a certain fee for his work. The Chief Justice is to be handed the right to nominate that person and, therefore, the right to obtain this salary or fee that is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a good deal of criticism has been directed against the system which has allowed the judiciary in Ireland in the past to exercise patronage.  They have exercised it in a way which has led to many difficulties, even to the present Government.  I think, as a matter of principle, if patronage is to be exercised, it should not be exercised by judges.  It may be bad enough to say the political Minister should have the patronage at his disposal; but though that may be a bad way out, it is certainly better than to have such patronage exercised by a judge.  Now, when we have the opportunity, we ought, I submit, to get away from that practice.  It is a very small point.  If <Col N="2482" /> the Deputy in charge of the Bill was given privileges over those interested in the land question, and if the Deputy had accepted this simple amendment, it would bring the question of the nomination of revising officers somewhat into line with the practice that is now being embodied in law relating to the Local Government elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether, if a provision had been inserted or included in the Interpretation Bill which we passed about a year ago, indicating that wherever the words &ldquo;The Lord Chief Justice of Ireland&rdquo; were read, the words &ldquo;Chief Justice of the Saorstát&rdquo; would be substituted, Deputy Johnson would have objected to it? That is the situation which ought to have arisen, and we are now trying to correct our omission.  I think I am not quite in agreement with Deputy Johnson's main plea, that a revising barrister should be in all cases appointed by a Minister responsible to the Dáil.  That would mean the possibility of the Minister's appointment being canvassed and discussed.  It would mean the possibility of the conduct of the revising barrister being discussed in the Dáil, and that would mean that we might get out of an atmosphere of impartiality and fairness which ought to characterise our proceedings here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister or the Chief Justice would consciously appoint an unfit man to such a post.  I think the proposal in Deputy Hewat's measure is one which falls into line with the practice elsewhere, which has tended to throw matters concerning elections more and more into the hands of the judges and to remove them from the purview of legislation.  Deputy Johnson may probably remember that when petitions against elections in the British House of Commons were tried by a Committee of that House, the results were not satisfactory, because party matters were introduced.  Now that those matters are considered by a tribunal of judges, the result has been more satisfactory.  I would urge Deputy Hewat very strongly not to accept the Minister for Local Government and Public Health as the Minister to appoint <Col N="2483" /> revising barristers&mdash;that is, presuming he is accepting the principle of Deputy Johnson's amendment.  I think it would be much better if he selected the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has nothing to do with ports or docks, and if any Minister is to make the appointment, it should be the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is intimately connected with the shipping and the mercantile community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I had in mind the probable trend of events within the city and county of Dublin during the next year or two.  I had in mind what has certainly been under consideration, the possibility that the administration of the Port and Docks Board would be by a public authority, allied with, and part of, perhaps, the general local governing authority of the area.  The Deputy suggests the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have the appointment of the person who is to revise the list of electors.  It really matters very little, only I do not see how the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes into it at all.  If the Minister for Justice had been the person in the habit of appointing registration officers under the electoral law, then I would have put him in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply want to bring some kind of uniformity into the law relating to the Port Board (claiming that it should be a public authority) with the law relating to public authorities as a whole. This revision of electors is not quite the same sort of thing as the revision of the electorate for local authorities, because the constituency is a very curious one. It has special characteristics and certain qualifications for one class of elector, and certain other qualifications for another class.  For instance, if a resident happens to have £3,000 worth of personal estate, no matter if that person's estate be in war bonds or not, he is qualified as an elector.  There is quite a number of qualifications.  Then there is the question of the cumulative voting system, the duplicate, the triplicate and the quintuplicate system.  The reviser has to do these things, but that is not <Col N="2484" /> the point.  The point is, who shall appoint the revising officer, who must be a barrister?  My suggestion is, that it is better not to have that power in the hands of the Chief Justice; it is not a judicial function and it should be in the hands of one of the Ministers of State.</P>

      <P>(1)  The seven elective members of the Board who would go out of office on the second Thursday in the month of January in the year 1925 under sub-section (5) of section 7 of the Principal Act shall, notwithstanding the provisions of that sub-section, continue in office until the second Thursday in the month of February in the year 1925 and shall then go out of office.</P>
      <P>(2)  The places of the members of the Board who go out of office under the foregoing sub-section shall be supplied by the election of a like number of members under sub-section (7) of the said section 7 of the Principal Act and all the provisions of the Principal Act as amended by this Act in relation to an election under the said sub-section (7) shall apply to the election aforesaid save that such election shall be held on the Tuesday in the month of February, 1925, immediately preceding the second Thursday in that month in lieu of the day appointed by the said sub-section (7).</P>

It is allowing them to continue without having given a return or any answer to their constituents as to their record in the office.

I just call attention to the fact that by the passing of this section you are extending the period of service and not having an election.</P>
      <P>You are doing this in the same way as you have been extending the period of service of the councillors of rural councils, urban councils and county councils, though you have been continually blaming those councils for incompetence and inability to carry out their duties in the way they ought to be carried out.

      <P>I beg to move that a new Section 8 follow Section 7 to this effect:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1898, no person <Col N="2487" /> qualified to vote at the election of elected members of the Board shall be entitled to more than one vote for each elected member to be elected at any election.</P>
    <P>As I stated yesterday, the method of election is of quite a peculiar kind at least in this country.  There are various classes of electors.  There are traders' representatives; there are representatives of the shipping interests, and the Lord Mayor of Dublin for the time being and six members of the Corporation, as provided for in the Act, go to constitute the Board.  Persons qualified as being traders or shipping members are to have certain qualifications, such as occupation of premises in the city, carrying on any trade or manufacture therein on a rateable value of £20, or being a wholesale trader within the city, carrying on business in the city and paying Customs Dues at the port, in the year, of at least £500, and similarly payment of Excise Duties of at least £500 in the year; or being the registered owner of shipping of at least 50 tons register; or being the payer of tonnage rates in the year of at least £100, in the case of an owner of a ship not registered in the port, who has an office and has a representative manager residing in the city or within fifteen miles of the boundary.</P>
    <P>Then the curious part of this comes in, that a person who is qualified in respect of a £50 valuation, has an additional vote for every £50 valuation in excess of the £50, up to a maximum of six votes; or if he is qualified by the payment of Customs or Excise duty over £1,000 up to £5,000, he has an additional vote; exceeding £5,000 and not exceeding £10,000, he has a further vote, and so on up to a maximum of six votes.  If he is the owner of tonnage he has a maximum up to 10 votes, according to the tonnage, and so on. Similarly in regard to harbour rates, he has votes.  Now, the effect of that is that certain elements in the community are in a position to carry a very great deal more weight than their mental qualification would entitle them to. Their ability to discern who would be a competent member is not added to by <Col N="2488" /> the fact that their qualifications are increased in this way.</P>
    <P>But then there is a further factor entering into this.  There is a system whereby a person may carry votes on behalf of other people to an extent even much greater than I mentioned the other day when I said that one person can deposit 1,300 votes at an election. As a matter of fact, I am informed that at a recent election, the last election, one person was able to deposit as many as 1,700 votes.</P>
    <P>That is a system of voting that I think is objectionable, and that I wish to remedy.  The method of election that is laid down in the Act makes it possible for certain interests in the city&mdash; native and foreign&mdash;to control to a very great extent the workings of the Port and Docks.  Deputies on the Farmers' Benches will be familiar with an agitation which has taken place within recent years.  Deputies from the city, particularly, know that there have been many complaints respecting the method of conducting the business of the Board and respecting particularly the allocation of space, the complaint being that the tendency of the Board in allocating space is to give preferential treatment to the big companies&mdash;the monopolistic companies or those which are tending to a monopoly&mdash;to the exclusion or detriment of would-be rival companies, coming forward in the hope of getting a chance to serve the interests of the community&mdash;getting an edge in, getting a chance of competing with the big companies&mdash;the railway companies and Coast Lines, Limited, of which the British and Irish combine is a constituent part.</P>
    <P>The factor that weighs with me is that the present system of voting in the election tends to increase the power of these companies to the detriment of the would-be rivals.  This has resulted in a great deal of heart-burning, a great deal of condemnation and, I think, probably a great deal of loss to the country.  In this amendment, I would hope that we would at least step one yard or so forward towards the prevention of the development of that monopoly; that we would secure that electors would not be able to carry six, <Col N="2489" /> eight and ten votes; that we would at least record our opinion that a more democratic system and a fairer system of election should take place, and that the persons who have been moving in the direction of controlling the port would at least have a slight check and that they would receive a warning that that tendency should be curbed.  On those grounds I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the House to reject the amendment, but not on any ground of merit or demerit.  I make this request of the House, because the present Bill does not profess to deal with anything but one small item. It gives us power to carry on our business in a proper way.  There will come a much more suitable time for Deputy Johnson to stress all the arguments he has used.  While I am not going into the arguments in detail, may I say that I do not at all agree with what the Deputy has urged.  The Port and Docks Board has its demerits.  It also has its merits and, so far as I am concerned, I will make an opportunity for Deputy Johnson or any other Deputy to discuss the franchise of the Port and Docks Board at an early and suitable date.  To-day I am asking the Dáil for sympathy and support in rectifying the state of affairs which the Dáil has placed upon the Board and which the Dáil never intended to place upon the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the new clause introduced by Deputy Johnson.  With an experience of 25 years of the port of Dublin, I must say that the members of the live stock trade and the public generally are not at all satisfied with the present constitution of the Port and Docks Board.  They would prefer a broader franchise.  What Deputy Johnson states is a fact&mdash;that the port is more or less controlled by the shipping interests.  It will be remembered that when a new company was started some years ago, it was almost impossible to get berthage for the &ldquo;Brussels.&rdquo;  Practically every site from the Custom House to Alexandra Basin was taken up.  It was next to impossible to get even a yard at the port.  In the interests of trade, the port of Dublin should not be a preserved <Col N="2490" /> port, or something equivalent to the &ldquo;pocket borough&rdquo; that we used to hear of in olden times.</P>
      <P>I think the franchise should be broadened and that an endeavour should be made to give representation to those interested in the development of the industrial resources of the country. I am in agreement with the main principles of the Bill, but the feeling that I have referred to exists amongst the people, and I think Deputy Johnson did a useful service in calling attention to it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson knows that I could not give any such undertaking.

These matters regarding the franchise and everything else could then be raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not guarantee that they would do any such thing. But Deputy Johnson knows that the whole future of the Port and Docks Board is under consideration in connecnection with the bigger scheme for the reconstruction of Dublin.  If anything came out of that, the Board might be altered without their having much &ldquo;say&rdquo; in it.  I am not objecting to the criticisms of Deputy Johnson or Deputy McKenna.  All I do urge is that this is a matter of urgency, and that I do not think the merits or demerits of the Port and Docks Board enter into the question at the moment.  Nobody can doubt that an opportunity will in a short time be given, either before the Reconstruction Committee or the Greater Dublin Committee, or by the <Col N="2491" /> promotion of a Bill by the Board, to go into the whole question.  The whole question can be gone into then if there is any strong feeling that the composition of the Board is not satisfactory to the people.  After all, we do not claim, as a Board, to be outside the range of public criticism, nor do we act in any way as arbitrarily as Deputy Johnson would have the Dáil believe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat has evaded the point.  The election that will be facilitated by the passing of this Bill will mean the re-election, I have no doubt in view of the present system, of the two representatives of the two big companies that are under criticism. It will be a fixing of that influence in the Board for at least a period of, I think, three years.  Perhaps we can get some kind of an assurance that we are going to have a real chance in the Dáil of discussing this matter&mdash;I do not mean by Private Bill, because I am afraid that Private Bills are going to be the means of getting many evil things done outside and of avoiding the criticism of the Dáil.  I want this question to be brought frankly before the Dáil by a Bill, moved either on behalf of the Port and Docks Board or on behalf of the Ministry, to alter the franchise and the present scheme of representation. I know it is quite right for Deputy Hewat to remind me of the existence of the Commission that is to inquire into the whole system, but from what Deputy Hewat himself said last night I think he is looking forward to three or five years hence.  I do not think we can afford to wait that time before this reform takes place.  I would like to have from Deputy Hewat, on behalf of the Port and Docks Board, some kind of an assurance that, of their own free will, they will father a Bill to revise the qualifications for the election of members of the Board.</P>

We are asked now to agree that the membership of the Board, as it at present exists, ought to continue.  As to the period of its continuance, that is a matter that will come up later, but we are now asked to agree that the Board shall be re-elected on its present basis, and that the present system ought to continue.

      <P>I have been a former member of the Port and Docks Board. As a member of the minority party on that Board, I wish to testify to the excellent work done by the Board.  I was a member of the Berthage Committee of the Port Board and I wish it to be known that the port reserves a certain amount of unallocated space, and that any firm of shippers who want a berth can get it by making application to the Harbour Master.  No ship was ever turned away by the Port and Docks Board for want of a berth.  What happened in the old days, say 20 years ago, I do not know.  As a member of the Board for the past eight or ten years I do know that a good many of the complaints referred to by Deputy Johnson have been removed.  The Board is an excellent one and it does its work exceptionally well.  As Deputy Hewat stated, this Bill has been put forward merely to correct the omission of the name of the Chief Justice, which was forgotten when the Act was going through before.  The Bill merely asks for a continuance of the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Greater Dublin Commission expects to have the members of the Port and Docks Board before it, and I hope the Commission will make its report before the time anticipated by Deputies. <Col N="2493" /> The Commission may be making recommendations concerning the points Deputy Johnson complains about.  Some years ago I had reason to complain myself about the system of election to the Board, but as time went on we got on the Board that type of man who is representative of the successful commercial men we have in the city of Dublin. As regards the mentality of the voters who had two, three or four votes on the plural system of voting, they were all successful business people in the city. They achieved success in building up fine commercial concerns, and must, I think, be given credit for the extraordinary ability which enabled them to merit an allotment of two, four, or six votes.  There were very few, I think, who had six votes.  On the whole, I say that the Port and Docks Board is one of the best managed Boards in the Saorstát. In the near future there may be a suggestion for extending its franchise. If any reasonable proposal is put forward that will safeguard the interests of the port of Dublin, I, personally, will support it.

      <P>Deputy Byrne has really missed the completion of his speech.  He should have said that the Board was constituted of so and so, but that his colleagues, representing the Corporation of the city of Dublin, that is to say, the civic members, are no longer there and that the Board is, of course, the poorer to that extent.  Their absence increases the power of these particular people that you are going to re-elect.  You are, by the abolition of the rights of the Corporation members &mdash;by their withdrawal&mdash;actually increasing the powers of the representatives of the shipping interests.  That is another reason for amending the present franchise, or, at least, for delaying action on this matter until Deputy Hewat has had an opportunity of consulting with his Board to bring in a better Bill.</P>

    <P>On resuming, <b>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</b> in the Chair, the Dáil went into Committee and resumed the consideration of the Dublin Port and Docks Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1924.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the last amendment was not accepted, but I hope that this one will be.  The amendment which I move is to add a new section before Section 8 as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;It is hereby enacted that if, owing to any cause, the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 of the Dublin Port and Docks Act, 1898, which provides for the election by the Corporation of the city of Dublin, acting by the Municipal Council, of six members of the Corporation to be members of the Board, are unfulfilled, the right to appoint six civic members of the Board shall be exercised by the members of the Dáil for the time being representing constituencies in the city and county of Dublin.&rdquo;  The case is made on behalf of the Board or, to be quite fair, on behalf of people who have recently been on the Board, that the Board has been amended somewhat in recent years, and that a different attitude has been adopted in regard to certain complaints that were rife, and that the Board has been, to that extent, put in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the truth of that, I have no evidence to submit, but I do say that one of the factors affecting that result, if it has been the result, was the existence of civic representatives on the Board.  By virtue of the provisions of the Act under which the Board is operating there were to be members of the Corporation representing the citizens acting on the Board.  There being no Corporation now there are no civic members and therefore there is no element within the Board to represent <Col N="2497" /> the public of the city as distinct from traders and shipping members.  It is said that there are schemes of financial consolidation afoot and that there are improvement schemes of one kind or another under consideration.  That makes it all the more necessary why there should be on the Board representatives of the citizens as distinct from representatives of the interests.</P>

      <P>I have, over and over again, refused to accept the view that the title of a Bill is to determine its scope.  It is what is in the Bill determines the scope, and not the title.  This is a Bill for a special purpose, and an amendment going outside the purpose and scope of the Bill is out of order.  I think this amendment goes outside the scope of the Bill, and is, therefore, out of order.  In addition, this is amending by way of public Bill a local Act, a procedure which, I think, is not normal, though it is possible, and which I would be prepared to allow <Col N="2498" /> only in special circumstances.  In this case there are special circumstances, but any proposal to amend any of the principal Acts, which are local Acts dealing with the Port and Docks Board, is a different matter and should not be dealt with in this Bill, and, possibly, it should not be dealt with at all by means of public Bill procedure.</P>

      <P>I can only bow to your ruling.  I regret it has arisen thus, because it affects the whole attitude which one must adopt to the Bill.  I was hoping it might be possible to assist in the passing of the Bill, to meet what is alleged to be a need, and generally to get over certain difficulties. To pass the Bill in its present form, without some such amendment, would. I think, be a mistake.</P>

      <P>My attitude in allowing this Bill to be moved as a public Bill and not sending it to the Examiner is mainly because it makes no change in the Port and Docks Board.

      <P>Is not this amendment of Deputy Johnson's an emergency provision similar to the emergency provision in the Bill for prolonging the term of office of certain persons whose term of office expires?  This is an emergency provision to meet the case of the dissolution of the Dublin Corporation and only endures so long as that Corporation is dissolved or suspended. Would not that be similar to the provision in one section of the Bill that prolongs the term of office in a time of emergency?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Standing Order says that by unanimous leave of the House or, in case of urgent necessity, of which the Ceann Comhairle shall be the judge, the Standing Order may be suspended, provided that, when it is proposed without notice to move the suspension of the Standing Order relating to the taking of any stage of a Bill, such motion shall not be received by the Ceann Comhairle unless it has the support of not less than half the Teachtaí who have taken their seats according to law.  I raise the point of order, in view of the ruling you have just made that this is a public Bill amending a private Act, and the Port and Docks Board, being a private corporation, it cannot be said to be a case of urgent necessity affecting the Dáil, as it is to convenience a private organisation&mdash;the Port and Docks Board.</P>

      <P>On the question of urgency, I submit that a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders is justified in the circumstances of the case.  I would like to have the help and assistance of Deputy Johnson in this matter, and I still make the plea to him that the various matters that he has raised are matters that this Bill does not affect, and that the opportunity for raising them cannot be very far distant. I understand Deputy Johnson's attitude, but this Bill is only seeking to put a large and important body&mdash;the Port and Docks Board&mdash;in a position to carry on its work and do its duty towards the citizens during a short period, and the holding up of the Bill will serve no useful purpose even from the point of view of Deputy Johnson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already tried to impress on the Dáil that the urgency of the matter arises from an Act of the Dáil unintentionally affecting the administration of the Port and Docks Board, and making it difficult, if not impossible, to have an election, and that the Board, with its reduced numbers, is not able to function properly.  That is not due to any act of the Board but to an act of this Dáil.  I think the Dáil is called upon to put right what is found to be inequitable.  I submit that this is an urgent matter and a very proper matter for the Dáil to decide.  The Dáil is the only body that could put right the position that has been disclosed in connection with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the proposition that is put to you, sir, to judge, is whether this is a case not merely of urgency but of urgent necessity within the meaning of this Standing Order.  Urgent necessity has relation in respect to this House to public interest.  Here is a matter which may be urgent to the Port and Docks Board, but that is a semi-private institution and the necessity and the urgency do not, I submit, depend upon the passing of this measure at this time.  The only delay that would arise, supposing the programme as outlined regarding the adjournment takes place, would be of six weeks or two months, when the Bill can be reconsidered with more leisure and without breach or straining of the Standing Orders.  The case for necessity has not been proved.  The case for urgency has not been proved.  I submit that this is not a case of urgent necessity within the meaning of the Standing Order, which must only be interpreted as having regard to the public need, rather than the convenience of a private organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit with regard to this question of urgency, that it is of urgent public importance, not merely of private importance, that there should be some body or authority competent to control the port of Dublin, and that unless this Bill passes <Col N="2501" /> early in January seven of the members of the Board will be disqualified.  The result will be that it will be impossible to get a quorum to attend meetings of the Board, and the Board will not be able to pay salaries or function in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot say that is the position as far as the ordinary business is concerned.  It is the position in connection with any variation of dues or in connection with the promoting of any Bill. For instance, if this Bill came up after the date on which these members should retire, it could not be promoted. We could not promote any Bill because of the fact that fifteen members are required to be present to sanction the proceedings of the Port and Docks Board either to levy dues, promote a Bill, or do any of the other things laid down in the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to correct any erroneous impression that I may have created with regard to the quorum for ordinary business.  I knew that for certain purposes a quorum of <Col N="2502" /> one more than the number that would exist early in January if the Bill does not pass was needed.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="AN CEANN COMHAIRLE Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>AN CEANN COMHAIRLE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a case of urgent necessity.  The ruling in the matter of urgent necessity still leaves Deputy Hewat in the position that he must get a very substantial majority to support him, so that the matter is left substantially to the Dáil.  The Port and Docks Board is, technically, a private corporation, I suppose, but it is really impossible to say that a body that controls the Port of Dublin, which is the most important port in the country, is not of a semipublic nature, and the Bill does not appear to affect any private interests. For the purposes of the Standing Order I rule, therefore, that the matter is one of urgent necessity.  Before Deputy Hewat can move a motion to suspend the Standing Order he must, under the Standing Orders, prove that he has the support of half the Teachtaí who have taken their seats according to law. That number, at the moment, would be forty-nine.</P>

If I get that answer I am prepared to withdraw any further opposition to the Bill.  In the interests of the country, in the interests of the port, and in the interests of Dublin, such legislation is necessary as there is no doubt that for a considerable time past there has been great criticism of the composition of the Port and Docks Board.  The sooner the Government bring in the necessary legislation, or the Port and Dock Board, or whoever is responsible, the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the desire of the citizens that the Port Board should be in any way reformed, the citizens have it in their own hands to do it.  If any expression came from outside sources that would seem to the Board to need a consideration of the position, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the Board would, in view <Col N="2504" /> of any circumstances of the kind, give the matter due and careful consideration. For the information of the Deputy, I may say that not very many years ago the Chamber of Commerce promoted a Bill for the reform of the Port and Docks Board.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact that same sort of proceeding could be carried out by any body of citizens at the present time as in the past.  The Act of 1898 is the principal Act in connection with this. If citizens come to the conclusion that the Port and Docks Board is not constituted as it should be constituted the power of public opinion can very easily be brought to bear in and outside this House.  All I can assure Deputy Magennis is that the members of the Board are alive to the importance of the trust in their care and recognise fully their obligations to the citizens of Dublin.  If that is brought into question I say without hesitation that the Board will carefully consider the position, and I think will do what is right and just in the interests of Dublin citizens as a whole.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where a female pensionable officer in the employment of a local body elects or is compelled by the terms of her appointment to retire on account of her marriage or intended marriage, such local body may with the consent of the Minister, grant to such officer on her retirement or, where her retirement takes place before her marriage, upon her marriage a gratuity not greater than either a sum calculated at the rate of one twelfth of her yearly salary and emoluments for each completed year of her service or than a sum equal to her yearly salary and emoluments whichever of those sums is the lesser.</P>

    <P>In page 20, Section 37, before subsection <Col N="2506" /> (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local body may, with the consent of the Minister, grant to a person who devotes the whole of his time to the work of the local body and is remunerated out of moneys provided for the purpose by the local body, and whose employment is terminated for a cause other than misconduct or incapacity, a gratuity not greater than one-sixth of his yearly salary or wages and emoluments for each completed year of his service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to secure in the case of assistants to clerks of unions and district councils and other unestablished officers who have been paid out of moneys provided by the local authority and who have devoted the whole of their time to the work, that local authority should be empowered, with the consent of the Ministry, to grant them a gratuity not greater than one-sixth of the yearly salary or wages.  I think this is a fair amendment.  Numbers of those officers have had their offices abolished under an amalgamation scheme.  I think, with the reservation that they must have devoted the whole of their time to the work and must have been paid out of moneys provided by the local authority for that purpose, the Minister might see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>(c) In the case of an officer of a committee or joint committee appointed for the purposes of the Agricultural and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act, 1899, who has become pensionable by reason of his having devoted the whole of his time to the service of one or more such committees or joint committees for a continuous period of not less than ten years, his service shall be deemed to have commenced at the beginning of such continuous period.</P>
      <P>The object of this is to ensure that 10 years, or as one may call it, a probationary period in the case of agricultural and technical officers will count for pensionable purposes.  I think everyone is in agreement with the principle.</P>

      <P>In page 21, before Section 38, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A local body may grant to any person who was an existing officer&mdash; within the meaning of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, and ceased to hold office under such local body after the 6th day of December, 1921, and before the passing of this Act and to whom no compensation has been granted by such local body in respect of such cesser, the same compensation as might have been granted to such person if such cesser had taken place after the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  This part of this Act shall apply to the granting of compensation to any person under this section and to such compensation when granted.</P>
      <P>The amendment is introduced on an undertaking given to Deputy Nagle to cover the case of an officer who could not be pensioned by the council as a result of being an officer of another authority.

In page 22, Section 43, to delete the words &ldquo;After the sixth day of December, 1922,&rdquo; in line 29, and the word &ldquo;thereupon&rdquo; in line 33, and to insert after the word &ldquo;who&rdquo; in line 29 the words &ldquo;having <Col N="2509" /> at least ten years' service as such officer of a local body.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The substance of this amendment was raised on the section during the debate in the Committee Stage.  The object of the amendment is to secure that officers who were taken from local authorities and joined the central authority and took service under them before this 6th of December, 1922, should have the same privileges as are accorded to those who joined after the 6th December, 1922.  If it is fair and equitable that men, taken from local authorities, because of the good service they rendered, and who were appointed to the central authority, should have their years' service legally counted for pension, I think the Minister must admit that it is only fair that that privilege, or, rather, that right, for that is what it is, should be accorded all round. When I raised this point before the Minister said that this 6th of December date was selected because that was the date on which the Constitution was passed.</P>
      <P>That is not a sufficient explanation, to my mind.  The idea is either right or wrong to give these men credit for the years they served previous to joining the central authority.  If it is right in one case, it is right in all cases.  The Government cannot get out of this by saying &ldquo;They are our own men to whom we are under certain obligations. The others were taken on by a previous Government.&rdquo;  That is no good argument to use against this amendment.  I understand that the number of people that would be affected by this is very few, and there is no good reason, that I can see, why they should not have the same rights as it is proposed to give under this section to those who were taken on after the 6th December.  I hope the Minister will give way on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>When we debated the principle of this in Committee, I said that I could only consider those officers who came into the service since we had taken over control.  Their right to consideration was based on a contractual relation entered into between the Government and the persons in question. An undertaking was given that some arrangement would be come to whereby <Col N="2510" /> they could get credit for their service. Officers were taken over previously, to whom no such undertaking was given, and we could not hold ourselves responsible for agreements, or lack of agreements, that existed between such officers and pre-existing Governments.</P>
      <P>They have no other right, only the contractual right, and I could not agree to accept Deputy O'Connell's amendment for that reason.  As to his statement that it would only probably affect a few officers, that is not correct.  It might have very far-reaching consequences if accepted.  A great number of officers have come in and it might extend this pension scheme considerably. I would be prepared to extend the date back to 1921, which would still leave it under our control, but would only deal with such cases as came under the Central Government while the Provisional Government or present Government was in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess I cannot understand the opposition of the Minister. He has based it on the contention that there was only a contractual right.  A contractual right, or whatever it was, would depend upon the will of the Dáil, because the Minister had no right to make any contract except subject to what was passed in the Dáil. The Government has no right to make any such contract.  I think that if inquiries were made the Minister would find that the number of people who would be affected, even by deleting this date altogether, would be very few.  I hope he will endeavour to find out how many would be affected.  The men who were taken over, and who are serving the State at the present moment, gave good service, and he will find that in comparison to those others who were lucky enough to be taken over with the new Government, these men will have a certain sense of grievance and that is not going to make them better servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask him to look into the matter and to find out the number, and if he finds that the number is not as great as he thinks then he might be willing to make this alteration in another place when the Bill goes there.  I do hope he will look into the matter and see the number of people who are affected.  Of course <Col N="2511" /> 1921 is something.  I know some men in the service at present.  And the ten years' limitation is there too.  That will affect them also.  Unless they had given ten years' service to the local authority they would not come under my amendment and that will be a further limitation on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Corish, I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 23, Section 47, lines 22 to 24, to delete the words &ldquo;if his period of service under such committee was or shall have been not less than 10 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is intended to deal more particularly with officers of county infirmaries and fever hospitals.  I will give a case in point.  The functions of the Roscommon County Infirmary&mdash;I do not know whether any Deputies from Roscommon are here&mdash;were transferred to the county board of health in 1923. Two nurses, who had then respectively eight and four years' service, and were permanent employees of the county infirmary, were transferred to the service of the county board of health, but the Minister gave sanction only to their temporary appointment under the board of health.  The nurses have now nine and five years' service, and apparently will be debarred from getting pensions in respect of their county infirmary service because it was less than ten years, and debarred from pensions in respect of their board of health service because the Minister insisted on making their appointments temporary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nurses, of course, when they were under the county infirmary committee, thought that they would be pensionable, but the transfer of the infirmary <Col N="2512" /> has altered the whole situation. They have no redress, since they cannot even claim pension for their county infirmary service.  It would probably meet the situation if the Minister would make these posts permanent and pensionable and allow their infirmary service to be reckoned for pension eventually. In a letter from the Ministry, dated 27th October this year, they stated that there is nothing under the existing law to require the board of health to take into account the service of an officer in the county infirmary or the county fever hospital committees in fixing a superannuation allowance. Now, the transfer from the county infirmary to the board of health was an administrative change, with which the staff had nothing to do.  It was not because of the choice of the staff, but of the central authority and the county authority, and, surely that should not operate to penalise the staff.  I think that is a reasonable proposition, and I ask the Minister and the Dáil to agree to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with this case which Deputy Johnson has put up.  It was a case of individual hardship, and if it were sent up to be dealt with by us departmentally, I am sure we would be able to ensure justice.  This provision of ten years is necessary in this section in order to prevent the giving of gratuities on a wholesale scale. That was the sole reason for putting it in, and in other respects these officers are just as well off as any other officer under the Bill.  I think that Deputy Johnson has stated a case of particular hardship.  I have not heard of any similar case before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot give details of the case, but I think it is a matter which the Department has been made familiar with through some of its officials because some correspondence has ensued.  We say that the section would deprive these persons who had something less than 10 years' service and who are transferred from the county infirmary to the board of health automatically, without their consent or without any real change in their status to their knowledge, of something to which they should be entitled.  Yet it <Col N="2513" /> appears there is to be a very definite change in their status.  They are to be deprived by the fact of that simple transfer&mdash;that is to say, the change over from the county infirmary to the county board of health, of benefits accruing owing to the fact that they had served some years in the county infirmary. I do not think the Dáil would agree that that is desirable.  I think that it is generally recognised by Deputies that between the county infirmary and the county board of health the nurses' services would more or less be continuous and should be considered as continuous, and therefore they should come under the benefits that were accruing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Committee Stage the Minister required a good deal of argument to keep me quiet in the matter.  I expressed great dissatisfaction with this very long sentence which is extremely hard to analyse.  I wanted to be quite sure that the transferred officers would get credit for the service they had done in the county infirmaries before the transference had taken place.  The question of the medical officers was in my mind chiefly at the time, and I had not in my mind at the moment the cases of men who had less than ten years' service.  I do think the case Deputy Johnson has brought forward requires some consideration.</P>
      <P>It would be absolutely and obviously unfair that nurses who had spent six, seven or eight years in the county infirmary and had been transferred and owing to some technicality or irregularity, or something of that sort, by which they only became appointed temporarily in their new offices, should be deprived of the time they spent in the county infirmary, and I think that the Minister might look into it.  I would be inclined to support the amendment as it stands if it means that the people, who had served eight or ten years in a county infirmary, after their transference to the county hospital or county homes are to be deprived of that time.  That, I think, would be manifestly unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of those officers is that under this section we are <Col N="2514" /> giving them rights which they had not before.  They were not permanent officers; they had no security of tenure and had no pensionable rights.  We are conferring pensionable rights on them, the same pensionable rights as other officers under the Bill, with the exception that we are not allowing them pensionable rights in cases of less than ten years' service, in order to prevent the wholesale granting of gratuities, as was the case under the 1919 Act. However, it is now too late for anything to be done in this matter here, but I will be prepared to look into it between now and the time when the Bill is considered in the Seanad.  I may be able to add something further to it, but I do not think we can do anything in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see the justice of the claim that service with the county health authority, under which is included infirmary committee and other health services, should be reckoned as continuous?  If there has been a transfer from one authority to another by virtue of the administrative act of abolishing the infirmary committees, surely that administrative act should not go any way towards penalising the persons in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that the Minister has made is that these officers have been made pensionable now, that is to say, they will have a claim from the time that they begin to serve in their new offices, but I think it would be obviously unfair, if they are made pensionable officers now, not to give them credit for the time they have served under similar conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>These officers at present are in the same position as a nurse in any private hospital.  You might just as well say that we should give pensionable rights to nurses who have spent the same period in St. Vincent's, the Richmond, or the Mater Hospitals. if they were taken over as officers of a <Col N="2515" /> county board of health.  The officers in these county infirmaries had no pensionable rights, and it is a considerable improvement in their status to transfer them to a body under which they would have pensionable rights.  Their status has been considerably improved, and they have lost nothing.  If we had not made this change they would have no pensionable rights of any kind.  We are improving their status by giving them pensionable rights.</P>

      <P>In page 24, before Section 50, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A county council may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as they think fit for purposes connected with the exercise or performance of any of their powers, duties, and functions which in the opinion of the council would be better or more conveniently regulated or managed by or through a committee.</P>
      <P>(2)  A committee appointed under this section may be either a general committee empowered to exercise or perform powers, duties, and functions in relation to the whole of the county or a local committee empowered to exercise or perform powers, duties, and functions in relation to a limited portion only of the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Every committee appointed under this section shall consist of not <Col N="2516" /> less than three members, and may be composed either wholly of members of the council or partly of such members and partly of other persons.</P>
    <P>(4)  The acts of every committee appointed under this section shall be subject to confirmation by the council save that the council may with the sanction of the Minister empower any particular committee to do any act (including the institution of legal proceedings) within the authority conferred on the committee by the council which the council itself could lawfully do.</P>
    <P>(5)  The quorum, procedure, and place of meeting of any committee appointed under this section and the area (if any) within which any such committee is to exercise its functions, shall be such as may be appointed by regulations to be made by the council with the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>(6)  Save as is authorised by this section it shall not be lawful for a county council to delegate any of its powers or duties to a committee.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment that I am introducing as a result of a discussion on the Committee Stage to the effect that the county councils should have the same power of appointing committees as county boards of health.  I mentioned that under existing statutes the county councils have power to appoint these committees, but it was not stated clearly or specifically, and in order to make it clear I have thought it well to introduce this new section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course another question arises.  Perhaps the Minister contemplates local committees being appointed. We are abolishing some of the local councils.  We are not ensuring, even in this amendment, that there will be a local committee of the county <Col N="2517" /> council.  This amendment does not ensure that an urban area which has been absorbed, or a rural district area, will have a local committee, or even that a county electoral area will have one. There is nothing at all to ensure that there will be a local committee of the county council, and I urge again the desirability of making it mandatory that there should be local committees. I think it is more likely, in respect of the county councils and the functions of the county councils as such, that they will appoint local committees under their optional powers than in the case of boards of health.</P>
      <P>I think the interests would be somewhat different, and, in practice, local committees for county council functions will be more likely to be appointed. But I would like it to be made mandatory.  I wish to point out that this section does not ensure that there will be local committees in respect of road administration, or some of the other functions under this section.  I think it is an omission and a fault, and I would like to know whether the Minister is prepared now to introduce an amendment to ensure that local committees shall be appointed.</P>

      <P>This would take it absolutely out of the power of county boards of health or county councils to decide this matter for themselves. Surely, if there were any virtue in the suggestion that Deputy Johnson makes it would appeal to the county council.  I cannot understand that local recommendations, coming from an urban district or a district council district, or being put up at the board of health or the county council, would not have due consideration and would not take effect.  But to say &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; is going a little too far; the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is getting us as far as we want to get.  If the position of a county council is such that it does not demand these sub-committees the county council can do without them.  I think that local Parliaments such as these, elected by the people, are the best authorities to deal with this question, and I should leave them absolute discretion to set up these committees or not.  I think that the Minister would <Col N="2518" /> be right to retain the principle that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is quite sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gorey takes up the right attitude on this matter.  I am not anxious to enforce my views on county councils unless it is absolutely necessary, and if these bodies are competent to take up the very great responsibilities that will be thrown upon them by this Bill, making them practically local Parliaments, they should certainly be competent to decide what kind of committees they will appoint, whether they will be local or general, or what kind of local or general committees they should be.  Accordingly, I would be very slow to stereotype any particular form of committees to make them compulsory.</P>
      <P>New section put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 24, before Section 50, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Article 36 of the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, shall be construed so that a county council may appoint committees with powers in relation to either the whole of the functional area of the council or such smaller areas as the council may think expedient.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was put down having regard to the probable attitude of the Minister in his refusal to insert mandatory provisions, and it still allows the councils discretion; it is still optional.  Its effect is rather drawing attention to the, shall I say, suggestion that there should be local committees appointed by the council under this Article 36 of Local Government Order, 1898.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section that has just been passed deals with quorum, procedure and the place of meetings of committees. Article 36 does not make any reference to the Minister at all.  It leaves to the county council the option of making regulations regarding the procedure of these committees.  That is not, perhaps, a very important matter, but it indicates a difference in point of view as to the responsibilities of councils.  If you are going to give a council the discretion that Deputy Gorey spoke of, at <Col N="2519" /> least you should trust it in regard to the making of rules of procedure, quorum, etc., without bringing the Minister in at all.</P>

      <P>I really do not think there is very much between us on these two amendments with the exception of the fact that mine has been passed through the draftsman's hands and Deputy Johnson's has not.  I do not know what that functionary would do if the amendment came before him.  The point was raised about making it necessary for the committee appointed by the council to receive the sanction of the Minister.  If the Deputy will look at sub-section (4) of my amendment he will see that matter explained.  It is only in particular cases where they set up Committees that the sanction of the Minister is required.  It probably gives much wider powers than Deputy Johnson's, and I think he ought to agree to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy want to encourage the practice which was touched upon at a previous meeting? That practice was that members would drop in to have their names recorded as being present, and then they would go to another meeting.  There may be no penalty and no loss of expenses involved in the case of urban councils; but it is a very undesirable practice to insert in any Act which will be effective, that a member can go into a meeting, stay a couple of minutes to find out whether there is anything on, or remain while an appointment is being made, and then go away.  If that is to be the practice to be condoned by the Deputy, I think we ought to take action of another kind.  We ought to include urban councils if there is any method of suggesting that a person is present at that meeting and should not be recorded as being present unless he sits there during the whole of the meeting, or for three hours.</P>

      <P>I think in the absence of experience of either urban or county council meetings, the Deputy does not exactly see the point the Dáil had in mind when these recommendations were made in Committee.  In one case members have to come a considerable distance.  In the past there has been a difficulty on county councils owing to the trouble in getting a quorum.  As far as my experience goes, the same difficulty has not occurred on urban councils.  There are Deputies on the same benches with Deputy Johnson who have had considerable experience on urban councils; possibly they would express their opinions.  My experience is there was no difficulty on urban councils and therefore there is no necessity for this legislation applying to them.</P>

I agree that it does not come into this.  I rise to point out that Deputy Good was making the point where finance was involved, but he was prepared to condone a similar offence where it was the administrative <Col N="2523" /> record of the councillor was in question.</P>

I would like to know what would the position be in the case of members of a county council or board of health or other members of a committee of a county council who had to travel to a meeting but owing to a quorum not turning up, could not transact the business of the meeting.  According to this amendment they are not entitled to get their expenses.  I think when the matter was discussed here on the last occasion it was agreed that when the members of a county council or commitee thereof attended, but through want of a quorum a meeting could not be held, those members should get credit for their attendance.  I would like to know if this amendment if passed would have the effect of negativing that?  Last week there were several amendments moved to the effect that these committees should be paid the same as the elected bodies.  Now, as I read this amendment, there is no member of these bodies except a member of the county council entitled to get paid this salary, as Deputy Gorey calls it.</P>

      <P>In page 26, Section 56, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) The powers of a library authority under the Public Libraries (Ireland) Acts, 1855 to 1920, shall include power to incur expenditure out of the library rate on the provision of public lectures and exhibitions (whether admission to such lectures or exhibitions is free or subject to such charges and conditions as the library authority may determine) and libraries in schools.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious amendment.  There was a discussion on it at the Committee Stage, and it was supported by all sides in the Dáil, and I think the Minister was inclined to give it support but that he could not screw his courage to the sticking point at the moment.  We were hopeful that he would have been able to consult with his advisers and the library authorities in respect of the power which it was proposed to give to the local authority to spend money out of the library rate for the provision of lectures and to provide libraries for schools.  The proposition was very generally supported from all sides.  We pointed out that it did not involve any increase in the library rate.  At present library committees are debarred from spending any of that money on the provision of a school library or on the provision of a lecture, but it would be very beneficial in assisting in working a library and making the library much more valuable, in fact multiplying the value of the library by several points.  I hope the Minister has been able to give friendly and sympathetic consideration to this amendment.  It is supported by the library committees in Limerick, Cork, Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire, Rathmines, and several other places where they have formally considered it and passed a resolution <Col N="2525" /> in its favour.  I hope the Minister will give assent to the proposed amendment and so avoid any further discussion.</P>

When the matter was under discussion before, when the Bill was going through Committee, I think there were expressions of opinion from all sections of the Dáil that some clause such as this should be embodied in the Bill.  I then took the opportunity of pointing out that this was one of the most reasonable and useful developments in connection with library work, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to enable our libraries here to take advantage of this very necessary and useful provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a word in regard to that portion which enables the library committee to give some help towards the provision of school libraries.  The Education Authorities for many years have been urging the necessity for establishing libraries in connection with schools.  All who are in touch with educational matters will agree that it is a great advantage to have those school libraries.  Up to the present few such exist, because there are no funds on which to draw, except voluntary funds or what can be got locally in the parish.</P>
      <P>I think, as Deputy Johnson said, this is a question that hardly needs any argument.  It only seeks to give committees power to assist in the establishment of school libraries if they are so minded, within their present rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter during the Committee Stage and, since then, I have taken the opportunity of studying the Public Libraries (Ireland) Acts, 1885 to 1920.  They are very numerous.  It appears that about every ten years somebody in the Chief Secretary's office said &ldquo;We need a new Libraries Act,&rdquo; and one was brought in.  So far as I can see, there is always one saving clause in these Acts, and that is that power is reserved to the Local Government Board&mdash;as it was then&mdash;to make rules in connection with the matter.  In Committee, the Minister <Col N="2526" /> expressed a fear that we might be going too fast; that in districts where there were rural libraries which had comparatively few books, the authorities controlling those libraries might spend their money on lectures instead of getting new books.  I think that Deputy Johnson's quotation of the Public Libraries Acts would limit that damage &mdash;that the Minister, as representing the now defunct Local Government Board, would be able by rule to control that. He might make a rule prohibiting any library having less than 1,000 or 2,000 books from promoting those lectures. That being so, I think there is a safeguard. This amendment gives power to Cork, Limerick and other such centres to exercise a faculty which does help to promote the usefulness of the library.</P>
      <P>I would also like to support Deputy O'Connell in his point regarding school libraries.  There is no doubt that a very valuable part of one's education is not that which is taught but that which he himself picks up.  School libraries enable boys and girls in the formative period of their lives to obtain knowledge which they might not otherwise acquire.  We all learn in many and diverse ways.  I met one Deputy who actually expressed regret that he was not on a Private Bill Committee.  I asked why.  He said: &ldquo;Look at the education it is.  You would learn more from those experts than you would from reading a hundred books.&rdquo;  I think that was a sane and sensible point of view, but he would probably study more wisely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think the Deputy was mistaken in thinking that he would really have learned more at the Private Bill Committee than from a hundred books, because from the books he would have learned every side of the question and not merely the side dealt with by the experts.  If any boy at school had time to read a hundred books, it would be a <Col N="2527" /> very valuable increment to his education. I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In the discussion of this matter on Committee Stage, I was rather slow to accept an amendment of this kind, but my chief objections have been overcome, as Deputy Cooper suggested, by quoting those particular Acts, which ensure that we shall have a certain amount of supervisory authority or power over those libraries. Deputy Johnson has introduced the word &ldquo;exhibitions&rdquo; into the amendment. It is a word that might otherwise have frightened me.  Deputy Conlan referred to the fact, on Committee Stage, that a number of those libraries consisted mainly of light literature.  I might be very much afraid that those &ldquo;exhibitions&rdquo; would consist mainly of light exhibitions&mdash;boxing exhibitions, circuses and various exhibitions of that sort, with, perhaps, musical comedy added.</P>
      <P>With the provision I have alluded to, I can accept the amendment.  It may, however, be curtailed somewhat in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister is accepting the amendment.  The reference to &ldquo;exhibitions&rdquo; in connection with lectures and libraries explains itself fairly well.  As to the powers of the Minister in the matter, it was intended from the beginning to retain in his hands those powers.  Exhibitions may be most valuable in connection with lectures, as illustrating books.  One thing fits in with the other, and it is necessary to leave more than the mere lecture within the power of the committee. I am thankful to the Minister for accepting this amendment.  I am <Col N="2528" /> sure he will find that it will be very valuable and that it will be gladly availed of.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 53:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 26, before Section 57, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  If the council of any county, county borough or urban district are of opinion that there is a demand for allotments for the labouring population in their area, and that such allotments cannot be obtained at a reasonable rent and on reasonable conditions by voluntary arrangement between the owners of land suitable for such allotments and the applicants for them, the council may provide a sufficient number of allotments and shall let such allotments to persons belonging to the labouring population resident in their area and desiring to take them.</P>
      <P>(2)  The power of the council to provide allotments under this section shall not include the power to provide allotments exceeding one acre in extent.</P>
      <P>(3)  The council may, for the purpose of providing allotments, by agreement or otherwise purchase or take on lease land whether situate within or without their area, and may improve any land acquired by them, and adapt the same for letting in allotments as they think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  The rents of the allotments shall be fixed at an amount not less than such as may reasonably be expected to ensure the council from loss, but in calculating such loss any expenses incurred in an unsuccessful attempt to acquire land for allotments shall be excluded, and subject as aforesaid such rents may be from time to time charged as are reasonable having regard to the agricultural value of the land: Provided that if the Minister is satisfied that the rents are to be charged for any allotments if calculated in the manner aforesaid would be greater than the persons for whom the allotments <Col N="2529" /> are required could be reasonably expected to pay, and that the need for the provision of such allotments is urgent, he may authorise the council to fix and charge such lower rents as he may think expedient.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purpose of this section the provision of allotments shall be deemed to include the provision of land for common pasturage.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with a subject not brought forward on the last occasion with regard to the provision of allotments.  It is not the same as the last amendment, inasmuch as the last was mandatory and this is permissive. It allows the county council or a county borough council or an urban district council where they see a demand for allotments, and that such allotments cannot be obtained at a reasonable rent by voluntary arrangement with the owners of the land, to provide a sufficient number of allotments, letting them to persons belonging to the working-class population resident in their area and desiring to take them. The problem of the provision of allotments has been very insistent in some parts of the country during the past few months.  I have had from a number of towns representations regarding the closing down of arrangements that had been going on voluntarily for the past twelve months.  These arrangements were entered into owing to the cessation of the schemes that had been in force during the war.  Groups of men in different parts had continued the allotment scheme by entering into voluntary arrangement with the proprietors of land in their districts.</P>
    <P>Several cases of the kind around Dublin have been brought to my notice. Cases of the same kind from Limerick, Sligo and other towns have also been brought to my notice.  It is quite evident that there is a demand in many parts of the country for the provision of allotments, and that it is becoming difficult, owing to a variety of causes, for groups of workmen to make terms with the local landowners.  We have, for instance, cases in and around Dublin where cattle dealers are claiming the re-possession&mdash;shall I call it?&mdash;of their fields, which have hitherto, for some time, been used as allotment <Col N="2530" /> ground.  They say the fields are more valuable to them as accommodation land for cattle, and the result is that allotment holders are being deprived of their allotments.  Similar cases, not quite in the same position, where people want their land for grazing&mdash;grazing being possibly more profitable than food production&mdash;have been brought to my notice.  I think, as a matter of social importance, it is very desirable to encourage this allotment holding. The persons who desire to do this work are obviously of the type that ought to be encouraged.  They desire to spend their spare time in cultivating the soil and in growing vegetables for their homes.</P>
    <P>Occasionally, some of the produce from these allotments is sold, but in the main the allotments are utilised for the growing of potatoes and vegetables of different varieties for home consumption. Cases have been brought to my notice, and proof shown to me in full detail, where men who have been continuously unemployed for months have only been able to keep their families provided for by the fact that they had these allotments.  They have been able to feed their families and keep them from hunger by the fact that they had these allotments.  Some of them were fearful&mdash;I do not know how far the fear has been removed&mdash;that if their unemployment were to continue and they were to be deprived of their allotments they would not know how they would be able to provide for their families of six, seven or eight children in regard to food supplies.  The amendment proposes to give councils an optional but not a mandatory power with regard to these allotments.  I hope that the Minister will give friendly support to the amendment, and that with the support of the Dáil it shall be carried.</P>

      <P>An amendment almost in the same terms to this one was moved on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  My reasons for objecting to the amendment then were the same as at the present time.  I am in favour of allotments myself.  I believe that they are beneficial from the point of view of being a great help to struggling people in time of shortage like the present and <Col N="2531" /> because they develop a good civic and social spirit.  I am altogether in sympathy with the idea that prompted the moving of the amendment, but, as I mentioned before it could not be given effect to in this particular way.  The Minister for Agriculture had a Bill, with the drafting of which I had something to do, before him last year.  It was a Bill that ran into sixteen or seventeen sections, in addition to several schedules.  It is necessary to have a big and comprehensive Bill to deal with this matter, and for that reason alone it would be impossible to give effect to it by inserting it in a Bill in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter that the Minister for Agriculture has under his consideration. It does not fall within my bailiwick only in so far as every Bill can be dragged in under Local Government in one shape or another.  It was the intention of the Minister for Agriculture to bring in such a Bill, and I understand he would have brought it in only that at the time there seemed to be no demand for allotments all through the city.  The general tendency was to drop the allotments that were in being, and I understand that in many cases it was impossible to get the moderate rent charged for them.  For that reason the Minister did not consider it so urgent at the time, and legislation of a more pressing kind kept him from introducing it.  I am sure if Deputy Johnson <Col N="2532" /> brings to bear on the Minister for Agriculture the weight of his eloquence that probably he would be able to get him to bring in such a measure early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Talking about allotments, one would not say &ldquo;live horse and get grass,&rdquo; but one might say &ldquo;live horse and get carrots.&rdquo;  I think it would be very desirable if we could get this amendment inserted in the Bill. If it is faulty in any way there would be the more reason then for the Minister for Agriculture, under the stimulus of the Minister for Local Government, to bring in an amending Bill, or, rather, a more comprehensive Bill, or a section in a Bill to repeal this particular section in the Local Government Bill.  If, perchance, the Bill of the Minister for Agriculture were to get precedence over this, then it would be a simple matter to drop this section before it is completed.  I do not think, however, that the Minister has given any good reason why this amendment, giving the councils certain powers, is going to interfere with the work of his Department. There is no particular regulation required, and there is no very great responsibility thrown upon his Department. If it is going to accomplish the purpose which we are all agreed should be fulfilled, then let us introduce it and pass it into this Bill.  I ask the Dáil to agree with that view.</P>

      <P>There are several amendments here which have been agreed upon.  Amendment 54 is an amendment which I introduced at the request of Deputy Colohan, and the principle of it was agreed on in Committee. Amendment 55 is an amendment introduced by Deputy Colohan to which I am agreeing.  I think it was, in effect, agreed to by the House during the Committee Stage.  Amendment 56 is introduced to give effect to a point raised by Deputy Everett and which was agreed upon in Committee.  Amendment 59 is consequential on it.  The remaining two amendments are proposed by Deputy Heffernan, who is not here, but I agreed with the Deputy to give an altered version of one of these amendments, and it is the only one about which, I think, there will be any dispute.  If the Deputies agree, we could, therefore, take amendments 54, 55, 56 and 59 and pass them now by agreement and take the other amendments, Nos. 57 and 58, later.</P>
      <P>The following amendments, Nos. 54, 55, 56 and 59 were then put and agreed to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 29, before section 63, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for the council of any county to resolve that an annual sum be raised off such county and paid as a salary to the surgeon of the infirmary or infirmaries thereof under the provision of section 86 of the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836, as adapted by the Local Government (Adaptation of Irish Enactments) Order, 1899, without the consent of the Minister, and so much of the said section 86 as imposes a limit on the amount which may be so raised and paid shall cease to have effect.&mdash;Aire Rialtais Aitiúla agus  Puiblí.</P>
      <P>In page 30, before section 65, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If an officer of a rural district council holds more than one office under that council or jointly under that council and another local body, and is removed from the office from which he derives the greater part of <Col N="2534" /> his income in consequence of changes effected by or under this Act, he shall be entitled to relinquish all the said offices and to receive compensation on the same terms and conditions as if all his offices had been abolished.&rdquo;&mdash;Aodh O Culacháin.</P>
    <P>In page 31, Second Schedule, Rule 1, lines 14 and 15, to delete the words &ldquo;a chairman and nine others&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the word &ldquo;ten.&rdquo;&mdash;Aire Rialtais Aitiúla agus Sláinte Puiblí.</P>
    <P>In page 32, Second Schedule, to delete Rules 9 and 10 and substitute three new rules as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;9.  The first meeting of a board of health after its election shall be an annual meeting, and an annual meeting shall be held in each subsequent year within one month after the anniversary of such election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;10.  At every annual meeting of a board of health the board shall elect a chairman, and may elect a vice-chairman, from amongst its members, who shall hold office until after the next annual meeting of the board.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;11.  At every meeting of a board of health the chairman, if present, shall be chairman of the meeting.  If the chairman is absent the vice-chairman shall be chairman of the meeting. If the chairman is absent and either no vice-chairman has been elected, or the vice-chairman is absent, such member of the board as the members then present shall choose shall be chairman of the meeting.&rdquo;&mdash;Aire Rialtais Aitiúla agus Sláinte Puiblí.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Heffernan, I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 31, Second Schedule, to add at the end of Rule 1, the words &ldquo;and such election shall take place in accordance with the principles of proportional representation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment speaks very well for itself.  Its object is to endeavour to put into operation the principle of proportional representation in connection with the election on the county board of <Col N="2535" /> health of members of the county council so as to give every party in the county council elected by the people an opportunity for getting their due representation on the board of health.  As proportional representation has been accepted in practically every phase of our representative life I see no reason why it should be refused in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to the amendment in an altered form, if Deputy Heffernan would accept it.  It gives effect to proportional representation as regards area but not as regards party. I was not able to combine the two, and Deputy Heffernan agreed that it was better to have area representation than party representation.</P>

    <P>So long as the continuance of the concessions, allowances, and advantages, including special proportions in division of receipts from through passenger and perishable or other traffic passing to, from, or over the railways belonging to, leased, or worked by the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company or any part thereof, hitherto allowed or granted to the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company by the London Midland and Scottish Railway Company is provided for by agreement binding on the Amalgamated <Col N="2536" /> Company and the London Midland and Scottish Railway Company, the London Midland and Scottish Railway Company shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Railways Act, 1924, or in any amalgamation scheme thereunder, be entitled to nominate a director of the amalgamated company who shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the directors or any of them to be appointed under the provisions of the Railway Act, 1924.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In line 2, page 3, after the word &lsquo;Company&rsquo; to insert the words &lsquo;as set out in the Schedule to this Act.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill refers in the Preamble to certain concessions that were granted by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway to the Dublin and South-Eastern Company, and to an agreement which had been entered into between the London, Midland and Scottish and the Great Southern Railway in respect of concessions of a similar kind, but there is nothing in the Bill to show us what the agreement is, only that it is to ensure the same kind of concessions, allowances and advantages as have hitherto been allowed by the London, Midland and Scottish and the Dublin and South Eastern.  The amendment is to insert some words to ensure that the agreement should give some details of the concessions, allowances and advantages, so that the Dáil would know what was the worth of these concessions, or what the new company was to be bound to receive, and what the London, Midland and Scottish were bound to give in exchange for the right to appoint a director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that he would make public the terms of the agreement, or, to be more correct, that he believed the terms of the agreement would be made public.  An agreement has been circulated to Deputies.  The meaning of it, I am sure, is clear enough to the two companies concerned, but I doubt whether any single Deputy, outside Deputy Davin and the Minister, knows anything about the agreement, notwithstanding the fact that it has been placed in our hands. <Col N="2537" /> We have not been informed what these concessions, allowances and advantages are, and I think the Dáil is as much in the dark, having this agreement before it, as it was before it was circulated.</P>
    <P>The non-publication of the terms of the concessions, allowances and advantages actually given by one company to the other simply means that we are asked to pass this Bill in the dark.  It is assumed, provided it is quite satisfactory, and that the two companies agree that it should be quite sufficient for us as a legislative chamber, and to say, &ldquo;You two companies having agreed on a certain thing, then we are bound in all reason, considering who we are in comparison with these two great companies, to confirm, ratify and implement the agreement they have entered into without any disclosure of its terms.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I had anticipated when putting down this amendment that the Minister would have disclosed the details of these concessions so that we could weigh them and examine them.  By accepting this amendment, it will be made imperative that we should have as a schedule the actual terms, value and description of the concessions, allowances and advantages that are referred to in the Preamble.  This is with a view to having that complete disclosure and to have on record in the Act, which it is proposed to pass, what the agreement actually involves.  Therefore, I move the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I share very much Deputy Johnson's opinion with regard to this agreement.  I doubt that we are going to get very much more information with regard to it than we have here.  The whole matter suggests to me that there is more behind this movement to put a director of the L.M. and S. on our Irish board than we know anything about.  We know that there is to be a director on our board of a company that has done everything it possibly can to prevent and obstruct the amalgamation of our railways.  That should raise serious questionings in our minds as to what exactly we are doing.  I do not know that the passing of this amendment is going to do any good, or if we can get any further details than we have got. <Col N="2538" /> The whole matter is very unsatisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want Deputy Davin to be under a misapprehension. I was not referring to any figure. I simply thought he knew what the agreement was, by virtue of his general experience and knowledge, because it refers to present routes and arrangements for the interchange of traffic between the London, Midland and Scottish and the Dublin and South Eastern section of the amalgamated company; the existing modes of division and the terms upon which the use of the Westland Row Station is made by the London, Midland and Scottish Company; and that these shall remain in force. I assumed&mdash;perhaps quite wrongly&mdash; that that technical phraseology was understood by those having a knowledge of technical phraseology in railway circles, but was not understood by the ordinary Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might plead a certain amount of knowledge.  I understand what is meant by routes and interchange of traffic, but if I were asked to prove to the Dáil that this agreement is what it pretends to be, I would have to ask Deputy Johnson to summon before the Bar of the House the railway-rates experts and chartered accountants who have checked, I believe, and gone into this agreement, for expert knowledge of its full meaning. I do not propose to go into that aspect.  I think the Deputy has thrown upon me unconsciously a responsibility I am not prepared to shoulder.  I do not intend to explain the technical phraseology of the words in the agreement, which I think should be understood by anybody capable of interpreting ordinary legal phraseology, as it is put into any ordinary Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson places me in the position of the person who being blind, was <Col N="2539" /> searching with an unlighted candle, in a dark room for a black cat which was not there; and putting me in that position he seeks to put the black cat there. An agreement, which is absolutely incomprehensible to him, and which he believes will not be comprehensible to anybody, save only Deputy Davin and myself, is to be put in as a Schedule, and Deputy Johnson will then wash his hands of the Bill and believe that it is properly amended.  Deputy Mulcahy gave him the counter in that, and said that the agreement will not make any difference; and that the agreement, being of a particular type, shows there is something more behind it.</P>
      <P>We must view this in a proper light. Certain concessions as described in the Preamble have been considered by the Railway Tribunal.  The Tribunal have set on these a certain value, and, in consideration of that value, have granted a certain exchange value of stock in the amalgamation scheme. It is provided that these be continued. Now, the experts in the matter&mdash;the Railway Tribunal, the people whom we set up to judge in this matter&mdash;have decided that these things are worth a certain amount; that worth being shown in the value of stock given.  This Bill, in its Preamble, sets out that, whereas these concessions used to be given, and whereas an agreement has been entered into in this form for their continuance, in consideration of that a director shall be granted. Whether, therefore, I say it is £20,000 or £19,000&mdash;and it may turn out to be £25,000 or £17,000&mdash;if I gave the most explicit assurance that I had looked into this and judged it and could give my word that it was worth so much, that would not be worth anything. The people who have been set up to judge in this matter are the railway tribunal.  They have passed judgment. They believe that an agreement of this sort is value for a certain amount of money, which they have translated in terms of stock.</P>

      <P>When other Bills are brought in giving other directors <Col N="2540" /> we will find out.  This is dealing with one director on foot of one agreement. I am trying to deal with one amendment. The amendment is set out in a schedule to the agreement.  I want to call the Deputy's attention to the place where he intends to put this.  If it is going to be put in at all, I think it should come in the fourth line rather than the second.  If it is to be put in at all, I would urge, for a reason I am going to indicate, that if this schedule is required&mdash;I think it is entirely unnecessary&mdash;or if it comes in properly,. it comes in in the Preamble in line 31&mdash;&ldquo;Whereas, an agreement, as set out in the schedule to this Act, for that purpose has been, etc.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to call the attention of the Deputy to the fact that Clause 2 does not say in the second line &ldquo;provided for by the agreement,&rdquo; but &ldquo;by agreement&rdquo;; that so long as the continuance is provided for &ldquo;by agreement,&rdquo; a better agreement may be made.  The Deputy may answer that a worse agreement may be made, but the directorate of the company will be there to see that no worse bargain is struck.  A better bargain might be struck.  The continuance, as set out in the first clause here, is not a continuance as provided for by this agreement.  It is, so long as the continuance of these concessions is provided for &ldquo;by agreement.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt unnecessarily.  There is a misunderstanding in my mind, or in his.

      <P>That comes back to another point, that the Deputy deliberately prefers to have the words as set out in the Schedule inserted in line 2 and not line 4.  That makes a difference, I think.  If the Deputy puts his amendment where he proposes to put it, it is so long as the concessions hitherto allowed are granted, as set out in the Schedule.  If he changes it, as I propose, and as I think he intended&mdash;I may have been mistaken in that; I seem to have been mistaken&mdash;it would be so long as the continuance is provided for by agreement binding as set out in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson wants, first of all, some information to show the nature of the concessions, and then he wants sufficient information to enable himself and members of the Dáil to check the figures upon which the present fixed value of the concessions was arrived at.  In other words, he wants to put before Deputies the number of passengers that travel between Gorey and Timbuctoo via the North Wall, via Dun Laoghaire; merchandise, perishable traffic, and all other kind of figures that would enable him to check them minutely.  I can tell Deputies that if they want that information they would want what is more important, sufficient time to check it, and they would want to have a good deal more time than is allowed between now and the adjournment for the Christmas holidays.  Even if Deputies had the figures, I am quite certain, from my experience of the administrative side of the railways concerned, they could not convince themselves that the figures are right, unless they had experts and chartered accountants with railway experience to explain them in detail.  Does Deputy Johnson want the figures in detail?  I might be able to go into it at some length, but in my opinion no one in the Dáil, not even the Minister, could prove that the value of the concessions, as assessed by the Tribunal, and chartered accountants, is the figure mentioned by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I am unable to explain my meaning in this <Col N="2544" /> matter.  We are referred to the letter from Mr. H.G. Burgess, of the London Midland and Scottish, to the Dublin and South Eastern Railway.  In that letter there are references to the existing modes of division, and the terms on which the use of Westland Row Station is made by the London, Midland and Scottish Company.  I take it, an accountant or someone has given guidance of some kind as to how they are to make the division.</P>
      <P>They are given some terms of reference, shall I say, as to whether it is a greater or lesser proportion.  Surely, it is possible to put down in language that the layman can understand apart from figures what the purpose of the agreement is.  Is it to give a lesser or a greater sum than would exist if there was no agreement?  Surely there must be an agreement whether in writing or not, or an understanding whether the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company are to get anything which can be measured in terms of cash.  That can be defined without going into the figures, and I submit that we are hopelessly left in the dark unless we get some information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The concessions set out in the Preamble.  It is all very well to get disgusted, and to say there is nothing before us, that apparently this is an attempt to gloss over in vague language something that cannot be disclosed.  That is the actual terminology used in this agreement, and on foot of that agreement the Railway Tribunal were able to find out what those concessions were and to put a certain value upon them.  That value has been indicated and stereotyped in the figures they had before them, and on foot of the total calculations of it they made their exchange of stock. There is a definite value which has been <Col N="2545" /> arrived at, but to arrive at that value and to put into the Schedule all the things of which it is composed, would mean putting into the Schedule all the traffic returns for a sufficiently long period of years to enable one to strike a general average as to what they are worth per annum, and that is an impossible task.  You could not schedule those things.</P>
      <P>Those concessions have a value.  The continuance of that value is agreed upon, and in consideration of the continuance of that a director is to be given.  The agreement has been entered into, and that is the agreement. It is not fair to say that this is acting in the dark.  It is no more acting in the dark than to say to the Railway Tribunal that they have a right in the year we are coming into to fix rates on a certain basis without scheduling what those rates were to be between every station.  It would be quite as sound to ask in the Railways Act that there should be a schedule setting out all the points between which traffic should pass, and that they could then base their view on what the new rates and charges are to be.  It is quite as reasonable to ask that to be put in the Railways Act as here.</P>

      <P>Only one thing might be said as to the necessity for this concession. The London, Midland and Scottish gave those concessions to the Dublin and South Eastern Company in the past.  They have agreed to give them to the amalgamated company in the future for the sole purpose of inducing traffic to come through the port of Dublin instead of other ports.  It is competition from which the port of Dublin derives advantage as well as the trader who pays a lower rate.  The concessions are given in order to increase traffic and induce it to go through the port of Dublin as well as through other ports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting discussion, but I fail to see what particular bearing it has on the legislation. This House, in its wisdom, or <Col N="2546" /> otherwise, passed a Bill to amalgamate the railways, and in doing so, it put up its best fight for directorates and such like conditions as between the companies.  Then the Government would step in to dictate the terms on which each railway was to be amalgamated in the general amalgamation scheme.  I respectfully suggest to the House that the terms on which the companies come to agreement amongst themselves are not matters for this House at all.  The Dublin and South Eastern Railway, in negotiation with the amalgamated railways, put up a claim that the value of their stock was so much.  An agreement was not immediately reached, and the bone of contention between the two bodies was an agreement entered into between the Dublin and South Eastern Railway and the London, Midland and Scottish, by which the latter benefited to a certain extent, getting a director on the Board of the amalgamated company.</P>
      <P>It certainly is a question for this Dáil, in connection with this Bill, to authorise that a director nominated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway should get a seat on the Board, but I submit respectfully to the House, that the question of the terms as between the two railways is a matter for the procedure laid down.  In other words, although the tribunal here is working, it is not working on an arbitrary basis, but in furtherance of an agreement voluntarily come to between the companies. As regards the value of the concession given to the London, Midland and Scottish, originally to the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company, that is not for us at all, because this House will not be called on to bear the burden.  It is the amalgamated company, and if they make a bad bargain, the amalgamated company will suffer.  It is a private agreement between the two companies, and all the Dáil is concerned with is not the £20,000, or whatever sum may be placed on the service, but the question of the director, whatever the consideration may be.</P>

We understood that as a result of this agreement a certain value of stock is being given to the Dublin and South Eastern shareholders.  Now, we are concerned with the agreement in this particular Bill.  If the position is that after a year or two years' working and with more information at our disposal as to the effect of having an outside director on the amalgamated board of the railways, and more information as to the financial side of this question, the Dáil reviews the matter and considers that from the point of view of this country, it is wrong to have an arrangement as regards this particular directorate, and if it withdraws the rights that it is proposed to give under this Act, what is going to be the position of the value of the stock transferred to the present Dublin and South Eastern shareholders?</P>

      <P>It is quite impossible for me to believe that a gentleman can be acting for a company which is not yet in being.  At any rate, the amendment goes on the assumption that some officials are still to be appointed. If the director nominated likes to absent himself no further officials can be appointed because he is not there, according to this amendment. It would mear putting a tremendous power into the hands of this director, to whose appointment some people object, because it would be giving him power to stop any other officials being appointed if he was simply absent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, if I may be permitted, alter this to the Preamble, paragraph (2).  I want to submit to the Committee that if there is any question of altering the agreement as between either of the companies, and the question arises within the board of the new company, and there is a difference of opinion as to whether it is desirable that any such agreement should continue, then that director ought not to have a voice which may be the deciding voice in that decision.  I am, of course, assuming that the railway company, the British railway company, the London, Midland and Scottish&mdash;is for persuading the Irish company against its better judgment by virtue of certain threats to oblige the company to accept its directors.  If there is any question of policy which may involve difference between the directorate and between the companies, then this particular director <Col N="2550" /> may have the deciding voice, and ought not so to have.  I think it is important that the power of the director should be limited in this respect, and that he should not have powers that might be exercised by any directors, such other directors having been appointed on the board because of other qualifications.</P>
      <P>The Minister, at an earlier stage in the discussion on this Bill, said that the director was not being appointed on the same basis or for the same qualifications as had obtained with respect to the Dublin South Eastern directorship. In that case, the Dublin South Eastern appears to have allowed a director of the London, Midland and Scottish Company on its Board by virtue of certain stockholdings.  Now, it appears that the process of thought has not been quite as the Minister indicated in the early stages, has not been quite that certain concessions of value were to be given to the new company, and by virtue of those concessions, year by year, they were to be allowed a director. These concessions have been valued and capitalised.  The new company's capital is increased accordingly and, presumably, the contention is: &ldquo;We have provided this new capital by our concession; it is the value of our concession that has increased the capital of the new company, and therefore, we are stock-holders in that new company to that extent, and that is ensuring us a right to a director.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That appears to be the course of reasoning now, which is very much like the proposition that the Minister was inclined to frown upon when we were discussing the Railways Bill originally. He would not consent to give a directorship because of stock-holding without election, but now he is prepared to support the position that concessions are worth stock, stock is worth a directorship. That is now the position that the Minister has taken, and it is rather an illuminating point to see the kind of pressure that the Ministry has succumbed to, when they have in fact succumbed to pressure from the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.  In any event, this amendment would limit to some extent, possibly, shall I say, the power of the London, Midland and <Col N="2551" /> Scottish Railway, whom the director will represent when any question is involved as between the two companies in the matter of the continuation of these considerations.  I therefore move the amendment in my name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very difficult point.  I am put in a very awkward position.  The Seanad is meeting to-morrow at my special request to deal with the Unemployment Insurance Bill, and I impressed on them the necessity to meet for that purpose, hoping that they would not have to be called back again later in the week to discuss this Bill.  I have to offer an explanation to them.  I will take this Bill the first thing to-morrow.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether an application had been received for compensation or pension for Mrs. L. Keighrey, Brackernagh, Ballinasloe, Co. Galway, on account of the loss of her son killed in action in August, 1922, at Patrickswell, while serving with the National Army, and, if so, if he will state what steps have been taken towards granting such compensation or pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. Keighrey's claim under the Army Pensions Act, 1923; was received and investigated.  It was ascertained that at the date of her son's death she was neither wholly nor partially dependent upon him.  Her claim could not therefore be allowed.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Third Schedule to the Act.</P>
