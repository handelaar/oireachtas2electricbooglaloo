      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that compensation amounting to £50 has been awarded to the parents of William Hegarty, Ballymackeera, Macroom, Co. Cork, who was killed by R.I.C. on September 5th, 1920; that this amount is considered inadequate by his parents, in view of the fact that they were dependent on him, and whether he will have the case reconsidered with a view to increasing the award.</P>

      <P>The claim of John <Col N="990" /> Hegarty, of Ballymakeera, Macroom, Co. Cork, for compensation in respect of the death of his son, William, was investigated by the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee, who formed the conclusion that the applicant was not dependent upon his son. The <i>ex-gratia</i> grant of £50 which has been paid was intended to cover any out-of-pocket expenses.  In addition, sums amounting to £100 were paid by the Irish White Cross.  I agree with the Committee's finding, and I am not disposed to refer back the claim for reconsideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that great dissatisfaction prevails regarding the inadequacy of the compensation awarded to relatives of members of the National Army who died during the recent hostilitites, either in action or from injuries received in the campaign, and whether, considering the small number involved, it would not be advisable to reconsider these awards with a view to a more adequate scale being fixed.</P>

      <P>I am aware that certain awards made under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, are considered inadequate. The provisions of that Act have therefore been reviewed in the light of the experience gained during its administration.  As a result, I hope very shortly to ask leave for the introduction of an Amending Bill.  Its proposals, if enacted, will make the Deputy's suggestion a practicable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The consideration of applications from ex-officers for supplementary grants has, in some cases, been prolonged owing to the fact that persons mentioned by applicants as references in support of claims to pre-Truce service, have delayed or failed to furnish certain required particulars.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer which I gave Deputy O Cúlacháin on the 8th July last, to a similar question.  The Minister for Defence had paid contributions for the members of the Railway Protection, Repair and Maintenance Corps, so far as these can be identified, whose occupation before joining the Corps was insurable occupation, and unemployment benefit has been paid, or is payable, to the persons for whom such contributions have been paid.  If the Deputy will let me have particulars of any cases in which it is alleged that benefit due is not being paid, I will have immediate inquiries made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case would not the Army authorities be supposed to stamp their cards for the full period of service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that is what was done, although not by the procedure to which the Deputy alludes.  Cards were not stamped week by week, but a sum equal to the deductions was credited to these people, and for that credit contribution is now being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the deduction made each week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite <Col N="995" /> clear whether it was made in every case each week, but it was made to get at the week by week deduction, and in the total result credit had been given to those people for the deductions made whether week by week or in a lump sum, and benefit is now being paid to those to whom benefit is payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister know it is illegal to stop more than one contribution at the time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say the Minister for Defence did anything illegal, but I do want to say that there may have been certain matters allowed for a few weeks to go unrecognised during the disturbed period, but leaving out any technical irregularity there may have been, no one has been prejudiced by the fact that the moneys deducted week by week were not evidenced by stamps affixed week by week.  If there was a lapse now and again it has been made up in the long run, and the contributions have been credited to all those people who were insurable, and benefit will be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that leave out certain people who were not insured prior to joining this corps?  Once you employ them upon this particular occupation does not that make them insurable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>No; a distinction has to be made in this.  People, for the purposes of the 1924 Unemployment Insurance Act, are recognised as being insurance to the extent of having further stamps credited to them, if at any time they had twenty stamps to their credit or ten stamps before a particualr date.  Anyone can come in under that.  That was the test of insurable occupation.  Certain people joined this corps who were railway employees and were definitely in insurable occupations.  Apart from the other slight test put up they more than stood the test.  Deductions were made from these people either week by week or in a way that corresponded to week to week deductions, and these people <Col N="996" /> gain benefit more than the people who pass the slight test of the ten stamps before a certain date, or the twenty stamps at a given period.  They will get more benefit, because deductions would have been made for the weeks they were in the Army in what is regarded as insurable occupation.  But persons who joined the Railway Corps without being in insurable occupations previously shall not, by that fact, be admitted as being in an insurable occupation.</P>

      <P>I propose at the adjournment this evening to move that the Dáil shall reassemble on Tuesday week, 18th November.  As to the items on the Order Paper, we propose to take No. 2&mdash;County Courts Appeal Bill&mdash; first, No. 3&mdash;Housing (Building Facilities) (Amendment) Bill&mdash;second, No. 4&mdash;Live Stock Breeding Bill&mdash;third, and Local Government Bill fourth. But I have to ask for leave to allow Deputy Hogan to raise, at half-past three, the question of which he gave notice yesterday.

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that the Dáil on rising to-day shall adjourn to Tuesday, 18 November. The reasons for it are two-fold.  In the first place, there-are five elections, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to attend here and take part in these elections.  They constitute what may be called a miniature General Election.  These elections are of considerable importance.  The ordinary business of the various Departments occupies a very considerable length of time.  Some Ministers have been unable to get away at all during the recess, and there are Bills which have not yet been introduced which require very careful consideration.  During the Recess some Ministers were away in Geneva, and it was not possible to get consideration of measures which are of considerable importance and which have been promised.  In the circumstances I think I am justified in asking the House to interrupt the ordinary course of the Session by one week, and I accordingly move this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President might have gone on and said there were twenty-five other reasons why the adjournment should be for a further week. Having stated the first, I suggest to the House that that is the reason why the President desires the Dáil should adjourn over next week.  There are matters before us that are urgent, for instance, the Local Government Bill. When the question arose a fortnight ago of re-introducing the Bill with the amendments, a promise was given that no obstruction to the Second Reading of the new Bill by any prolonged debate would be made because of its urgency. Now we are right into the middle of the discussion on that Bill, and I submit that there is no satisfactory reason why we should not proceed with the discussion next week.  In addition to that, we have notices on the Order Paper to the effect that other Committees will be sitting&mdash; a Joint Committee on the Liffey Electricity <Col N="1001" /> Bill, the Committee on Public Accounts, and there will be other Committees, I have no doubt.  When these very important Committees will be sitting they will require the attendance of Deputies here in any case, but to comne right to the Kernel of this matter I want to submit to the House that it is raising a matter of very considerable constitutional importance.  It has been a subject of complaint more than once that the Ministry and the Dáil are considered as, in the one case, the executive of a political party, and in the other case as an adjunct, that is to say, the Dáil is a mere adjunct to a ratifying body of the decisions of a political party.  Because elections for members to fill vacancies in the Dáil are taking place in country, the Ministry which is not responsible as a Ministry to a Party but to the Dáil as a whole, comes forward and suggests that the Dáil should suspend its business to allow the members of one political party to conduct propaganda in the country.  No matter how important elections may be for the fortunes of that party, it is putting the matter of bye-elections into a position superior to the interests and the business of the Dáil, because the fortunes of one party in the Dáil are at stake.  I think that is evidence of failure to appreciate the position that the Dáil should hold in the country and in the institutions of Government.  The Ministry should not, I submit, ask the Dáil to suspend its business over a period, simply for the purpose of allowing members of the party which supports the Government to go into the country to conduct an electoral campaign.  If that is necessary there should be a dissolution.  There is no occasion for anything of the kind, and I say that the business of the Dáil, the prestige of the Dáil and the dignity of the Dáil are of more importance than that a party in the country should have support in the conduct of its bye-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the matter is of very great importance. , It is setting a headline for successive Governments.  It is not wise to invite future Governments to allow the business for the Dáil to be subordinated to the interests of the <Col N="1002" /> party which happens for the time being to be supporting the Government. I therefore urge very earnestly that the Dáil should not allow its sittings to be suspended in this way for this purpose.  If there are contentious metters which require a full attendance of the Government party, let the least contentious matters be brought forward.  A break now of a week will mean a prolongation of this portion of the session into close upon Christmas. Possibly, it may mean that the desires of the Minister for Local Government which already have been supported in the Dáil will be frustrated. , That may be a good thing or a bad thing from my point of view, but that is not the matter.  The Dáil has definitely supported the Minister in his contentions and in his desires, but the Dáils wishes in that matter are running the risk of being frustrated to suit the convenience of a political party.  I think that is placing the Dáil in a position of subordination to the interest of a party in the country, and I think that is very undesirable.  I move, therefore, as an amendment, that on the adjournment to-day we adjourn to Tuesday afternoon.</P>

If this were a normal <Col N="1003" /> country, and we were living under normal conditions, I should object very much to such a proposition being brought forward as is being brought forward by the President, because it will involve us sitting on into July and August.  But is is not a normal country&mdash;</P>

      <P>And every party has not taken its palce in the Dáil.  I hope to see the day when every party in the State will come into the Dáil. At present there is one party, perhaps I should say there are two parties, who have withdrawn themselves from the Dáil.  These parties have an absolutely free hand for propaganda.  They do not have to come down here, listen to the debates, and vote, and if the Government is to be given rudimentary fair play they ought to have some opportunity of meeting this propaganda. While they are tied to their offices in the Dáil they cannot do that.  It makes for better public education to have Minister going down to the country and talking to the people.  I only wish that they did more of it; I only wish that it would not take a bye-election to drag them on to the platform.  But this will facilitate them in facing the country and explaining the several issues, what has been done and what is to be done, to the people of the country.  I shall support the President's Motion, only I think he would have made it stronger if he had given us some idea of what work we have before us in the four weeks prior to Christmas.  Are there many new Bills to be introduced?  Are we to take up, for instance, the detailed consideration of the Defence Forces Bill, which must become law before the end of March?</P>

      <P>We have had six months in which we have been fairly busy, as I have explained.  I quite admit that this is a cause of complaint, but I do say that it is a cause of complaint which may be answered.  We are in the position of having to bow before other parties who have had better luck than we in the matter of not losing any of their members.  The Local Government Bill will not be interrupted in its passage by reason of this week.  It will be possible to have it passed into law before the end of the year.  It is not really a question of the fortunes of a party; it is more a questions for the State.  For many months, ever since the last General Election, every possible mode of propaganda has been used, not so much against the political parties that are represented here, as really against the State.  People are issuing untrue statements concerning the work of the Dáil. To that extent it is a responsibility of <Col N="1005" /> the Government and of the Dáil and that the real issue, and the real circumstances, should be placed before the people.  It is not possible to do that and to continue to work here.  With regard to the Local Government Bill, I must say for my own part, that I have <Col N="1006" /> not had the time to examine that measure in the manner that I think was its due, and it was owing to the pressure of business that that was the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. BURKE Mr. BURKE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Housing (Building Facilities) (Amendment) Bill, 1924, be received for final consideration.&rdquo;  On the Committee Stage of this Bill, I think that Deputy Good asked a question in regard to our policy concerning the floor area of houses.  Under the principal Act we have practically no control with regard to deciding whether the houses should be five, four, or three-roomed houses. All the houses were constructed by <Col N="1007" /> private builders.  In this Bill we will have a certain amount of control, in so far as the houses will be constructed by local authorities.  Heretofore there was a tendency in my Department, which I think was a world-wide one after the war, to try and secure a very high standard of houses.  That was responsible for the tendency to insist on the building of three, four, or five-roomed houses.  Subsequent events, the difficulties of erecting houses, and the very serious state of affairs that has arisen as a result of the lack of houses, have made us change our attitutde more or less in regard to that.  At present we have no objection to building three-roomed houses, and if the local authorities under this Bill wish to construct three-roomed houses we will have no objection.  Deputy Good also required information as to the number of houses that were erected under the principal Act.  Here is a list to date. The number of three-roomed houses which have been built is 50, the number of four-roomed is 399, and the number of five-roomed is 977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which the Minister has given us reveals exactly what I was afraid was happening. He tells us that 977 five-roomed houses have been erected, as compared with only 50 three-roomed houses. When we were discussing the original Bill an anxiety was expressed, in fact, I think the view was generally expressed through the Dáil, that the policy should be, and I think the President agreed, to encourage the building of three-roomed houses, so that we might get the largest number of houses possible erected with the limited means at our disposal.  Now, what has happened?  Under the Bill the five-roomed house gets practically double the financial assistance given to the three-roomed house&mdash;£100 as against £60&mdash;consequently we only get half the number of the larger-sized houses. That is unfortunate, particularly from the point of view of what is happening with regard to sub-letting these houses. The President pointed out the other day that people were sub-letting rooms in those houses and were living rent free. <Col N="1008" /> That we should give State subsidies to that sort of thing is very undesirable, and I would like to see, in view of these figures which have just been given, a firm stand taken by the Government to stop this scandal of sub-letting.  What is happening is this, that instead of improving the housing situation by the erection of new houses, we are practically moving in the opposite direction, because, owing to sub-letting, the number of occupants in some of these new houses is almost appalling.  I was told the other day that in one new house of a comparatively small size there are twenty-seven children belonging to the different families lodging there.  That is bringing about even a worse condition of things than we had before, bad as the old regime was.</P>
      <P>I would ask the President, in view of these facts, of which he is fully aware, to take some steps towards encouraging the erection of three-roomed houses and I will not say towards actually stopping the erection of the larger houses, but as far as possible, not to encourage their erection.  The Minister has told us, as some of us knew already, that in his Department there was a desire up to a recent period to encourage the erection of the larger-sized houses.  I hope both the Minister and his Department have seen the error of their ways from the unfortunate results that have accrued from their policy.  I trust that their efforts will now be entirely in the other direction.</P>
      <P>I would ask the President who, as we all know, takes a particularly deep interest in the housing question, in view of the positively alarming figures which have been given by the Minister for Local Government, to have something done to turn the movement regarding the building of houses in the other direction, and in that way we would be doing work of national importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is given in the Act.  It is stated there what the prices are that the houses can be sold for.  I explained on another occasion that it is rather difficult to get at the mean size of a house which, if reduced, is expensive, and if increased is also expensive.  Deputy Good knows better than anybody else what I mean. The figures given by the Minister are instructive&mdash;50 three - roomed, 399 four-roomed, and 977 five-roomed houses.  I do not think it would be a good plan for the Ministry as a policy to favour the erection of three-roomed houses in large numbers, as such houses will accommodate only families in which there would be only boys or only girls.  The churches are, I think, very insistent on four-roomed houses. It would be a matter though for serious consideration by the Minister, when introducing next year another Housing Bill, as to whether he might not vary the sums given for the three-roomed, four-roomed, and five-roomed houses, so as to meet in some way the case put up by Deputy Good.  That is the only way it can be done satisfactorily. Deputy Good's real case is that the new houses are actually becoming slums.  Examination will show that we are not keeping pace in the construction of new houses with the deterioration of the old houses.  That is really the problem.  I think the Deputy himself, in a pamphlet issued some time ago, gives the cause, which is that the number of people engaged in the building trade is being gradually reduced, that is the number of bricklayers and other operatives is, unfortunately, on the decrease; and at the same time the number of houses going into decay is increasing.  We are coming to a point where we will require to experiment with some quicker method of building houses, and of meeting not only the increased demand for houses, but the demands of those who have to leave houses by reason of deterioration or insanitary conditions.  A satisfactory feature about the Act is that 1,400 houses have been built, or are in course of erection, although the amount given towards their erection by no means compares with the huge sums given <Col N="1010" /> under the million pounds housing grant.  We are getting towards this condition which Deputy Johnson says we will never reach&mdash;a more or less normal condition.  The local authorities in two years have put up something like 2,000 houses.  There will be criticism of the Department with regard to the delay in these proceedings, but I think the Department is thoroughly justified in seeing that the expenditure of such huge sums of public money should be justified.  In some of the cases there is no justification for the class of scheme put up. One thing is evident on the figures mentioned by the Minister, and that is that there is apparently a considerable number of people who have got this £100 to build a five-roomed house. Ordinarily, one would be inclined to say that if you can pay £400 for a house, at a pinch you might pay £500. It would be interesting to examine how many three-roomed houses had been constructed by private individuals in the preceding twelve months. I do not suppose they would amount to 77.  One might say that without this subsidy one thousand houses would not have been erected.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Dáil to pass the Final Stage of this Bill to-day.  Local authorities have been pressing for it for a long time.  It is unreasonable, I know, to ask this, particularly as permission has been refused in reference to another Bill, but if it were passed to-day it might be possible to get the Seanad to meet next week to pass the Bill finally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not much enamoured of three-roomed houses.  I do not think that the provision of them would really be the help it appears on the surface.  Only within the last ten or fifteen years have three-roomed houses even come to be provided in considerable numbers. When I was a member of the Dublin Corporation I remember a case being made for the provision of two-roomed houses for old men or old women.  The children are the principal consideration now, and my view is that while the Ministry might not stand in the way of the provision of three-roomed houses, they ought certainly aim at the construction <Col N="1011" /> of houses of not less than four rooms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call the attention of the President and the Minister for Local Government to an indication which was given, that they would consider the question of allowing this grant to be applied to the reconstruction of houses in rural districts. This is a matter which I brought up when the original Bill was introduced. I also sent in an amendment dealing with the matter for this Bill, but the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order. It is, I think, a very debatable matter whether it was out of order, but I submit to his ruling.  I think that the President has not given the matter full consideration. If he did, I think he would realise the necessity in the rural districts for a grant for reconstruction of houses.  The Minister's mind has been taken up largely with the conditions which exist in the cities&mdash;with the slums.  I approve of his ideas in that respect.  But the fact remains that houses to relieve the slum populations are not being built.  The greater number of the houses being built are five-roomed houses.  We also find that grants are being given to such men as civil servants to build houses.</P>
      <P>I never could understand why grants were not allowed to be given for the re-construction of houses in the rural districts. In many rural districts there are conditions existing in regard to housing, which amount almost to slum conditions.  I know cases of farmers whose families are sleeping in barns. Deputies who are conversant with the conditions existing in the rural districts, must know that far the greater part of the building which is done in connection with farmhouses is of a reconstructive nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have been approached over and over again with regard to this matter, and I believe if the grant were extended to the rural districts, it would be very largely availed of.  I know it cannot be done in this Bill now.  The President, however, has promised that a new Bill will be brought in next year, and I would be satisfied if he would give a promise <Col N="1012" /> that in that Bill the reconstruction provisions will apply to rural districts.</P>

      <P>A point raised by Deputy Good seems to me to require some explanation.  I understood him to say that a number of the houses built under the Housing Act of this year are not being occupied by the persons for whom they were built, but are being sub-let at a much higher rent than is provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy's case was that a good many houses which had been built by local authorities with the aid of Government money, had been sub-let.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly that was the alternative interpretation.  Under the principal Act there was intended to be a prohibition against charging more than a certain weekly rent.  On reading it now, I am a little doubtful whether the Act effectively prohibits sub-letting.</P>

We realised that to prove excessive rent-charging in the case of sub-letting, was absolutely impossible.</P>

      <P>I do not very often find myself in agreement with Deputy Good on the housing question.  I am <Col N="1013" /> afraid I must disagree with him again on the matter of the three-roomed house.  It is obvious from the figures read out by the Minister that the people who can afford to build houses at all are not the class of people that will build three-roomed houses.  A person who would live in a three-roomed house cannot find as much money, even with the subsidy, as would build a three-roomed house.  People who have £300 or £400 want a better class of house, and, with the subsidy, will be able to get it.  As far as three-roomed houses are concerned, a very large number of those houses would not, in my opinion, be good for the future of the country.  In order to preserve the decencies of life, the least you can provide is a four-roomed house. From my experience in the matter, I favour the erection of four-roomed houses, especially in urban districts. We have a considerable number of these houses up and down the country, and I think it is the experience of everybody that every decent workingman wants at least a four-roomed house.  There are occasions, of course, when a man must take any house that offers.  Hence the difficulty we have as far as the sub-letting of these houses is concerned.  The shortage of houses is so acute that it is impossible to prevent sub-letting.  In Dundalk, although our agreements are drawn up very strictly, and provide that the tenant is not to sub-let, we have to wink at that clause in the agreement in order that people may get shelter.  That will continue for a considerable time until the Government are in a position to place, perhaps, some millions of money at the disposal of the authorities or the public for the purpose of building more houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were possible with the limited amount of money at the disposal of the local authorities at the present time to build within six or twelve months 1,000 or 2,000 houses it would alleviate to some extent the distress caused by the housing shortage.  However, it would only get to the fringe of the problem, as a great many people have to be provided with houses.  If the money is provided I would ask the Government <Col N="1014" /> not to favour the building of a large number of three-roomed houses, because we are only going to create a new class of slum, a class of slum that will cause a good deal of trouble, and give the people who come after us in 10 or 12 years' time a similar problem to that which we have.  For that reason I hope that the Ministry in any further scheme they may put forward will favour the erection of houses with at least four rooms.  The three-roomed house is only suitable for a man and his wife.</P>

      <P>I want to support the point of view expressed by Deputy Heffernan.  There is general complaint that the rural population does not, in matters like this, get the consideration that town or city dwellers receive.  The conditions in many parts of Ireland are, beyond doubt, as bad in the rural districts as they are in the cities.  I would suggest to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that he should ask for a report from the engineers who have gone through the country inspecting sites for new houses, so that he could see what their views are on this question. It is my experience that there are districts in the country where the housing conditions could not possibly be worse. It is true that we have some facilities for building houses, but very many small farmers would be unable to face the proposition of building a new house.  A farmer might be given £100 grant, but nothing less than a five-roomed house would be of any use to him.  He has got to have a kitchen, and the rooms would be for the use of his family.  Many men would not be able to find, even if given the £100, sufficient money to build a new house. It is that class of people are worst off. There ought to be consideration for that type of citizen in the country districts. If the Minister is unable to do anything for them under this Bill, it would be an encouragement if he could <Col N="1015" /> say that any further measure dealing with housing will apply equally to country districts as well as to the cities and towns.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Hughes said about sub-letting. We all agree that sub-letting is very undesirable, but owing to the acute shortage of houses at present it is impossible for public bodies to insist on the regulations they make with tenants being carried out.  Deputy Johnson referred to the question of the rent charged to people who are compelled to take a room or two from persons in occupation of artisans' dwellings.  I think the Ministry should take effective steps to deal with what might be called profiteering in this connection. We know that there are people who are agitating to get into houses at cheap rents, and the moment they get possession they sub-let part of them, sometimes at a figure twice or three times what they themselves are paying for the houses.  That is certainly a great scandal, and should not be tolerated.  I think the Ministry should take effective measures to deal with it, and that we should have a statement from the Ministerial Benches, pointing out what a bad practice it is.  A circular should be sent out to local authorities telling them to deal with that state of affairs.  I would like to ask the Minister to say if that rent, which is a rack rent, is recoverable in law?</P>

      <P>In the rural district of Fermoy 250 cottages were passed for building in 1919.  The preliminary expenses were incurred, doctors visited the old houses, engineers prepared plans for the Local Government Board of that time, and the rents were fixed. When the new District Council came into office they neglected the matter.  I am ashamed to say that they threw out the scheme.  I wonder if there is any chance of that scheme being revived again, as some of the people for whom the cottages were intended are living in houses out of which consumptives have gone either to the grave, the sanatorium or the County Home. Through necessity the people have to <Col N="1016" /> live in these houses.  I think that if the Local Government Department could sanction that scheme of cottages now they would be doing not only a good turn for the district of Fermoy, but for the whole country.</P>

      <P>I would like to emphasise the point made by Deputy Heffernan regarding the want of consideration for the needs of the rural areas.  We seem to have a knack here of legislating for cities and urban districts. Anyone who is acquainted with rural life in Ireland at present knows that it is dull and drab enough without having the people living in ill-ventilated and drab houses.  A good many of the houses in the country districts lend themselves to reconstruction.  It would be well if the Ministry would consider the position, as very often people in the country are infinitely worse housed than those living in urban districts.  There is an amount of physical and mental deterioration in the country because of the want of bright surroundings.  If we are to face social problems as well as other problems we will have to consider this, and try to make life in the country a little brighter and more cheerful than it is. One of the ways to do that is to help the people to make their houses pleasant, healthy and agreeable to live in.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Corish's question, and Deputy Johnson's suggestion, and also in reference to the remarks of Deputy Good, I am thoroughly in accord with the views they have expressed.  However, it is very easy to recommend the Minister to take effective measures to prevent re-letting.  I think if the Dáil asked Deputy Corish to outline what kind of measures we should take, he would find it very difficult to do so.  In cases of sub-letting, it is likely the person who rents the house from the original tenant is bound by some agreement of secrecy not to disclose the rent he pays. If he makes that known he will probably be dispossessed and left without any house at all.  As long as you have a housing shortage you will be met with that difficulty.  I think it will be extremely difficult to deal with that <Col N="1017" /> point.  At the same time, I think the Deputy's suggestion to circularise local authorities and get them to bring whatever pressure they can on people who indulge in this particularly contemptible form of profiteering, is a good one, and we will act on it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>With regard to the rural houses, I am familiar with the situation that Deputies Heffernan, Baxter, and Hogan have dealt with.  I realise that in rural areas many of those houses are in a very bad condition from a sanitary and a health point of view.  It would be desirable if facilities were given for the reconstruction of these houses.  Under the present Bill only £50,000 is allocated for that purpose.  Any Deputy who weighs the matter fairly in his mind will realise that the case for the town dweller is very much stronger than the case for <Col N="1018" /> the country dweller.  In a matter of this kind one of the great difficulties the town builder is faced with is the difficulty of finding a site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BURKE</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that one of the difficulties was the finding of a site.  It is considered desirable that he should be allowed to reconstruct in this way in order to avoid that difficulty.  The countryman, in the ordinary course of events, has very little difficulty in getting a site, and, as a general rule, he can acquire it at a moderate price.  It must, however, be borne in mind that under the Act the farmers have availed of the facilities provided to the extent of sixty per cent.  If we were to enable them to reconstruct houses in this way I think we would require a grant of something like £1,000,000 for reconstruction alone.  I think the fact that dwellers in the rural districts are responsible for building sixty per cent. of the houses under this Act throws some light on the figures that I have quoted, and do not make them quite so alarming as Deputy Good alleges.  The farmer in the ordinary course of events is not inclined to build a house of less than five rooms.  If we inquire into the figures we will find that a great number of the five-roomed houses that have been built were built in the country. The difficulty that Deputy Good is so much afraid of will not occur to the same extent as he imagines.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (e), line 19, after the word &ldquo;prolific&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;but this clause shall not apply in cases where the bull is kept exclusively for use with the herd which is the property of the owner of the bull.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is very evident.  The idea is that if the owner of a bull, which he keeps for his own purpose, has one that he desires to retain, it is not a matter of concern for the country or the Department as to how prolific that bull is.  If a bull of high strain is not prolific, his progeny may be of such great advantage to the owner that he may be anxious to keep it.  As the Bill stands, the Minister has power to cause the destruction of such a bull as that.  My amendment has the effect of allowing the owner to retain the bull.</P>

      <P>It is hardly worth while <Col N="1021" /> wasting time over this amendment.  A bull that is not prolific is not going to do very much harm.  If the Deputy likes, I will agree to delete clause (e) entirely.  I do not want to overload the Bill with too many exceptions.  I will delete the clause, as it does not matter.  The first thing that is known in any neighbourhood is that the particular animal is not prolific, and there will not be much harm done by the deletion I am agreeing to.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In the case of a pure-bred bull the property of one person and used exclusively for the service of cows the property of that person, the Minister shall not refuse to grant a licence under this Act solely on the ground mentioned in paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The discussion on this matter was closured rather hurriedly last night and I was not quite satisfied with the Minister's explanation. I suggested that he should withdraw the word &ldquo;pure-bred,&rdquo; and he declined to do so.  I think if he considers the matter fully there are reasons why the word should be withdrawn. As the Bill stands, the owner of a herd who keeps a bull for the exclusive use of that herd can only, on <Col N="1022" /> his own option, keep a pure-bred bull of a certain class, provided that bull conforms to the type that is authorised to be kept in a particular county or district.</P>
      <P>To my mind the Bill interferes too much with the personal liberty of the stock-owner or the herd-owner.  I see no reason why, even in Cahirciveen, a man if he has a herd of his own, and if he gets a bull purely for the use of that herd, should not be allowed to keep a cross-bred bull of the Dairy Shorthorn type.</P>

      <P>I desire to support Deputy Heffernan in urging on the Minister the desirability of assisting owners of herds in this matter.  At the same time I think there should be included in the Bill something permitting the introduction of pure-bred or half-bred Shorthorns.  As the amendment stands it will shut out a good half-bred Shorthorn, and that is the type from which we get the best calves in the country, robust calves of sound constitution.  If the amendment were to be passed in this form, the half-bred Shorthorn would be shut out.  I consider that we should not allow a half-bred Polled-Angus or Hereford. Usually there is a bad recrossing from them; but with the pure-bred Shorthorn, the longer you cross the better the progeny becomes.  I would urge the Minister, if he does not see his way to delete the word &ldquo;pure-bred,&rdquo; to let <Col N="1023" /> the section read something like this: &ldquo;In the case of a pure-bred or half-bred bull&rdquo;; that would not shut out the County Limerick and County Tipperary half-bred bulls.</P>

The importance of that matter is very great.  It means practically bringing bulls up to the level of the very cattle that Deputy Hogan has referred to.  That is one of the main ideas of the Bill.  Those animals should be had in preference to any pure-bred animal, because they have produced the stock that is of so very much value to the country.  Those should be retained and the point that Deputy Hogan has raised is one that the Minister should consider.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy suggest some amendment to meet the point?  If the Deputy is really afraid that the Department is going to prevent a half-bred Shorthorn bull from standing in Limerick, could he not suggest an amendment to meet that point? He could suggest an amendment which will cover the case of a Galloway bull in Kerry or an Aberdeen Angus or a Shorthorn in Kerry.

      <P>If that is so, I would like to have that stated.  I would like to hear the Deputies on the Farmers' benches saying they think the Shorthorn bull should be put on a Kerry cow.  If that is not their intention let us have the matter made clear. <Col N="1025" /> The intention of sub-section (d) is merely to give the Department power to prevent an Aberdeen Angus or a Dairy Shorthorn from standing in Cahirciveen.  Do Deputies object to that?  That is the first question to decide.  Is it right to prevent an Aberdeen Angus or a shorthorn from standing in Cahirciveen, where you have everybody with Kerry cows, and in a district where the Department has been developing the Kerry cow for a long period?  If Deputies agree that we should not allow an Aberdeen Angus or a shorthorn to stand in Cahirciveen, let us have that point decided, and let us try and fix some form of words which will make it clear that half-bred shorthorn bulls can stand in Limerick.</P>
      <P>It was with that end in view that we drafted the section in the form in which it is.  Under the section as it stands the Department may allow a half-bred shorthorn bull to stand in the County Limerick, and they have power to prevent the same class of bull from standing in Cahirciveen, County Kerry. There is no dispute between us, unless Deputies think that the owner of a herd in the County Kerry ought to be allowed to bring a half-bred shorthorn or a half-bred Aberdeen Angus bull into that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that.  The private owner of a herd may have a herd of half-bred Shorthorns in the County Kerry.  As the Bill stands at present he could not bring a half-bred Shorthorn bull there.  He could not have such a bull for the purposes of his own herd, and I see no reason why he should not be allowed to do so. I do see a reason, however, why such a bull should not be allowed into that county for the purpose of serving cows in the neighbourhood.  The point is, that if a man in the case of his own herd wishes to go in for a special type of breed he could not do it under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis in this matter should be laid on the use of the word &ldquo;exclusively.&rdquo;  I think Deputy Heffernan fails to realise the great risk that is involved in his proposition. If the owner of a herd is entitled <Col N="1026" /> to use, say, a half-bred Shorthorn bull in a herd in Kerry, there is very considerable risk that the bull will be used outside his own herd, and, therefore, the difficulty of confining it exclusively is a very great one, if the bull happens to be sent into a populous area.  There is considerable protection, however, when the use of such a bull is confined to pure-breds, because the cost of service will be greater, and more particularly because the owner of a pure-bred bull, in a private herd of that kind, is not going to allow his bull to be used for general service, so that there is a protection there in the case of a pure-bred.  There is very little protection if you have a half-bred in a populous area, and, therefore, I think the proposal of the Minister is necessary to keep a safeguard on pure-bred bulls used exclusively for the service of cows the property of the owner. If you do not keep in the word &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; you are running a great deal of risk and destroying the purpose of the Bill.  Again, if you delete the words &ldquo;pure-bred,&rdquo; you are running a great deal of risk, and I think you must include the words &ldquo;pure-bred&rdquo; and &ldquo;exclusively.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister now makes Kerry the centre of gravity for his attack on the arguments advanced by Deputy Heffernan.  If so much success has been attained so far in this <Col N="1027" /> effort by the Department, it is, I suggest, because of the co-operation given by the farmers down there.  If a farmer down there establishes another herd and feels he needs an animal of a different type to the types already in the locality, there is going to be more harm wrought by the Department in preventing that breeder getting such an animal than is likely to arise from the use of that animal in herds outside. Men who have cattle of the Kerry breed and who are anxious to improve their quality are not likely to permit an animal to be used for their cattle now which they would not permit so far.  I think the Minister himself is contemplating a possibility that is not likely to arise.  If there is to be a balance on any side it ought to be on the side of liberty to the individual to take an animal in that is of a sufficiently good type.</P>

      <P>If the case is as it has been put forward by Deputy Heffernan that this half-bred bull is not to be allowed, I believe that the Minister is to a certain extent interfering with the liberty of the breeder.  I have not read the Bill very thoroughly, but the Minister said, I think, that such is not the case at all.  If he is, however, going to prevent the breeder from using this bull exclusively for his own herd, there is no doubt whatever that he is interfering with the liberty of that breeder by compelling him to introduce pure-bred bulls.  Personally, I am in favour of the pure-bred bull. I prefer him to a mongrel of any sort. If the case is as put forward by Deputy Heffernan, I certainly think the Minister is interfering with the liberty and right of a breeder, if he has a fad in a particular direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Doyle has put the case fairly when he said &ldquo;if such is the case.&rdquo;  I would ask Deputies to read the section.  The Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; refuse to grant a licence under this Act in respect of any bull which appears to be of a breed or type unsuitable for the district in which it is kept.  In the case of a pure-bred bull, the property of one person, and used <Col N="1028" /> exclusively for the service of cows the property of that person, the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; not refuse to grant a licence under this Act except on the grounds mentioned in sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
      <P>Mark the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the first sentence and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the next.  Deputy Heffernan's suggestion is that the amendment which stands in the name of Deputy Duggan and which is to come on afterwards should read as follows: In the case of a bull, leaving out the word &ldquo;pure-bred,&rdquo; the property of one person and used exclusively for the service of cows the property of that person, the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; not refuse a licence.  That is what the amendment means exactly, and we must be taken to mean what we suggest in our amendments.  Deputy Johnson suggested yesterday, and I agree with him, that this section might be re-drafted, that it might be re-drafted on the lines of providing that, in certain circumstances, the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; refuse, and that in certain other circumstances, the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; refuse.  For instance, the Minister may refuse to grant a licence for a breed or type unsuitable for a district, but he shall refuse to grant a licence for a bull affected, say, by contagious disease.  I expressed my readiness to change the section to meet Deputy Johnson's views.  I would ask the Dáil to consider the changed section. You would first of all find that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; refuse to grant a licence in certain circumstances such as contagious disease, etc., and that he may refuse to grant a licence in certain other circumstances.</P>
      <P>You would have exceptions in favour of a pure-bred bull.  But still, in the case of a pure-bred bull he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; not refuse the licence, but in the case of a half-bred, not a cross-bred bull&mdash;and we should not mix up the half-bred and cross-bred&mdash;in the case of a half-bred bull he may refuse.  Why take away the powers that we may refuse if we think well to refuse the licence for the half-bred in certain districts? Can we limit ourselves any further than that?  Do Deputies think it right?</P>

It means that although we are absolutely certain that this bull is going to serve, not only the owner's herd, but cows in the neighbourhood, we are to be allowed no discretion, but we must give him a licence, whether we consider the bull is used exclusively for the owner's herd, whether half-bred or not.

We should at least have some discrimination.  Where we are certain there is a bona fide application from the owner of a dairy herd of Shorthorns in Kerry for a half-bred bull, we have power under the Bill to give him that half-bred.  But suppose 8 or 10 persons are getting half-bred Shorthorns, and we know they are to serve not only Shorthorns of particular herds but the cows of the parish, are we not to be in a position to prevent that?</P>

An Act of Parliament is not just for the present circumstances; it is with a view to putting into operation a scheme that will last for many years, and the only point between us is this. All we are claiming to do in this section is to have power to prevent a man who wants to bring a half-bred Shorthorn or an Aberdeen Angus into Kerry from doing so when we know that the bull is going to serve cows not only belonging to the man himself but to the whole parish.  Is that right? We have power to allow a Shorthorn half-bred or Aberdeen Angus into Kerry where we are quite sure that the bull is to be used exclusively for serving the cows of the owner's herd.</P>

That is hypothetical and it will remain hypothetical unless we get the co-operation of the farmers of the country.  Deputy Heffernan shakes his head.  He is one of the sanguine people who does not hope to get that result.  I am one of the sanguine people who believe the result will depend upon the farmers.  We are aiming at something which can only come into existence with their co-operation and to say that we are dealing with hypothetical cases is quite true, but it is true of every Act of Parliament.</P>

    <P>Motion by Deputy Patrick McKenna:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a Special Committee, consisting of nine Deputies, to be nominated by the Sessional Committee of Selection, be appointed to enquire into the system under which the Old Age Pensions Act, 1924, is being administered in the Saorstát; that the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, and that the quorum of the Committee be five.&rdquo;&mdash;(Debate resumed.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>When the discussion on this was adjourned I was putting a question to the Minister for Finance as to whether it was his intention, or if it was his desire, that a Commission, or Committee of the Dáil, might be set up to consider the present system under which the Old Age Pensions Act is administered.  What I am not clear about is, if he were prepared to concede that a Committee ought to or might be set up, does he consider that a Committee can really discuss this present system, or suggest another, without taking into account the present administration?  After all, it seems to me that the system under which the Act is at present administered and the administration itself are inseparable; I cannot see how one can be considered or discussed apart from the other.  I cannot see how that Committee could hope to do anything at all without first taking into account the present administration, and in the light of the administration of the present system suggest a new system, if, as we know will be the case, the system is not found satisfactory&mdash;whether it is the administration or the system that the administration has sprung from. <Col N="1034" /> I am not clear on that, and I want to be.  I do want to say this, that as regards the administration at present, down the country anyhow, it is regarded as being very far from satisfactory indeed.  Since I came into the Dáil, and very recently, I have had very many complaints from pension committees in my county, and the feeling of some of these committees is that really they might as well not be in existence at all.  I admit that from what I know they can do very little good.  In a case where it is very obvious that the claimant is entitled to the pension they can pass it, and the pension is granted; but I believe it would be granted if the committee were not in existence at all, simply because there would be no arguments against it.  But in a case where there is any question, no matter what the decision of the Committee may be, no matter what the local feeling may be as to the claimant being entitled to the pension, that does not seem to weigh with the administration.  I am merely voicing a very general opinion when I say that the feeling is that the committee has absolutely no power, and very little attention is paid to their decisions at all.</P>
      <P>I do not know where the fault lies. I have had experience of claims passed by the Committee, passed again by the Committee after they were appealed against, but the decisions of the Committee did not weigh with the administration. I know that in cases there may not be, from the point of view of the administration, sufficient evidence to go on, but the administration seems never to be satisfied to accept local decisions, founded on local knowledge.  If the Minister is prepared to say that a Committee of the Dáil should be set up to consider the system, I think he might as well recognise that no good can come from the setting up of such a Committee unless the work of the present administration will be under review by it.  Unless he is prepared to concede that, it seems to me that Deputy McKenna's motion will not have achieved the object for which it was put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWhite" hpid="Mr. WHITE Mr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would desire to draw the Minister's attention to the fact <Col N="1035" /> that the local pensions officers are both rigorous and unreasonable in their views.  For instance, take the case that Deputy A. Byrne quoted of a bed provided for an old person by a relative in the city of Dublin, and valued at 3/- a week.  I want to bring under the notice of the Minister another glaring injustice in the valuation of the means of the claimants in rural districts, like that from which I come, and that is the valuation of a stack of turf.  That is not provided by the pensioner; everybody knows that he or she is physically debarred from having anything to do with the cutting or handling of turf. This turf is cut, handled and worked, and put on the street, or wherever the turf stack is placed, by the son or daughter or by the grand-children of the pensioner.  I contend that it is most unreasonable for local pension officers to take into consideration the value of that stack of turf.  It is just as unreasonable on the one side as the case that Deputy A. Byrne quoted of the bed, valued at 3/- a week, that was given by a daughter-in-law, or some other outside relative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that I desire to draw the attention of the Minister to, and to emphasise is that some machinery should be set up by which the ages of these old people can be established, some reasonable machinery.  I know of several cases in my own area where declarations and affidavits&mdash;declarations made before Peace Commissioners and affidavits made before Commissioners of Oaths&mdash;were sent on by the claimants to the Pension Committees. They were sent on from the Pension Committee to the Department in Dublin and they were rejected.  A large number of these unfortunate people who are applying for the pension are helpless and illiterate people, and some proper consideration should be shown to them in the establishment of their ages.  I know, and we all know perfectly well that the Department is working at a great disadvantage in the way of being able to obtain proper verification since the records were destroyed in the Four Courts, but at the same time the Minister and his Department and the local <Col N="1036" /> pension officer should not look upon all the unfortunate poor people seeking pensions as absolute rogues.  They are not being told that in actual words, but that statement is practically thrown in their teeth, and the people who sign affidavits are subjected to what I consider an insult. I know, and the Minister should know as well, that a large number of these humble people in the country do not go to make declarations before Commissioners of Oaths without first giving due consideration to it.  I think myself that is a matter that the Minister should put before his Department, that some reasonable and fair machinery or some reasonable test or standard should be set up for the proving of the ages of these people who are applicants for old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I would also say that the pension officers and the various rural councils should not be so unreasonable and so rigorous as they are in the administration of the Act.  They should place more reliance on the statements of old age pension committees, because these committees are composed largely of respectable and responsible persons in the various districts, and their views and statements should be taken seriously into account in the administration of the Act.  I think that the Minister would be acting properly by setting up a commission to inquire into the working and details of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>If I interpret correctly the promise which the Minister for Finance made yesterday it means a review or complete change in the methods of granting old age pensions. The appointment of a committee of inquiry would in great measure rectify matters which we know are wrong. Some people cannot ascertain their ages because the registers in the chapels were either destroyed or lost, and many people do not know where they were born, but their appearance would lead anybody to believe that they are over seventy years of age.  There should be discretion vested in the pension officers and in the pension committees, which Deputy White described as being composed of very honest people.  I do not know if he is right there.  After all, I <Col N="1037" /> am satisfied with the promise and with the sympathetic manner in which the Minister for Finance has agreed to set up a committee to review the administration of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the setting up of this Commission because, as one who has administered the Act in many localities and attended committees at which claims have been considered, I am aware that there can be a very great improvement in the administration of the Act.  Where public boards of various kinds have to meet and where committees are appointed to deal with these pensions, it is very often found that the number of people who attend at these meetings is very limited.  Personally, I have very often had to adjudicate on cases all over Co. Westmeath with, perhaps, the assistance of only one person.  I know that very undue hardship is inflicted on a large number of persons owing to various circumstances.  Returns were made by the Excise Officers as to the means of the applicants and these persons were either struck off the list altogether or their pensions were considerably reduced.  Returns came before me recently in which the applicants were represented to have an acre of hay, an acre of potatoes, and a certain quantity of turf, and these were put down at a certain value.  That was certainly their value then, but what is their value now?  They are practically valueless.  These persons have existed during the winter on feeding pigs from the small quantity of produce they have been able to produce and their position is very serious.  My reason for giving these illustrations is to try to get back pensions for these people if they have to make an appeal.  That will take a considerable time.  The pension officers have to inspect the places, the committees have to meet, the cases come before the Department in Dublin, and, whether the decisions are favourable or unfavourable to the applicants, a period of several months must elapse.  I consider that this Commission will do a considerable amount of good.  Even though it might not be able to change the administration of the Act at present, I believe it would <Col N="1038" /> be able to recommend and certainly would recommend means by which a great amount of the present suffering would be relieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I am struck with what Deputy White has said in regard to cases which he quoted, but it occurs to me to ask what is the reason very often of this genuine hardship?  What does it result from?  Is it the result of attempts, systematically made, to get for individuals in cases of this kind, or in other cases, advantages to which people are not entitled?  If the Old Age Pension Act had been administered honestly, so that everybody who got a pension was a genuine case, it would make it very simple to administer the Act now, and the greater latitude which Deputy White asked for could easily be given.  Why, however, is it impossible to give it in cases of the kind mentioned?  The reason is that the local committees and local individuals, as Deputy Shaw pointed out, have a bias in favour of getting something out of the Central Fund that is not paid for locally; in other words, we are all inclined to be good fellows. People should understand and learn in the country that for every claim made unjustly, other people, who have just claims, will have to suffer by having to undergo a stricter scrutiny when their claims are going through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLyons" hpid="Mr. LYONS Mr. LYONS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister for Finance has met this motion fairly well, when on Wednesday last he agreed to appoint a Committee of Deputies with a number of outsiders.  I am sure that when that Committee gets working it will be able to adjust a number of existing grievances.  I disagree, however, with Deputy Hewat's statement regarding local committees. These committees fully recognise that portion of every pension that is granted must be borne by people in the locality. Every pension, of course, comes out of the Central Fund, but it is really paid locally by means of high rates and taxes.  I have had experience for the last four or five years of local committees. On one of them was a parish priest, a parson of the Church of Ireland, <Col N="1039" /> and several other respectable persons, but frequently the recommendations of that Committee were turned down.  I do not blame the Department or the Minister for that, but I do blame the local officer.  He is the man who sends forward his file with certain information, but he does not go to the district and find out that information for himself.  He depends on what other people tell him.</P>
      <P>In some cases applicants had, say, ten hens or a goat, and these were taken into account and valued at so much.  In my opinion these things should not be taken into consideration in cases where the persons are over 70 years.  An old man may be over 70 years and have sufficient strength to enable him to continue at manual labour, or otherwise to earn a few shillings a week, and these few shillings are counted as income, but if he were an invalid he would be entitled to a pension and get it.  I think that is not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the pension should be given to all who reach the age of 70 years.  If necessary one penny per week could be levied so as to enable pensions to be given to all at the age of 70, or even 65.  The Minister for Finance said several schemes had been put before him.  One was to strike a rate of so much in the £ with a view to providing pensions.  I am sure the local authorities that passed resolutions condemning the action of the Government in regard to old age pensions would have no objection to levy a rate to relieve the distress of the old and infirm.  If meetings of public bodies are held on this matter I am sure the old age pensioners will benefit considerably.  Deputy McKenna's motion is a few months too late.  If it had come earlier the people might not have to suffer so much.  I am sure every Deputy will quite agree that the pension scheme is carried out in a most ridiculous manner.  The local committees are selected by the county councils, and surely they would not select people who would vote to give pensions to their own friends and relatives for the purpose of making paupers of them.  The suggestion is made that <Col N="1040" /> they make awards without making inquiries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, not directly but indirectly.  The local people know more about the applicant for a pension, who resides in their locality, than the pension officer who may reside 30 miles away, and more than the people in the offices in Dublin.  In the majority of cases when the claims come up they are refused.  In the cases of blind persons, a shilling a week has been taken from them, and in some cases three or four shillings a week.  That is a matter that should be inquired into.  I agree that the Minister has met the purpose Deputy McKenna had in view in bringing forward his motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for FINANCE (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I give a word of explanation to Deputy Baxter?  Only the system can be considered, that is; the defects and faults which have been revealed in the working of the system, and the Commission will have full power and it will be its duty when faults and defects are apparent, and injustice arises from the working of the present system, to suggest, if they can, a better system under which these will not occur.  When I said that the Commission would not consider the question of administration, I meant that the Commission cannot get after officials for the way that they perform their duties.  The question of dealing with the officials must be left to the Minister in charge of the Department. He ought to see that they do their duty right, and if the Dáil thinks that the Minister is not taking the proper steps to get the officials to do their duty, it can get rid of that Minister, but the officials should look to the Minister who is responsible for their Department. That is what I meant when I said that the administration of the system should not go to the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in support of the suggested Commission.  I was connected with the administration of Old Age Pensions in my own county from the time the scheme came into operation, and I had <Col N="1041" /> the opportunity of seeing how it worked for a great many years.  There has been a great deal of inconsistency in the working of it.  Sometimes claims are allowed to pass without examination, and at other times there is a great display of energy.  To secure an Old Age Pension now is so frightfully difficult that it is almost a Herculean labour.  For some time I have been trying to get the old age pension for deserving cases.  After months I succeeded in getting it for one woman.  It is impossible in some cases to establish proof of age owing to the burning of registers in a certain church.  The burning of registers has been very common in Kildare.  When I look back over 50 years, I am surprised that there are any registers in existence.  In the days of my youth I have seen registers kicked about in the vestries of one or two churches.  These poor people who are looking for pensions are now paying the penalty for the carelessness shown about these things.  Another matter is, that the way in which means are calculated is most inconsistent, and not understandable.  For these reasons I have great sympathy with the motion, and I hope something will be done to make the working of the Act more reasonable and intelligible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidHall" hpid="Mr. HALL Mr. HALL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HALL</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.  Some few months ago I asked a question in the Dáil in relation to the disallowance of a pension to an old lady in Co. Meath. The reply to the question was that it was open to the old lady to make fresh application in the usual way.  I communicated that information to her She went to see the pension officer in the district and he abused her, and, moreover, told her that he would see that she would not get the pension. <Col N="1042" /> This is a fact.  If these officers are the same as the officers who investigated dependents' allowances in the case of Army men, I would not doubt that in a good many cases they have reported without visiting the claimants.  I brought it to the notice of the responsible Minister and the matter was rectified by sending another man. I do not agree with the present system of valuation of small property.  I do not believe that the Minister thinks that a pension of 9/- is sufficient to keep body and soul together.  He must realise that something extra is required to make up the deficiency between the 9/- and the sum that would be sufficient to sustain life.  If the statements made here by some Deputies that a goat and hens are valued and taken into account in computing the pension, I think it is very unjust and unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I do not see what objection there could be to appointing a Committee of the Dáil to investigate the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act.  I cannot understand why there should be any objections, unless there is some fear that something very unpleasant or uncomfortable might be disclosed.  I think such a committee should be appointed to see if the present system can be remedied.  I believe it would do a lot of good.  It would place people who are entitled to the pension in the position of getting a pension, and on the other hand, get rid of some people who are receiving the pension and who are not entitled to it.  I know there are farmers with a pretty good property drawing pensions, while poor people who have no means of livelihood are unable to get the pension because they cannot produce a birth certificate, or find someone in the locality who can vouch for their age.  I know of one instance where a man of 74, who is able to give the date on which he was born, cannot get the pension.  He has kept a record of things that happened at a particular period in his lifetime.  A certain man in the locality has made an affidavit that he believes the man is 73. Despite that his appeal has been turned down, and there is no method at his disposal whereby he can acquire a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> I think this motion is a very reasonable one, and should be supported by every Deputy.  If the motion has not been previously considered or decided upon by some parties in this Dáil I cannot see how any Deputy on the Government benches can vote against it on a division if he has not been here to listen to the arguments.</P>

      <P>I came into the Dáil unsatisfied with the statement made by the Minister the other evening.  I understood him to say that he would not allow in the terms of reference to this committee a review of the present administration of the Act, but from the explanation that he has given today I am quite satisfied to accept the proposal of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that as far as I can see the Local Government Department seems to be a mere puppet in the hands of the Ministry of Finance so far as the administration of this Act is concerned. During the whole of this debate I have not seen here the Minister for Local Government.  As we are all aware, the Local Government Department is the ultimate court of appeal in all these cases.  As regards pensions officers and officials of the Ministry, I would not like to interfere with the Minister responsible for these officials, but I must say from experience of the administration of the Act and information received from pensioners that some of these officers have been too extreme in their decisions.  When this Act was passed I was connected with a movement along with a great Irishman&mdash;the late Professor Kettle.  There was a discussion on one occasion as to how a pension officer should be described, and Professor Kettle said: &ldquo;It would be a bit discourteous to call him a spy, but I think it would suit to call him an investigator, an objector, a discoverer of ambiguities, an apostle of economy&mdash;in a word, a devil's advocate.&rdquo; That has been the experience of a good many old age pensioners.  I do not say that pension officers are as bad now as they were under the British administration.</P>

      <P>A lot of them were sent over from England and Scotland to administer this Act, and some of them would not know a sheep from a goat.  They used to go out into the country, sit down with the old people, and inquire: &ldquo;How many hens has Mary Anne Malone, and how many pigs has so-and-so?&rdquo;  That was the way they went about calculating means.</P>
      <P>I wish to impress on the Minister that when preparing his Terms of Reference he should include a query as to what is income.  I have read the Act carefully and there is no definition of what income is.  I remember when this matter was before the British House of Commons the then Prime Minister and his colleagues told the Irish members of that time how the matter would be settled.  They said that in the first instance the Pension Committee would consider it; then the Inland Revenue authorities; and finally the Local Government Board.  The question of means is giving a lot of trouble to the Local Government Department, as is also the question of age.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that I have not to ask the Dáil to divide on this matter. I wish to assure them that I did not bring forward the motion, and my party did not advise me to bring it forward, as a means of gaining cheap popularity or trying to score a point against any other party.  We brought it forward in order to clear the air and try to show to the people of the country that so far as the Dáil is concerned we are anxious under our National Government to be as generous as we possibly can, having regard to the finances of the country.  I ask leave to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>I would like to say with reference to the criticism by the Deputy of the Minister for Local Government, that when this motion was brought forward the Minister had been here all day dealing with the Local Government Bill.

      <P>It is with some reluctance I have been compelled to raise this matter in this fashion.  I put down a question to the Minister for Finance the other day in which I asked him on what evidence a number of claims for personal injuries were turned down.  I expected on the part of the Minister some sympathetic reply. That is to say, I expected a reply in which he would indicate that the Ministry were prepared to give some consideration to cases where substantial evidence could be brought forward that personal injuries had been sustained. On the contrary, I found an attitude displayed by the Minister which left me no option whatever but to bring forward the matter in this fashion.  I am so old-fashioned as to imagine that a Government is responsible for the safety of its citizens, and that when a war of defence or offence is entered into by that Government, it is responsible for compensating those who were injured in that war.  Those responsible for the honour of the State are responsible for compensating parties who were injured.  We are told that there has been a continuity of Government since the first Dáil.  There must then be a continuity of responsibility, and if the war of defence, engaged in by the first Dáil, brought certain penalties in its train to certain people, then the continuity of responsibility for providing for people who were injured rests upon the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us try to visualise the state of the country in 1920.  Possibly Clare suffered as much as any other county <Col N="1046" /> and I could wax rhetorical, perhaps eloquent, if I were to describe to you some of the things that happened in that county.  Some time towards the end of September, 1920, there was an ambush between the towns of Lahinch and Milltown-Malbay, brought about by the Republican Army, in which the Crown Forces suffered severely, some twenty, it is said, being killed or mortally injured.  That brought about reprisals on the two towns, one of which is at either end of that road. Armed forces descended on Lahinch a few nights afterwards with petrol, bomb, and machine-gun, and the people were driven from their homes into the sandhills.  I do not want to harrow the feelings of Deputies by describing how the people suffered on the sandhills. Their homes were set on fire.  Women and children and old people were driven before the bomb and the bullet, and English bloodhounds and jackals were left to desecrate and waste the homes that were left behind.</P>
    <P>I could draw a picture if I liked of these people standing between the sea and their burned homesteads, and I could describe what tragedies occurred, tragedies none the less terrible because they were silent revulsions of nature, because of disobedience to an inexorable code.  I am endeavouring to deal with matters of a very delicate nature, and the Minister may try to understand by implication what I mean, as I do not wish to express it.  When the people made application to the Government&mdash;a Government established by their sacrifices&mdash;they were turned down without any opportunity being given them to bring forward evidence.</P>
    <P>I have the unfortunate experience of knowing that concrete examples irritate the Minister.  However, I will produce another concrete example.  I will give the Minister the case of one young lady who was driven from the sanctity of her home in her night attire to the sandhills.  I will read what the doctor says about her now.  She was living in Lahinch, a happy, healthy girl.  She was driven forth to the sandhills.  Here is what the doctor says referring to her condition now:</P>
    <P>As a result of the exposure, shock and terror, her health has suffered <Col N="1047" /> severely....  She developed a cough and became very anæmic.  She has not been able to do any work practically since on account of loss of strength, headache, and vomiting. She is a nervous wreck.</P>
    <P>I have seen other nervous wrecks as a result of the struggle and exposure.</P>
    <P>Let us see what an ex-captain of Fianna Eireann, and an ex-captain of the I.R.A. says:</P>
    <P>We, the undersigned, willingly testify to the invaluable services rendered by Miss &mdash;&mdash; during the Anglo-Irish war.  During that period she gave every assistance in her power to the I.R.A. in the way of providing ammunition, carrying dispatches, and providing food and shelter for the boys who were on the run at the time.  It was owing to the information which she obtained previous to the ambush at Moanreel that the activities of the Crown forces were thwarted.  Otherwise the I.R.A. would have been taken unawares and captured.  Many a Volunteer living to-day owes his life to the assistance rendered by this girl.</P>
    <P>What does the Ministry of Finance say to her?  This evidence was before the committee.  I do not know if it was before the Ministry of Finance, but I know that a document was sent out from the Ministry of Finance&mdash;a stock letter.  I have seen scores of these letters.  The letter says:</P>
    <P>It is regretted that no compensation is payable in this case.</P>
    <P>Is that a fair way to treat this girl? She is only a sample of many others.</P>
    <P>Let us go to the other end of the road in which the ambush took place, to Milltown-Malbay, and we find much the same story.  When there were a number of men in Mountjoy jail clinging to life by a thread, on hunger strike, the Irish Labour Party sent down instructions that a &ldquo;greased lightning&rdquo; strike, as it was then called, should be inaugurated in order to get those men out of jail, and save their lives for the country.  That strike went on in Clare.  The whole place was held up, and when the victory was won by labour for these men by the strike, these men went out to Canada Cross, a place outside the town, to celebrate the <Col N="1048" /> victory, and what do we find?  The Black and Tans fired on them.  Some of them were killed, and some badly wounded.  We find that one of the men who was killed was a tailor.  He was the sole support of his sister, and what do we find?  We find that his claim was turned down by the Commission. We find that a man thatching a hay-rick was mortally wounded, dying afterwards owing to the rupture of a blood vessel.  The claim of his relatives was turned down.  Then there is the case of a baker who was wounded in the arm, and, who, as the result, could not carry on his occupation for 11 months afterwards.  His claim, too, was turned down.  I do not know if all these facts are before the Ministry. But I know this, that I do expect from the Ministry of Finance further investigation into all these cases, where concrete evidence can be adduced that they are cases of real suffering and hardship, and cases where compensation could reasonably be expected from the Government.</P>
    <P>Possibly the whole scheme of Irish patriotism is changed and what was roseate in 1920 is black, grey and drab to-day.  The people who suffered in this connection, people whose health has been destroyed, and who are unable to carry on their occupation in the future, should at least get some help from the Government.  When we see the very people, who carried on the war against this country, are, under the terms of the Treaty, supposed to be paid, and I quite realise that they must be paid, these people who suffered for the cause should be compensated. I want to ask the Minister for Finance if there is any clause in this nation's treaty of honour towards these people who suffered when Irish freedom was being hammered out&mdash;is there any clause, with honour and justice, to remain inoperative in the cases I have endeavoured to bring before you?</P>

      <P>I desire to support Deputy P. Hogan in the matter he has raised.  I was about to ask you if there is a quorum of the Dáil present.  If there is, it is due to the decent sprinkling of labour and farmer Deputies.  When such a grave subject is raised as the matter of giving justice to our suffering countrymen, it looks <Col N="1049" /> decidedly bad that the Government benches are comparatively empty. Deputy P. Hogan has gone at full length into this question.  He has told you how cases have been decided over the heads of applicants, without their having been given notice of the intention to have their cases determined, and without giving them facilities to appear either in person or by legal proxy.  In addition the Deputy has said, and I believe it is perfectly true, that the amounts awarded have been in many cases inadequate.  I know the Finance Minister will say in regard to that point: &ldquo;At the time the Provisional Government was set up an agreement was reached with Great Britain, under which agreement each country decided to meet the claims of its own nationals.&rdquo;  I think that is right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>But then the findings of the court were suspended and their decrees were not permitted to become operative.  The English Government, I believe, have done no such thing.  The claims awarded in the county courts in Ireland to the dependents of the servants of the British Government, such, for instance, as the widows of policemen, are being paid in full by the British.  But in Ireland all these claims are being re-heard by the Commission, whose powers are rather indefinite and whose terms of reference are decidedly vague.  I do not think it is just to this country, and I do not believe it is right, and it is setting a very poor value upon our own nationals that we do not give them&mdash;I will not say the same treatment as the British gave theirs, because we cannot afford to do so&mdash;but at least we should make some effort to meet their claims justly.  I have had several cases brought to my notice where the paucity and meagreness of the awards given&mdash; and in some cases no award has been given at all&mdash;do not reflect any great credit on the Commission that determined these cases.  I have, for instance, a case in which on the 29th June, 1921, a young man was shot by Crown Forces.  It was a callous murder. He was a young man 25 years of age, in the prime of his manhood, and his relatives received an ex-gratia <Col N="1050" /> grant of £100.  The funeral and legal expenses practically came to the sum awarded them.  I have another case where a child of six or seven years old was shot.  I admit, of course, that it is not easy to justify the contention that, from the wage-earning point of view, they had lost anything.  But they did not even get the funeral expenses.</P>
      <P>These are some of the cases that are antagonising people.  I would suggest to the Minister, with sufficient regard for the Exchequer, that it is a bad spirit and false economy to, Shylock-like, ask for the last pound of flesh.  I ask the Minister to be more generous and to give more consideration to the cases that come before the Commission, and to deal more generously with the applicants and afford them reasonable facilities for presenting their cases.  At the present time, owing to the ambiguity of the terms of reference and the secrecy with which the Commission works, solicitors down the country are in the dark as to what the procedure is, or should be, or how best to get their clients' cases put before the Court. Every Deputy in the counties where there was fighting is inundated with letters from constituents protesting against the dilatory conduct, partly of the Commission, and the absence of awards in reasonable cases; and in other cases, where the awards have been issued, against their meagre character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. MORRISSEY Mr. MORRISSEY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MORRISSEY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this matter of awards.  I suppose the best way of bringing it home to the Minister for Finance and to the Dáil would be to follow what Deputy Hogan has done and to give some concrete cases.  I will give the Minister the case of a young lady, a dressmaker, who got a bullet wound in the jaw.  She was the sole support of her old mother.  This lady spent five months in hospital, and had to undergo two operations.  She is disfigured for the remainder of her life, as the result of this bullet wound and the operations, and she gets a notification from the Ministry of Finance that no compensation will be paid to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also the case of a man whose property and furniture were destroyed. <Col N="1051" /> He was himself beaten and his wife was also beaten by the British Forces in 1921.  He is still waiting for compensation for that personal injury and for the destruction of his property.  I could quote innumerable cases of members of the I.R.A. who were murdered by Crown Forces.  The maximum award in the cases seems to be £100, <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.  I could quote where one young man was murdered in his own house.  It was a well-known case.  There was no doubt that was done by British Forces in Thurles in 1920.  About three months ago his mother, a very old woman, was informed that she was to receive £100.</P>
    <P>I have another case in mind which happened in Nenagh, where two young men were murdered and butchered beyond recognition in 1920.  They were so badly treated by the Crown Forces that even their parents were not allowed to see them before they were buried.  As a result of that, the father of one of the boys is to-day paralysed and has been paralysed for a number of years.  He is confined to his bed. This man has now got notification from the Ministry of Finance that he is to be awarded £100 compensation for the murder of his son.  One could go on giving case after case such as I have described.  When the people contrast the compensation that they are getting with what was given to the dependents of the British Forces, they, certainly, are forced to the conclusion that they have a grievance, and a very great grievance, against the Government. They think that their sons who went out to fight for the country, and who as the result of the fight lost their lives, should have their lives valued more highly.  As a result of their deaths their fathers and mothers are without the means of support to-day.  These people deserve more consideration than they are getting from the Ministry of Finance.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to give a lot of illustrations.  I think these illustrations could be multiplied and kept up until Christmas Day without getting rid of them.  There is, however, <Col N="1052" /> one particular case that I have in mind. That is a man from the South of Ireland who was interned in Ballykinlar. While there, he was injured, and he claims that he has been greatly impaired in health as the result of the injuries sustained.  He applied to the Personal Injuries Commission to have his case considered with a view to making up for the loss he had sustained. Without having examined him or having a doctor's examination of the man at all, they refused to consider the matter, on the plea that as the injury occurred outside the Saorstát they had no jurisdiction.  Now, this particular thing happened before the Saorstát was established, and I think, at least, they should have given some other reason than that for turning down the case. I would like if the Minister, when he is replying, would explain his reason for such a letter being sent to the applicant, and why the fact that the injury happened in Ballykinlar should debar him from having his case considered by the Personal Injuries Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to assure the Dáil that the statements made by Deputies are a fair sample of the general complaints.  I will not delay the Dáil, but I wish the Minister would consider a case of particular hardship in my county.  I am sorry that some of the Limerick Deputies are not here to corroborate this particular case.  I am sure Deputy R. O'Connell knows the case.  The Deputies will remember that on the night that the Mayor and ex-Mayor of Limerick were assassinated by the Black and Tans, a boy from Westmeath who was working as manager of a meat shop in Limerick was also assassinated.  He was the eldest of a family of eight children, and was the main support of the family.  The father was dead, and he used occasionally send home a £10 note to his mother, and used to send meat every week from the shop.  His family had to go down from Westmeath to bury him.  It cost them over £40.  His relatives tell me they put in their claim in the usual way and it was turned down.  One day I had a visit from one of the family here, and Deputy <Col N="1053" /> O'Leadáin and myself saw the Minister for Finance, and he decided to have it re-opened.  I got a reply that the result of the reopening was to turn down the claim again.  I have heard since of other cases in which reasonable and fair compensation was given, but in this particular case, I think something should be done, if only by way of ex-gratia grant.  That is an exceptionally hard case.  I know the family.  They are living on 15 acres of poor, miserable land.  The saddest part of the story is that the mother lost her senses over this boy's death, and another boy was in the Mullingar Asylum for twelve months.  If that is not a case of hardship I do not know what is.  I would like if the Minister would take a note of that case, and if something cannot be given by way of compensation, that he would give something as an ex-gratia payment.</P>

      <P>I think something should be done for those victims who suffered in the fight for freedom.  It is proper and right that some reasonable compensation should be given to the people who helped to establish the Saorstát Government.  It is not so long ago since £12,000 was set aside for the pensioning of a few antediluvian judges.  The cases mentioned are more deserving of recognition and of compensation from the general population of the Saorstát than those judges.</P>

      <P>The Terms of Reference to the Commission, so far as it affects this matter, are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee will recommend to the Minister for Finance what sums are, in reason and fairness, to be paid in the cases above mentioned, regard being had, <i>inter alia</i>, to the actual earning capacity of the injured person prior to the injury; and to the impairment of the earning capacity attributable to the injury; and to the actual extent of dependency upon the deceased person prior to the death or injury of the deceased person, and any effective provision made by the deceased person for his dependents by way of insurance or otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee has heard a very large number of cases.  Some 6,400 claims were received.  About 4,000 of <Col N="1054" /> these have been considered.  Awards have been made in 1174 cases, and they have actually been paid by the Minister for Finance in 950 cases.  There are a couple of hundred others that are to be paid almost immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount already paid is £277,283, or an average of £236 per award.  Now, the Committee has a very big volume of business to do, and it is desirable that they should get through that work with as reasonable a degree of expedition as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of that, and also in order to save unnecessary expense to applicants, the Committee has decided not to hear people in person where there does not seem to be, from the particulars given on the form of application, some prospect that an award might be given.  I do not think I could disagree with that or ask the Committee to alter their procedure in that regard.  As far as I am concerned, I have sent quite a number of cases back to the Committee for consideration.  I sent them back cases on private representations made to me by Deputies, by solicitors representing applicants, and by other people. I also sent back cases because of questions raised in the Dáil.  I sent a few cases back because, on looking over the awards in the Department of Finance, it was thought that certain awards looked rather high.  In any case where a reason seemed to exist, or where it was pointed out to us that a case ought to be sent back to the Committee, it was so sent back and was reconsidered by the Committee.  In a few cases the Committee made some changes.  In others they upheld the decisions which they had previously arrived at.  I have not looked personally into all the cases that were sent back.  I looked into several of them, and I must say that I am satisfied, from an examination of the papers in all the cases which I looked into, that the Committee did what was right.  I cannot pretend to deal with concrete cases brought up here without notice.  I must simply take <Col N="1055" /> no notice of them.  I do not know the facts.  No statement of some of the facts alleged here was made on the form of application.  If facts exist now which were not put on the original form of application, let them be sent forward, and if there is some prospect of an award being given the case will be reconsidered by the Committee.</P>
    <P>It often happens that people misrepresent cases to Deputies.  I will mention a case which a Deputy from the Labour benches wrote to the Ministry of Finance about.  It was the case of a man whose daughter received injuries on the 9th July, 1921.  She died in July, 1922.  The Deputy complained that recently a letter was received from the Ministry of Finance addressed to the girl herself, stating that no compensation could be given.  To the Deputy that seemed very bad, but I have the form of application here. It purports to be signed by the girl herself, although it is dated the 28th June, 1923, that is to say, a year after her death.  It purports to be signed by her and states a lot of things, but of course it gives no indication that the girl was dead, and that in fact she was a year dead when the form was sent in. That case seemed very bad to the Deputy and he said so, having only the facts that he had.  I might say that one does not always get all the facts from applicants.  There are quite a number of people who really suffered nothing and who make application for grants.  There is an enormous number of frivolous applications sent in.  One can understand that cupidity is always aroused when money is to be had, and that people will always exaggerate their sufferings.  People who happened to be beaten or a little ill-used by the Black-and-Tans began the next day to exaggerate the ill-usage they had suffered, and they have gone on exaggerating that ever since.  In a great many cases the beating was a very unpleasant thing, but it left no serious results at all.  There was a large number of cases based on circumstances like that.  Where there is no real evidence of injury or impairment of earning capacity it is quite right that all such cases should be turned down.  I approve of such cases being turned down. <Col N="1056" /> There is another class of case in which there is a good deal of complaint, that is where a person dies and where there is no dependency and where a small award of £50 or thereabouts is made. A case was brought to me the other day by a Deputy outside the Dáil and a question was asked in connection with it by another Deputy.  It was that of two young men, farmers' sons, who were killed.  An award of £50 was made in each case.  On looking over the papers in these particular cases it was absolutely clear that there was no dependency at all.  The farmers, in both cases, had substantial farms. They had other sons working the farms. If anything, you might say that the remaining members of the family were financially benefited by the deaths of the sons who were killed, that is, if there was anything in that.</P>
    <P>I have taken up the line, and it was taken up by the President when this matter was first discussed, that if there is no pecuniary loss we are not going to pay compensation.  We are not going to dry the tears of the relatives with bank notes, and I think that is a very sound thing.  One might very easily talk about a human life and say, is it worth only £50?  We are not attempting to pay anyone for human life, but we are attempting substantially to relieve the hardship which a death causes.  We pay only where there is damage that can be measured in money. I think if Deputies will look into the matter they will find very many cases come under that heading.  Some time ago a young child was killed; that is a case again where we are asked to dry the tears with banknotes.  Cases were mentioned by some Deputies, and I confess I have not looked into them all myself, but Deputy Morrissey mentioned a case where a girl was disfigured because of bullet wounds.  But even though her earning capacity as a dressmaker, or whatever she was, was impaired&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the circumstances were, but if she was only laid up for five months and her earning capacity impaired for that time that would be a small matter.  But <Col N="1057" /> although her earning capacity was not permanently impaired there might be reason in a case of a young woman to give compensation for disfigurement that resulted from injuries, and that is a matter that I will promise the Deputy to look into.</P>
      <P>I will look into the case that Deputy Nagle mentioned.  There, no doubt, there is difficulty in regard to people residing in the Six Counties, who were never out of the Six Counties, and who were injured and now claim compensation to be paid by us.  It is very much like some other payments we had to make and it is very doubtful whether it would be proper to make it.  So that if we were to make payments of that kind I doubt whether it would be proper for the Ministry of Finance to make those payments without putting the amount into a special vote and bringing it in that special way under the notice of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>That is only an individual case, and that presents special features.  That probably was a real case, but there were a big number of cases that have not the special feature that particular case has.  I can only repeat to Deputies that if any case is shown to me I am willing to have any case sent back to the committee for reconsideration. If there is further pressure&mdash;I am afraid I could not do it in a very large number of cases&mdash;but I am prepared in a reasonable number of cases to examine the whole papers and evidence so far as I can get them, and take my stand upon that in the Dáil. I have not refused to accept the recommendation of the committee in any case.  I do not think it would be at all a possible position for the Minister for Finance to exceed the amount, although I do not know whether there is any technical point that would make it impossible to exceed the amount recommended.  It would be improper to exceed the amounts recommended, or to put pressure on the committee <Col N="1058" /> to recommend an amount greater than they thought proper.  But the committee is really very sympathetic. It is a committee which, in addition to a judge who may take a strict legal view, has two laymen on it&mdash;one of them a doctor&mdash;and in the cases presented to me, and I have examined at least twelve or fifteen of them, or thereabouts, I found the committee has acted quite fairly and without undue stringency.  I will discuss any case with any Deputy who brings it forward, but I must say that the investigations that I have carried out so far have given me every confidence in the committee.  They have to take a rather hard line, and remember that the time during which large sums were paid in compensation in the case of death was only a very short period.  Ordinarily, if a person gets injured in a row there is no compensation due.  We are trying to pay no more than will meet a fair pecuniary loss.</P>

      <P>May I ask for a little more information in regard to the terms of reference, and perhaps also about the interpretation of the terms of reference.  It is quite obvious that there must be some guiding principle actuating the committee in suggesting awards.  Though the Minister says that the earning capacity in the case of injured persons, or the extent of dependency in the case of one who lost his life were the things that have to be taken into account, the committee must be guided by some principle in relation to these two factors.  What is that guiding principle?  Is it based upon some scale, or is it purely optional and arbitrarily at their discretion?  Is it so many years' dependency?  What kind of principle is at work determining the amount of the award?  One reason why I ask this is that there is abroad a belief based upon a statement made, I think, in the Dáil about compensation between the Saorstát Government and the British Government of a sum, I think, of £900,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that was a separate case.  There was an impression <Col N="1059" /> abroad that this £900,000 was the fund out of which the total compensation was to be paid and fitted into.  The Minister's repudiation of that will, perhaps, help to dispel that false opinion.  But in any case, it would be desirable that the House should be made aware of whether there is any ratio established between the amount of the award in the case of injury, and the earning capacity, or in the case of death and dependency the number of years dependency, or what other ratio is taken into account.  What other standard of compensation or allowance or grant is taken in fixing the amount of compensation or of the grant.  There seems to be a general impression that there has been very great variation according to the class of case brought forward.  I cannot suggest any examples.  I do not want to, but the impression is widely held that there has been discrimination in favour of certain sections of the public and against others.  I have no knowledge, whatever, whether there is any justification for that, but if we could be informed that there is a basis on which compensation shall be paid, apart from the mere chance whether one or two or three members of the Committee may be present, whether they have had digestible breakfasts or not&mdash;a chance of that kind might affect the award unless there is a guiding principle, and it would be well if we were made aware of whether such principle exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing was laid down from the Government with regard to scale except really the terms of reference, which stated that these factors should be taken into consideration, and that the Committee should give what was fair and reasonable. That is as detailed as in many cases you find in law for a judge.  You will find laws which state that judges are to give what is reasonable compensation and which means that they are to take all the factors into account.  In any cases that have come before me I know the committee have taken into account, for instance, in cases of a deceased person the age of the children and the actuarial expectation of life of <Col N="1060" /> the deceased person, having regard to his age.  They took the ordinary life insurance tables and found out what was his income, had regard to his expectation of life, made a calculation for his support, took into account what amount the family would get from his life insurance, and so on.  So far as the cases I have seen are concerned, they have taken all the factors it seemed to me, or anybody in my Department, could reasonably be taken into account, but there is no scale laid down.  You have to have regard to the circumstances of, say, the family, or the injured person, before the injury or death took place, but you do not lay down a fixed scale of, say, 35/- a week in the case of death.  There is no scale of that kind laid down; it is left to the Committee to examine all the circumstances and to make their award having regard to them.</P>

      <P>This is a copy of a resolution which has been passed by the Executive Council and which, in the opinion of the Executive Council, ought to be placed before the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Executive Council, being aware that large numbers of persons have been or are likely to be apprehended in respect of crimes committed or alleged to have been committed by them during the period hereinafter mentioned and having considered the reports of police and other officers responsible for the maintenance of law and order, is of opinion that no useful purpose would be served by the institution or continuance of prosecutions in respect of criminal acts committed or alleged to have been committed between the 6th day of December, 1921, and the 12th day of May, 1923, in any case in which it appears that the act was committed or purported to be committed in connection, directly or indirectly, with the state of rebellion and public disturbances created by the recent attempt to overthrow by force the lawfully established Government <Col N="1061" /> of Saorstát Eireann (including the Provisional Government), whether such connection arises from the act having been or purporting to have been committed in the course of the said rebellion and public disturbances or in aid or furtherance of the same or in the course or in aid or furtherance of the suppression of the said rebellion and public disturbances, and the Executive Council hereby declare and puts on record its considered opinion that the highest interests of the State and the promotion of the reign of law and order now happily restored would best be served by the responsible officers of the State discontinuing or refraining from instituting criminal proceedings in any such case as aforesaid, and, so far as it lawfully may so do, the Executive Council directs all officers of the State concerned in the administration of the law to act in accordance with the views hereinbefore expressed.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>But cannot the Minister say quite definitely that all cases which arise in that connection should be released?  There is, on the one hand, a man who was successful in escaping arrest, and on the other a man who was not so successful.  In the second case the man is being imprisoned, and in the first he is running no risk of imprisonment.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be well if the President said what is the significance of the date, 12th May, 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the date for compensation in respect of either property or personal injuries, which was, properly speaking, fixed as the date on which it could be reasonably said that disturbances came to an end.  Persons who had property destroyed during the period would get compensation, if their property was destroyed before the 12th May, 1923. At that time we had an examination of such damage and, generally, we came to the conclusion that the 12th May, 1923, was a reasonable date, and has been so fixed in the Act, that is, as far as compensation for damage to property and compensation for personal injury are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>Why I raised the point is that it is my recollection that it is only a few days before this so-called &ldquo;Call off of the War Order&rdquo; was issued by Mr. de Valera, and I think we ought to appreciate the terribly unfortunate position in which a large number of young people in the country were put by the fact that, while washing his hands and standing inside what he called a wall of glass, Mr. de Valera was understood to be supporting this particular type of war, and we know the type of leadership that he gave, in an occult kind of way, to a large mass of misled and misdirected young people.  It is quite possible that the aftermath of that ran over, in small groups, or even with individual people, into a period of a month, or two months, or three months subsequent to May, 1923.  I think that everybody would wish in cleaning up this particular period that it should be thoroughly cleaned up, and that no odd cases would arise that would drag on that particular period, or drag on the feeling that was aroused in different parts of the country through the followingup of cases that some people say were actions taken with a patriotic purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As it stands, this particular date, I think, is something like a fortnight after some announcement <Col N="1063" /> was made that the disturbances were to cease.  Now, we have got to fix a date; the date that is fixed is a generous date.  Major operations had long since ceased, if there were ever such things as major operations, and I think that in fixing a date we were practically committed to fixing the same date in respect of this as we fixed in the case of property and of personal injuries.  It is a very big act on the part of the Executive Council, big in all its bearings; it is a very serious act.  I suppose that in the whole course of its existence it never did an act more serious than this, and one which <Col N="1064" /> evilly-disposed persons might canvass for a lengthened period.  In that respect I think that we had no option but to fix this particular date, and even though there were misled and misdirected people who misconducted themselves after that date, I think that the law has its own claim on them and that they must subscribe to the law of the land.</P>
