      <P>asked the President if he will state whether it is the intention of the Government to make any provision by way of pension, compensation, or gratuity in respect of the men of the Connaught Rangers who were convicted in India for their Irish sympathies, and if he will see that the men who have been unable to secure employment since their release from prison are placed on equal terms with the dismissed and resigned R.I.C. men.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No statutory authority exists for the payment of pensions, compensation or gratuities to men of the Connaught Rangers who were convicted in India for their Irish sympathies, and the Government has not had the matter under consideration. If the Deputy will supply me with details of any cases of distress amongst these men, I will consider whether any remedial action can be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether a number of demonstrators and teachers in the College of Science have been dismissed or are under notice of dismissal, and, <Col N="2636" /> if so, whether he will state the reasons for this action; further, if it is the intention to continue in the College of Science, without any reduction, the scientific courses of instruction for which those buildings were erected and equipped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE, replying</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has asked me to read the following reply:&mdash;I am not aware that any member of the recognised teaching staff of professors, lecturers, or demonstrators at the College of Science has been dismissed or is under notice of dismissal. I am informed, however, that it has been customary to employ in the College laboratories a staff of assistant demonstrators and extra assistant demonstrators, and it has been found necessary in the present state of the country's finances to fix the number of these officials at a maximum of seven. I understand that this arrangement involves a termination of the employment at the end of the present session of six extra assistant demonstrators. The assistant and extra assistant demonstrators are appointed from year to year, and the termination of their office is not correctly described as dismissal.</P>
      <P>In reply to the last part of the question, I wish to state that the position of the College is at present under consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the Carlow Rural District Council contracted for the erection of a wall around the new cemetery at Leighlin Bridge, over twelve months ago; that the work has not been proceeded with because of the delay in sanctioning the contract, and whether, seeing that a large number of unemployed in the district will benefit by this work, he will expedite sanction at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT and PUBLIC HEALTH (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Carlow Rural District Council at a meeting in April, 1923, accepted a tender in this matter, involving an expenditure of £830 and rejected one for £796.  They were subsequently informed that their action was one which they would have to justify before the Auditor.  The Council then deferred consideration of the work.</P>
      <P>In November, 1923, they again advertised, and apparently received only one tender, which would involve an expenditure of about £930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2638" /> On April 14th last they forwarded the proposed plans for sanction.  These were incomplete; the Council were informed accordingly, but they have not since forwarded the further documents necessary.  I will expedite consideration of the proposals as soon as they are received.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that litigants from Kilbrittan, Co. Cork, have to travel twelve miles to Clonakilty District Court; and whether, in view of the fact that the old courthouse in which courts were held fortnightly under the old régime is still available at Timoleague, he will arrange for a monthly sitting of the court at Timoleague.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for INDUSTRY and COMMERCE (Mr. McGilligan), replying</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the Minister's reply:&mdash;I am aware that some residents in the most easterly parts of Kilbrittan may have to travel about twelve miles in order to attend Clonakilty District Court, but I am not satisfied that that circumstance constitutes any very striking hardship, or that it is desirable to reopen the court at Timoleague.  Attendance at a District Court is not a <Col N="2639" /> very frequent incident in a countryman's life.  I take it that if any one person found it necessary to make this journey once every year, on an average, he would be considered rather litigious. It is the opinion of the Department, and the opinion seems to be shared by almost everybody, that there were too many Petty Sessions Courts under the old régime, and it must be remembered that more courts mean more District Justices and more District Court Clerks.  We have in fact about halved the number of courts, and obviously that cannot be done without making the journey to court somewhat longer than formerly.</P>
      <P>The most I can promise the Deputy is to keep the matter in view when the District Courts under the Court of Justice Act are being settled.</P>

      <P>Mr. Gill was not actually in possession of a bicycle when arrested on the 3rd July, 1922.  It appears that either he or a companion, who was with him, but who was not apprehended, had a bicycle when sighted by troops.  The bicycle was abandoned in their attempt to elude arrest.  At the time, on being questioned, Mr. Gill denied that he either owned or was in possession of the bicycle.  The bicycle cannot now be traced.  In the circumstances of the case it is not proposed to entertain any claim for compensation.</P>

      <P>Mr. McGahan was not entitled to the benefits of Defence Order No. 20, which was in operation only during the period when general demobilisation was in progress and when all N.C.O.'s and men were required to pass a strict medical examination and to re-attest at lower rates of pay or take their discharges.  That period extended up to the 31st March last.  Mr. McGahan was not demobilised. He re-attested on the 29th November last for six months, and left the Army in the ordinary way on the 29th ultimo, on completion of service. I am, however, considering the desirability of extending the period covered by the Defence Order mentioned.  When a decision has been reached Mr. McGahan's case will be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>A cheque for £2 15s. has been forwarded to Mrs. McGahan in respect of dependents' allowance due to her up to the date of her husband's discharge from the Army.  I regret that I am unable to comply with the Deputy's suggestion to issue a railway voucher to her and her five children.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for LANDS and AGRICULTURE (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained the reasons for this Bill and the provisions and implications of the Bill at considerable length on First Reading, and I need not go over that ground again.</P>
      <P>If the option allowed is exercised by all county councils then instead of paying a rate this year of £2,315,000 out of agricultural land the rate payable will be £771,666 and the amount of the abatement will be £1,543,334.  This money will be borrowed by the county councils from the banks, with which they keep account and may be repaid by an annuity extending over a period of not more than seven years. The annual payment of interest and sinking fund for the seven year period approximates to about £250,000.  If the scheme is applied to two typical cases: (A) who owes one year's arrears, and who is in addition liable for his current rate, and (B) who owes no arrears, and is only liable for his current rate, and if it is assumed that the rates payable out of agricultural land for the year 1923/24 and 1924/25 are the same, viz., £60 in each case for the year 1923-24, and £57 in each case for the year 1924/25, the position will be made quite clear.  (A) will pay his year's arrears £60, plus one-third of the current rate, £19&mdash;a total amount of £79&mdash;and his abatement will be £38. (B) who owes no arrears will pay £19 out of his current rate of £57 and will be relieved to the same extent, viz., £38.  In each case, instead of paying £38 this year each will pay it over a period of seven years from the 31st day of March, 1925, and the first payment will be made in 1925-26.</P>
      <P>There is just one Clause of the Bill to which I wish to draw Deputies attention. It is Section 4, (5) and it reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a County Council makes default in the payment of any sum payable in respect of a loan borrowed under this section, the Minister may on complaint being made to him by the person to whom such sum is payable and after notification to the <Col N="2646" /> County Council concerned direct that the amount of such sum shall be deducted from the amount payable to the County Council out of the agricultural grant, and the sum so deducted shall be paid to such person in discharge of such sum; providing that this enactment shall be without prejudice to the Guaranteed Fund under the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This clause gives the security of the Agricultural Grant to the banks for the necessary loan.  The banks have met us very fairly in this matter, and on the strength of this Clause are ready to facilitate by lending the money at five per cent. and making the necessary arrangements to accept repayment over a period of seven years from the 31st March, 1925, by equal annual instalments.</P>
    <P>The interest and sinking fund under the scheme will be comparatively small in view of the considerable period over which the loan is to be repaid, and there will be no excuse whatever for any county council who fails to collect it and who thereby forces the Minister for Local Government to make a draw on the quota of the agricultural grant applicable to that county.  I beg to move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>We feel that this Bill is a very doubtful blessing.  Those of us in the country who have paid our rates will find very little protection in this Bill.  It means that payment is only deferred and that we pay interest on the money.  The Minister says that interest will be £6 10s.</P>

      <P>In addition to paying the rates, we will also have to pay interest as we go along, and ultimately the entire amount will have to be paid. Of course, I recognise that it is a benefit to the State to make people pay arrears.  It may be possible to pay arrears in this fashion, but those who have paid their rates will regard this measure as a very doubtful blessing indeed. It is a case of &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  We are told to <Col N="2647" /> wait for better times, but there may not be better times, and if the times be not better and we still have to pay, matters will be worse.  It is a measure to meet an exceptional situation, and for that reason, and for that reason only, we accept it.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is agreed, if it is proposed to take the Second Reading one day and the Committee Stage the day following.  This is not a non-contentious Bill.  It is a Bill which, as far as I can find out, outside the Government benches, has very little approval.  It is a Bill which involves very important principles indeed. <Col N="2648" /> When any Bill is not merely formal or technical, I should object to the Committee Stage being taken on the day following the Second Reading.  It does not give Deputies a chance to draft amendments.  Certainly, if in conjunction with that, we are to be called on to pass the Bill through all its Stages the day after the Second Reading, I think it is an abuse of the forms of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been on the Order Paper for nearly a fortnight. It is a Bill of five sections, and every Deputy must know the terms of the Bill inside and out in these circumstances. While Deputy Cooper is technically correct in stating that it is not exactly regular or correct to put down the Committee Stage for the day after the Second Reading, nevertheless, he has not, I suggest to him, stated the merits in the circumstances of this particular case.  The Bill is really an urgent Bill, if it is to be passed at all, and that is a matter for the Dáil.  It is an urgent Bill in view of the fact that the collection of rates can only go ahead after the Bill is passed.  It should be decided as quickly as possible one way or the other.  The Bill has been on the Order Paper for about a fortnight, and has been circulated for some time.  It is quite a simple Bill.  Every Deputy has had an opportunity of making himself acquainted with the provisions, and I suggest to Deputy Cooper, in all the circumstances, that though he is technically correct, as between the two of us, he has hardly got the merits in this particular case.</P>

      <P>I have had ample opportunity of considering such amendments as I myself wish to put down, but I have had no opportunity of considering such amendments as Deputies Johnson or Gorey, or any other Deputy, might put down.  I would suggest to the Minister that it is hardly fair even to the officials of the Dáil&mdash;as amendments should not be handed in before the Second Reading&mdash;that they should have amendments handed in now and have to circulate them to Deputies by to-morrow morning.  If the Minister reconsiders it, I think he will see it is not a proper way of doing business, rushing business like this.  I realise the necessities <Col N="2649" /> of the case, and I am not anxious to obstruct the Bill in any way, but it places those who do not sit on the Government benches in a wholly unfair position.  We are liable afterwards to have it said to us, &ldquo;Why didn't you object to this, and why didn't you object to that?&rdquo;  while really we have no time to object to anything at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins) Kevin O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to introduce a reform which was introduced in England in the year 1898. Previous to that time, a defendant was not a competent or a compellable witness at any stage of criminal proceedings, and that principle was extended to cover this: that the wife or husband of a defendant was not a competent or a compellable witness.  In the year 1898 an Act, entitled the Criminal Evidence Act, was passed in England, enabling a defendant to give evidence in his own defence if he so choose.  Previous to that Act, there had been some minor exceptions made in the Married Women's Property Act of 1882, and in the Evidence Act of 1877.  But the first substantial exception applied to this country was in an Act of 1903&mdash;the Motor Car Act.  In relation to prosecutions under that Act the principle was extended that the accused person could give evidence on his own behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reform has been for some time back demanded from all quarters of the legal profession, by barristers and by solicitors.  I do not know of any other country in which the defendant is precluded from giving evidence on his own behalf.  There were reasons why the <Col N="2650" /> Act was not extended to Ireland in 1898, and why the Parliamentary Party of the day opposed its extension to Ireland. At about that time political prosecutions were common, and the suggestion was that the administration of the law was unfair in its dealings with people charged with political offences.  It was considered better that accused persons could not be subject to cross-examination, and should not be entitled even to go into the witness-box. Conditions have changed, and it is now rather a hardship that a person charged with an offence may not himself give his own version of things and his own account of his whereabouts and of the relevant circumstances in connection with the charge.</P>
    <P>There are, as Deputies know, many cases in which the evidence was mainly circumstantial and Deputies who ever served on juries are familiar with the plea put up that the only person with a real knowledge of the facts is precluded by law from tendering evidence. This Bill removes that disability.  It does not make the accused person a compellable witness, but it provides that at his own selection he may give evidence in connection with the criminal charge.  Deputies will note in Section I, the conditions or provisos attached to the general principle that an accused person may give evidence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a person so charged shall not be called as a witness in pursuance of this Act except upon his own application:</P>
    <P>(b)  the failure of any person charged with an offence, or of the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged, to give evidence shall not be made the subject of any comment by the prosecution:</P>
    <P>(c)  the wife or husband of the person charged shall not, save as in this Act mentioned, be called as a witness in pursuance of this Act except upon the application of the person so charged:</P>
    <P>(d)  nothing in this Act shall make a husband compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during the marriage, or a <Col N="2651" /> wife compellable to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during the marriage:</P>
    <P>(e)  a person charged and being a witness in pursuance of this Act may be asked any question in cross-examination notwithstanding that it would tend to criminate him as to the offence charged.</P>
    <P>It is considered desirable now to apply here that principle which has existed in England since 1898, that an accused person may, if he so wishes, give his own version of the occurrences revelant to the charge.  This is an appropriate time to make these reforms in the administration of the law.  I think the principle embodied in the Bill will be one that will be generally approved by the public at large, as it is generally approved by the legal profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us whether there is general satisfaction in these countries where this provision has been made?  I imagine the objection that was originally put forward was that the failure of a prisoner to elect to give evidence on his own behalf would be likely taken by a jury as somewhat prejudicial to his plea of innocence.  The very fact that a prisoner declined or omitted to apply for leave to give evidence on his own behalf might be taken by a jury as a tacit admission of guilt, or at least anything he might say might be taken as going to prove his guilt, and therefore he would decline to give evidence.  I have no definite views on the matter, but I would like some assurance from the Minister that the provision in the Act of 1898 has been satisfactory, and that in general it has been approved in England since it was adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak with any first-hand or definite knowledge on the subject.  I do understand that there is no complaint of unfairness arising out of the principle that was recognised in English law in 1898, and that there is general satisfaction with regard to it.  If any Deputy knows of any other country in which an accused person is, by law, debarred from tendering evidence I would be glad to hear of it.  My information is that <Col N="2652" /> there is no country except Ireland in which that state of affairs still prevails &mdash;that a prisoner can offer no evidence on his own behalf.  We have to ask ourselves what, after all, is the real object of a trial.  It is not a battle of wits; it is to ascertain the true facts of the situation.  Deputy Johnson suggests that the election of an accused person not to give evidence may be taken by the jury as an unfavourable circumstance. We have tried to meet that to this extent, that the counsel for the State will be precluded from commenting upon that fact.  We cannot, of course, get into the minds of the jury men and prevent them from drawing conclusions unfavourable to the prisoner.  It is simply a question of where the balance is: whether it is a wise and proper thing to continue here a system by which a prisoner was absolutely excluded, even if he strongly desired to do so, from offering evidence with regard to a serious charge under which he lay.  We have come to the conclusion that it is an anachronism and an anomaly that ought to be removed in our system of criminal justice.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister for Justice that, in the interests of justice it is time that the law in this country was brought up to date in this respect.  As to the unfavourability towards the prisoner, I also believe it would be impossible to strike a balance in the matter.  The fact that a prisoner has not been allowed to give evidence in the past has been often dwelt upon by his counsel, and to that extent the prisoner may have benefited, but the object of the prosecution is, as the Minister has stated, to get at the true facts of the case and to administer justice accordingly.  Therefore, I, for one, welcome this Bill.  I would like to know if the Minister could inform the Dáil whether he believes that this Bill will be in operation as an Act before the next Commission, which is to take place shortly in Green Street, Courthouse, Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.  I do not know whether Deputies are aware of the fact that within the last six months quite a number of actions have been started in the courts for, or in respect of, property which was commandeered during the period from, I suppose, 1919, up to the time of the Truce.  Now, in some cases&mdash;I could say the vast majority of cases&mdash; the goods were commandeered by order of a higher authority than the person who actually carried out the action.  In the case of proceedings which have been commenced there against a person who commandeered any property, and in some cases that have been brought under my notice, very considerable loss will be sustained by those persons who were acting under authority but who are unable to establish that authority in the courts in the absence of some such protection as we anticipate will be afforded by this measure. Considerable unrest has been occasioned by these proceedings and by the decrees which have been granted in respect of them.  The Bill proposes to put a stay on such proceedings and establish this method for affording compensation for the loss of such property as may have been commandeered. There has also been a considerable amount of misgiving with regard to certain acts done during that period, and I think it will be within the recollection of the House that from the early period of the setting up of the Free State Government we gave an indemnity to British soldiers, or persons who were authorised on behalf of the British Government, to do certain acts here during that period.  This measure only gives the same rights and privileges to those who were acting under the authority of Dáil Eireann, of either the First or Second Dáil, as set out in the first section.  There is also a clause dealing with the validation of sentences and the execution of sentences <Col N="2654" /> of military tribunals, and Section 4 deals with the setting up of the Committee which I have mentioned.  Section 5 deals with the assessment and payment of compensation in certain cases.  Section 2, I should remark, sets up the certificates of Ministers as evidence in certain cases.  That, in substance, is what is in the Bill.  I think it will be non-contentious.  I should have expressed regret for not having introduced it long before this, and I hope it will afford some satisfaction to such persons that even at this late hour we are giving authority which should have been given long since.</P>

      <P>I am glad that such a Bill has been introduced. It has obviously been necessary, because there have been cases of considerable hardship which can be met only by such a measure as this.  After all, we are the Fourth Dáil, and actions have previously been taken by our predecessors. I cover what I have to say by that preface, because the President knows, and I know, that there were cases where action was taken, of which neither he nor anybody at that time would like to have stood in defence, but they probably would be covered by this Bill as it now reads.  I am not quite sure how the matter would stand. I will refrain from going into particulars in any particular case, but I will recall his mind to one which was, I think, familiar to him at the time.  It came up very strongly.  It was a case where life was taken and action at the time pended and did not proceed because of peculiar circumstances that prevailed during those months, but that person could, I think, if the proofs could be available now, still be covered under Section 1, sub-section (1), paragraph (a) or (b).  I know that it is not the intention that this Bill should be used as a cover for any action taken at the time under the just reprobation of those in authority, but I am not sure whether the drafting of it&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;would not lend that colour, as it reads, and, I think, that precautions ought to be taken that actions which were then justly reprobated might not now be covered by any indemnity extended in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult <Col N="2655" /> to satisfy my judgment on this Bill.  I realise that there may be very many cases where some kind of indemnification should be given, but I am afraid that the Bill is so wide that we may be parties to indemnifying acts that we could not, if we knew the circumstances, and knew the cases, bring ourselves to do.  One difficulty also which I find in the Bill is that it is leaving Executive Ministers to decide whether a person is to be indemnified or not.  I think that that is a blot, and I think that it is a very unsatisfactory provision.  It may have been easy when dealing with acts of soldiers of the Army or officers of the State, in the case of the last Indemnity Bill, to say that it was for Ministers to determine whether such a person committing such an act was doing it by authority, but we have a period ending on the 28th June, 1922, defined here.  That deals with the period during which there were many actions which have been denounced high and low as being rebellious and irregular.  It is apparently to be for the Ministers to say whether a person committing such an act, say from the signing of the Treaty to the 20th June, was acting with authority or not.  I am not able to speak very definitely as to the position of the military forces of Dáil Eireann during that intermediate period.  I do not know whether it would be said that members of the Republican Army had ceased to be members of the Republican Army at any given date, or whether that date is the 20th June or earlier.  I think it is hardly reasonable to say, if an act was committed by any person before the 20th June, that he sided with the Government forces, and that then it is for the Ministers to determine that that was an act to be indemnified against, but that if he happened to be a person who went on the other side, that person was not to be indemnified.  It may be urged that we have a right to give full weight to the impartiality of Ministers and that they will give their certificates, no matter which side was taken by soldiers or civil officers.  I think it is not reasonable to put that strain upon the public or upon the Ministers. There were acts committed after the Treaty which I think we might find it <Col N="2656" /> difficult, if a specific case was put to us, to justify or excuse.  Therefore I feel some doubt and hesitation in agreeing to an Indemnity Bill of this character which is so very wide in its survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put to the Minister a specific case.  The I.R.A. existed until the 28th June, and there had been differences, very acute differences, but there had been some sort of collaboration up to quite a late date in that month.  It would be difficult to say, unless we are partisans, which we may be held to be, certainly on this matter&mdash; it might be difficult to say so far as a court of justice would be concerned which was the authority in the I.R.A. up to that date.  But we have defined that date for a definite reason, the reason being that it was about the time that the attack on the Four Courts was initiated.  Acting on the instructions of superior officers, certain motor cars were taken in the City of Dublin, an act which we reprobate.  But it might be claimed under this Bill to be an act that is to be wiped off the slate, and it is for the Minister to say whether it should be or not.  No charge was to lie against people who entered a garage in Baggot Street unless Ministers say that such a charge was to lie.  I cannot reconcile myself to that position.  I should like to be able to say that everything has been cleaned up, and that the circumstances are such as to allow us, notwithstanding a knowledge or assurance that guilt, actual moral fault perhaps, was in question, to begin a clean sheet and indemnify all persons generally against the consequences of their acts.  But this Bill is so wide in its sweep that it is left to the discretion of a Minister to certify whether such and such an act by such and such a person was justified in the circumstances. That is asking rather much of the Dáil, and I feel it would be necessary to have a good deal more explanation of the necessity in all these cases than we have had.  I can understand many classes of case where indemnification of this kind should be given, but I am not satisfied that the indemnity should be given at this date in all cases that may come forward and subject only to the discretion of the Minister who would certify <Col N="2657" /> the legitimacy&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;of these acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the ambiguity of this Bill and the powers left to the discretion of the Minister certainly warranted that we should have got more information from the President on the Second Reading.  It is very hard to understand all the sections in the Bill and their application.  And I am wondering what is going to be the position of a person who in the Spring of 1922 supplied goods, such as bread and things of that kind, to troops.  I have cases in my mind where people were in the habit of supplying bread and clothes to the troops from the signing of the Treaty up to, say, June or July, 1922; and I have myself presented some of their accounts for payment to the Ministry of Defence, and have met with refusal so far as part of the accounts is concerned.  I should like the Minister to make it perfectly clear what the position of such people is to be under this Bill.  As I said before the Ministry accepted responsibility for a period during which such accounts were contracted, but have denied and refuse to accept responsibility for another period.  I do think that when it became apparent to the Ministry and the Government that certain I.R.A., as they were called at that time, had broken away in certain districts in the Saorstát, the shopkeepers who they knew were in the habit of supplying food and goods to particular battalions should have been circularised, and I also hold that the Ministry should be responsible up to at least the 28th June, that is the date mentioned in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know, and I am sure that the Ministry know, that some I.R.A. were supposed to have broken away as far back as March, 1922, and in one of the cases which I spoke about at the beginning of my statement the Ministry agreed to accept responsibility in the Wexford area up to that date.  I question whether the Ministry were right in that case.  Although certain officers from the Wexford area came to a conference in Dublin, and to all intents and purposes severed their connection with the Government at the particular conference held then, it was some months afterwards before the rank and <Col N="2658" /> file of the battalion tore themselves away from the proper authority.  And in view of the fact that in March, 1922, a conference was agreed to by the Second Dáil, and was held between the two sections in the Army, I hold that anything that happened prior to that should have been accepted as a responsibility by the Government when they accepted that conference as a medium to try and bring the two opposing sections of the Army together.  I think that is sound reasoning, and I think it ought to be accepted by the Minister. I should like the Minister to make it perfectly clear what is the position of traders who did supply troops in the different areas during that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that when I first read this Bill I found myself in almost the same position of perplexity as the two last speakers. The measure, as an indemnity one, certainly is of the widest possible character. It amounts in effect to a blank cheque and that blank cheque is to be in the power of an Executive Minister to endorse.  Now, sir, I think that the arguments put forward by Deputy Johnson against the Executive or against Executive Ministers having such a power, both from their own point of view as well as from the point of view of the State, are sound.</P>
      <P>We find in the Bill that the certificate is to be one signed by an Executive Minister.  I presume that that means an Executive Minister of the present or the future Government in existence at the time during which he signs the certificate.  Now, on the face of the Bill it really may come to this: that one Executive Minister may from his knowledge&mdash;I will not say his inclinations&mdash; be inclined to sign a certificate and another Executive Minister may not be so inclined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, I think that the Dáil should ask for an assurance that this signature of an Executive Minister should be the signature of that Minister with the authority or acting upon the authority of the Executive. It is very difficult for an ordinary person to know from perusing this Bill where this indemnity begins and where it ends.  It is perfectly true that dates are given, but then it is to <Col N="2659" /> refer to &ldquo;any act, matter, or thing done,&rdquo; which really covers anything and everything.  As regards the dates, there is a great deal to be said for what Deputy Corish has said in regard to the period when certain shopkeepers in the country supplied goods to troops when actually those troops may not have been at the moment acting under authority, or under the instructions of the Provisional Government.  I have had instances myself where goods were supplied to troops up to the 12th May, 1922, and when these troops were, let us say, the successors&mdash;at any rate they occupied the same premises though they had severed their allegiance from the Free State Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the army of occupation <i>de facto</i>, but, perhaps, not <i>de jure.</i>  However, I would suggest to Deputy Corish, if the Damage to Property Act were properly interpreted, and from my knowledge I believe it is being so interpreted in the districts which I am acquainted with, these people should be entitled to compensation for goods supplied to these troops because, though they may not have been taken by physical force, at any rate, the moral pressure was such that the traders of the town could not very well have refrained from supplying the occupants of the barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, may I say that that is an entirely different thing to what I spoke about. It is a question of an officer sending down an ordinary application form for goods which was continuous at this time, when the troops were properly recognised by the Government.  It was not a matter of commandeering at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a matter of commandeering at all; that is just what I was saying.  Though there may not have been physical force in the matter, the moral pressure was such that though the trader knew that this officer was not at the time belonging to that portion of the I.R.A. which adhered to the Free State still he practically had to supply these goods. I suggest, therefore, to meet this case it would be well if the President or the <Col N="2660" /> Minister in charge of this Bill could make it known that that was the intention of the Government when they passed the Damage to Property Act. if that is not the case, and if the Damage to Property Act does not apply to those cases, then certainly these traders will have, and must have, a genuine grievance.  The case that has been made out by Deputy Corish is a just and a proper one, but I think if the Minister will inquire into the matter he will find that at any rate up to the 12th May, 1922, which is the final date of the period covered by the Damage to Property Act, any goods so supplied in such circumstances would be and mostly have been treated by the judges as goods which had been taken, if not by physical, certainly by moral pressure, by Irregulars, and they have awarded compensation or made reports, as is actually the case, under the Damage to Property Act.  That being so, that does not get the ordinary Deputy away from the vagueness of this whole Bill.  I must confess once more that I do not know what the Bill applies to.  I know the period during which it applies.  I do not understand what Executive Minister is to be detailed, if any is to be detailed, by the Executive to sign these certificates.  I do not know whether if one Executive Minister refuses to sign them that another will be entitled to do so, and I think on these points generally it is not asking too much to ask for some further explanation from the Minister in charge of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, sir, that the Bill is quite as indefinite as some of the Deputies who have spoken would suggest.  I can see from the Bill that it deals with the actions of persons holding office under the first Dáil Eireann or under the Second Dáil Eireann or being in some other way responsible to either one or other of those Parliaments.  I do suggest that it would be impossible that this Dáil would consider providing an indemnity at the present moment for any persons others than those serving the First or Second Dáil during the period mentioned in this particular Bill.  The only other persons who are there to be indemnified are the persons opposed to serving the Government of the time <Col N="2661" /> and who elected to serve an Irregular Army Council that was set up after the meeting in the Mansion House in March, 1922, or in the months immediately preceding that, or elected, to serve some particular person in the country who had, as a personal matter, broken away from any allegiance that he may have had to the Second Dáil.  I think it would be impossible for this Assembly to consider the question of an indemnity for any such person at the present time.  On the other hand, from the point of view of administration, I quite realise that the Minister responsible for giving a certificate may be faced with very many cases in which the allegiance to the Second Dáil, say in the earlier months of 1922, may be pretty indefinite.  During that time you had a very mixed-up arrangement in different parts of the country.  You had men in organised bodies in different parts of the country who had not definitely disclosed whether their allegiance to the Second Dáil was definitely broken or not.  The Minister administering the Bill will have very many cases in which he will have to use his discretion and exercise his judgment. You have it that in many parts of the country the State was well served by persons who were then, or who became definitely Irregular in the meantime, maintaining the ordinary law of the land.  It will be realised that those persons, in so far as they served the State, are entitled to indemnity.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, you will have cases, such as the case in Dundalk, where men actually in the uniform of the State up to the 28th June and subsequent to that, were actually Irregulars. We had actually to take the barracks from them some time after the 28th June by surprise. We had officers in charge of some of those men there who received moneys from the Second Dáil for the maintenance of these barracks.  They may or may not have spent that money in the maintenance of these men, but they left considerable bills behind them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General MULCAHY General MULCAHY">
      <NameTxt>General MULCAHY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do feel where there were men and officers in the <Col N="2662" /> form of the State holding say, a barracks in Dundalk for the State, that a certain definite responsibility does lie upon the Government for considering any debts left behind by them as soldiers of the State, and in indemnifying traders who supplied them, while there apparently as officers of the State, with food and clothing.</P>
      <P>So that in administration, difficulties will present themselves and I do not know any authority that you can put the responsibility on for deciding those things but the Executive Minister, and I think that Deputy Redmond will be assured by the President that there is no question of one Executive Minister as against another Executive Minister. There will be a prescribed Executive Minister who can certify.  It will be definitely either the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Home Affairs.</P>
      <P>There is just another point; I do not know whether paragraph 5 (3) really covers it.  During the summer of 1921, and running into portion of 1922, the Volunteers had camps.  Now, it is quite possible that in respect of some of those camps&mdash;they did not amount to fifteen in the whole country&mdash;legitimate traders supplied them with food regularly and supplied them with clothing regularly.  In respect of supplies given in that particular way we may find that there are liabilities to be met by the State.  I do not know whether the exact terms of this clause here will allow of it or not but I do hold that the clause should be so drafted as to cover that particular point.  In connection with that, I take it that no doubt the President will take into consideration General Order 28 regarding the commandeering of stores issued on the 7th July, 1921, as well as General Order No. 15, that was issued on the 3rd December, 1920. There is another point in connection with the Bill that I do not think is dealt with, and I think it ought to be, that is, that a date at a reasonable period should be fixed by some authority or another, and perhaps covered by the Bill, as a final date after which claims could not be made.  Otherwise we would have the matter of claims dragging on for two or three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. CONNOR HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I also, in <Col N="2663" /> common with the other Deputies who have preceded me in speaking, view this Bill with mixed feelings.  It is not that I want to be taken as objecting to the principle of indemnity.  But I think it should be restricted in its application. I see here a passage in the First Section under Sub-section (1) (b) which reads: &ldquo;Was done or purported to be done for the purpose or in the course of the struggle to bring about the termination of the rule of the British Government in Ireland, and the establishment and maintenance of the First Dáil Eireann and Second Dáil Eireann...&rdquo; I do not like the implication in that.  It is quite possible that that passage could lead to great abuse.  Human nature is a very perverse thing, and it is quite possible that a person purporting to act under this Dáil could do wrong to a fellow-citizen, a matter which would have really no bearing on the struggle to bring about the termination of the rule of the British Government in Ireland.  As I say, we are not opposing the principle of indemnity.  At least I am not, but seeing that the Irish Volunteers were belligerent forces it naturally follows that the recognised international military code must apply to these sentences against spies which were carried out, and these acts must be regarded as just. But then a good many things have been done, and a number of Courts were set up and a number of fines were imposed and sentences passed which could not stand in reason and equity.  We should like to know from the Minister is it proposed to indemnify those acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another section in this Bill&mdash; it is Sub-section (4) of Section 1&mdash;I would like the Dáil to consider this section. I do not like the principle enunciated there.  I do not think the Dáil ought really to interfere with the judgments of the courts.  It is retrospective legislation.  It is a very bad and a very dangerous principle to admit, and I for one do not like it.  There is a further section here which has unfortunately led to very much abuse through the country.  It is Section 5, Sub-section (3) (i) and (ii).  Of course we must admit that the State is not bound, and that it is not responsible for the <Col N="2664" /> acts of those purporting to act in its name, but I should like it to be made clear that that will not prevent sufferers from illegal actions having the right to apply to the Court for damages against the individuals who caused them losses.  These are my observations on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The general complaint against this measure appears to be that it is too wide and too indefinite. I take it that the real explanation is that we have had no experience in this country of Indemnity Acts.  If the Deputies would peruse the Indemnity Act passed by the British Parliament they would find exactly the same indefiniteness and the same broadness.  We have got to do the thing decently while we are at it.  This measure has to be considered in the light of a great many circumstances and a great many issues, and it is more than possible that by reason of it some things may get indemnity that in ordinary circumstances would not.  I think it will be admitted that in war time, in a period of disturbance, many things happen which most people will reprobate and condemn and so on, but for which there is some excuse by reason of the circumstances of the time.  As far as the indemnity clauses of this measure are concerned, they have been framed in the light of the experience that we have gained from the British Indemnity Act, which was most exhaustive, and afforded the maximum of security to any of their forces and any persons acting under their orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended to indemnify persons who acted under the First and Second Dáil, and both the First Dáil and the Second Dáil had a number of Ministries, each one of which might have initiated or carried out or ordered certain acts which, in the light of the circumstances of to-day, this Dáil would not consider or order or direct to be done, functioning as it is in the open day.  Take, as an instance, the Belfast boycott.  Very few people here would have the temerity to recommend the enforcement of a decree against any country or against any county in that country as was done at that particular time.  But you must recollect the <Col N="2665" /> circumstances of that time.  Practically all the people of one particular religious denomination were driven from their employment and a pogram was instituted against them. The people of the rest of the country were not in a position to assist directly, and they took the only obvious method known to them at the time and instituted a boycott.</P>
    <P>Very few people in a democratic assembly would take up that attitude under normal circumstances.  We must not lose sight of the fact that there were special circumstances at that time which necessitated that order being made and carried out.  Are we now to refuse to give an indemnity to the persons who acted under those circumstances? At the earliest possible opportunity the Provisional Government took-off that particular decree against Belfast.  It had an excellent effect there, and nobody, I am sure, is better pleased than citizens of the Saorstát now that that action was taken, although there were criticisms at the time.</P>
    <P>The Ministry of Home Affairs when it was functioning in those days ordered certain things to be done, and so did the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Local Government.  Those things were not done under the strict letter of the law of Dáil Eireann, because Dáil Eireann was not functioning, though it gave power to the Ministry or the Executive to issue those orders or carry out such acts as were necessary during that period.</P>
    <P>Certain reports might have received sanction, but if we were asked to point to a Statute under which those men carried out orders, we would not be in a position to point to such a Statute. We are now giving an indemnity in respect to those things, and it is an indemnity which those people are entitled to.  Orders were carried out then in good faith, and acts were done, or purported to be done, in order to bring about the termination of the rule of the British Government.</P>

      <P>I did not quite catch the Deputy's question.  As I say, we lack experience of Indemnity Acts. This, as far as our people are concerned, is the first measure we have had to deal with.  Supposing some officer exceeded his duty, or was sent out to do some duty, he has a right to complain now if we do not afford him that protection which I think he is entitled to claim from us.  It has been mentioned that the Executive Council itself should deal with those cases.  I have mentioned instances in which a member of the Executive Council might not be in a position to decide upon a case.  He gets information from his Department. If we were to appoint the Minister for Justice in this connection, he would be bound by whatever information he would get from the Minister for Defence.  The Minister for Defence would be a more suitable person in connection with things affecting his particular Department.  The same would apply to other Ministries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connor Hogan mentioned a case dealt with under Clause 5, sub-section (3), part 3.  It is not intended, as will be seen by that section, to compensate for the billeting of troops.  I should mention that one particular claim came in in respect to the billeting of troops, and it was for three guineas a week for a certain number of months in the year.  It turned out that the person in respect of whom the charge was made was the son of the man who made the charge.  Other cases occurred in which pretty considerable bills came in for the billeting of people, and the rate charged was three guineas per man per week.  An ordinary man would be kept as a paying guest in a place of that sort at, I suppose, a guinea a week.</P>

      <P>Where there were any genuine cases they have been given consideration.  I quite admit that the point made by Deputy Mulcahy is a very good point.  There must be some date on which applications should finally be sent in.  I mentioned already to-day that there were eighteen thousand cases of billeting claims cleared off by the end of March. But claims are coming in still, and at a fairly rapid rate.  I understand they are coming in very rapidly from one quarter of the country where a demobilised officer has recently taken up his residence.  Now we are prepared to discharge liabilities that were undertaken by the State, other than those which are excluded in all fairness, but we are not going to salt the State in order that certain persons will benefit by it.  I do not think the case mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy is covered. That is the case of the camps.  If it be not covered I would be prepared to accept an amendment in order that such cases should be included.  I do not know the terms of General Orders 28 or 15, but I will undertake to look them up.</P>

      <P>I do not know that there was any other point urged in connection with this Bill, except <Col N="2668" /> some matters that were mentioned by Deputy Redmond.  The Damage to Property Act does make provision for certain claims.  I believe that it is possible that quite a number of these claims were not made, but I think that there is a provision in the Act which would entitle the persons concerned to make application to the judge to extend the time.</P>

      <P>Will the President explain the meaning of the date &ldquo;28th June,&rdquo; and what was the position as between the date and the approval of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty?

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the question of the dates of the Second Dáil would come in.  The reason why the 28th June is mentioned is this: there was no statutory authority for the troops that were in uniform and acting under the Provisional Government, or the Second Dáil, at that particular time.  Let us suppose for a moment that they had a man under arrest, that he attempted to escape, and that he was shot.  In that case, while they were acting under orders, there would have been no statutory authority, I take it, for firing.  It would have been their duty to do it, and possibly the officer in charge, or a soldier, would fire a shot, and if the man were killed, an action might lie against him, or a prosecution, and as the other Act, the Indemnity Act of last year, started. I think, on the 28th June, the whole of the period comes in now under either one or other of the Indemnity Acts. The first would have started in January 1919, and run to the Truce; this one now takes it up to cover the whole of the period, so that while those troops or officers of the State, or persons employed, might not have had the statutory authority behind them we are covering it by this indemnity Bill.</P>

The file went away and it is not now recoverable because it is in the possession of the person who was then Minister for Home Affairs.

Deputy Redmond appeared to think that it could be dealt with under the Damage to Property Act.  As I understand it, cases of this kind are dealt with by a court, and when the court has deliberated upon them a report is made.  The person who makes the application does not know what award is made; it is merely a report that is made, and an <i>ex gratia</i> payment is made to the person if it goes in his favour.  I do not think that that is the way to deal with transactions of that kind.</P>

      <P>I explained on the First Reading that this was a contentious Bill, but I want to say at once that it is a contentious Bill only in regard to one particular point. It is, of course, a very important point. It is, if you like, the principle of the whole Bill.  The Bill is a very long one, but the sections that deal with that particular point, which I will outline, are the only sections that can be said to be highly contentious.  This particular subject of improving and standardising the output of our creameries, and improving the methods of marketing, has been discussed by all the interested parties for the last five or six years.  I think this is the third Bill that has been drafted to give effect to what was thought to be required.  These Bills were never introduced.  This is the first Bill introduced, but the provisions of all these Bills were discussed in detail, criticised, reformed, and reconsidered by all the interested parties on various occasions for the last four or five years.  This Bill will be no more contentious than the Egg Bill, but for the big issue, that is to say, whether butter should be graded at the ports or whether the national brand should be given to creameries that are thought fit for that brand after examination and inspection, and on the Ministry being satisfied as to the standards of equipment and technical competence of these creameries.  That is the only contentious issue.  There are contentious details, but except for that issue this Bill would be no more contentious than <Col N="2672" /> the Egg Bill, though it is much longer than the Egg Bill.  The other details of the Bill, I should say, have received more agreement and more examination and consideration by the traders concerned than even the details of the Egg Bill, so that none of us is coming to this subject anew.  We all heard it before, and we discussed it at great length. Though that issue, which I have mentioned requires the most careful consideration, and though there is a lot to be said on both sides, I hope the Bill will not be held up on the grounds that it is a long Bill, and that difficulties will not be put in the way with regard to the other matters that are really not contentious.  The scheme of the Bill is, briefly, as follows:&mdash;All premises in which dairy produce is manufactured for sale must be kept clean and in order; must be suitable for the requirements of the business, and must be provided with an adequate supply of pure water.  That refers to all premises, creameries, butter factories and dairies.</P>
      <P>Any authorised officer on being satisfied on inspection that any premises used for the purpose mentioned does not comply with the requisite conditions of cleanliness and order may serve notice on the occupier requiring the defects to be remedied, and failure to comply with the notice subject to a right of appeal to an arbitrator to be appointed by the Executive Council, will be an offence.</P>
      <P>That is a summary of sections which deal with all premises, creameries, butter factories, and dairies.  These sections attempt to ensure that all premises in which butter is manufactured will be kept clean and in order.  We next come to the supply of milk.  The supplying of dirty milk or cream or milk or cream delivered in a dirty vessel to creameries, cream-separating stations, or other places in which milk or cream is used for manufacturing human food for sale, or its acceptance in such places, and the supplying of dirty butter or its use in butter factories or other places in which butter is used for manufacturing articles of human food, are also made offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is realised that we must go back to the sources, and that we must insist <Col N="2673" /> that the milk supplied to creameries and the butter supplied to butter factories by farmers, the producers, must be clean, and produced under circumstances in which cleanliness is possible. The Bill provides for the registration of, first, creameries; secondly, of cream-separating stations; and, thirdly, other premises used for the manufacture of butter other than creamery butter, for export, that is to say, butter factories. Prior to registering any premises of any of these three classes, the Minister must be satisfied that the premises comply with the conditions of cleanliness and order applicable to all premises used for the manufacture of dairy produce for sale, and in addition the premises must be equipped with certain specified equipment, or such other equipment as the Minister may approve. Regulations will have to be observed by persons carrying on the business on registered premises with a view to securing proper methods of manufacture, and of marketing their produce. The Bill provides for the establishment of a national brand for creamery butter of an approved standard of quality, packing and finish.  Before I go from that point, I want to draw attention again to the classes I have mentioned.  The Bill provides for the registration of creameries, cream-separating stations, and other premises used for the manufacture of butter, that is to say butter factories.  Regulations will be made with regard to cleanliness and equipment for all these institutions, and butter cannot be made there, and butter cannot be exported from them, and cream cannot be collected at the cream-separating stations unless these stations are registered, and they will not be registered until they comply with the conditions of cleanliness and equipment which are considered essential.</P>
    <P>With regard to the national brand, any creamery registered under the Bill will be entitled to obtain from the Minister permission to use the brand so long as the creamery complies with certain approved conditions as to equipment, staff, methods of manufacture, etc., to be prescribed in rules made by the Minister, and so long as the butter ordinarily made at the creamery attains <Col N="2674" /> the requisite standard of quality and packing and finish as determined by examinations of the manufactured butter to be made (a) at the creamery and (b) at surprise butter inspections to be carried out in accordance with rules to be made by the Minister at any place, either at the port of transit or anywhere else.  The creamery, therefore, to get the national brand must first of all be registered; secondly, it must have the standard equipment and the technical competence; but it must have considerably over that required for mere registration.  For instance, no creamery will get the national brand that is not pasteurising.  It is conceivable that a creamery will be allowed to export without pasteurising, but generally the standard of equipment and the technical competence to qualify any creamery for receiving the national brand will be high.  The Minister may at any time by order provide for the granting of the use of the national brand to butter made at premises other than registered creameries subject to compliance with the same conditions as apply in the case of creameries, but modified and adapted so as to meet the special requirements of the premises in which the butter is made. It will not be lawful to export unless (1) the butter is exported direct from a registered creamery; or (2) the butter is exported direct from premises registered under the Act for the manufacture of butter (other than creamery butter) for export; that is to say, exported from a butter factory; or (3) the butter is exported from premises registered in the register of non-manufacturing exporters.  We register certain premises which are not creameries, and which are not butter factories, but which belong to the wholesalers, where butter, perhaps, made in creameries and in factories is exported, and special licences may be obtained for the export of any consignment of butter.</P>
    <P>It will not be lawful to export butter unless every package is marked with a mark or number to be assigned by the Minister to the premises from which it is exported or, in the case of a special licence, to be specified in the licence.  It is proposed to prohibit the <Col N="2675" /> export of any butter not properly packed or marked, or of any butter from a creamery or butter factory containing over 16 per cent. of water.  Possibly, perhaps I should say probably, we will allow an export of butter from premises belonging to somebody who is not a manufacturer, even though that butter contained over 16 per cent. of water.  That may or may not be allowed.  It possibly will be allowed in the beginning.  It will depend on the market and how the trade develops. It possibly may not be allowed later on.  In either event there is a discretion either to allow or forbid it.  The Bill confers ample and drastic powers of inspection of premises where butter is manufactured.</P>
    <P>That is the scheme of the Bill.  As I said before, the debatable issue is, whether butter should be graded at the ports or whether we should give a national brand which would be a mark of premium quality to any butter coming from creameries where the standard of technical competence and equipment is up to the minimum prescribed. That is the issue.  It is felt that we should aim in this country, at least, at something approaching the standard of Denmark; that our aim should be to produce one quality of creamery butter and one quality only, namely, the best.  It will take some time to realise that, but that should be our aim.  If that is our aim, then I think the question as to whether all butter should be graded at the ports and whether we should have a first, second, third or fourth grade, or whether we should give, in the first instance, a national brand to choice butter, and merely allow the export of all other butter fit for export under licence, can be easily decided.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that it is almost common case that, even if we adopted the grading system, we can only grade at the ports with any safety butter coming from creameries which would be entitled to the national brand under the branding scheme.  We could not grade at the ports with any safety butter coming from creameries where the standard was not up to the required minimum.  It is admitted that in order to grade butter at the ports the only <Col N="2676" /> tests possible in the circumstances are tests for flavour, smell, and water content. Even though some very good judges, people who would be entitled to be called experts, will say that these three tests can find out all that is to be found out about a particular consignment of butter, I think the weight of evidence is that they are not final or conclusive.  Butter might be graded at the ports as choice butter on these three tests, and in a fortnight afterwards that particular consignment might be anything but choice butter.  That is the reason that we could not with any safety attempt to give a first grade, a premium grade, to butter which has come from a creamery whose standards are not up to the minimum required for the national brand.</P>
    <P>So that the issue between the people who favour the national brand and the people who favour grading at the ports is really narrowed down to this: should butter coming from the limited number of creameries&mdash;limited at present&mdash; whose standards are up to the mark, and who in view of their standards would be entitled to the national brand, be graded at the ports?  That is what it comes to.  Suppose for a moment that a consignment of butter came from a creamery whose general standards were not up to the national brand standard but which proved on taste, smell and water content to be first-class butter&mdash;even though that is first-class butter I think it is admitted by the creamery managers that they could not give it a premium grade.  The question arises, therefore&mdash;What grade should it get?  If it cannot get the first grade why should it get the second?  In any event, why should it not get the first grade, if it is first class?  It cannot get the first grade, even though it is first class, because nobody can be sure that it was manufactured under conditions which are bacteriologically all right, and, consequently, that it will be as good butter in fourteen or fifteen days after the various bacilli get going at it.  I think it is even admitted by the Creamery Managers' Association, who are the best-informed champions of the grading-at-the-port system, that they could not give it first grade.  Why, then, should they give the second?  Although <Col N="2677" /> this is a contentious issue, we can narrow it down to a very small point, and that is, whether we give a national brand to butter up to a certain standard, coming from creameries which are also up to a certain standard, or whether we will grade that butter. The issue is not really a live issue in connection with any other butter that comes from any other creamery.  It will probably save a certain amount of debate to try to narrow the issue at this stage.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill we have been agitating for for years.  The Minister is quite right when he says that we have been asking for this for four or five years.  We welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction.  We have been always convinced that if left to ourselves we would never reach the standard required and which we should aim at.  We saw that the only way to deal with it was by a State scheme. There is no need for speech-making to emphasise the necessity for this.  All that need be referred to are questions of detail.  This is a Bill of the utmost importance and marks a new era in our economic life.  We cannot be too careful in taking the first big step in our economic life in this matter.  We cannot be too careful in laying the foundations carefully, and the provisions of this Bill are the foundations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We got the Bill on Tuesday evening and we are going to give it a Second Reading to day.  We have not had time to go through the different sections in the Bill carefully.  We have very little objection to the Bill, but we would like to get the Second Reading postponed for a week.  If the Government is not agreeable to that we will ask for sufficient time, between now and the Committee Stage, to consider this Bill so that the foundations will be laid as they should be laid.  In a matter of such importance we consider that nothing less than three weeks or a month would be sufficient to deal with it properly.  The Bill introduces new and drastic steps. Such steps may not be new to other countries, but they are new in this country.  As the Minister stated, grading is the bone of contention, especially the method of putting on a brand.  It is not now that that contentious question has arisen, as we have been up <Col N="2678" /> against it for three years.  Two bodies have been offering advice as to how the question should be dealt with.  They are still offering advice.  Advice is always good, but the right thing to do is to select the best advice regardless of who gives it.</P>
    <P>The question of grading is a contentious one, and sometimes it is not a disinterested one.  I would ask the Minister to postpone the Committee Stage, as long as possible, so that we might get suggestions with regard to amendments from people who are vitally interested. There are experts up and down the country, and it is on their advice amendments will be framed, so that the foundations of the Bill will be solidly laid.  We wish the Bill good luck.  It is something that we have asked for, and we are glad that it has now arrived.  The Minister has the Bill on his finger tips, and he has had expert advice for months.  We have not had that advantage, and we want a little time to consider it.  We have been asking for a Bill of this kind for a long time.  The Agricultural Commission unanimously recommended that such a Bill should be introduced, and the important thing now is to have the foundations right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain, if he can, what objections the champions of grading have to this system, and if there is not something in the fact that it is a dangerous thing to give a creamery which might conform to all the conditions required, power to send butter to England branded with the highest mark, which might still be wrong.  I believe that is the essential point against the Minister's system as compared with grading.  I do not stand for either system at present. I stand for the best system, and the question is, which is the better of the two?  As Deputy Gorey has said, we agree with the principle of the Bill, but we require time in order to get the best advice as to where it may be necessary to amend it.  In order to do so we ask to have the Committee Stage deferred as long as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the Second Reading of the Bill. In the main I think it does attempt to embody the unanimous recommendations <Col N="2679" /> of the Agricultural Commission on this matter.  I would like if the Minister would consider the question of altering the little somewhat, and allowing a little latitude, so that the Bill might cover, if the necessity arose, not merely dairy produce, but milk itself. The Bill deals with milk manufactured into something else, and I want to see the same provision made applicable to milk as to butter.  We may have what are now called creameries sending away whole milk.  We may have them sending away cream, which, under the definition in the Bill, might not be considered dairy produce. I make that suggestion to the Minister.  It will not alter the structure of the Bill very much but would allow for possibilities that we should foresee.  Grading is a question that has given rise to a good deal of contention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grading at the ports has been put forward as a counter-proposal to the establishment of a national brand.  It has been argued as a counter-proposal. I think that, even if there was a grading system, it would still be desirable to have a national brand.  I think it should be after a period of experience of the national brand, and of the administration of a Bill of this kind, that we should insist upon grading at the ports.  There would be nothing to prevent a trade association of a creamery proprietors, or any co-operative organisation, arranging for grading at the ports, though it would not be, necessarily, a State institution. It could be done if the trade was insistent upon it, in addition to the application of the brand.  But I would suggest for the consideration of those who are advocates of the grading system immediately, that antecedent to that there should be a period during which a general standard of excellence would have been established. When it is put forward, with the experience of New Zealand that grading at the ports is the example we should follow.  I think it ought to be borne in mind that the surroundings of creameries and dairy farms in that country are better generally, from the standard of cleanliness and hygiene than in this country, and you have the preliminary steps fairly well established before you <Col N="2680" /> begin the grading system.  You have also a period of six weeks for transportation before bacteria can begin to carry on their operations.  When samplease are taken at the port of landing in England one can tell how far the original branding conforms to the actual condition at the time of landing.</P>
    <P>The conditions in respect to Irish butter are very different and, while it may eventually prove to be valuable to have a grading system, I do not conceive that system as something which would supplant the necessity for a national brand for butter produced under good conditions.  I look upon this matter, perhaps, somewhat differently from those others to whom I have spoken and who have discussed it. Some people seem to think that a national brand of itself is a brand of a particular consignment of butter.  It is not.  It is a brand to certify that the people who have been engaged in the making of that butter, the surroundings of the place where that butter is made, and the general standard of efficiency of the butter makers have been proved.  It rather is on a parallel with the medical officer who has justified himself to his examiners as one qualified to act as a medical man.  He is not asked to undergo a grading before he approaches a patient.  He is not asked to put himself into a certain category, but he actually qualifies as a medical practitioner, and that, in fact, is what is proposed to be done by this scheme.  The people who have to apply for the use of the national brand have to prove their completence, but this is better than the medical practice inasmuch as there is a consistent and continuing test of a person's qualifications. Unfortunately in the medical profession, once qualification has been obtained, there may be a deterioration, but in this case it is intended that there shall be a continuing test, that the dairies and their produce shall be frequently inspected, and, again differing from the medical practitioner, that if the results prove that the qualification originally granted is not justified then it will be withdrawn.  In the case of doctors very often a number of deaths rather enlarge the practice.</P>
    <P>The Bill will, I think, go a long way generally to raise the standard.  It will <Col N="2681" /> require, I think the Minister will agree, that there should be a fairly general acceptance of the principles.  If the farming community, assisted by the creamery managers, were to say, &ldquo;We shall not have anything to do with this Bill, we shall not apply for the use of the national brand,&rdquo; the Bill would be of no effect, but I would expect, if the farming community decide that the Bill is to be of value, is acceptable, and will lay the foundations of a much more productive and profitable butter industry, that any dislike or opposition which creamery managers, who are in the main their servants, or supposed to be, have to the operations of the Bill as being rather second best, would not prevail.  I hope not, at any rate.  I think, however, whatever one may say as to the value of the grading system, that grading at the ports in preference to this national brand proposal should not be thought of as an alternative, and, as a matter of fact, it may be found, with a few years' use of the national brand, that it can be supplemented by a grading system which would really mean giving extra marks for the superior qualities of butter which have not merely qualified for a brand but are superior to ordinary branded butter.  I submit it is better to think of the grading system as one which would eventually be supplementary to the national brand and not one which would be considered as an alternative to that brand.</P>

      <P>We on the Farmers' Benches realise that unless we have the active co-operation of the farmers, creamery managers, and all who are interested in this trade, no Bill passed by the Government can be effective, and we are willing to offer our co-operation and do anything we can to <Col N="2682" /> make this Bill a success.  The comment I would make about this Bill is this.  It deals with a comparatively complex and intricate form of manufacture.  It is a specialised subject and despite the fact that that subject has been discussed for many years we get this Bill on a Tuesday and are asked to pass its Second Reading on a Thursday, and I submit to the Minister that while we have not had sufficient time to form an adequate opinion of the Bill we are expected definitely to support its principles or otherwise.  I think we should have got a longer period to consider the Bill before its Second Reading.  One objection I have to the Bill is that it attempts to do too much by means of regulations.  The Bill is simply a legislative skeleton upon which the Minister hopes to build up his flesh of regulations and, when the Bill is passed, he will have in his Department almost complete control over the rules and regulations to be made in connection with this butter control.  Now, with regard to the vexed question of grading versus the system which the Bill proposes to carry into force, I would say that I have not definitely formed an opinion on the matter myself.  I think it all hinges on this question, whether fresh butter can be graded at the ports within three days of its manufacture, and whether those responsible for grading at the ports can tell at that stage whether the butter will be in a similar stage in one, two, or three weeks.  If they can definitely state that, I am for grading. I think the general contention is, and the general bulk of the evidence goes to prove, that they cannot do so.  You may get butter at the ports which has been manufactured for two or three days and which will comply with the ordinary tests with regard to colour, flavour, texture, and water contents, and still it will not be bacteriologically pure, and in the course of a week or two the butter will develop ferments and bacilli which will have the effect of completely changing the quality.  As Deputy Johnson says, the grading at the ports cannot be considered as an alternative to the system proposed by the Minister, but it may be reasonably considered as a supplement to the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2683" /> The reason I think that is this: that in my opinion the system proposed in this portion of the Bill is not absolutely watertight; it cannot be absolutely effective to prevent bad butter going out of this country and prevent bad butter bearing the Irish brand going out of this country in the future.  This examination of the creameries, these tests along the railway lines or at the ports, the technical competence of the staffs of the creamery, and all these things may be very effective, but still it may happen that occasionally bad consignments of butter will get out; and if many bad consignments of butter get out bearing the Irish brand, there is no doubt that fact will discredit the brand.  And the only way I can see by which that can be avoided is by the grading at the ports.</P>
    <P>There are regulations in this Bill which deal with the cleanliness of the milk and the cleanliness of the butter, and I think it is high time that such regulations were enforced.  We, for our part, are willing to do all we can to see that cleanliness is carried out on the farms, because we believe that before high-grade Irish butter can be produced you must have cleanliness from the time milk is produced on the farms until the butter is packed at the ports. And it is only reasonable to expect that those who handle the milk ought to take all the elementary precautions to secure cleanliness, such as washing their hands before milking, and washing the cow's udder.  But it is a fact that you may take all the ordinary measures to secure cleanliness, and still the butter manufactured may not be bacteriologically pure&mdash;that is, it can be contaminated in the creamery.  I believe the greatest danger of contamination is the presence of ferments in the pipes and machines in the creamery, and for that reason it is absolutely necessary that inspection of the equipment and thorough knowledge of the technical ability and business qualities of the staffs of the creameries should be attended to.  I believe that bacteriologically pure butter implies of necessity the pasteurisation of the cream.  For that reason no butter will be, as I understand by <Col N="2684" /> the Bill, granted the Irish brand unless it is manufactured in a creamery which has the proper equipment.  And in that equipment must be included the pasteuriser.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion I should like to make to the Minister, and I intend bringing it forward at the Committee Stage of the Bill.  As the Bill stands at present, those who are particularly responsible for the production of butter, and those who are responsible for the production of milk, will have no further say in the carrying out of the measures which are proposed in this Bill, that is, the Minister and his Department will have complete control over the regulations which are to be enforced.  We who have some knowledge of the action of the Department in regard to butter manufacture in this country in the past are very dubious about this, and we are very slow to give our support to any measure which will put such complete control in the hands of the Department and the officials of the Department.  We have a very unhappy memory of the work carried on by the Department in 1920, when the system of butter control and butter licence was in force.  It had the effect of losing for the Irish butter manufacturers, and therefore for the Irish farmers, an enormous sum of money&mdash;close on half a million, it is stated.  For that reason we believe that it is advisable and necessary that some form of advisory council should be set up&mdash;some form of council which would deal with these rules and regulations and before whom these rules and regulations could be placed before being finally adopted by the Minister. Such rules and regulations should also be laid on the Table and be open for the inspection of the members of the Dáil for a sufficient time before they are enforced.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is one very important omission from this Bill.  It is in regard to what are known as cream gathering stations.  There are certain portions of this country where these stations exist, and there may be many more before we are finished with this butter business.  There is a factory which is engaged in the gathering of cream and the manufacture of that cream into butter.  As I read the Bill <Col N="2685" /> at present, it will prevent the exportation of butter manufactured in such a creamery; and if that is so, it will penalise an excellent creamery, and it will prevent what, in my opinion, is a very important matter&mdash;the adoption of such a system in other parts of Ireland. My belief is that our aim should be in this country to endeavour to see that practically all the milk is converted into butter at creameries, or central institutions, because we believe that that is the only method by which you can attempt to standardise a product which is so difficult to standardise. But there are portions of this country which are not sufficiently thickly stocked with dairy cows to warrant the establishment of ordinary creameries: and in such places the obvious thing to do is to encourage the establishment of cream-gathering stations such as exist in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other places.  The cream can be gathered over a very wide area.  It can be retained for a day or two at the farms and then collected at the stations and manufactured into butter.  As I read the Bill, it would not be possible to export butter manufactured in such creameries.  If that is so, I hope the Minister will take steps to rectify that matter before the Bill passes through.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say about this Bill.  There are many matters which, on further consideration, we may see fit to bring forward at the Committee Stage.  I think, speaking for my Party, I may say that we are willing to support the principle of the Bill.  We are not prepared to take a definite stand with regard to the possibility of grading, because we believe that there may be a possibility by which grading can be adopted, but we realise that, as things stand at present, grading cannot be accepted as an alternative to the principle proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few remarks to make on this Bill.  One is, that it is regrettable that such a measure as this has to be introduced here at all, but the fact remains that we have had opportunities for managing this branch of our industry better than we are really doing it.  I think we may as well say we failed to do what we ought to have done, and of necessity the Minister for Agriculture introduces <Col N="2686" /> this Bill.  This Bill struck me as being very drastic, and Deputy Heffernan is correct when he says that the power of the Ministry to make regulations is really very great, and as we see the regulations will mean everything. The regulations must certainly be in words and phrases, a very much weightier document than this Bill is, as introduced.  The authority the Minister should have in drafting the regulations is certainly a matter for serious consideration.  They are certainly going to impose drastic regulations on trade.  The Bill will do that.  Because of that fact we cannot nor need we, expect that the Bill will be enthusiastically received by everybody.  It will not.  Any measure that is going to upset trade to a certain extent, or upset the conditions that some people regard as satisfactory, will never be satisfactory to everybody.  There are people who would, perhaps, rather not see this Bill, because it will mean an upset in trade, but the country feels that a change is necessary.  The recommendations of the Agricultural Commission are embodied in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One feature of this measure is that it is certainly going to cost the dairying industry in this country a considerable amount of money if it is to be carried into effect, or if they are to profit by it&mdash;that is, if the creameries are to live up to the regulations which entitle them to benefit by the establishment of a national brand.  It will certainly mean in the dairying Industry throughout the country, the expenditure of thousands and thousands of pounds.  That will mean to many of our creameries, large and small, considerable difficulties.  It is questionable whether on account of this fact many of our creameries throughout the country may be in a position financially to take steps to comply with the regulations that are necessary in order that they may compete for the national brand.  Now, beyond doubt, the fact that our butter has not been up to the standard we would like is to some extent because the machinery in many of our creameries is not what it ought to be.  That will have to be changed and altered. That will mean in every creamery, in a small separating station, an expenditure <Col N="2687" /> in some places of over £1,000 and in most places close to £1,000.  It will mean much more to our large churning centres.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience recently, and I regret to say the policy of our Irish banks towards many of our co-operative concerns is not at all as satisfactory as we would like, nor is it, at all, encouraging, if they are to make alterations that are necessary in order that they will benefit by the operation of this measure when it becomes law.  This Bill when it becomes law will be the policy of the Government demands that our dairying industry, our co-operative and other creameries throughout the country generally, have to make alterations and changes that are necessary in order to comply with the Government policy, I would like to know if it would be Government policy that they should do anything by means of an expression of opinion that would make our Irish banks more favourable to our Irish farmers in trying to improve their industry by the employment of better methods.  It seems to me beyond question that unless some facilities are given to many of our creameries, better credit facilities than we can get to-day, many of our creameries will not be able to make any efforts whatever to comply with regulations necessary to benefit by the operation of this measure.</P>
    <P>There is the question of these regulations, and I am sure the Minister will admit that the regulations which are to be made under this Bill mean everything. They are more than this skeleton. They mean everything in the success or failure of the measure, the amount of restrictions that would be placed upon trade, and very naturally, those engaged in the trade to-day, many of those who have technical knowledge, and years of experience do feel that if they are put in the hands of the officials of the Department or met with a set of regulations that might not come before this House, and of which this House or the members might know nothing, that with those people going down the country with all this power of the law behind them, very many <Col N="2688" /> people in the trade would perhaps find themselves in a difficult position.  In order that the Bill may be a success and achieve what the Minister and we hope is intended it will achieve, it is necessary that we should have the co-operation of all people interested in the trade, the business, and the industry in the country.  If we are to have that, all those people ought to get an opportunity of knowing, and, if possible, of assisting in formulating the regulations which are to be made, and which are to govern their industry. That point of view ought to be taken into account by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is one point that struck me particularly, that is the question of cleanliness in the creamery.  The inspector will have the power to visit the creamery and be the absolute judge as to whether that creamery is in a clean condition in accordance with regulations or not, There is to be no appeal. It seems very unfair that a creamery manager should be at the mercy of an individual going down there making a chance inspection, and making a report. That inspector might be capable, able and anxious to do what is right, but he might not be in a particular mood when he would be prepared to make the most favourable report on the conditions of the creamery.  Personalities sometimes enter very largely into this, have entered into the administration of the affairs of the past, and will again in this country.  It is not right that absolute power should be left to any inspector to report on the cleanliness of a creamery, and owners have no opportunity of appeal.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with this measure and it is the question of whether this 4d. per cwt. is intended to cover all the expenses of administration.  I see the Minister nods his head.</P>

The Minister says that this is not sufficient to cover the cost of administration. <Col N="2689" /> I was going to point out that if it were, it was rather peculiar that this industry should have to defray all the cost of improving its own position, while at the same time people in the country were being taxed to help other industries.  The Minister nods, indicating, I suppose, that that is not so. I accept that.</P>

I would ask the House to agree, because it will simply mean that we shall have to meet late frequently on succeeding days, and as we have more or less got acclimatised to 10.30, with three-quarters of an hour for adjournment, it is really pleasanter than to be looking forward, wondering what day the Bill is coming on.</P>

      <P>I have, in the first place, to apologise to the Dáil for getting up to talk about the Dairy Produce Bill at all, not being interested in the dairying industry.  But I would like to draw the attention of the Dáil to the fact that again the Farmers' Party are giving conditional support to a measure very much on the same lines as a Bill that passed through this House, known as the Railway Bill.  I cannot congratulate the Farmers' Party on their intelligent analysis in either case.  We have heard from the Minister for Agriculture on various occasions that the farming community represents seventy-five per cent. of the <Col N="2692" /> wealth of the country, so far as exports are concerned&mdash;in other words, that the productive wealth of the country is represented by the farming community to the extent of seventy per cent.  This Bill, with the support of the Farmers' Party, practically makes for the nationalisation of this industry.</P>
      <P>This amounts to the nationalisation of an industry which, according to what we have heard, is incapable of doing anything for itself.  If the estimates are turned up it will be found that the amount voted for this industry is £350,000.</P>

      <P>What I would like to know is what has the Ministry of Agriculture done in the expenditure of this large sum of money to inculcate in the farmers, individually and collectively, the need for carrying on their industry without Government intervention. It surprises me to hear, after all the pap fodder, that to-day the farmers should come along and say that they are incapable of managing their own business.  They are going to go back to the Minister for Agriculture, and he says in reply to them &ldquo;you are incapable of managing your own business, and I am going to manage it for you.&rdquo;  That, I suggest, is not a very encouraging outlook.  We have the farmers' representatives admitting that they cannot ensure on their own account clean butter or cleanliness in the dairy, or indeed anything that would be calculated to make a profit out of the industry which they are supposed to control.  Now, if that is where we are drifting, it will not be long until someone comes and asks one of the Ministers to regulate the hours at which we are to have our breakfasts and our dinners, and perhaps to suggest what we are to have at these meals. I will vote for anything you like so long as it is within reason, but I say distinctly that this is not a measure which I think the Dáil should assent to.

      <P>I am trying to talk on what is contained in the Bill, though Deputy Gorey may think that I may be out of order and may be talking through my hat.  I made my position clear at the outset by stating that I was not individually interested in the dairy industry at all, and if I may put it so, perhaps my views may be freer from bias, for that very reason, than the views of Deputies from some other quarters of the Dáil.  My object in speaking is to say that I do not think it necessary to have this Bill introduced at all.  I am also opposing a principle in the Bill, because I have objected to the same principle when I saw it embodied in other Bills that came before the Dáil.  The principle that I object to is Government interference in ordinary commercial matters except where it is absolutely necessary.  If the farmers say that Government intervention is necessary as regards their industry then they have the right to support this Bill.  But on the other hand, I object to Government interference in matters of trade and commerce for the reason that it is unhealthy and unwholesome, and generally detrimental to industry.  On these grounds I deprecate the introduction of this measure.  In my opinion it would be much more satisfactory if the people most deeply concerned in this industry would properly organise it themselves rather than have a measure of this kind introduced for the purpose.</P>

      <P>Unless the Minister has qualms of conscience about the perfection of the Bill I cannot see why he should be anxious that these imperfections should be removed.  I believe that this Bill was promised in the Governor-General's speech.  The proposal, he said, had been discussed for the last four or five years.  The Bill was made available on last Tuesday, and what it has taken the Ministry and its officials to evolve during the past twelve months is expected to be digested, analysed and accepted almost within twenty-four hours by the unfortunate Deputies.  I say unfortunate, because Deputies who wish to take an intelligent part in these discussions have to analyse these Bills, whereas Ministers are in the fortunate position of having their thinking done for them by their officials.  I am not speaking as an expert on this Bill.  I am merely speaking from information I have received from those who are expert in the business and whose livelihood is dependent upon matters affected by the Bill.  The Minister said in introducing the Bill, and he repeated it to-day with certain qualifications, that this was a contentious measure, and raised what he called the time-honoured issue regarding grading.  He went on to say that he had decided not to adopt the method which was supported by a very considerable and well informed body of opinion in the country.  This is a measure very far-reaching in its scope and severely drastic in its powers.  The Minister has power to make regulations in regard to almost every section in the Bill.  We know what that means, that it is not the Minister who will make these regulations, but the permanent officials.  Under this Bill there is power to penetrate into and ascertain the private affairs of any person concerned in the industry affected.  My information is in regard to the matter of grading that practically the whole of the <Col N="2695" /> trade is in favour of that.  That is my information, but if it is not so, I am open to correction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that correction. Will the Deputy question the fact or the statement that grading at the ports of embarkation has now been adopted by nearly every country exporting to Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Hewat could give you information on that.  He seems to know all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that Deputy Gorey is instructing this Assembly in matters of deportment and etiquette?  If that is so, I think the Deputy ought to be appointed Minister for Etiquette to this Assembly.  Deputy Heffernan called attention to the fact that no provision had been made in the Bill for associating the industry in any way with the operations of this measure. The Deputy also called attention to the disastrous results of the policy pursued in 1920 in the matter of the control of the industry.  The same officials who were responsible for these disastrous operations will probably be the persons under this Bill, as it stands, who will be responsible for its direction.  As I said in the beginning, I do not presume to offer an opinion on this measure as an expert.  I do suggest, however, that this measure is so far-reaching in its scope, and so drastic in its requirements, that the Minister who is so anxious to have this a good measure ought to give ample time for its discussion here.  The interests of those who derive their livelihood from the industry ought to be very carefully considered, because as a result of this measure their interests will be affected for many years to come.  I do not think the measure ought to be rushed through because if that is done its defects will only be discovered when it becomes law, and then we may require an amending Bill to remove these defects. I believe that what I have said on that point is in accord with representations <Col N="2696" /> made by the Farmers' Party.  I think the request made by Deputy Gorey and his colleagues that the further consideration of this measure should be deferred to a later stage is a reasonable one.  If consideration of the matter is not deferred until next session, I think at least that Deputies ought to get two or three weeks for the purpose of making a thorough examination of the Bill so that the important interests affected may be fully safeguarded.  I think if the Minister agrees to that suggestion he may succeed in passing into law the ideal measure which he hoped for when introducing this one.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, and lest there might be any misunderstanding regarding my statement as to what happened in 1920, and the officials responsible, I would like to say that I did not mean to insinuate that the Department is now under the same type of control that it was then.  I have better hopes that the officials will be under a control which is much more in sympathy with the people.  But on principle I do not believe in leaving the regulations of trade or matters of that kind to the officials of any Department.  I think the people who are in the trade and whose interests are at stake ought to have a voice in making these regulations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the point about the officials.  It is the easiest and cheapest thing in the world to attack officials, but I want to announce to all whom it may concern, that in any democratic system of Government like this, where you have Ministers accountable to the Dáil, if anything goes wrong, it is the Minister who is responsible, and the Minister should take the blame.  It is not fair that the officials, of whom I have no complaint to make, should be criticised here in the Dáil in that fashion.  They have to do what they are told; that is what they are paid for.  The Minister is under the direction of the Dáil. He has to formulate his policy; he is responsible for that policy, and the officials have only to carry it out and they should get fair play in the carrying <Col N="2697" /> out of their duties and not be attacked in that fashion.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to follow Deputy Hewat or Deputy Milroy for although I did state that I was anxious that the Bill should be improved in its passage through the Dáil they both admitted that they did not know anything about the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MILROY</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned I made no such statement.  I said I had read the Bill, and studied it closely, but I said I did not speak as an expert in the dairy business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing. They both said they were not experts. They both admitted that they knew very little about the dairy business, and what Deputy Milroy has learned was he said what was told him within the last two or three weeks by men who were engaged in the business.  With regard to Deputy Hewat he is worrying himself with the question of nationalisation. Nationalisation may be a very worrying thing but it beats me to think that any man could get up, at this time of day, and declare that he has one fixed dogma in politics and economics, and that is <i>laissez faire.</i> How anyone could adopt that attitude after the experience of the last ten years simply baffles me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Deputy is against any interference from the Government in business or industrial matters, and because absolute individualism is what he stands for.  We will not argue about that now.  Let the Deputy examine the Bill and make up his mind as to whether the Bill is necessary, and try and relieve his mind of this bogey of State interference and nationalisation, and examine the matter on its merits.  Let him criticise the Bill and let him try to improve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one thing to say to Deputy Hewat, and that is, that by the time the farmers organise themselves and get going his complaint will be totally different, and if he comes to get protection from me, I am his man.  Deputy Johnson and other Deputies pointed out that it is not absolutely essential that the two schemes, grading and the national brand, should be regarded as if they were mutually destructive.  They are not.  Deputy Wilson, I think it was, said that the real difference is as to whether we are taking adequate steps to protect the brand and to see that the butter when it comes in branded, from the creamery, is up to the standard, and he asked me what we had done to ensure that butter bearing the brand and leaving this country will be up to the standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask what is to happen if butter with the brand not up to the standard gets to England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that that is the real point.  The real point was to ensure that the butter bearing the brand is up to the standard. I am prepared to give, and the Bill as it stands gives, ample power to examine the butter at the ports.  If it was found necessary to make regulations which would enable us to examine the butter at the ports we can do so. Further, if there are any amendments needed in that direction I am satisfied to accept them.  That, therefore, definitely ought to remove one very big grievance which the creamery managers have against the branding, that is, against the abuse of branding. If there are any amendments necessary to enable us more effectively to make an examination of the butter bearing the national brand at the ports, I am willing to accept that amendment.  If it is found that we are making the Bill water-tight in that direction, at least let us hear no more about the contention that butter bearing the national brand may go out and not be up to the standard.  I am willing to accept an amendment in this form:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2699" /> (1)  The Minister may, if and whenever he is satisfied that such order is necessary or expedient in the interest of the butter industry in Saorstát Eireann, by order (in this section referred to as an examination order) require that all or any particular class of butter proposed to be exported, or all or any butter proposed to be exported from any particular premises or class or premises, or any particular consignment of butter consigned for export, should, before the same is exported, be submitted for examination by the prescribed officers with a view to determining whether such butter is suitable for export, and the Minister may by such order prohibit either absolutely or on failure to comply with conditions, the export of any butter which on such examination is found to be unsuitable for exportation.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may by any examination order or by any subsequent order make regulations in respect of all or any of the matters following, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the method of submitting butter to which an examination order applies for examination, including the submission in suitable cases of representative parts only of the butter.</P>
    <P>(b)  the officers by whom the examination is to be made.</P>
    <P>(c)  the method of making the examination, and the places in which the same is to be made.</P>
    <P>(d)  the conditions with which the butter must comply in order to be suitable for export.</P>
    <P>(e)  the conditions under which butter found unsuitable for unrestricted export may be exported.</P>
    <P>(3)  An examination order shall remain in force for such period as shall be stated in the order, and for such further period as may be prescribed in any subsequent order, and where no such period is stated in the order, the order shall remain in force until revoked by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any person who shall export or attempt to export any butter in contravention of an examination <Col N="2700" /> order or of any regulation made under this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section, and shall on summary conviction thereof be liable, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Now, in that case, it gives us power to say that butter bearing the national brand shall only be exported on certain conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Shall it not also give power to grade as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it goes as far as that, but we can examine that afterwards.  For the purpose of the present point it gives us power, if we find it necessary, in order to examine it more conveniently, that all the butter should go to certain ports, and there will be power to have the butter sent through certain ports.  So that as far as the Bill is concerned it is at least as water-tight as any grading scheme for the purpose of seeing that butter bearing the national brand shall be up to the standard.  Now, is that point definitely clear?  That decision ought, and should, allay at once a considerable amount of apprehension that causes a considerable amount of talk. Now, while I am on that point, I want to say in regard to the statement that this Bill is a skeleton, that it in reality contains 41 sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fairly substantial skeleton, and I am asked why we should not make it more detailed.  Take that section I have just read out for you.  Is it contended that we should insert the regulations in the section?  It may be that on examination of the Bill certain clauses could be made closer. That will appear on examination of the Bill during Committee.  But I think it will be found on examination of the Bill that it will not require very much alteration in that direction, and that it will be found impossible to deal <Col N="2701" /> with the subject in any other way than by regulation.  I am willing to accept an amendment provided that regulations shall be laid on the Table of the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that, I have not said that I am taking power to grade at the ports.  That may be the effect of the amendment which has been roughly drafted.  But I am taking power to examine the butter at the ports in order to make it absolutely certain that all the butter bearing the national brand is up to the standard. I hope that it will not be necessary, and I hope that as a result of the education, inspection, and so on, that all the creameries to which we give the national brand will be reliable enough, or will be sufficiently reliable in the way of turning out butter which is worthy of the national brand, and that we will not have to go to the trouble and expense of examining all that butter at the ports.  But if it is found by experience that examination is necessary we will have the powers there.  I do not wish, and we do not intend or contemplate, that the butter shall be graded at the ports.  Grading is a different thing from examination. You grade butter according to three or four classes.  We do not intend that. There is only one grade exported from Denmark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, yes.  There is only one grade exported from Denmark. We allow two.  First of all we allow the export on the national brand butter.  That is the first grade.  We allow the export of butter which is not up to the national brand, but is good enough for export.  That is the second grade.  Our scheme is not nearly as tight, and is not nearly as rigid, as the Danish scheme.  In fact, if you consider the butter that is being made at the present moment, we are dividing the butter into three classes&mdash;first, the butter that is fit for the national brand creamery butter; second, the butter which is not fit for the national brand <Col N="2702" /> but which is good enough for export; and third, butter which we hope will disappear entirely as a result of the regulations in regard to equipment and technical competence which we intend to make.  Considering the butter which is being turned out at the present moment, we are grading into three classes, as against the Danish one.  We must aim at the Danish standard. Consistency and standardisation are more important than having a very few producing a really choice butter, a large majority producing a middling butter, and a considerable minority producing a very bad inferior butter. The fact that the national brand is on the butter and that in order to get the national brand it will have to receive 92 marks out of 100, does not prevent the possibility of turning out butter worth 96 or 98 marks and getting a better price for that than for the butter passed at 92 marks.  The point is that the butter nationally branded is guaranteed up to the standard of 92 per cent.  Deputy Heffernan wants to know whether butter made from cream collected at creamery gathering stations should be exported.  Of course it can. Creamery gathering stations are registered.</P>

      <P>In Wexford there are many instances where cream is separated at the home of the supplier, and it is taken to a central creamery and manufactured into butter there.  We want to know how does that class of place come in under the Bill.  That is what Deputy Duffy and myself have in mind.  There is a considerable number of places such as I have mentioned in counties that are not dairy counties but which are aiming at being dairy counties and which are unable to set up a large central creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly in that case the butter is not entitled to the national brand, as the Bill stands, the reason being that cream separated in a farmer's house every day is not, as a rule, brought to the creamery daily.  It may not be brought for three or four days. The farmer has to bring his milk to the creamery daily because he has a large quantity, but in the case of cream he may keep it for four or five days in order to have a big quantity, but in the meantime it may get stale.  It is not as easy to do that with milk.  In the summer time a farmer may have anything up to 50 or 60 gallons of milk and in the winter time he may have between 15 and 20 gallons.  All that milk is taken to the creamery each day. If he happens to have a few gallons of cream he will hold it over until he is able to supplement it and bring 10 or 15 gallons to the creamery.  There is a danger in those circumstances of the cream getting stale in the homes of the farmers, and the butter, as a consequence, would taste.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. HOGAN Mr. HOGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not really cover it.  It was not the intention in the Bill to encourage the collection of cream in the farmers' homes and keep it there for four or five days before sending it to the creamery.  It is quite possible that section might be used for the purpose of giving the national brand even in cases like this, but I may point out that that was not intended. It is considered that it is not wise to encourage the separating of cream in the homes and the taking of it to the creameries every four or five days, as always does happen, because the cream in those circumstances becomes stale.</P>

      <P>It is important that there should be an Advisory Council, but the constitution of it is going to be an extremely difficult matter, and that cannot be dealt with in this Bill. It will have to be dealt with separately. I have asked the interests concerned to put up a definite scheme, and though they profess to want an Advisory Committee, when the scheme arrives you <Col N="2706" /> will find there will be something else. Their scheme is that the Department should take the responsibility and they will do the administering.  That will not do.  I see the necessity for an Advisory Council, but I want to see a first-class Advisory Council set up, and if there is, I want to see that the Minister for Agriculture will have full advantage of their advice.  It is essential to realise that it is necessary to have the intelligent co-operation of all the interests concerned for the administration of a Bill like this.</P>

      <P>I apologise for interrupting again on this question of creamery-gathering stations, but my reason for doing so is so that if possible certain conditions should be laid down in the Bill whereby those stations would come in for the brand on compliance with those conditions.  An attempt has not been made in the Bill, and perhaps the matter has not been raised at all until now, whereby the provisions of the Bill could extend to those.  We want the Minister to inquire how far certain conditions could be laid down that would give these people the brand, because we have creameries of that description, and they are very likely to multiply.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Wilson pointed out, the Bill gives power to give a brand in special cases and under special regulations.  I thought that was clear.  But I did say that it was not contemplated to give a brand in the circumstances.  However, we can argue that in Committee.  I have an open mind on the matter; I am giving you reasons against it.  We can argue that in Committee, and we can have all the reasons for it.  With regard to delay and with regard to this question of allowing a considerable time to clapse before the Committee Stage is taken, I know this is a very important Bill, a very big Bill, a very heavy Bill, and that ample time should be given for the Committee Stage, but a month is out of the question, and there is no reason for it.  We might as well be frank with one another.  It is easy to talk about the far-reaching effects of this Bill, and we all, Deputy Milroy, the Farmer Deputies, and the rest of us know that what is between us is this question of grading, and we know that that question of grading has been examined and re-examined for the last four or five years, has been examined by the Farmers' Unions, has been examined by the Agricultural Commission, has been examined by everybody who takes any interest in the industry, and there is no use in coming here now and pretending that it is an absolutely new issue, that you require time to consider it.  I would be sorry to think that the Farmers' Party have not taken the trouble to get the facts about these particular things before this.</P>

We may make regulations, and we may make them more or less drastic, and when the creameries are examined one of the considerations which the Ministry will have to take into account undoubtedly is the cost of making these changes in equipment. Deputies can take it that that will be fully borne in mind and that we are not going to rush in immediately after the Bill is passed and ask creameries which are in a shaky condition to spend a lot of money in new equipment and matters of that sort.

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for JUSTICE (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil will remember that last year a Bill was passed through this House which the Seanad had not time to consider before the Dissolution. I have been glancing over it. It is a Bill of six sections and it dealt with very little more than the question of hours.  Section 1 of that Bill laid down the opening hours as from 9 o'clock in the morning until 9.30 in the evening for week-days.  In that Bill there was no distinction between Saturday and the other week-days.  That Bill, as I say, did not become law owing to the dissolution of the Dáil, and we find ourselves now considering again this question of the licensed trade and certain matters in connection with it.</P>
      <P>The Bill which Deputies are asked now to consider is somewhat more comprehensive than last year's measure.  It is divided altogether into five parts.. Part I. deals with hours; part II. with licensing, part III. with clubs, and then there are two parts dealing with illicit distillation and methylated spirits.  In preparing the Bill we had, of course, very numerous conferences with all the interests concerned, whether concerned in a direct personal way or through temperance enthusiasm or otherwise. On the 12th of last month a rather large Conference was held, at which I brought together representatives of all the interests&mdash;temperance associations, of which there are four or five; representatives of the licensed trade throughout the country, and the city traders; representatives of clubs; representatives of hotels, theatres, and so on.  Something that perhaps might be expected happened at that Conference. There was not unanimity.  It is scarcely a caricature of what happened to say that the temperance people abused the clubs; that the licensed traders abused the temperance people and the clubs; and that the clubs abused the licensed traders and the temperance people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would not be untrue to say that I distributed a certain amount of abuse impartially. I thought really it would have an educative effect on all sections to bring them together in that way and let them hear what the other people had to say. It was useful, too, for me.  What I aimed at was to strike a reasonable mean between the conflicting views. There will, of course, never be unanimity on a question of this kind.  There is no unanimity this year; there was no unanimity last year; and if a measure of the kind were introduced next year, or the year after, I think the miracle would not happen.  We regarded it as our duty to endeavour to strike a fair and reasonable mean between the conflicting views, to endeavour, as it were, to get the mentality of the average elector who would not have any special vested interest involved, who would simply be out for ordinary decency of life in the country.</P>
      <P>We have in this country 15,000 licensed establishments.  In other words we have a publichouse for every 200 head of our population&mdash;men, women and children.  In England there is one to every 400, and in Scotland one to every 695 inhabitants.  So that in that respect, if in no other, we seem better catered for than the inhabitants of the other island.  I think that is far too many licensed establishments, and I do adhere to the belief that the real trouble with regard to this trade is that there is scarcely enough legitimate trade to go round, and that there is always a scramble for the crumbs.</P>

And that the people in a smaller way are led into lapses and breaches of the law and so on, in an endeavour to pick up something from their more substantial competitors.  I would like to see, and I hope to see, a Commission established to go into the question of how best the number of licences might be reduced.  On such a Commission, of course, there would need to be adequate representation for all the interests involved&mdash;and this is a trade and this is a subject matter in which there are many interests involved. <Col N="2713" /> It is not a question merely of the licensed traders on the one hand and temperance enthusiasts on the other.  There is the question of the producer right back to the farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>From the farmer to the Minister for Finance, as Deputy Johnson says.  It is a question that would need to be gone into most carefully. But I think that we would all agree that 15,000 public-houses in the Saorstát is something far in excess of the reasonable requirements of the inhabitants, and that the traders themselves would welcome an investigation with a view to a very substantial reduction.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, this measure purports to be a reasonable measure of temperance reform.  There is nothing in its 28 sections that does not seem to us to be an interpretation of what the average reasonable elector would wish on this question.  We have avoided, of necessity, matters which would involve, or which might be considered as involving, the question of compensation. There are bigger questions than are dealt with in the Bill which must be left over to the consideration of some such Commission as I have outlined.  In the meantime you have this Bill.  It deals in the first instance with the question of hours.  In that matter the Bill of last year, which was passed by the Dáil, laid down the opening hours be from 9 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.  In this measure it is proposed that the opening hours be from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., except on Saturday, when the closing hour shall be 9.30 p.m.  There is no change on Sunday, except one that I think is a reasonable and a proper change, that drink shall not be sold between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m.&mdash;in other words, between the hours that might be considered as the hours of Divine Service. There are provisions dealing with special days&mdash;Good Friday, Christmas Day, and St. Patrick's Day&mdash;on which complete closing is provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of theatres, I enquired into that matter rather closely, and am not disposed to make any alteration in their hours, beyond laying it down, as Deputies will <Col N="2714" /> see by sub-section 3 of Section 1, that people shall not be admitted to a theatre after the hours of 9.30 in the evening, unless they have previously engaged or paid for seats in the theatre, or are employed therein.  Theatres have a limited kind of licence, which involves permission to sell drink from half an hour before the performance until half an hour after the performance. I am satisfied that interference with that would lead to irregularities within the theatre, such as people drinking out of bottles in the corridors, and that kind of thing.  There is no serious case for any interference with the existing position, beyond seeing that people do not resort to theatres after the licensed establishments have closed, for the purpose of obtaining drink.  The Bill provides for that.</P>
    <P>With regard to clubs, it is proposed to have the same hours for the sale and consumption of drink in clubs as for licensed premises.  Of course there will be two views about that as about many other aspects of the Bill.  There are those who hold that the club is an excellent institution, meant for the social and moral upliftment of its members, or possibly for their physical development; that the sale of drink there is the merest sideline, and that there is no case for the State stepping in and saying that they shall have the same hours, in respect of the sale of drink, as the licensed trade.  Such investigations as we have made do not point exactly to that ideal state of affairs. For instance, a club on the north side of the city whose average monthly purchase is twenty barrels of stout and fifty-two barrels of porter, is doing a rather hefty sideline in the sale of drink.  The view is put up that it is very much on a par with people drinking in their own homes; that a number of citizens come together, form themselves into an association, and that there is no case for State interference.  There are matters in which people have to be protected from themselves, and the consumption of drink in clubs is not on a part with the man drinking in his own home.  I am inclined to believe that many men consume far more drink in clubs than they would consume in their own homes, or that they would be allowed <Col N="2715" /> to consume there.  In any case, a thirteen-hour-day for the consumption of drink is not so bad, and if people make the most of it they will find they will be able to get outside quite a lot of drink.</P>

      <P>From and after the 25th day of September, 1925, it shall not be lawful to carry on any business (except the businesses hereinafter expressly authorised) in the same building as that in which the business of the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail for consumption on the premises is carried on, unless the portion of the building in which such sale of intoxicating liquor is carried on is structurally separated from and has no internal communication with any portion of the building in which any other business (except as aforesaid) is carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I put that to Deputies as a proposal, and with regard to that section, if I cannot convince the majority of the Deputies, voting freely and without party ties or obligations, as to the propriety of that portion of the Bill, I am prepared to drop it.  That is not a new decision on my part.  It is an arrangement which I came to four or five weeks back with the party which gives habitual support to the Government.  I put that section in the Bill because I want to argue it with the Dáil, and it is a matter which I am prepared to argue and discuss very fully on the Committee Stage.  Now, I will see on the Order Paper when the Committee Stage comes, an amendment to delete that section, and I would much prefer an amendment purporting to deal with cases where the application of the principle would involve undoubted hardship. My complaint is that with regard to this matter there is a tendency to <Col N="2716" /> exploit the hard case.  I would sooner have the principle examined on its merits, whether at this hour of the day, whether in the year 1924 the public are satisfied that a system should continue by which women and girls going into shops for a package of tea, or a pound of butter, or half a pound of rashers, must, as it were, force their way in, past men standing over their pints; or, put it in another way, whether at this hour of the day it is considered proper that a man going in for a pound of nails should be subject to the temptation of wasting&mdash;I will not use the word &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; because it is partisan&mdash;of spending his time and money in a different way to that which he intended.  I think it is a fair thing to say that a man going in for a drink should go in for a drink, and that a man going in for a pound of nails, and should go in for a pound of nails, and there will not be that inducement of spending that time and money in a different way to that which he originally intended.  Extravagant statements have been made as to the expenditure that this would involve, and people have spoken as if it were a three-foot wall that would be necessary between one portion of the establishment and the other.  Deputies know, of course, that a lath-and-cardboard, or a lath-and-plaster partition would meet the requirements of the Bill, that all that is asked is that the two portions of the shop shall be separate.  If the principle is right, if at this hour of the day the public are entitled to be better served, then let the hard cases not be exploited.  I am well aware, and was well aware when I asked that that section be written into the Bill, that there are cases in which very considerable architectural difficulties would arise, cases in which the question of light would be somewhat difficult if the owner of premises would be expected to divide them in the way suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Very good; let us, by amendment, deal with the hard cases but let the hard cases not be exploited to defeat a principle, if that principle is right and sound, or, if it is a question that September, 1925, is too near and that the time should be extended, let that, too, <Col N="2717" /> be argued.  I will ask Deputies on the Committee Stage to agree with me that this system of a mixed trade carried on in the same room is bad in its sociological aspect; that, first of all, that is not the way that people should be served, that women and girls and children should not be expected to go in through a public house for the purchase of their groceries and other household requirements, and, there is also that other aspect, that temptation should not be there for a man going in for some requirements for his house or for his farm to spend his time and money in a different way.  I am told that it would really mean two shops, and that it would mean additional requirements as to staffs.  Well, there is considerable unemployment in the country and, if it means additional requirements as to staffs, I think that in that matter I can depend on the support of the Labour Deputies.  This Bill, as I have stated, is an attempt to interpret the mentality and to interpret the wishes of the average electors, and I put this aspect to people who referred to this measure as tyrannical and confiscatory&mdash;I do not know how many other adjectives were applied to it in resolutions that I have got during the last few weeks&mdash;that the measure might very well be something different even from their point of view.  I feel that, if year after year measures of reasonable reform are shouted down and voted down, a time will come when matters of this kind will be put by referendum to the people, and when the people, with the recent large additions to the electorate, and with the recent large additional woman vote to the electorate, may pass a much more comprehensive and much more drastic measure of reform.  And I do put it, even to those who are vitally and personally affected by the Bill, that unless they show a disposition to meet the reasonable requirements of the public as to temperance, as to sobriety, and a reasonable catering for what people are entitled to expect for their wives and children, boys and girls, the public may very well deal with this whole question in its own way at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I am not a Prohibitionist, nor in any measure that I would take responsibility <Col N="2718" /> for would there be any complexion of that kind.  But if I am right, I believe that the trend of public opinion in this country is running strongly in favour of reasonable temperance reforms of this kind, and that, if that is not met, and met in a reasonable way by the interests concerned, there may come more far-reaching measures.  I put that simply as food for thought to those who are inclined to think, or, if not inclined to think, are inclined to say that this measure goes beyond the bounds of reasonable change.  That structural separation clause must abide the verdict of the free vote of the Dáil.  That is an understanding and an arrangement.  But the other sections involve very little more than was embodied in the Bill that was passed by the Dáil last year.</P>
    <P>I feel certain that it is unnecessary for me to dilate upon or to advocate the two concluding portions of the Bill &mdash;the portion dealing with illicit distillation and that dealing with methylated spirits.  Deputies know the need for both of these parts of the Bill.  The illicit distillation traffic is one on which considerable inroads have been made by the activities of the Gárda Síochána, but which has not been stamped out; and I have come to the conclusion now that much further headway is unlikely to be made unless we take power to control the raw material.  I am so advised by the police themselves, and by Deputies and public officials in the areas affected.  I am advised that we have got to come down to the point of absolute control of the raw materials of poteen if we are to hope to absolutely stamp it out.  It is a great evil&mdash;a great social evil&mdash;in the areas in which it prevails.  The methylated spirits traffic is, of course, no less an evil.  If it exists on a smaller scale, at any rate it is no less injurious in its effects; and we propose here what we hope are adequate powers.  It will be noted that illicit distillation no longer remains on the basis of being mainly or primarily a revenue offence; it is made an ordinary criminal offence, punishable by imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I do not know that at this stage of the Bill there is matter calling for much further comment.  Deputies will <Col N="2719" /> notice that in Section 23 power is given to the police to search clubs or to visit and inspect clubs under certain circumstances where there is suspicion that a breach of the law is taking place.  Formerly the police were under considerable difficulty with regard to clubs, because they had to have something more than suspicion, they had to have something little short of absolute personal knowledge before they would get from a magistrate the necessary warrant.  I am glad to say that at the conference which I had the representatives of the club assured me that they would welcome police supervision and police inspection, and had no objection to the insertion of a clause of that kind in the Bill; and that is something which certainly gives every evidence of <i>bona fides</i> and every evidence of a desire to run the clubs properly on the part of those who represented the clubs at the conference.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Deputies&mdash;or some Deputies&mdash;will see in the Bill not merely sins of commission, but sins of omission.  From time to time I got requests to bring certain matters within the scope of the Bill.  There are local problems and special interests here and there in regard to which people saw, or thought they saw, in the Bill, an opportunity of having grievances, real or imaginary, redressed.  There is the problem of the Cork tied house, which I am not attempting to deal with in this measure, and which must be left over for fuller examination by a Commission. And then, here in Dublin, there were two special requests, one from certain people on the North side who had six-day licences, and who would like to have seven-day licences, and the other had reference to a problem which I am sure is well known by circular and memoranda to many Deputies, if not to all&mdash;the problem of the added areas.  These are questions which I think can better be dealt with on the Committee Stage, if amendments are put down, and which I would suggest, at any rate, ought to be omitted from the scope of the discussion at this stage of the Bill.  I formally move the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the <Col N="2720" /> general terms of this Bill at all.  There are some clauses in it that nobody can say anything against, and there are some clauses in it that everybody can speak against.  But before I start off to say that I should like to see the Bill rejected, the Minister himself rejects it by saying that he would like to see a Commission set up.  So should I.  I gave evidence before a Commission seven years ago.  The late Mr. Justice Gordon presided at that Commission, and in connection with that Commission, any publican who would be shut up would be compensated.  As regards this Bill, the Minister has very generously given leave to everybody to slaughter the structural clauses.  There are clauses inserted in this Bill, some of which would suit the cities, and more of which would suit the country districts.  You take, for instance, the cities where you have a tram service, and where Ministers are living, I may say.  They are prejudiced by the fact that a man can be converted into a <i>bona fide</i> traveller, for a penny, on a Sunday.</P>

      <P>A man jumps into a tram and pulls the bell, and off he goes, and he is a <i>bona fide</i> traveller&mdash;and that, after getting for three hours before that the privilege of boozing away in a publichouse.  It is no wonder that the <i>bona fide</i> traveller part of it is objected to, when, as I am told, here in the city the three hours' period is abused and people are not satisfied with it.  Give us the three hours in the country and a little of the <i>bona fide</i> traveller business, and no structural clauses, and we will almost fall into line with the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has taken charge of the theatre and the publichouses there by night&mdash; the bars.  He objects to the girl of eighteen going inside the publichouse bar.  So do I.  I agree with him that a girl under the age of eighteen should not be allowed inside any counter, for her health's sake.  If she is not we will have better athletes in the country, for the girls will make better mothers.  I come back to the theatre.  I was in there the other night.  Not alone were there people there eighteen years of <Col N="2721" /> age, but there were a few there not eight, ten, eleven, twelve or thirteen, all, walking around dressed up nicely. They would pick the eye out of you.  I was up in the gallery with other Deputies. I had a look down into the pit to see were there any Ministers there to put a stop to the kickers, but I did not see any Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back to the <i>bona fide</i> traveller part of the Bill, I would ask the Minister for Justice to bear in mind seriously that it would be a great hardship on the people in country districts, if this one o'clock in the day <i>bona fide</i> business were imposed on the publicans.  He mentioned Divine Service a while ago.  The people where I come from are as divine as they are in Dublin, and the travellers from the country especially, can hardly go to Mass at all without a drop.  I do not say this now by way of a joke.  From time immemorial those people living three to five miles away in the country drive into the village to chapel on Sundays. They put up their horses in the stables that have been built for them years ago by our fathers.  I am a publican myself.  A farmer like Deputy Gorey would drive in his horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A DEPUTY A DEPUTY">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDaly" hpid="Mr. DALY Mr. DALY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DALY</NameTxt>
      <P>And put him up in the publican's yard in the stable and make off for Mass, or if it were snowing he might go into the fire, and you know the remainder.  If this Bill were passed it would be a crime for the farmers' horse to drink in the publican's yard, and it will be a hardship on the people coming into Mass on Sundays, if they have to come home again without being able to get messages in the house with which they are dealing, with which their fathers have dealt before them, and in which they get the best value. As to the opening hours, nine o'clock in my district anyhow, is early enough. God knows, with the amount of unemployment that exists&mdash;publicans as a rule are sleepy chaps&mdash;nine o'clock is early enough for them except on fair or market mornings, when the thirsty farmers come in.  The Minister knows it himself.  He spent some time in Cork and Youghal, a watering place down in <Col N="2722" /> my district.  How would it affect holiday-seekers&mdash;they may call it a holiday or a necessity&mdash;who go to Youghal to enjoy the fresh air after the week's work, if they could not enter a publichouse before one o'clock?  In those watering-places travellers should be specially catered for.  I make a suggestion&mdash;I hope I will be on the Commission&mdash;that a country publichouse should get permission to open for three hours, say, from eleven until two.  We have Mass at 12 o'clock.  You would have an hour before Mass and an hour after.  Then you could put down the <i>bona fide</i> business.  This deals with the country, where a man has to walk two or three miles on business or pleasure.  He has not merely to hop into a tram.  Alas, we are asked not to taste a tint of drink on St. Patrick's Day.  Our fathers would turn in the grave if they heard it.  Many of them got their heads smashed on St. Patrick's Day, and it would not be a Patrick's Day unless they came home half &ldquo;boosed.&rdquo;  All those time-honoured customs are to be put aside to please the Pioneers, the people who have a big banner, with Pussyfoot drawn out on it.  I do not like to say anything against the Pioneers, because I am a kind of Pioneer myself.  I may as well say that, because some Deputy may fling the taunt at me, &ldquo;Why don't you have a drink yourself?&rdquo;  I drank my own share of it.  I would like to point out that the Minister for Justice thinks it necessary that there should be a Commission set up.  I think it should be set up also, and it would be a golden opportunity to avoid this pardon or absolution in connection with the structural clauses.  I say: &ldquo;Withdraw the whole Bill.&rdquo;  Should there be a Commission set up afterwards you can bring forward a new Bill at the time you will be bringing forward the Rural Councils again. Bring forward a new Bill after the Commission, and do not put the car before the horse by having the Bill first and the Commission after.  I would ask that the Minister for Justice in justice to the Bill, should withdraw it.  In that Commission he suggests we will give him our blessing and every assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, covered a great deal of ground, which I shall try to cover briefly.  It not unfrequently happens that when I am speaking here I am conscious of speaking on a subject of which I have only an academic or superficial knowledge.  That is not the case in this instance.  So far as the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is concerned, I have, I may say, absorbed the subject.  I shall deal with it in the spirit in every sense of the word in which the Minister put it before us, when he said he tried to get at the mentality of the average elector by striking the mean between conflicting views.  There is no worse way of getting at the mentality of the average man, than by striking a mean between two extremists.  They come off at tangents, and you do not get at the centre.  But where the Minister will get at the mentality of the average electors is here in this Dáil. Therefore, it is to be hoped that we will have a full debate, and that Deputies will express not opinions dictated to them, but their own opinions, whether they are popular or unpopular.  The Minister expected to be accused of sins of omission.  He accused himself of <Col N="2724" /> one sin of omission.  I am going to rub it in.  It is that there is in this Bill no provision whatever for the reduction of the number of licences.  That is one of the things that have been in the forefront of every agitation and temperance movement in this country for years.  The reason for the omission is obvious.  The reason is the Minister for Finance.  It is a serious omission, and one that is felt to be serious.  I do not myself believe that drunkenness depends in any great degree on the number of publichouses.  I am confirmed in that by the figures the Minister gives. He said there was one licence to every 400 of the population in England, and that there was one to every 695 of the population in Scotland.  I have not the figures with me, but it is common knowledge that Scotland is a more drunken place than England.  The average number of convictions for drunkenness is much higher than in England, though the proportion of the number of houses is very much smaller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The police are more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I never heard that. It is entirely new to me to hear that any police force is more efficient than the City of London police force.  Yet the number of arrests for drunkenness is infinitely lower in London than in Glasgow.  There are other factors to be taken into consideration, such as the climate, what people drink, and Sunday closing in Scotland, which has had a very considerable effect.  As I say, I do not believe the number of licences has really a great effect on the amount of drunkenness.  I think the truest thing on this subject was said by the late Lord Salisbury, that though he had a large number of bedrooms at Hatfield they never made him feel any more sleepy.  It did not necessarily follow, he concluded, that because of the number of public houses there was any more drunkenness.  What I do think is that the number of small publichouses we have in this country is uneconomic.  We have in a small village of forty or fifty houses, eight or ten licensed houses, which is too much of a good thing, even allowing it to be a good thing.  It is not economic, and it involves an enormous <Col N="2725" /> number of small transactions&mdash;buying a barrel of beer at a time, and that sort of thing, which makes the work of the railways more difficult.  I do hope the Minister is not putting the reduction of the number of public-houses out of mind altogether.</P>
      <P>Another question the Minister has failed to deal with, so far, is the question of spirit drinking.  It has been in the past the aim of a great many temperance reformers to discourage the drinking of spirits, as compared with the drinking of ale and porter. There is an English poet&mdash;I should rather call him a rhymster&mdash;who once said:</P>
      <P>Brandy and gin blows out your skin</P>
      <P>And makes you feel quite clear,</P>
      <P>So damn your eyes, whoever tries</P>
      <P>To rob the poor man of his beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sentiment has been endorsed by a good many.  I do not know whether the Minister is familiar with the system adopted in Gothenburg, in Sweden. He has been borrowing one or two details of it in this scheme, but whether he has been borrowing them unconsciously or not I do not know.  He has borrowed one provision which prohibits the sale of alcohol on credit. That is a very good provision, and I heartily endorse it.  He has also borrowed another provision, less excellent, which prohibits the sale of any form of alcoholic liquor to anyone under 18 years.  He has borrowed from the Gothenburg system, and he has gone one better, because the Gothenburg law applies only to spirits and does not apply to beer.  Comparatively recently there were twenty-nine houses in Gothenburg selling spirits across the counter, and there were 200 beer houses, so that a person under 18 years had ample opportunity of obtaining beer.  I do not think it can be seriously contended that a glass of beer does a boy of 18 years, taking hard exercise, any harm at all, or that a glass of cider does him any harm.  I think that there the Minister is following a precedent&mdash;a British precedent. I do not know whether it should be called a British precedent or an American precedent, because an Act passed last year in the House of Commons was introduced by a lady who is <Col N="2726" /> American by birth and British by marriage, and who succeeded in getting this made illegal in Great Britain. There has been no great improvement, so far as I can see, in any of the young people in England since, and at the same time there is that unreasonable restriction.  I have known children under 18 years&mdash;even children of 15 and 16 years&mdash;ordered beer, stout or porter by doctors.  As long as they were at home they would, under this Bill, be able to have that, as they would be in a private house.  But if they went to stay at an hotel, or if they went to one of those watering-places of which Deputy Daly spoke, where, apparently, people go for no other purpose than to drink, they would not be able to get stout or porter, according to the provisions of this Bill, even if ordered it by the doctor.  That is as far as I understand the provision.</P>
    <P>I venture to think that the general characteristic of the Bill is rather excessive rigidity.  It has many very valuable provisions, but the whole scheme is too cut and dry, and there is not enough allowance for exceptional cases.  The Minister is placing all licensed houses on the same basis.  It is rather ridiculous to apply exactly the same standards to the Shelbourne Hotel and to a publichouse, say, in Clifden, or Cahirciveen.  The kind of business is different, the conditions under which they work are different, and it is almost impossible to get a scheme of hours that would suit them.  If you try to crush them into a Procrustean mould you will create hardship and ill-feeling. Take the question of theatres. The Minister has grouped all theatres. together, even theatres that do not possess licences.  There is one theatre in Dublin&mdash;the Abbey Theatre&mdash;which has no licence.  The Bill says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No person shall be admitted to any theatre, music hall or other licensed place of amusement after the hour of half-past nine in the evening unless ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that means any place possessing a patent as a theatre.  The Abbey Theatre has no licence for the sale of alcoholic liquor at all.  It is a theatre which very often has two or three plays on the programme, some of which may be very familiar to frequenters <Col N="2727" /> of that theatre.  I might wish, for instance, to avoid a play by the Minister for External Affairs which I had seen several times before, and to go down at a quarter to ten or ten o'clock to see some new play put on at the end of the programme.  Under this Bill I would not be able to get in. That is not to prevent me getting a drink, because I could not get a drink, in any case, and I would be able to get a drink in a publichouse up to that time.  That simply shows that the scope of the Bill is a little rigid.  As the Minister begs us not to labour hard cases, I will not deal further with that, but I would like to know if, under this Bill, the privilege which exists at present of applying to a District Justice for extension of licensed hours for particular purposes still continues or not. There is nothing in the Bill about it, and I am not clear whether it is repealed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  That, to some extent, meets my view.  In my opinion there ought to be five kinds of licences.  We are trying to standardise this matter too much. There should be a licence for a hotel, and in defining a hotel the Minister might very reasonably demand a certain standard&mdash;a certain number of bedrooms, so that any little village publichouse would not be at liberty to call itself a hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there should be another standard for restaurants.  I might say that the only legislative effort in my life was when, 14 years ago, I helped Mr. P.J. Brady to carry a Bill in the House of Commons which made it possible to have a drink at supper in Dublin.  I never heard that the Bill did any harm, but it lapsed during the European War and has not been revived.  Now the trade of the restaurants in Dublin is so small that I do not think it would be possible to revive it.  As far as I know, it was a harmless provision, which gave a certain amount of enjoyment and a certain amount of employment suitable to a capital city.  After all, Dublin is a Metropolis.  I know I shall be reminded that Dublin should not sit up late, so that it may go to work early in the morning.  But Dublin does not sit <Col N="2728" /> up late, and it does not go to work early in the morning.  Paris sits up late, and goes to work early in the morning, and remember that in Paris there are practically no restrictions. Paris is a very much earlier city than either London or Dublin, and I suggest that the two things are not necessarily incompatible.  The third form is the licence for clubs.  The fourth is the ordinary licence for sale across the counter, and the fifth is the off-licence, a problem which the Minister has not tackled in this Bill, but which he will have to tackle some time. There are various abuses connected with it.</P>
    <P>Now, I come to the provision with regard to the closing on St. Patrick's Day, on Good Friday, and on Christmas Day.  I am not going to support what Deputy Daly described as the time-honoured custom of getting half boozed on St. Patrick's Day.  That reminds me very much of a saying of Shakespeare.  It is &ldquo;a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.&rdquo;  I would ask Deputies to remember that St. Patrick's Day is a bank holiday and a general holiday in the country now.  I think it is very hard to lay it down as this Bill does, that if I go to Bray, or in a misguided moment to the other end of the County Dublin to address my constituents, I cannot have a glass of beer or a whiskey and soda at my meals unless I take a room in the hotel.  That seems to me unnecessary.  Close all the bars as much as you like, but to say that a drink should not be served at meals under the circumstances I have described is, I suggest, pressing the thing a little too far.  I am not going to lay the same stress on Good Friday or on Christmas Day, because these are days that should be spent in the bosom of the family.  But St. Patrick's Day is now a bank holiday, and a day on which people go out to enjoy themselves. I cannot see that it would do them any harm if they had an opportunity for having refreshment at their meals.  I do not think that such a regulation would do any harm, or that the fabric of the State would be shaken in any way.  I now come to the question of the clubs.  I admit that <Col N="2729" /> this is a very difficult question, but I agree with the Minister that a club that is only a camouflage publichouse should have no better treatment, and, if necessary, have worse treatment, than the publichouse.  Here, also, we should be aware of undue rigidity. There are a great many clubs with bars.  There are such things as golf clubs with bars.  I suggest to the Minister that if he is able to make a rule that no member of a golf club should be supplied with alcoholic liquor until he has played at least eighteen holes, it might not only be useful, but I am sure it would help to raise the standard of the golf.  At the present time you have people playing golf up to a late hour.  At the present season, particularly on Saturday afternoons, golf is played up to 9.30, and sometimes a good deal later. It seems to me if the closing hour in golf club bars is fixed at 10 o'clock that it is a little arbitrary.  What I suggest is that the Minister should lay down certain hours during which the bars in clubs can be kept open.</P>
    <P>I suggest with regard to club bars that the Minister should fix a maximum number of hours during which the club can sell drink, and that he should make that maximum number considerably less than the thirteen hours allowed to the publichouse.  If it would conciliate the Labour Party in any way I would suggest eight hours as the club day for drink.  I suggest also that the clubs themselves, when applying for a licence or for a renewal of a licence, should state the hours during which they wish to sell drink.  It will be open to the police to make an objection if in any case they think these hours are going to be abused.  The suggestion I make would, I think, put an end to the camouflage publican, because it would not then be worth his while giving up thirteen hours' sale of liquor in order to secure eight.  This provision, if enforced, would impose a great hardship on a number of clubs.  For instance, I know that in London the Press Club is used entirely by people who work at night, and as the club has an all-night licence it is allowed to sell drink. If the Dublin Press, printers, telegraphists, <Col N="2730" /> and other people who have to work at night, wish to start a club, or if they have a club already, I do not believe it would do any harm to let them have a glass of ale with their supper, even if that meal were served at 2 o'clock in the morning.  All these matters are subject to the police regulations, and if clubs make application for unusual hours without any valid reason the police will oppose the application and the club will probably not get its licence.  Of course, it is simpler, from the police point of view, to have an absolute fixed rigidity, and that everyone should conform to it. To have no variation in the hours is not a solution of the difficulty.  It has been found possible to work the licensing laws in London with a variation in the hours.  For instance, at one side of Oxford Street the publichouses close at 10 o'clock, while at the other side they remain open until 10.30, but the police do not find any difficulty because of that.  I feel that this uniform rigidity which I find in the Bill is due to the Minister's Napoleonic cast of mind.  Napoleon once felt great pleasure in thinking that at a certain hour every day every child in his Empire, which then stretched from Calais to Rome, and from Barcelona to Rotterdam, should be doing a certain sum.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would derive great pleasure from feeling that on every Saturday night at twenty-five minutes past 9 o'clock the last tumbler is being emptied in every publichouse in Ireland; at twenty-eight minutes past 9, all over Ireland, that thousands of mouths are being wiped after the last drink, and that at thirty minutes past 9 the keys in the locks of thousands of publichouse doors are grating.  That is a beautiful dream, of course, but I do not think it makes for the happiness of the Government.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on the Committee Stage, I propose to do all I can to mitigate the rigidity of the Bill.  I am not opposing the Bill, because it is one that has very valuable provisions, and I would vote for it if it were only for the two last parts dealing with illicit distillation and methylated spirits, both of which I believe are urgently needed.  I do think, however, that <Col N="2731" /> it will cause a certain amount of friction and ill-feeling and will make for what the Minister once described as &ldquo;persistent unpopularity.&rdquo;  But I support the Bill under great difficulties, because of the conditions in which we are discussing legislation.  The Minister begged us to deal with these points in Committee.  While we have not a great deal of time to deal with these points in Committee, the great difficulty for the ordinary private member is that he cannot call a draftsman to his aid to frame satisfactory amendments that will stand fire. Therefore, I would urge the Minister to do one of two things, either to be satisfied with a Second Reading now and to leave the Committee Stage to the autumn when we shall have more time, and when possibly the organisations that ought to come to his assistance and support and which have not done so up to the present, will have come into action.  If he cannot do that, I would urge him to help us with the drafting of amendments as far as possible, and not to turn down amendments because they are badly drafted. He could give us the benefit of the Government draftsman's assistance and advice, and an assurance that any such amendments that meet with substantial support in the Dáil shall not be rejected because they are badly drafted, but that he should help us to lick them into workable shape.  The Minister also said that contentious matters had better be left for the Committee stage.  If we respond in that spirit, will he give us an assurance that he will give us a helping hand?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was brought forward on Second Reading I rather first, as Deputy Cooper did, thought it was likely to be contentious in a number of respects, and that if it was intended to become law this summer, it would mean a very much longer sitting than had been anticipated, and would have meant very urgent pleading with the Seanad to sit longer than they proposed to do.  I do not think it is reasonable to submit a Bill of this kind along with a number of other Bills of great importance which require to be examined closely and minutely, at this <Col N="2732" /> stage of the session, and, therefore, I suggest that it is a Bill which ought not to be persisted in in view of the big programme before the Dáil, unless other parts of the programme or many of them are to be dropped.  There is not much sign of these other Bills ceasing to flow, and I cannot understand how this Bill is likely to become law within the time suggested as reasonable as the length of this session.</P>
      <P>For my pains I received two or three very abusive letters, saying I was trying to plead the cause of the publican and to ensure the perpetuation of drunkenness in the homes of the writers of these letters.  It is not because I receive these letters that I am supporting this Bill.  I would support a very much more drastic Bill than this is.  But I want to suggest to the Minister that it is very doubtful wisdom to try to pass the whole of this Bill at the present stage, and that to remedy the acute evils he would do well to make a separate Bill of the two clauses, the one relating to illicit distillation, and the other relating to methylated spirits.  I feel confident he would get almost unanimous support if he introduced those two sections as a separate Bill, and allow it to pass through quickly.  By that means he would deal with an immediate and pressing evil, and he would at least save six months in the active treatment of those two evils, because I cannot think, whatever the Dáil may be persuaded to do in regard to this Bill by the throwing overboard of a number perhaps, of very valuable provisions, that the Seanad will be persuaded to do the same.  I do not think they will, and then we will not only lose the Bill as a whole, but the clauses dealing with distillation and methylated spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But on the general question, and I am speaking for myself alone on this matter, I am prepared to support the Bill to the full, reserving freedom, as I always do, to criticise and vote against such clauses or sections or special proposals in relation to those sections.  In the course of discussion in regard to the Bill outside the Dáil I find a curious state of mind developing, a state of mind which rather suggests the necessity for examining first <Col N="2733" /> principles with regard to the use and sale of intoxicating liquor.  I find a tendency to argue that there should be no restriction, and that there should be as much freedom in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor as in regard to the sale of bread.  And it is even suggested that while the immediate results would be disastrous, still in the long run, and perhaps not too long a run, benefit would accrue to the country inasmuch as the fittest to take intoxicating drink, without evil results, would survive and would breed a race immune from intoxication.  In a sense that is the end of the argument put forward in regard to freedom to sell all intoxicating liquor.  But most people on examination, thinking for any length of time upon the matter, will come down to the agreement that there must be in this country and in this climate and in these latitudes certain restrictions upon the sale of intoxicating liquor, because we know from experience that a considerable section of the public&mdash;an influential section of the public&mdash;are quite prepared to exploit the appetites of men and women to the detriment and deterioration of men and women. Because of that exploitation and because it is necessary, as the Minister said, to put some restriction in the way of mankind in the satisfaction of the degrading appetites, licensing restrictions on the sale of intoxicating liquor have been found necessary.  The question then arises as to the extent of the restriction and the extent of the interference.  I think anybody who has travelled the country and has observed the conditions under which spirits and beer are sold, and the effect of that sale upon the general social condition, will agree that there should be steady and increasing restrictions upon that free traffic.</P>
    <P>A good many people were greatly elated three or four years ago at the spirit of the country when there was a determined effort to reduce the sale of intoxicants.  Now, undoubtedly, there was a great deal of good in that effort. It may be that there was too much elation and not enough of thought and consideration of the fact that there was a reaction against that wave of temperance, and perhaps the nett result has <Col N="2734" /> not been entirely good.  But if there had been more restriction and less freedom when the reaction came, if it had been possible to enforce the law, even as it existed we would not have had the complaints and the grievances expressed that we have had.  There is no doubt that the increase in the last couple of years in the sale of intoxicating drink has done a great deal to demoralise the country.  Deputies talk as though the matter of Sunday trading, and the opening of houses in the country are simply a matter of satisfying what one might call the reasonable desire to refresh oneself, but Deputy Daly and most other Deputies well know what the conditions in the country are.  We know that men, not men who have travelled, but men who live next door or within twenty, thirty or a hundred yards of the publichouse, spend hours and hours there drinking pint after pint and degrading their surroundings and everything connected with them.</P>
    <P>It is wasteful and simply doing harm to themselves and to their families. Now, I believe that we ought not to be afraid to risk unpopularity in respect of this question.  I was sorry that the Minister adopted a somewhat apologetic tone in regard to this Bill.  He seemed to be a little afraid that he was asking the Dáil to do too much, and rather asked to be excused for inviting legislation of this kind.  It is a very moderate Bill, very much more moderate as he suggests than the Bill which will be introduced and passed within a few years.  I think that there ought to be very little cutting in the provisions of this Bill even as presented.  The structural alterations clause is one that seems to have excited the most opposition. I think that it will cause a certain amount of hardship and expense to a large number of people.  I think that possibly the time allowed in the Bill is too short, but I frankly tell the Dáil that in my belief that clause is intended, or, at least, it will have the effect of making the country trader and the city trader decide whether he is to be a publican or a grocer, whether he is to be a publican or an ironmonger, and he will have to decide whether he is going to conduct one business or the <Col N="2735" /> other business.  I think it would be well for the country if people were made to decide that.  You go into a country town and you find 120 houses, 70 of them having licences.  Of course, they are not there for the trade of the town.  It is intended to be a weekly or monthly trade&mdash;perhaps one day's trade in a month, or one day in the week, a fair day trade or a market day trade.  They try to combine two or three businesses, and they have a slum of a house, and they call it the &ldquo;pub.&rdquo; It is dirty, ugly, dilapidated in every respect, and the surroundings are disastrous to the mentality of the people that frequent these places.  Now, I say it would be a very good thing, indeed, for the country if those places were reduced by two-thirds, and if this clause, this proposal insisting that there shall be structural divisions as between the general trade and the liquor trade, were passed.  If it would have the effect of closing up a considerable number of houses, I think it would be a very good thing indeed. Now, I think it is quite reasonable, say, within a period of 15 months or two years&mdash;and I think the longer period would be preferred, a longer period than that fixed in the Bill&mdash;to call upon the trade itself to provide an insurance fund that will buy out or compensate those houses that have to be closed.  I would certainly make that the basis of any compensation.  Those houses that are to remain would undoubtedly get the benefit of the trade that remains.  And if it is not a fact that the existence of public houses increases the consumption, then the remainder of the public houses will have the same amount of consumption and they will have a sufficiently increased revenue to provide compensation.  But notwithstanding Lord Salisbury and the statement that because he has 100 bedrooms, he does not sleep more than once per night, we know, as a matter of fact, and we know as a matter of practice that the more public houses there are, and the greater the facilities for drinking, the greater the quantity of drink taken.</P>

      <P>One does not go <Col N="2736" /> through life in cities and in country towns without knowing that when two or three are gathered together and the facility for drink is at hand the inducement to drink is succumbed to. And unfortunately we have the habit in this country of having public houses which are nothing but drinking places, and you have to stand for your drink &mdash;simply places where you can open your mouth and pour down beer.  Now, I say that ought to be altered in the best and quickest possible way.  Deputy Cooper spoke of the Gothenburg system. I am not talking as a Prohibitionist, for I am not a prohibitionist.</P>
      <P>I do say if you could induce any considerable number of people to establish a publichouse trust on the Gothenburg system, make it compulsory that the licensee would also have available food and other kinds of drink besides intoxicants, let a manager be there who would only be paid a profit on the nonintoxicants, establish a place where there would be some little recreation, an occasional game, and perhaps even an occasional lecture, and song, and where you would not have simply a drinking establishment, you would do a great deal for the promotion of temperance in the country.</P>

      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the views expressed by Deputy Cooper regarding the difficulty that Deputies find, and will find, on the Committee Stage, in drafting amendments of a nature such as the Minister himself has invited.  The invitation almost necessitates having an official draftsman at the disposal of the Deputies.  The suggestion of Deputy Cooper is one which I hope the Ministry, and the Dáil generally, will think of as a suggestion which might be given effect to in regard to legislation in <Col N="2737" /> general.  Particularly in this Bill, it will be found that if the invitation of the Minister is considered, the drafting will be of a technical character, and unless Deputies are to be expected to allow interested associations to appoint draftsmen&mdash;which I do not think is altogether the best procedure&mdash;then the drafting will be difficult, and the opportunities for submitting sensible amendments will not be so great as the Minister suggests.</P>
      <P>I am going to support the Bill, and the Minister, in general, in his defence of the various clauses, if he deems it necessary, and if the Dáil decides that this Bill is to be passed at this period of the legislative year.  Again, however, I suggest that it would be more likely to bring outsensible and well-considered legislation if he would defer the Committee Stage of the main portion of the Bill, take sections 25 and 26 and make a separate Bill of them, and ask the Dáil to give the Bill rapid passage.  I think the country would be very much more satisfied, and I think more valuable work would be done than by risking the loss of the whole Bill between the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Like many Deputies, I have not very much affection for this Bill.  It seems to me to be a somewhat clumsy attempt to whitewash a condemned structure, to tinker with what I consider is an impossible system.  The Minister for Justice, who has my sympathy in the matter, forcibly reminds me of the somewhat squeamish maiden who, after visiting the museum for the first time, came back the next day with a supply of kilts for some of the statues.  I think that the drastic reform that is needed in this system should be only undertaken after thorough and careful inquiry has been made into the system. There is reform needed in the uniformity of the liquors supplied, and there should be such uniformity as will guarantee to the ordinary public that they are getting what is safe and what is best for their own interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reform is required with regard to the tied-house system that the Minister has referred to.  It is extremely necessary that that reform should be brought about with regard to the tied houses. <Col N="2738" /> Then reform is also required in the reduction of licences.  As the Minister for Justice has stated, there are fifteen thousand licences in Ireland.  I find from the return issued that the number of licences in the Free State is 10,135.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that the larger percentage of that number engaged in dual trading, and only 2,918 sold liquor alone.  The reduction of licences generally is a question that will have to be envisaged, and it is a question on which this inquiry is absolutely necessary.  We have licensed houses altogether out of proportion to the requirements of the community, and it does not tend to insure that business is conducted in the best possible way when we have a superfluity of licences, and when it is the interest, not merely the duty, of everybody, if he wants to live, to do things that otherwise he might not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that while this inquiry is necessary, there may be anomalies, and there are, I think, in the metropolitan area, that could be rectified by a much less pretentious measure than this, and there are certain inequalities and unfairnesses between individual traders, I understand, existing in the neighbourhood of the City.  These people should be brought into the City for licensing purposes also.  It is a most intolerable thing, and it is a most unjust thing that they should be refused the privileges of the City, when they have been taken in for all other purposes generally. As regards the proposals in the Bill, although they are tinkering with the case I think they are tinkering wrongfully in some ways.  I feel that while they should be closing on Christmas Day and Good Friday, St. Patrick's Day should be placed on the same basis as Sunday.  I think there are certain requirements of the public on that day that necessitate that there should be elasticity with regard to St. Patrick&rdquo;s Day, and that after 1 o'clock the same facilities should be given on that day with regard to <i>bona fide</i> travellers as on a Sunday.  I think that the hours of opening would be all right if discretion were given to a District <Col N="2739" /> Justice in the case of an early morning fair or market, to make provisions for the requirements of rural areas where people may have long distances to go, and where it may, perhaps, be necessary for them to get stimulants, particularly in the winter time.  With regard to the hours of closing, I do not see any necessity for making a difference between Saturday and any other day.  I do not think that any argument can be put up for it.  I think a better argument might be made in favour of the hours of trading on Saturday being longer than they are, instead of making them shorter.  I think that the proposal with regard to Sundays is right.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of structural separation.  I consider this is the greatest myth that could possibly be invented.  The idea that this dual trading has any sinister influence with regard to temperance I would not agree with at all.  I do not believe it has, but it is a grand text, undoubtedly, for those who want to preach Prohibition, and for some fanatics who are more or less extreme in their views, but I do not think that they could give any argument to show that the present system is in any way detrimental to the general interests of the community from the point of view of temperance. I do not see why structural separation should be enforced, especially as it would be impossible in a great many cases.  It seems to me that if structural alteration is ordained by this Bill, and if a man is ordered to separate his business structurally where it is not possible for him to do so, he should have the option of going out of the trade and claiming compensation.  The State should be prepared to give him this compensation, because you cannot ordain any hardship on a trader for the benefit of the whole community. That should be well understood, because I do not think it would be just or equitable to order any man to separate his premises structurally when it would mean that he would have no alternative but to go out of the trade. I could not at all agree with the proposal to order structural separation, except it was accompanied by a proposal <Col N="2740" /> with regard to compensation, and I am sure, when an inquiry is held into the trade in general, that we will arrive at reasonable ways and means of arranging that the number of licences can be reduced, and that if separation is deemed advisable where premises do not admit of it, compensation should be paid.  It would be the duty of such an inquiry to arrange that.  The spirit grocer is very much penalised in the Bill.  There are only 390 of these altogether. Deputy Cooper elaborated a scheme for five separate standard licences. I think that the object of those that are concerned in the matter should be to bring all the licence-holders on to the one register.  I think that there should be only one register.  The spirit grocer is the black sheep of the licensed trade generally, and he is exploited as such by everyone who gets up to talk temperance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be clear on this point, because, of course, if the Deputy is right I will be open to reconsider the Section.  My view is that the spirit grocer was given his licence to sell wine for consumption off his premises.  If he sells wine and intoxicating liquor to be consumed on the premises, that, in my opinion, is a breach of the condition on which he was given his licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephMcGoldr" hpid="Mr. McGOLDRICK Mr. McGOLDRICK">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGOLDRICK</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that that is a condition that attaches to spirit <Col N="2741" /> grocers' licences, that no drink is to be sold for consumption on the premises. Unfortunately, very few of the spirit grocers have been able to keep to that condition.  The difficulty of their being able to carry it out ought to be considered, and they ought to be placed on the same register as other licensed traders.  They only got these licences because the exigencies of the situation compelled it, because it was not considered desirable to increase the number of the other licences.  As regards the clause against girls under eighteen being employed on the premises, I think an exception might be made in the case of a trader's own family in regard to that.  I take no exception to the hours as regards Sundays.  As far as materials for manufacturing illicit spirits are concerned, I consider that very drastic penalties should be imposed.  They could not be too drastic for me.  I would be very much inclined to send persons found dealing in such things to gaol.  The arrangements with regard to clubs I am perfectly satisfied with.  I do not see that members of clubs should have any rights beyond the ordinary people who patronise the licensed establishments. I think they should not be able to exempt themselves from liability to prosecution by supplying drink at hours when people could not get it in the ordinary way.  I think it a danger if you allow them to have greater facilities than what are allowed to ordinary people in the ordinary public-houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Johnson suggested that after an inquiry those who remain in the trade should pay for those who go out. I think that proposal is one that could be put into force in this country.  I believe it is one that is capable of being applied.  They have such a scheme, in fact, in Wales.  It has imposed certain hardships, undoubtedly, on the people remaining in the trade by having redundant licences extinguished in areas at long distances from the areas in which those remaining carry on their trade.  Those remaining are compelled to pay compensation in an area from which they would not get any trade in the ordinary way.  An Inquiry could arrange the areas and the means by which licences could be materially reduced. <Col N="2742" /> Trade is extremely bad at the present time, and the temptations to those engaged in the trade to do things they should not do in order to make a living are far too great.  An Inquiry should be set up to go into the matter thoroughly and put forward ways and means for getting these licences reduced. Unless that is done you will not help the cause of temperance in this country.  There are a great many proposals in the Bill that I can support.  I can support the Second Reading, but with reservations with regard to some of the points I have spoken of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWalterShaw" hpid="Mr. SHAW Mr. SHAW">
      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>My position in connection with this Bill has been made very easy owing to the very reasonable opening statement of the Minister for Justice. He has agreed to leave to a free vote of the House the most controversial clause in the Bill, namely, the structural alteration clause.  As far as that clause is concerned, it is my intention on the Committee Stage to vote against it, because from my knowledge of a large number of houses throughout the country districts it would be practically impossible to comply with the conditions.  I do not think at the present time such drastic legislation should be adopted.  It would be necessary, if the structural alterations were carried out, for various shops to have double staffs, and while it was suggested that that might be a very good matter in the interests of labour, I think with the trade those people are doing at the present time, and the fact that they are practically, in my opinion, only paying expenses, it would be an impossibility to carry that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matters I take exception to are the hours, particularly with regard to districts which keep old time. In a large number of country areas they are 1½ hours behind the ordinary time, and the proposal in the Bill would mean, where old time is kept, they would be obliged to close at 8 o'clock. Other matters which I think might be amended would be in connection with fairs and markets.  It is not my intention to say anything further at this stage more than to suggest that the Minister should be agreeable to accept reasonable amendments in connection with these matters.  I think the Bill might <Col N="2743" /> be passed, and might be a great benefit to the country without causing any very serious loss to the persons engaged in the trade.</P>

      <P>There are a few points I wish specially to refer to.  I would wish that Deputy Johnson's views, as stated in his opening remarks, could be carried into effect.  That is, that Clauses 4 and 5 would be dealt with immediately, and that an opportunity would be given to the members of the Dáil for a conference to consider what further alterations should be made in the clauses that have been suggested, and to put forward a scheme that would be more acceptable to the Dáil, that would be more advantageous in the interests of temperance, and certainly would not be a loss to the people concerned in the trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Parts 4 and 5. As to illicit distillation, any punishment that could be given to those connected with that would not be too severe.  The number of inmates in many asylums has been increasing largely for the past three or four years owing to the amount of illicit spirit coming into the towns and villages.  If more powers are required than are taken in this Bill to deal with this evil I hope the Government will apply to the Dáil for them. I believe that those who engage in illicit distillation are the lowest and the worst type of criminals.  Robbery, murder and crimes of violence of the worst kind have been brought about as a result of this spirit being sold in the towns and villages.  I believe, too, that no whiskey should be allowed out of bond under five years' old.  It is this bad type of whiskey that is one of the chief causes of drunkenness and of the crimes attendant on drunkenness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards methylated spirits, we know what the result of drinking that has been in some of the industrial centres.  We know how degrading and how ruinous it is.  As to the opening hours on fair days, I believe there should be power to grant exemption. Those who wish to open their houses <Col N="2744" /> early on the days that fairs are held should be allowed to apply for an exemption and pay a certain amount for it.  Each year when the licences are being renewed those who wish to open early on those days should get an exemption, which would be marked on the licence, for which they would be charged a certain amount.  I do not see why the closing hour on Saturday should be earlier than on other days, In the country districts the working people are not paid until Saturday. They leave their work according to old time, so that they have only a half or three-quarters of an hour to get to the nearest town.  If they have to travel a couple of miles that would be very unfair to working people.  The wealthier classes can get their housekeeping done during the day, but those people who only get paid on a Saturday should not be prevented from doing their business by introducing such an hour as this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am entirely in agreement with the proposal for absolute closing on Good Friday.  It is a day which should be specially devoted to the Lord.  It is a day on which there should be devotions for all Christians.  The same thing should apply to Christmas Day.  But St. Patrick's Day is a national festival on which our people go to Feiseanna, football matches, &amp;c.  In London on that day there are Irish re-unions which very prominent men attend, and which continue perhaps until an advanced hour in the morning.  People of every nationality do rejoice on their festival day.  Why should the Irish people at home be told that they cannot enjoy it in the same way?  The wealthier classes can get a supply of whiskey or wine into their houses and they can, if they wish, take their hamper with them in their motor car. The working man cannot afford to pack a hamper or have a motor car.  I do not see why on St. Patrick's Day these people should be prevented from taking drink in moderation.  The idea that some people have that you must bring in legislation for the purpose of making people do what is right is not, I am afraid, going to lift the standard of our people.  It is not going to give them a very high moral sense.  I believe <Col N="2745" /> that temperance in Ireland will come through the schools and through the children.  It will come through the fathers who wish to show an example to their children by not indulging in too much drink.  I believe a certain amount of drink is good, but I believe too much of it is an abuse.  Moderation in drinking is a necessity with a great many people, and it is not wrong for anyone to take drink so long as they do not abuse it.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of licensed houses, I believe that there is an excess of them.  But I wish to remind Deputies that it was by legislation these licences were created.  Now we are asked by legislation to deprive these people of their licences without any compensation.  I do not think that is just.  This section as to structural alteration would certainly do this, and that would be a great disadvantage to the country.  Some of those people who are merely existing in the country towns will be driven out of business by this proposal for structural alterations. In the country areas, owing to reduced trade, due to lack of employment, some of these people are merely existing at present.  It would be better for the country that numbers of these people should go out of business, but this is not the time to force them, until the country begins to find its feet and get to work, which it has not done as yet.</P>
    <P>It is not for us to increase the unemployment market, or to send farmers' sons, who are in business in small towns and villages, back to the country. Many of the people there are at present sending vegetables, butter and other things, to help their friends in the towns to eke out an existence.  If their sons who are at business are sent back to farmers, having regard to the present state of agriculture, they are certainly not going to help their parents to get out of their difficulties. If these people cannot go to friends in the country they are going to be an expense to the public, as they will come on the rates, directly or indirectly.  I absolutely object to that section.  It may be possible that under a revised scheme the question of separating these business houses can be dealt with.  The fact that there is drapery at one end <Col N="2746" /> of the shop, and grocery at another end, does not lead to drunkenness.  In the country towns the bars in such shops are generally at the far end, or perhaps near the entrance.  The bar is certainly not at the counter where other goods are sold.  It strikes me that those people who are determined to take a glass of wine, and who will not drink anything stronger, as it would not be suitable to their sex, would find a place to go and have a glass of wine. We know of a country where they have prohibition, and we know what has been the result.  I know from friends who came over lately that there are many people in that country now drinking who never drank before, simply because they have been prohibited from doing so.  I am afraid that is a rather Irish characteristic too, and that until there is a higher moral standard in the country, if you want to prevent people doing something, you will not succeed by simply telling them they must not do it.  I believe the question is really one of example, and that the temperance reformers should rely on the schools.  I do not believe you are going to help the cause of temperance by turning a certain number of people out of the trade or by bringing in restrictions. I do not see why a man's daughter of 17 years of age should not help in his shop.  If she leaves school at 16 and goes to the grocery business, she attends behind his counter.  If he is not able to look after her, I am sorry for him.  I think she would be better employed under her father's supervision than pretending to be amusing herself on the roadside.</P>
    <P>There are other sections in the Bill with which I do not agree, and I trust that the Minister for Justice, if he persists with the Bill this Session, will agree to some amendments.  Dealing with clubs, I suggest that the closing hours should be 11 o'clock.  It is unfair to men in country districts, who leave their business perhaps at 9 or 9.30 p.m. and get to their clubs at 10, that when they sit down to a game of cards, or go to the reading room, they cannot have a drink up to 11 o'clock.  It would be a very good thing if all clubs closed not later than 12 o'clock.  In my young days people stopped in these <Col N="2747" /> clubs until 2 a.m.  I do not think that is right.  At the same time, I think clubs are entitled to remain open an hour longer than the licensed houses, in as much as many of the owners of these houses close at 9 o'clock and then go to their clubs.  Let the power that this Bill places in the hands of the authorities be used to see that clubs are properly conducted.  If that is done, to my mind there is no need for enforcing unnecessary restrictions.  The law will see to it that there will be no abuses.</P>

      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister for Justice on the introduction of this Bill.  I have been listening to sermons and lectures on temperance for many years, but I do not know of anything that will have such an influence on the citizens of the Saorstát, in the way of giving up intoxicating drink, as this Bill will when it becomes law.  I quite appreciate the need for temperance in the country, but suggestions have been made by some Deputies that this Bill will not help temperance but will be instrumental in creating more excessive habits of drinking. Take for example the closing of public houses on Saturday nights at 9.30 p.m.  That is five minutes past eight, Irish time.  Now, in order that I may be able to explain, so that the Minister for Justice will understand it, the difference which the various times make in the country I should mention that I was once in the town of Athlone and I heard the Angelus ring there.  I then motored to Moate, ten miles away, and I heard the Angelus ringing there. I then went on a few miles to Tubber and I heard it ring for the third time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Minister for Justice to look at the badge in my coat.  Now what is the result to workers who live in these places and who keep Irish time?  When they get their money on a Saturday evening it is late, for the farmers in that part of the country are not too fond of parting with the workers' wages until the last moment and they like to hold the money as long as they can, like all employers. The workers cannot send <Col N="2748" /> their wives into the shops at night as they would be told that it is after 9 o'clock, although in reality it is only after 8 o'clock.  They are, in fact, beginning to think in the country that the Summer Time Act is as drastic as this measure, though I admit that I supported it for the sake of giving extra daylight to my fellow-workers. The effect of this Bill will be that in large towns on Saturday night, when it comes to 9 o'clock the workers will be told by the publican that the time is up, and they will take large quantities of drink home.  The result will be that a kind-hearted father or mother will give intoxicating drink to the children, and when these children grow up they will get a certain gnawing around the bottom of their hearts which will make them take more liquor than will be good for them.  At present with the 10 o'clock closing in country towns, drink is not brought home, so that the children do not get the taste of it.  I do not know what influence there is in alcohol or whiskey, but I believe there is an influence in it which makes people who get a taste for it unable to do without it.  I ask the Minister to extend the hour at night for closing and make it 10 o'clock all round on a Saturday night.  I do not see why, in one part of the Bill, he gives certain facilities to certain very small places. Under the old Act public-houses are open until 9 o'clock in one town, 10 o'clock in another and 11 o'clock in another, according to population. Under this Bill they all close at the same time, but I think the hour should be 10 o'clock all round, and I think that in towns in which fairs and markets are held it is necessary to open at an extra early hour in order that buyers who come in for a half of whiskey or a bottle of stout may be put in good humour to make a bargain. The sellers get a better price because they are in better wit.  Deputy Johnson has dealt with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic at fair length.  Some Deputy has mentioned that the workers go into a public-house on a Sunday and do nothing but stand in the bar pouring beer down their throats.  Now that is really wrong.  I am sure that the Deputy who mentioned that knows very well that we have the Civic Guard throughout <Col N="2749" /> the country.  I quite agree that years ago, during the British régime, the R.I.C. used very often allow a man to go in to get a drink in his town on a Sunday.  The publicans now, however, at the sight of a member of the Civic Guard starts to shiver like blancmange on a plate.  The result is that no native of that town will get a drink in the town.  Very often I went in to a strange town in my own constituency and tried to bring a native of the town in with me to get a drink, but I found it impossible to get it for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has been raised concerning public houses in the country districts, and we are told that they are dirty and that they are simply places to spend your money in the whole day long.  We are told that it is more or less degrading for a man to enter inside the door.  Well, I have visited a good many of them, not for drink, and I have not seen any of this dirt that we are told of.  To my mind every publican, whether he is in a big financial position or whether he is a man waiting the change of a shilling over the counter in order to send out for something that he may require himself, tries to do his best to keep the house as clean as it possibly can be kept.  I hope when it comes to a vote on this Bill that the Deputies of the Dáil will not be inclined to vote for Section 12.  There is more opposition to this section in the country than there is to Article 12 of the Treaty in the North, and I certainly was very, very pleased when I learned that the Minister for Justice is allowing a free vote of the Dáil on this section, which means that the section is finished.  Every Deputy in the Dáil will quite agree that it would be a shame and a disgrace &mdash;if I could find a worse word I would use it&mdash;to request a man who has not the room or the means of doing so to convert his little house into two different departments so that he might sell chains and secondhand coffins in one and drink in another.  I quite agree that if we had ample house accommodation, it would be necessary to apply the principle of &ldquo;one man one trade.&rdquo;  But at the present time, owing to the scarcity of houses and owing to the poor state of the Saorstát Exchequer, the Minister for Justice will <Col N="2750" /> run the risk of not being on the very best terms with the Minister for Finance if he goes on with this Bill, because by reducing the number of publicans in the country you are also reducing the revenue of the country; and I believe that the duty charged on liquor is the only guarantee that they have at the present time for the carrying on of the administration of the State.</P>
    <P>A word or two concerning the clubs. Deputy D'Alton agreed that the clubs should be left open till eleven o'clock. At the present time they are allowed to continue open till 12.  If the clubs are allowed to continue open until 11 o'clock, will that have a bad effect on the members of the club who will be able to get drink there until 11 o'clock? Will it have the effect of making the bank account of a member, if he has such a thing, any heavier at the end of the year?  I do not think it will.  If a man has only one-and-sixpence, and is going to have three pints before closing time, he will have them whether the club is closed at 9 o'clock or 11 o'clock, so I do not think it would mean anything extra to allow the clubs to refresh their members until 11 o'clock. There is another point in connection with the club&mdash;I do not think it is right at all that a member of the Civic Guard should have power to walk into a club at any time and to search the club, and to see if there was a breach of the Licensing Act.  I think it should be necessary that the Civic Guard should have a warrant before entering a club, or else that he should be a member of it.  You will find that practically the majority of the clubs in the country&mdash; any of them that I have seen&mdash;are managed in the most respectable manner, and that there are not any such things as abuses except on the night of a smoking concert.  And I believe the Minister for Justice himself and other members of the Government do not object an odd time to a smoking concert or to a bit of diversion or amusement. And why should we deprive the people in the country of the same little bit of diversion that we require sometimes ourselves to relieve the monotony here?  The same thing applies to the country, where you have workshops <Col N="2751" /> with dust flying around, and the workers there like to have an hour or so once or twice a week at a smoking concert, and I certainly think they ought to be allowed that privilege.  It is certainly not a great privilege.</P>
    <P>There is a further sub-section which I object to as being a weak one.  It refers to family attendants and barmaids.  If 18 years of age is to be the minimum age for females before they begin to serve their time in a bar, they will be 21 years of age before they have served the three years necessary. Their parents are paying for them when they are at school and while they are serving their time.  When they are 21 years of age some lucky or unlucky man comes along and the barmaid gets married.  She is simply out of her time as a barmaid, and the result is she has done nothing for her parents in any shape or form to compensate them for having reared her.  Sixteen years of age is an age that would suit barmaids to start to serve their time.  At 19 their time would then be served, and they have two years in which to give a return to their parents.  In the majority of cases the parents are poor people who cannot afford to send their children to a University in order that they may become priests, doctors, or solicitors, and the only alternative is to put them inside a counter and let God do for them as God did for themselves. Every Deputy in the Dáil has received a great many resolutions and telegrams from all parts of the country.  I do not know whether every Deputy has been as unfortunate as I have been.  I have received them from all parts of the country.</P>

      <P>They may know me all right, but it is not because of what I spent in a public house in intoxicating drinks.  In the town of Athlone we have eighty-two public houses.  The population is something between seven and eight thousand.  I have been going to that town, and living in it at times, for the last twenty or twenty-two years.  In all that time I have not seen any real signs of intoxication.  I have <Col N="2752" /> not seen people falling about the streets as you do in many other places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming to Mullingar, there are there about 70 publicans.  The population is something about four thousand.  I know Mullingar well, and since the Civic Guards went there I do not think they had ten cases for drunkenness against any of the citizens.  At least I have not seen any.  The Minister for Justice knows these things.  He knows the number of prosecutions there have been for drunkenness throughout the country and he will find that in Mullingar there have not been ten cases for drunkenness and disorder in the streets since the Civic Guards went here.  That speaks very well for Deputy Shaw.  From Edgeworthstown, Granard, Ballymahon, down to Longford, we have large numbers of public houses, but if section 12 is allowed to stand&mdash;I am sure it will not&mdash;95 per cent. of all those publicans will have to sell out, and the price they will get for the premises will be very small.  Those people will be losing a large sum, but not alone will those people be losing but the State will also be losing.  Those people will have to go out of the country.  Any employees they have will be put on to the Labour Exchange where they will not receive benefits because they cannot be insured. I do not know whether the Minister for Local Government will agree that a person selling drink is in an insurable occupation.  He would want to be sometimes.  Another point I want to make is that if the Minister for Justice really wants to satisfy the people he will allow this Bill to stand on the shelf for two or three years. The Act they have at the present time I think is quite enough.  I do not see any great abuse throughout the country. I am sure every Deputy in the Dáil knows well that the vast majority of them have promised to vote against this Bill.  At least I have seen in the daily Press where Deputy so-and-so made promises.  Furthermore, they said, the Government were withdrawing <Col N="2753" /> the Whips.  If the Government withdraw the Whips, what will be the result?  If the Government are defeated on this measure, will there be an election and will they have to resign? I am sure the country is not at the present time fit for an election.  Personally I am not particular.</P>

      <P>I will get in before any of your men.  The result is you will have a vast majority of the people against you.  You are penalising a large number of publicans and small traders.  I do not speak for the very big ones who have ample accommodation for improvements.  They have also a good deal of money.  They were in business in the good old times, when the duty was not so high and they could make more profit.  We have also traders who are dependent on the few shillings they get over a counter for the education, clothing and feeding of their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of them are just in as poor a position as any workman or artisan. I know a couple of public houses which are thatched.  Judging by the outside, those are not houses that you would like to ask the Minister for Justice into, if you met him on the way. Neither would you like to ask a Deputy in for refreshments, if you judged the place by the outside.  But the inside of these houses is clean and the owners are doing their best.  I certainly do not agree with the Deputy who says that these places are kept in a dirty, filthy condition.  I hope, for the sake of those poor people, the Deputy did not really mean that it should go to the public that our Irish publicans are so slothful that they do not keep the premises, for which they pay licence duty, in a proper condition, or in such a condition that they would act as a magnet to draw passers-by in for a drink.  With the amendments which I hope the Minister will accept, I agree with the Bill.  I think the Bill ought to get a Second Reading on conditions. One of these conditions would be that a publican not in a financial position to employ barmaids over the stated age should be entitled, if he is sick, to have <Col N="2754" /> his daughter serve in the bar though she be under the age of eighteen&mdash;that is, provided he has no sons.  That is not a very big concession to ask. Surely it is not too much to ask either that public houses should be open up to 10 o'clock on Saturday nights.  On fair and market mornings a publican should be permitted to open an hour or two hours before 9 o'clock.  Above all, it is not too much to ask that the same concession that has been given in the past in regard to Sunday drinking, to the city of Dublin, should be applied to all parts of the Saorstát&mdash;that is, that public houses should be open from 2 o'clock until 5 o'clock on Sundays, and that there should be no bona fide business at all.  That would meet with the good wishes of all concerned.  I am authorised by practically every publican in the constituency I represent to say that they would be delighted to agree to this arrangement.  If the Minister for Justice would agree to this he would receive the blessings of all the publicans of the country.</P>
    <P>There is one question I would like to refer to in connection with the powers of District Justices.  The District Justices, under this Bill, have power, on the application of any superintendent or inspector of the Civic Guard, to close down any town on any day they may wish.  I do not know what is meant by that&mdash;whether we are expecting another rebellion, or whether we are expecting any serious trouble in the country.  I think such a provision is really uncalled for.  We are told that we are living in a Free State, but any body of people who may have a grudge against another section of the community can go to the inspector of the Civic Guard and can have the place closed up.  Fear of disturbance, I take it, is the real reason for this provision. But you will have disturbance if you have these public houses closed up all day.  It will be something like old times, when cattle were driven away from the landlords and the landlords were driven out of the country.  The publicans may rise up and drive out the Civic Guard.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister say that he is going to leave Section 12 to the free vote of the Dáil.  I <Col N="2755" /> intend to support the Bill on condition that the hours are 10 o'clock for Saturdays and that the other things I mentioned are accepted.  If these are not accepted then I will call for a division.</P>

He has dealt with practically every section in the Bill and condemned them, and yet he tells us that he is going to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lyons dealt with the matter of the employment of bar maids.  The Bill states that barmaids are not to be employed under 18 years of age.  With that provision I thoroughly agree, because I do not think that a public house is a suitable place to have any young girl who is under 18 years of age.  As matter of fact, I do not think that a public house is a place for a woman at any time, and I think the Minister is to be congratulated on putting that provision into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the bona fide question, I thoroughly agree with the Minister so far as that section is concerned. It is all cant, if I may use the expression, to talk about refreshments in connection with this particular section, because we all know very well, and there is nothing to be gained by trying to humbug ourselves, that there are people who go out into the country for the special purpose of procuring drink on Sundays.  They do not go out to refresh themselves in the accepted <Col N="2756" /> sense of that word, but rather they go out deliberately to get a lot of drink in country public houses on Sundays.  I am very glad that the Minister has practically decided to drop Section 12, because I am convinced it would be a great hardship on publicans if they were compelled to carry out a reconstruction of their premises.  This, too, would be a most inopportune time to introduce a provision of that kind, because we all know that with many of these people business is very bad at the present time.  I do say, however, that something must be done in that connection, because it is certainly not a desirable thing to see men drinking stout, porter and whiskey at a counter when young girls, women and young boys have occasion to enter licensed premises in order to procure groceries and other things.  I think that as far as possible there should be some division made between the grocery counter and the particular portion of the shop where drink is being sold.  I do not think legislation should go so far as to stipulate that the two departments in the business premises should be completely isolated.  I think that outside the counter there should be a wooden partition between the departments where groceries are sold and where drink is offered for sale.  I think we could allow a connection between the two departments inside the counter, but certainly not outside.  I think that is a matter that should be insisted on, because certainly a lot of young people are demoralised in a great many public houses where groceries and drink and all the rest are sold at the one counter.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to clubs, certainly every one of us has been canvassed by people interested in clubs, and I agree with the Minister for Justice in the action he has taken so far as clubs are concerned.  And there again there is no use trying to fool and humbug ourselves. We know very well that the fact of clubs having a licence and being permitted to sell drink is an inducement in 19 cases out of 20 to people in various parts of the country to join these clubs.  We know that is held out as an inducement, and we know there are abuses in these clubs.  I do not <Col N="2757" /> know why Deputy Lyons objects to the Civic Guard visiting these clubs.  I think they should have permission, without any warrant at all, to enter these clubs, because we all know there are abuses in these clubs and they should be looked after.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any other points, but again I say I think the Minister is doing right in allowing his party to vote freely on Clause 12.  I do think something should be done to cut off the bar from ordinary groceries in houses where mixed trading is done. I would ask the Minister especially to stand by the clause in so far as the barmaids are concerned, because I think it is a desirable clause and a very proper provision that no girl should be allowed at that age to go into a public house at all.</P>

      <P>I did not like to interrupt the Deputy, but as a matter of explanation I would like to say that my point as regards barmaids had reference to the case of the publican's daughter.  I quite agree it is very awkward having girls under eighteen <Col N="2758" /> serving in bars, but that regulation should not apply to the publican's daughter.</P>

      <P>The circumstances of Mr. O'Grady's claim were very complicated and took a great amount of time to elucidate.  Furthermore, legal advice had to be sought as to the propriety of admitting the claim as a charge against Army funds. However, it is expected that it will  practicable to effect its settlement within a fortnight.</P>
