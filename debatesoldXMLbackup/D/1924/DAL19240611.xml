      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that great dissatisfaction exists in the country owing to the delay in dealing with pre-Truce claims for personal injuries; if he will state if it is intended to take any action to expedite the hearing of the claims and subsequent payment.</P>

      <P>Two reports of the Compensation (Personal Injuries) Committee dealing with applications in respect of pre-Truce personal injuries have been received by me.  All the recommendations of the first report and the majority of the recommendations of the second report have been paid, and it is hoped to dispose of the remaining cases in the second report before the end of the week.  A further report is expected before the end of the month, and the necessary payments will be made without delay.  I am satisfied that the claims are being heard and disposed of with all possible expedition.</P>
      <P>The first report of the Committee dealt mainly with post-Truce claims. The second report contains eighty cases of pre-Truce injury in which recommendations for payments of compensation are made.  The third report of the Committee will deal exclusively with pre-Truce claims, and will include about 500 such cases.</P>

Lynam, C.C., Tullamore, has not yet been delivered; and if he is aware that a notice was sent Fr. Lynam by the Post Office Authorities on the 28th May to the effect that the parcel was being detained for test, although the contents were specified on the invoice attached to the parcel; if he will state how long more the detention for test is to last, and if he will take steps to prevent this and other delays in the transmission of business by post.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that Mrs. Mary Fitzgerald, Coolaha, Gortroe, Youghal, applied for compensation únder Section 71 (a) of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, in respect of <Col N="2095" /> the loss of her son killed during the recent hostilities while on active service in the National Army protecting the railway line, Headford to Kenmare; whether he is aware that the Pensions Board refused to allow the claim, and whether as the deceased volunteer contributed largely out of his pay to the support of his aged mother, now almost destitute, he will cause this claim to be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the terms of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Third Schedule to the Army Pensions Act, 1923.  It has been ascertained that Mrs. Fitzgerald was dependent on her deceased son to a very limited extent.  A pension is, therefore, not payable.  Again, inasmuch as five members of her family are in regular employment, it would appear that her circumstances should not be such as to warrant the issue of a gratuity.  Mrs. Fitzgerald's application was, therefore, I regret to say, necessarily disallowed after careful consideration.  I shall, however, be glad to consider any representations made in the case as to the existence of any special circumstances which might justify the grant of a gratuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is <Col N="2099" /> that the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1924, shall take precedence of the Unemployment Insurance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that we are not going to deal with the Unemployment Insurance Bill at all to-day?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it means that it will not be dealt with at all to-day. While I have made it clear to the Minister for Justice that I gave him precedence to-day, I made it equally clear that he will not get it another day.  The Unemployment Insurance Bill comes on to-morrow, whether or not he finishes to-night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of resolution between the Minister for Justice and myself.  I was more borne than convinced by him.  I realise that the Unemployment Insurance Bill has been delayed, and is still further delayed by this postponement, and I propose to ask the Dáil to take such steps as will enable the latter stages of the Bill to be taken together, so that there will be no delay.</P>

      <P>Deputies at this side of the Chamber object to these proceedings. This Bill has been promised for a considerable time.  It has been delayed, and now it is going to be further delayed.

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>There are already four Bills on the Order Paper for to-morrow, and they will have precedence over everything postponed from to-day. If the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been convinced by the arguments of the Minister for Justice, can he explain why the Minister for Justice is not here to convince us?  We have certain rights in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we take the Unemployment Insurance Bill after we finish with the Railway Bill.  It is very much more urgent than any of the other matters on the Orders of the <Col N="2100" /> Day.  The Health Insurance Bill may be very important to the National Health people, but it is not important to the people; they would be far better without it.  The Dublin Police Bill is not at all urgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a possibility of portion of to-day being lost if we abide strictly by the Orders of the Day as set out here.  It is not very likely that we will get on to No.10 to-night. I have guaranteed to take it to-morrow.  For the problematical loss of a portion of a day, I guarantee, with the leave of the Dáil, to make it up on the later stages.  We are working to the 29th June, and that sets the pace for me in trying to get this Bill through the Dáil.  The Minister for Justice cannot be here because he is in the Seanad dealing with Bills there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know the Minister for Justice may be thirsting to show his sympathy with the licensing trade, in connection with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, but we on these benches take the view&mdash;and it is the considered view of our party&mdash;that the Unemployment Insurance Bill is much more important than the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  It is a matter of indifference to thousands of workpeople whether drink is sold at 7 o'clock or 9 o'clock.  They have no money to purchase it nor have they work to provide the money.  The Government, seeing that, are unable or unwilling to provide work for the workers, and in the circumstances they should proceed to provide a proper system of maintenance for those people who cannot find employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere fact of postponing the Bill to-day does not prejudice its ultimate expedition in the Dáil, and in those circumstances I think the objection might be withdrawn.

      <P>I beg to move for permission to bring in the Indemnity Bill, 1924.  The purposes which it intends <Col N="2102" /> to carry out are outlined in the Resolution, and I formally move for permission.  The main purport of the Bill is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A Bill entitled an Act to restrict the taking of legal proceedings in respect of certain acts and things done during the struggle to bring about the termination of the rule of the British Government in Ireland and the establishment of the First Dáil Eireann and the Second Dáil Eireann respectively as the lawful Government of Saorstát Eireann, or done during the period immediately succeeding the conclusion of that struggle and to make provision for the payment of compensation to certain classes of persons in relation to such acts and things as aforesaid and to validate sentences and the execution of sentences imposed by military tribunals acting under the authority of the First Dáil Eireann or the Second Dáil Eireann and for other purposes connected therewith.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That leave be given to introduce the Indemnity Bill, 1924&rdquo;&mdash; put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Second Stage ordered for Tuesday, June 17th.</P>

      <P>Amendment 38 was moved by Deputy Duggan, and we were on a discussion with regard to its provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I think, was invited to explain what was meant by the term &ldquo;National Forces.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that was exactly the demand made of me.  I think the term &ldquo;National Forces&rdquo; explains itself, and does so without any details from me.  I understood that a suggestion had been made that there should be incorporated here some such phrase as occurred in Deputy O'Connell's previous amendment. &ldquo;work of national importance.&rdquo;  Apparently, on the last day work of national importance was being defined as meaning work not in any of the military forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is where my doubts arose.  It <Col N="2103" /> was previous to that amendment having been moved that I asked Deputy O'Connell if he had in his mind any definition of &ldquo;work of national importance&rdquo; outside of &ldquo;services with the military forces.&rdquo;  I understood from him that he had not, that the term, &ldquo;services with the military forces&rdquo; included the one &ldquo;work of national importance&rdquo; which he intended to bring in.  I was waiting for some further statement from Deputy O'Connell of the additional work of national importance which would not come in under the term &ldquo;services with the military forces,&rdquo; and I am still waiting for that explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to raise any particular objection to the insertion of this amendment, but it seems to me to emphasise the fact that the whole of the provisions of this Bill are laid down on the lines of real nationalisation of the railways.  In other words, as an ordinary commercial concern, the railways, I think, could not be called upon to differentiate as regards their staff on an amendment like this.  The whole trend of this amendment is that the Government are taking control, not only of the arrangements in connection with the railways, but in connection with the services of the servants of the railway companies.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DUGGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 35, Third Schedule, paragraph 5 (d), lines 48 to 52, to delete all from and including the word &ldquo;average&rdquo; to the end of the paragraph, and to insert in lieu thereof the words, &ldquo;annual value of the remuneration and emoluments of which he was in receipt on the 3rd day of April, 1924, unless he received promotion within one year before the said 3rd day of April, 1924, in which case his remuneration and emoluments shall for the purpose aforesaid be taken to be the annual value of the remuneration and emoluments of which he was in receipt immediately before such promotion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is introduced in accordance with a promise made when the Bill was in Committee.  The object of <Col N="2104" /> the amendment is to ensure that a redundant official will receive his compensation on the basis of his salary at the date of retirement, except in the case of men promoted within one year prior to the 3rd April, 1924, in which case the basis of compensation will be the salary prior to the promotion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>We look upon this amendment, although perhaps brought forward in a little different form to that in which it was discussed in Committee, as being a most unfair and unreasonable attempt on the part of the Government in dealing with those who may become redundant as a result of this Bill.  A railway servant, or an official who is associated with the Superannuation Fund, receives under ordinary conditions a pension based upon the rules in operation with regard to the fund which he belongs to.  Some funds provide that superannuation is to be based on the last seven years of average salary, while others give a percentage of the average salary based on length of years of service.  I cannot understand why the Minister has put in this proviso with regard to those who receive promotion twelve months prior to the 3rd April, 1924.  I have seen a circular which is supposed to have been issued by the Ministry in regard to promotions that took place&mdash;I think the date given was the 1st January, 1924. Vacancies have occurred in the ordinary administrative positions in the railways for the last twelve months as they have always occurred.  These must be filled from a purely administrative point of view.  The attitude of the Minister in regard to these cases is that any person who may have been called upon in the ordinary course of events to fill a higher post, which had to be filled for administrative reasons, will not get the benefit of the increase of salary, following promotion, if he becomes redundant as a result of this Bill.  Mr. Justice Wylie, in the case of the Irish Railways Wages Board, gave a decision which means a certain increase of salary for the lower grade staffs on the railways.  This increase ranges from £5 per annum to £40 per annum.  The effect of the operation of this amendment, as it stands, is that any of these lower grade officials or servants who may become redundant as a <Col N="2105" /> result of this Bill, in 1926 or in 1927 will not receive the benefit of these increases in their compensation or superannuation. In other words, they will be compelled to retire, and to accept compensation terms based upon their salary in 1921 or in 1922, although they may not become redundant until 1926 or 1927. I think that is very unfair, especially to the lower grade people, who otherwise would benefit to a considerable extent as a result of the recent decision of Mr. Justice Wylie.  As in most cases it is the lower grade people who will become redundant, I hope the Minister will see the injustice that is being done by this amendment, and that in all fairness he will accept the later amendment standing in the name of Deputy Johnson, which deals with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the amendment which stands in my name would meet the whole case.  It is the last appeal that we are making to the Minister in the final stages of this Bill, and I hope the appeal will not fall on deaf ears.  This is not a matter of looking for charity, but of looking for rights already established.  Superannuation is already granted to servants retiring under ordinary conditions, and I think that what they get under ordinary conditions they should get under the extraordinary conditions created by the coming into operation of this measure.</P>

      <P>At this late stage of the Bill it would, I suppose, be useless for me to make an appeal to Deputy Davin to read the amendment which is under consideration before I proceed to pass any comments on something that he has evolved from his imagination and which is not before me.  He has spoken of increase in salary.  Is, I ask, increase of salary mentioned in this amendment?  The words are &ldquo;unless he receives promotion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Promotion surely means increase of salary, and increase of salary will have some effect on his superannuation or upon the compensation sections in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask, does increase of salary always mean promotion? I am dealing with an amendment <Col N="2106" /> which states &ldquo;unless he receives promotion,&rdquo; not unless he receives an increase of salary at a certain period. The object of the amendment, as stated, was this: That the railway companies were warned definitely, and were requested to take into their consideration a scheme for the reorganisation of the railways.  They were given that warning about November, 1922, and the effect of the amendment is to catch any promotions that were made after that date.  They were not actually tied to that date because they were given liberty to make promotions during two or three months following the date of that warning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister correct in stating that the date of the warning was November, 1922?  I understood that the date was November, 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>The date of the warning was the 17th November, 1922. That was issued to the railway companies on that date, and we are now seeking to prohibit promotions made after the 3rd April, 1923, counting towards the pension which will be given if a man is discharged because he becomes redundant under this railway scheme.  That is a very different thing to what the Deputy has stated.  This question of promotion is very different to the granting of an increase of salary.  People who get the ordinary increase of salary and who may become redundant will have their pensions calculated on the terms which Deputy Davin thinks equitable.  The only people who will not benefit in that way are those who were given promotion after the three months' period or later than the warning was first issued to the railway companies, that a railway reorganisation scheme was on foot and that promotions should be carefully scrutinised.  The amendment catches these people, and we intend to hold them to it.  There is one change which perhaps may be made later in the amendment.  The phrase at present is rather vague, and it is intended to substitute a more definite one.  It is proposed to substitute for the &ldquo;3rd day of April, 1924,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the date of the happening of the event giving rise to the claim <Col N="2107" /> for compensation.&rdquo;  That is not so objectionable as accepting the whole of the next amendment.  Is it possible to have this amended amendment considered with Amendment No. 40?</P>

I go back to a warning given on the 17th November, 1922, and a certain liberty was given for a period after that.  I go back beyond the date of the circular. That was a very definite event.  The circular was issued specially because it came to our knowledge that a promotion was about to be made, and the circular was issued having special reference to that one promotion.  We do know of three promotions made since that time.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the amendment.  The matter was raised at an earlier stage.  I think there is no need for it.  I think that the Bill speaks of employees of the companies which must include all such persons, but there is no doubt that within a certain section of the railway service there have been certain suspicions, and this amendment will make matters quite clear and remove those suspicions from very suspicious people.</P>

      <P>I expect the Minister has in mind the case to which my attention was drawn where a solicitor for an absorbed baronially guaranteed company had been engaged for over 38 years.  He was appointed by the County Council.  It appears, if I remember rightly, that the County Council would not, in view of the passing of this, consider itself responsible for pensioning such a servant.  If this section is amended in the way the Minister now proposes it will mean that that solicitor, after having served 38 years as a whole-time employee of the Committee responsible for the baronially guaranteed line to be absorbed, will be deprived of his right of pension from either the county or from the railway company.  I am not quite sure if I have the case right at the moment, because I did not expect it would arise, and my memory is not very clear on the point, but I expect the Minister has had the matter brought to his notice.  It seems to me that injustice would be done, and I hope the Minister does not wish to do injustice to any single person, even a solicitor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>But this refers to a class different rather to the class referred to in the Schedule.  The Schedule, I take it, refers to existing officers and servants of a railway company.  This refers, according to the Deputy who proposed it, to shop employees who may be Trade Union employees, and who may pass from one shop to another, and who have no service at all, except the period that is mentioned.  Are the men after two, three, four or five years service in this shop entitled to carry a pension?  This class is quite a different class to that referred to in the original schedule, and I think the Deputy who proposed the amendment saw the difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My previous answer when this point was raised was <Col N="2110" /> that shopmen were included.  We had always intended to include them; and it was only to make explicit what we believed to be already in the Bill and in the schedule that this clause has been introduced.  The period of five years put in is intended to apply to railway shopmen as well as to every other class of employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. GOOD Mr. GOOD">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOOD</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite contrary to the usual practice in connection with Trade Union employees.  If a man who has had three or four or five years' service in a shop is going to get a pension and leave that service and go into some other service, he is going to get a rate in excess of what is the recognised Trade Union rate.  This is going to set up a principle that is going to be exceedingly awkward; it is going to set aside what I might call standard rights in connection with certain trades.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 43:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In page 42, Ninth Schedule, Part II, to delete the figures opposite &lsquo;Mayo&rsquo; and substitute therefor &lsquo;£292.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to convince the Minister of the unreasonableness of the attitude which he takes up in trying to victimise a county that is not over prosperous, in the interest of the huge monopoly which this Bill is going to establish.  In Mayo there are two railways, and remember that they are guaranteed railways. We heard a lot last week about keeping one's engagements, but that all seems to be forgotten when we come to deal with individual promises.  There are two railways in County Mayo&mdash; the Claremorris and Ballinrobe Railway and the Claremorris and Swinford Railway.  The Claremorris and Ballinrobe line is carried on at a loss, and the Claremorris and Swinford line is carried on at a profit.  The Claremorris and Swinford line was built in <Col N="2111" /> order to break down the monopoly of the Midland Great Western Railway and allow the Great Southern and Western Railway Company to get in and take some of the route.  This Bill changes all this.  The attitude that the Minister takes up indicates that he is going to do something that at least is not exactly carried out in commercial establishments.  He wants to treat each of the railways as a separate item, and, as far as the County Mayo is concerned, he takes completely all the profit, and he wishes the County Mayo to take the whole portion of the loss.  Shylock brought up-to-date.  That is really what it is.  He takes not only his pound of flesh, but he takes 800 times his pound of flesh.  Now, in 1913 they made a kind of standard agreement in regard to these railways, and from 1913 to 1923 the officials of the County Council had no access to the books of those companies; but in 1923 the official of the County Council came along and he had access to the books; and for the half year ending the 30th April, 1923, the Claremorris and Swinford Railway&mdash;the only railway to whose accounts they had access&mdash; showed the surprising profit of £29 13s. 2d.  A very astonishing thing happened in the very next half year.  The profit in the next half year rose from £29 to £1,163.  There seems to have been a gold mine in the railway running from Swinford to Claremorris. Now, the years in which the auditors or the officials of the County Council had no access to the books of the railway companies were very prosperous years, and I am sure&mdash;I have not the slightest doubt about it&mdash;that if the officials of the County Council had access to the books, the receipts of the county would have benefitted very considerably by their investigations.</P>
    <P>The loss on the Ballinrobe line was £1,776 18s. 4d. for 1923.  Those are the very last figures available.  The gain on the Claremorris and Swinford line was £1,193 9s. 3d., made up of a profit of £29 in one half year and a profit of £1,163 in another half year.  Of course, we feel this very much in the county of Mayo.  We do not think that <Col N="2112" /> it is at all fair that the people of the county should be mulcted for their portion of the loss on the Claremorris and Ballinrobe Railway, while there is no account at all taken of the profit on the Claremorris and Swinford line. And what I wish to suggest to the Minister is&mdash;and I hope he will adopt the suggestion&mdash;that the difference between those two figures, £1,776 and £1,193, will be taken as the full loss that is, £583, for half of which the County Mayo is only liable in justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. McNALLY Mr. McNALLY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McNALLY</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. For the last twenty years the Tuam and Claremorris Railway has been worked at a profit roughly of £1,100 a year.  The branch line is a guaranteed line.  The line from Claremorris to Ballinrobe has been working at a loss roughly of £900.  What the Minister proposes to do is to take the £1,100 profit and make us pay the £900 loss on the Ballinrobe line.  That is not fair, and I, therefore, second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment has for its object the setting off against the amount payable by the County Council of Mayo in respect of the Ballinrobe and Claremorris Railway, a so-called surplus arising on another railway. There are three railways with which the county of Mayo is concerned&mdash;the Athenry and Tuam Extension to Claremorris, the Ballinrobe and Claremorris Railway, and the Claremorris and Swinford Railway.  With regard to the first of these, the Bill does not provide for any payment from the County Mayo in respect of that line.  With regard to the Ballinrobe and Claremorris line there is a loss, and that loss is being met by the arrangement under the Bill. Against that we have in this amendment to set off what is called a surplus arising out of the Claremorris and Swinford Railway.  The true position with regard to the Claremorris and Swinford Railway is this: It is worked by the Great Southern and Western Company under a very old agreement, an agreement which, if this Railway Bill did not come along, would certainly have been revised, and which <Col N="2113" /> would have turned this peculiar surplus into another loss.  It is an old agreement set up many years ago whereby the line is worked for a sum of £4 per mile per week.  The Great Southern and Western Company, working this portion of the line for that sum of money, enabled a portion of the line itself to show a surplus.  It is quite certain that the cost per mile per week of running any baronially guaranteed line in this country would average at the moment between £10 and £12, so that the case is that, by virtue of the old arrangement, which is quite inequitable in present-day conditions, this portion of the line is at the moment enabled to show this so-called surplus.  If the Bill had not come along that agreement would have to be subject to revision, and had it been revised at the rate which corresponds with the working expenses per week of other lines, there is no doubt that this so-called surplus would disappear. Consequently, the provision of the Bill that the county of Mayo shall pay a sum of £866 for ten years in substitution of a perpetual liability for payment of the interest on the guaranteed capital, is quite equitable.  A case can be made out for setting off the so-called profits against the loss on the other line, but that surplus arises, as I have said, by virtue of an old agreement, which is completely out of touch with present-day conditions, and which is subject to revision, and which would have to be revised had this Bill not come along.</P>

I can hardly understand how we could call it inequitable, because it was an agreement. We consider all those baronial guarantees in which the barony has to pay, inequitable, but why would the Ministry consider an agreement, if it operates against the company, inequitable? Is there any definite clause asking for this revised arrangement within a certain time?</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Wilson, I wish to say that the agreement was not made for any stipulated period, but there was nothing which would prevent the company from making application to have the rate revised. The circumstances are such that any clear exposition, any clear view, of the present cost of working would immediately put this agreement out of court, and even though no time-limit existed as to the time it would run, application had only to be made for the agreement to be broken.  I am not interested in one railway company over another.  The question of one company over another disappears with this Bill. There is to be one amalgamated undertaking, and that has to be made economical. The County Council of Mayo is being relieved from the liability it had in perpetuity, and it is being set over a period of ten years, and it has to pay a very limited sum.  I think that Deputy Good will assent that the Mayo County Council, like every other county council, comes very well out of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I think the argument of the Minister is not quite convincing.  I think there was a bargain made and that it should be adhered to.  According to the Minister, so far as the interests of the railway companies are concerned, it should be a case of heads I win and tails you lose.  The point he makes about the cost of running the line having increased, is an argument that would tell in favour of the reduction of the profit, but not of sweeping away the whole lot.  I suggest to the Minister that he should look at it from that point of view, and give the county credit for some of this profit that is made on the Claremorris and Swinford line.  He has not made much of a case for sweeping away the entire profit, because he said that the railway company would have raised the point.  I think the Great Southern and Western Company is well able to look after its own interests.  When they did not raise the point up to now, they might have gone on for another twenty years without raising it.</P>

I would like to expand the argument, and say that the arguments of the Minister in favour of the Bill are not convincing, but are quite the other way.  Deputy Sears and Deputy Wilson are responsible for putting through this Bill, and how either of them can get up and say that there is a claim for retaining an obligation against a railway company when they have been roping in the spoils during the whole period of this Bill, seems to me to be very unconvincing so far as they are concerned.</P>

Was there a bargain between the Mayo County Council and certain baronies with regard to these guaranteed lines, and why are we not keeping the baronies to their agreement?  Would he prefer the baronies kept to their agreement and have the Claremorris and Swinford line also kept to their agreement?  Would he consider it a reason for mulcting the County Council in heavy sums if the baronial guarantees were kept <i>in toto</i>?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I can easily understand why the discussion of the Railway Bill is considered to be such a dry subject, especially as we find alongside it the Intoxicating Liquor Bill awaiting discussion.  I have no desire to delay, even for one minute, the time of the Dáil, or the time which the Minister for Justice is going to take up in connection with the Intoxicating <Col N="2116" /> Liquor Bill, when he will, no doubt, in a very eloquent way, advocate the cause of temperance.  I want, however, to make a few points in regard to the Bill as it now appears before us. The Bill, as amended in Committee and on the Report Stage, is certainly a considerable improvement on the Bill as it appeared when originally drafted, but we are not exactly satisfied that the Minister was justified in rejecting some of the very reasonable amendments which we put up with the object only of improving the Bill as a whole. I can assure the Minister that he will be faced with amendments of the same kind in the other House, where the machinery of the Government Party organisation does not work so effectively and so unjustly as it works in this House.  I hope in the intervening period he will look more closely into these amendments so that he will not be faced with a defeat in the other House, which will give more favourable consideration to the amendments on their merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clause 25 of the Bill directs the tribunal that is to be set up to go into and decide upon the question of a preliminary revision of railway rates within three months.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the amalgamated company, when formed, will control&mdash;or, at least, I think it will&mdash;the Royal Canal.  I want to know from him if a preliminary revision of rates in regard to the amalgamated undertaking that will affect the Midland Great Western Railway, will also mean a revision of tolls affecting those who trade on the Royal Canal system.  I want to know from him if on this preliminary revision of railway rates the question of rates and tolls on canals will be gone into at the same time.  In other countries where a system of water transport is used to a greater extent than in this country there is a deferential in favour of canal companies; the rates are 20 per cent lower than those that operate on the railways.  I draw attention to this fact because I happened to be on the Canal Commission, and I have received many communications from by-traders particularly, conveying to me the grievances under which they <Col N="2117" /> suffer as by-traders.  There has been no reduction of canal rates or tolls since they were first imposed by the Ministry of Transport.</P>
    <P>I think any preliminary revision of railway rates should not prejudice the position of those who are using the canals and waterways system of the country at the present time.  I hope the Minister will make that quite clear.  I believe the Bill does give power to the Minister acting on his own behalf and without representations from anybody, to order the tribunal to go into the question of canal rates and tolls.  I think it is a very important matter, and I think the Minister should take some steps to give a direction to the tribunal in the matter.  There was a Commission set up to inquire into the future of the inland waterways and canals, but as far as I can see the report has been buried without a funeral service.  I hope I am wrong in that.  At any rate, the Minister, or his predecessor, has made no statement to this Dáil as to what it is intended to do arising out of the report of this Commission.  For that reason, I think it desirable to mention the matter here now.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I wish to speak on, though I may appeal in vain to the Minister to look into it; it is the question of pensions to old railway servants, men who retired before the bonus came into operation on the railways.  They have been retired upon a pre-war basis, and, as everybody knows, the pre-war pension basis has severely hit old pensioners, whether they were Civil Service pensioners or railway pensioners.  I was wondering if the Minister would make some representations to the directors of the amalgamating company to see if anything could be done to improve the position of the very few men who are affected.  Something of an improvement has been effected in the position of men pensioned by the British railways on a pre-war basis.  Perhaps representations on the part of the Minister to the people who have the doling out of the money would have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>If the scheme which is laid down under this Bill, that is the scheme of a <Col N="2118" /> huge monopoly under private ownership, is going to fail, it will fail simply because of the failure of private ownership. We were told by the President, when moving the Second Reading of this Bill, that the people who would be entrusted with the carrying out of the work in connection with the operation of this scheme, would be given a last chance, and if within the period which was allocated for experimental purposes it proved to be a failure, then the Government, or whatever Government would be in power at the time, would be compelled to take the bold step of nationalising the Irish railways.  I have supported this Bill on principle, because I believe it makes the path easy for nationalisation.  I believe if it fails it will fail because of the failure of private ownership, and if this scheme fails, and with it private ownership, we will no doubt look upon this Bill as the last monument to the system of private ownership in this country.  I hope the experimental period will not be very long, because I am as certain as I am standing here, that this scheme will eventually fail, and fail because it will always take into consideration, or the people who will be administering it will take into consideration the question of more revenue and higher dividends for the owners, rather than the question of providing the best services that can be given to the community at the cheapest possible rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamHewat" hpid="Mr. HEWAT Mr. HEWAT">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we may take it that, when speaking on this matter, Deputy Davin has really been speaking in favour of the Bill.  This Bill entered the House on Second Reading in an atmosphere which was, perhaps, a little more heated than should be the case in considering a business Bill of the importance of this measure.  It has gone through Committee Stage and has been amended.  In so far as the amendments to the Bill have been carried, I think it is thereby improved&mdash;that is, if it were possible to improve what is unimprovable, so far as the principle is concerned. This Bill nas been brought forward by the Government and it has been forced through the House by the machinery of the Government.  It has received support from Labour, and in that connection one is hardly surprised <Col N="2119" /> that it should get the support of Labour. Deputy Davin has been quite outspoken in that respect.  He considers the measure as a milestone on the road to nationalisation.  I hope the House will bear that in mind.  On a former occasion the Labour Party brought forward a Bill on the lines of nationalisation, and this House, in its wisdom, threw it out on the Second Reading.  It did not even submit it for amendment.  Now the Dáil has, by a majority, adopted what Deputy Davin recognises, and rightly recognises, as a Bill making for nationalisation.  And what for?  Who wants this Bill?  The railway companies do not seem to want it.  I have not seen very much enthusiasm on behalf of the Bill in the Dáil except in Government circles and in those circles in which the people supporting the Bill or advocating it are going to get something for themselves.  The Farmers' Party told us, in the earlier stages, that they supported the Bill in a half-hearted fashion.  It did not much matter whether they supported it in half-hearted fashion or not.  They have supported it, and the basis of their support, I think, is, without their having stated it deliberately, the relief the baronies are going to obtain through the transfer of the loss on the baronial railways to the trading community.  I make the Farmers' Party a present of that.  It is a short-sighted policy, and I do not think they see very far on the road they are travelling.  Deputy Davin has said that this Bill is going to fail, that it is an experiment in the direction of nationalisation and the last chance for private enterprise.  Where does private enterprise come into this Bill at all?  There is not the semblance or the vestige of private enterprise in it.  This Bill provides that a certain number of directors shall operate the railways in the financial interest of their shareholders.  That, if they had free and untrammelled control of the railways, or even reasonable control, would be private enterprise.  But that is not so in this Bill.  Any possible power they had got has been taken from them.  There is a tribunal to be set up which is going to be comprehensive and far-reaching in character. That tribunal is going to tell them <Col N="2120" /> what rates they are going to charge. That tribunal is going to tell them what wages they are going to pay, presumably.</P>

      <P>My friends on the opposite benches can very well look after that, and I am sure they will. But this tribunal is going to be an allpowerful factor in connection with the running of these railways under unification. What is this tribunal going to be?  It is going to be a tribunal appointed by the Government.  It is going to have the Government behind it.  In other words, the whole railway system, from beginning to end, is going to be permeated by political influences. When Deputy Davin talks about the unified railways under this Bill as being private enterprise, he is only jeering at the whole principle of the Bill. There is no private enterprise in it. There is no initiative in it.  There is nothing but a dead thing in it, except so far as political influences are going to run the undertaking on political lines.  I do not mean to say it is going to be run on political lines, beyond the fact that the political party in power is going to have control of the railways as effectively as if they were nationalised. To talk about railway directors being there to manage the railways is only a farce.  What is going to happen under the Bill?  The board of directors are naturally going to take full advantage of the protective clause of the Bill, which provides that the revenue coming to the shareholders is to be based on the revenue of the three preceding years to 1914.  The tribunal is to say what rates of freight and what passenger fares are to be put in operation to provide that revenue.  Supposing there is contention about that&mdash; and there must be contention about it straight away&mdash;you have got one member of the tribunal, a man of experience in railway matters, and you have got, the railway directors, on the other hand, and you start straight away&mdash; almost as soon as the tribunal is formed &mdash;into contention between the various bodies, as to what is the right rate to be charged for goods and passengers. You have, of course, got the public to consider.  The public have been jibbing <Col N="2121" /> at the high rates and fares that are being charged.  I say deliberately that, within the last twelve months, their chance of getting a reduction in these rates and fares has been prejudiced by this Railway Bill.  I say deliberately that the railway companies that are going to be amalgamated could not have continued for the past twelve months to have charged twenty-five per cent. over the competitive non-amalgamated companies if it had not been for the bad influence of this Bill on the whole situation.  Is it going to be easier to deal with Labour under the amalgamated company than it is under the present companies?</P>

      <P>I think not.  I can see the influence that has already been brought to bear in connection with this Bill having a very material effect on the cost of working of the railways in future.  You have seen Deputy Davin using very successfully his powers and influence in connection with this Bill. You have seen at the last stage, at the death knell, of this Bill provisions being inserted to include pensions to shop men on the railways&mdash;a class of men who were never considered railway men in the past.  What have we seen through the course of the Bill? The Farmers' Party want their goods carried for nothing.  The farmers, as the Minister himself has said, represent 75 per cent. of the wealth of the country and those responsible for 75 per cent. of the wealth of the country are going to demand that their goods should be carried very much lower than the goods of anybody else.  How is the Government going to resist it? We can wait and see.  The unfortunate part of the thing is that when we wait and see we are in the soup.</P>

      <P>That is quite true. What I complain of is, the Bill is so far-reaching that the people who have been discussing it do not understand how far-reaching it is.  They have no more idea than the man in the moon where they are going to hit themselves. Of course, the Bill can be altered and swept away, but my responsibility in <Col N="2122" /> the matter is, that any word of mine that can bring forth a recognition of what this Bill will mean in the future must be said.  What is the use of talking&mdash;not a bit in the world.  I have spoken many times on this Bill, but we have the stone walls around us.  We have the Farmers' Party supporting the Government.  We have the Labour Party supporting the Government. Where do I come in?  Nowhere.  But I do make this last protest, that the Bill is wrong in principle and that the Bill in practice will work out very differently to what Deputies expect.  If they expect that this Bill is going to bring prosperity and wealth to this country, I suggest to Deputies that they are making a grave mistake.  It is a bone of contention which so far from pacifying is going to create more trouble in the country.  But it is going to pass.  I cannot prevent its passing, but I do say that it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hewat has spoken very earnestly and has approached nearer to passion in regard to this Bill than ever I have noticed before.  He fears that it is a long step downwards.  Perhaps Deputy Hewat remembers when he speaks about our supporting this Bill that, as a matter of fact, we were in the same Lobby with him when we voted against the Second Reading.  But the Dáil having decided that this Bill is deserving of support and ought to be passed in principle, we have endeavoured to the best of our ability to amend it.  Sometimes we have found ourselves supported by Deputy Hewat.  We endeavoured to amend it; he endeavoured to destroy it.  Several times, when opportunity occurred on the Committee Stage, he delivered Second Reading speeches denouncing the principle of the Bill, and he has managed on the Final Stage to do the same thing.  He is to be commended for that, because he is reiterating his very deep convictions.  But Deputy Hewat ought to have supported the Bill which was introduced some months ago. Then there would have been no need to have felt so sorely about this Bill. We have tried to amend the Bill, and <Col N="2123" /> in some few directions it emerges from the Dáil better than it came in.</P>
      <P>I do not want the Dáil, or Deputy Hewat particularly, to think that I look upon this Bill as something which is very valuable.  I do not.  While I agree that it is probably paying the way for a nationalised system, and do not think any alternative to a nationalised system is likely to be of real value to the country, I have objected to this Bill because of the fact that while I foresee nationalisation, this Bill is prejudicing such a nationalised system. It is weighting the nationalised system with a burden which will make nationalisation uneconomic, and will give an opportunity in future years to Deputy Hewat to say: &ldquo;Didn't we tell you so; nationalisation is uneconomic; you cannot run the railways successfully without subsidies; you cannot run railways under a nationalised system and be successful.&rdquo;  This Bill is preparing the way for Deputy Hewat in five, ten, or fifteen years' time to say that about a nationalised system. It is weighting the future nationalised system with a burden which no nationalised system will be able to bear and give proper service at reasonable rates.  It is securing the present owners of railways in a position which they will be able to use when bargains come to be made for nationalisation. That is why I object to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure whether we ought not to take a little more account of the developments of traction and transportation and not look forward to nationalisation so eagerly after we have adopted this Bill, because of the burden it is going to place on a nationalised system. Deputy Hewat has said that from no part of the country and no quarter of the Dáil has there been any keen demand for this Bill.  I wonder does he think that there is no need for any change in the railway system.  Of course&mdash;I gave him credit for it several times&mdash;he is consistent, inasmuch as he opposes everything that would prevent any group of persons running a railway from here to anywhere.  He would not have any State regulations in regard to railways.  He would have free private enterprise in regard <Col N="2124" /> to railways and other things.  Unfortunately for his contention we are living in a country which is circumscribed in area and in economic possibilities and we must realise the necessity for regulating the railroads so that the private enterprise Deputy Hewat would like cannot eventuate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been no demand for changes in the railway system?  Has the commercial, industrial, and agricultural public been satisfied with the railway system and railway services under private enterprise? Evidence produced at quite a number of railway commissions proves quite the contrary, and that the commercial, industrial, and agricultural communities have been insistent and persistent in their complaints about the railway services under private enterprise and competitive conditions, so dear to the heart of Deputy Hewat.</P>
      <P>The railway system had then, in response to public needs, to be changed. In what direction was the change to take place?  We suggested, as a very generous suggestion, but one that was practicable and, as I think, too generous to the railway companies, a nationalised system, which would not only nationalise the railways, but bring under one co-ordinating authority all transportation and communications.</P>
      <P>I maintain that the railway system in this country can only be economic, and really give the maximum value to the community, by co-ordinating and using to the best advantage, the various systems of transportation. This Bill fails to do that.  This Bill bolsters up the existing railway shareholders, and gives them an extraordinary advantage, which they did not in equity deserve.  While paving the way for nationalisation it is, in advance, making nationalisation likely to be a financial failure.  However, there may be no other course to adopt at this stage.  I want just to say that I, at least, am not welcoming this Bill as something of great value.  I believe it will be, both in service, in economy of working, and in many other ways an advance on the present system.  That, at least, ought to be satisfactory to the trading and to the farming communities.</P>

I think he has taken up this new undertaking, very shortly after his acceptance of responsibility, in a manner which is very creditable to him.

      <P>I would like to support what Deputy Johnson has said with regard to the courtesy we have received from the Minister in the conduct of this measure.  That has been referred to already, more than once, during the discussions that have taken place on the Bill.  I think everything that has been said in connection with the conduct of the measure, and with regard to the courtesy shown by the Minister, will be supported generally in the Dáil.  On these Benches we have offered a good deal of criticism, but we have tried to put it forward in a way that would be least hurtful.  The same spirit, I think, has actuated the Minister in replying.  Deputy Johnson has referred to what he considers the great objection to the Bill right through. That is, that it is too generous to the railway shareholders.  I am afraid that view is not shared, to any large extent, by the railway shareholders, because, if I can follow what has happened on the Stock Exchange with regard to railway shares, since this Bill was introduced, I have not seen any considerable rise in the value of these securities.  In fact, my attention has been drawn in several quarters to the fall that has taken place in a number of these securities.  Deputy Johnson's view, I am afraid, is not shared outside the Dáil, if, to any extent, inside the Dáil.  Though one does not like to anticipate what might happen under certain circumstances, I could not help feeling&mdash;as we were loading the amalgamated company with blisters <Col N="2126" /> of one kind or another, which amount to a considerable sum in the aggregate per annum&mdash;what would happen if the Tribunal failed to maintain the standard income.  That is a possibility&mdash;I will not say probability&mdash;that has occurred to the minds of some of these stockholders in connection with the railways.  I am sorry it was not present a little more frequently to the Government and to those who had charge of the Bill, when they accepted, as they did accept to-day, a rather unusual liability in connection with pensions for shop hands.  I wonder is the Government aware of the amount that this burden may involve on those who have to carry on the railways in the future?  We talked of the liability in connection with baronial guarantees. That is all cast on them.  I would like to know what will happen to those who hold these baronial stocks in the event of the railways which are under the charge of the Tribunal not reaching the standard income?  What will happen to these baronial securities transferred to the company?  If the company cannot function, what is to happen to these liabilities?  These are matters we would like to hear something about from the Minister.  It is all very well to say that such a thing is impossible. or that we could not see circumstances being brought about whereby such questions would arise.  As one sees this Bill laden, from day to day, with additional burdens, one becomes more or less alarmed, and the probability of the unforeseen occurring is certainly more probable at the end of this discussion on the Bill than it was in the early stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, commercial men, have objected to this Bill from two points of view. First of all because it creates a monopoly. In commercial circles we do not look upon monopolies at all favourably. We also object to the Bill for another, and equally strong, reason&mdash; that it would not reduce rates to the figure which is necessary.  It has been pointed out during the discussions here. on many occasions, that seventy-five per cent. of the products carried by the railways in the Free State are agricultural products.  It was also pointed out recently, by one in authority, that <Col N="2127" /> ninety-five per cent. of the exports of the Free State were agricultural products. That being so, ninety-five per cent. of our exports are carried by the railways, and there ought to be no people more interested in the Railways Bill than the agriculturists.</P>
    <P>We have been discussing this matter now at considerable length, and no section in this Dáil has taken a smaller interest in this Bill than the agriculturists. One of the surprises to me and one of the surprises outside the Dáil is that this Bill could have had support from the agricultural section. What is the position?  At the moment agricultural produce is carried on the railways in England at fifty per cent. over the rates prevailing in pre-war days.  That is to say, fifty per cent. over pre-war levels.  In Northern Ireland agricultural produce is carried at 75 per cent. over pre-war levels.  In the Free State to-day the rates for agricultural produce are anything between 120 and 150 per cent. over pre-war level&mdash;three times the rate that their competitors have to pay on agricultural produce in England.  That is the position in the Free State.  We hold that this Bill will establish those rates, and that is, as I said, one of the reasons why we object to it so strongly. If there is one thing more essential than another for the success of this country, it is cheap transit for agricultural produce. Agricultural produce is to-day paying three times as much as those against whom it has to compete are paying in Great Britain in the way of railway rates.  Yet, as I said, those who are the most deeply interested in that commodity, agricultural produce, support this Bill.  We have not, throughout the whole discussion on this Bill. been given a single reason for that support. We have been told by the Government that the reason for urging this Bill at the moment is that they were anxious to effect economies.  We have had no statement whatever nor any White Paper of any kind issued, showing in money value what economies may or will accrue from this measure.</P>
    <P>We have been told that by concentration in certain directions, by purchasing, <Col N="2128" /> by way of repairs and by way of manufacture, that economies will ensue.  I have some doubt about it. Certainly we, in this generation, will not reap much from these economies, because all such economics, will have been brought about by dispensing, to a considerable extent, with those in authority. It means that those who are dispensed with will have to be paid pensions on a fairly generous scale up to two-thirds of their existing incomes.  So that we cannot, as far as I can see, and I have taken a fair view of the Bill, hope to expect very much in the way of economy for a number of years. That is one side of it.  On the other side you are weighting this amalgamated company with the burdens accruing from these baronial and other uneconomic propositions.  Of those we have a figure.  That figure has been given to us and has been pointed out, of course, as an estimate.  It can only be an estimate.  That figure has been given to us over the signature of three of the four amalgamated companies, and that figure shows that the amalgamated company will be burdened with £90,000 per annum through the baronial affairs.  Now, where are the economies on the other side to be put against that?  We have been told there are economies.  But where are the economies to be put against the £90,000?  Where are all the economies that have to be put against the £90,000? So that if we must cut down rates, as it is essential in the national interest that we should cut them down, we can only do so by reducing expenses.  How is this amalgamated company to reduce expenses?  I hope the Minister will give us some further enlightenment on that question.  We certainly have not received much light in that direction up to the present.  I am satisfied, however, from what I know of the railways and from what I have seen of this Bill, that this Bill is going to place a heavy burden on the commerce of this country, and as that commerce is a competitive commerce, depending for success on maintaining its position against competition in England, I say that this is a burden that will injure that trade.  It will injure the agriculture of this country, and instead of doing any good, I am satisfied that as a result of that injury <Col N="2129" /> it will increase instead of reduce the number of unemployed in the Free State.</P>

      <P>We on the Farmers' benches received this Bill with very little acclamation, and we gave it, as Deputy Hewat says, what amounted to half-hearted support.  But we gave it our support, and now we are taunted by Deputy Hewat and Deputy Good for doing so.  The very reason that Deputy Good states as the reason why we should not give it our support is one of the reasons why we are supporting it.  That is, that we do know that the rates for agricultural produce in Great Britain are now only 50 per cent. above pre-war rates.  We know that the rates in Northern Ireland are only 75 per cent. above pre-war rates.  We know that the rates on agricultural produce in the Free State are from 100 per cent. to 250 per cent. above pre-war rates.  We know that that is the existing state of affairs, and we see no prospect in the management of the companies of any steps being taken which would have the effect of reducing the high rates on farm produce.  Things being as they were, we thought that any change would be a change for the good, and we feel in this Bill, that there is some possibility that the rates on agricultural produce, and the rates on produce in general, may be reduced. We are not at all hopeful that they will be reduced to any great extent, but we are going to give it a chance, and we feel that this Bill will give us a better chance of having our rates reduced than if things are continued as they have been in the past.  If we went to the railway directors and said: &ldquo;Rates on agricultural produce are killing agriculture, we cannot afford to pay those rates,&rdquo; the answer we got was: &ldquo;Look at our wages bill.  You see it is so much now; it was so much in pre-war days.  How can we reduce rates when wages are so much above pre-war?&rdquo;  Then we come to Deputy Johnson, and Deputy Johnson points out that the wages paid on the railways have practically no effect on the rates that they are charging on agricultural produce.  His figures seem to be very convincing, and he shows that a reduction of 20 per cent. in wages <Col N="2130" /> would only cause a reduction in the ordinary rates of a very small amount.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson says&mdash;I do not know if he actually said it, but the implication was&mdash;that if the higher railway rates are not caused by wages they must be caused by something else, such as bad management, lack of cohesion, and lack of co-operative working. Between both parties it is impossible definitely to find out where the fault lies.  We are sent from post to pillar, and meantime we are continuing to pay high rates.  Therefore we conclude that if there is to be a chance of improvement, the chance is by a change, and the only feasible change that we see, short of actual nationalisation, is a change in the direction of amalgamation. I took up an attitude of strong opposition to the nationalisation of railways when the Labour Bill dealing with the matter was introduced.  I must say that my attitude is not now so strong as it was then, because I have a feeling that the Bill which we adopt to-day will tend in the direction of nationalisation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good, I think, wants to know what is to happen if the railways fail to pay the standard rate, and if the revenues which they get fail to make up the standard revenue.  The answer to that is nationalisation.  If the railways do not meet the standard rate of dividend, and if they are not able to reduce the rates charged at present, I think there is no alternative except that of nationalisation.  I am not supporting nationalisation.  I do not believe in it.  Theoretically, I believe it is the correct thing, but as a practical proposition it cannot be a success.  I believe there are defects in human nature which make nationalisation not a very feasible proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hewat gave as the reason why we supported this Bill that we were pleased the cost of the baronial guarantees was to be made a national cost, and would eventually be placed on the amalgamated company.  That is a small reason to give for our support. We did not give support for that reason but we did support the change in the baronial charges for the reason that we believed it is the only <Col N="2131" /> feasible proposition in the scheme.  We are being taunted with not taking very much interest in the Bill.  Perhaps we did not take as much interest in it as we might have, but I must say our points of view were being guarded largely from the Government benches, and the discussions and the wranglings &mdash;if I may use the expression&mdash;which took place were largely between the Independent Benches, representing as they do the shareholders and capitalists, and the Labour Benches representing the workers.  We do not stand here representing either capitalists or workers; we represent a large number &mdash;by far the largest number&mdash;of railway users.  We give this Bill our support, half-hearted though it be, because we think there is a possibility that rates may be reduced, and it is essentially important for agriculture that railway rates be reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an old French proverb known as: &ldquo;<i>Qui s'excuse, s'accuse.</i>&rdquo;  I think that fits exactly the attitude of mind of the Farmers' Party, as expressed by the last speaker.  He says that he and his friends are giving this Bill their half-hearted support, and then he proceeds to excuse himself and his friends for that half-hearted support.  At any rate, we know what the attitude of the farmers is on this matter.  What I rise especially to endeavour to find out is what exactly is the attitude of the Labour Party towards the final stage of this Bill.  I listened most attentively to the speech made by Deputy Johnson, in which he stated that he and his party voted against the Second Reading of the Bill, and he also correctly stated that they proposed several amendments, some of which were carried, most of which probably were rejected, and those which have been carried have improved the Bill; but Deputy Johnson sat down without informing the Dáil what he and his party were going to do in relation to this stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now in company with others upon these benches, I spoke and voted against the Second Reading of the Bill, and proposed certain amendments in Committee.  Nothing that has transpired <Col N="2132" /> during the course of this Bill through the Dáil has led me to alter my own opinion upon the merits of the Bill.  I said previously, and I say once again, that this Bill creates a monopoly, and that it creates not private monopoly, nor a Government monopoly, but that it is a hybrid monopoly; that is my rooted objection to it. If there is to be a monopoly at all would say once more let it be a Government monopoly, and I repeat that personally I would prefer that this should be a straightforward measure of nationalisation than a half-hearted hybrid proposal, which I agree with Deputy Johnson, may jeopardise future nationalisation; it certainly will destroy private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hewat said quite rightly that there was no demand for this Bill, that there was no demand for the specific proposals contained in it.  He is quite right.  But there is a demand, and a very proper demand, for a reduction of rates, and that is the one thing throughout the whole of this discussion, which no speaker has been able to guarantee that this Bill will bring about.  Deputy Johnson himself stated on one occasion that he did not see how this Bill was going to bring about a reduction in rates, and I have yet to learn from any Minister how this measure is going to bring about that much-sought reduction.</P>
    <P>There has been a reduction in rates on a certain railway line.  There has been a reduction upon a railway which has its head office in, and which is registered in the Free State&mdash;I refer to the Great Northern Railway of Ireland. The Great Northern Railway have reduced their rates considerably within the past few months, and I contend if this Bill had never been introduced that the Midland Great Western Railway, which is in competition&mdash;in spite of what has been said about there being no such thing&mdash;with the Great Northern, in certain portions of the County Cavan, and elsewhere in the West, would, inevitably, have reduced their rates.  They would have reduced their rates of themselves if it had not been that this Bill was propounded, and that they were waiting the result of its passing through this House. <Col N="2133" /> Further.  I say if the Midland Great Western Railway rates, and other Free State railway rates are reduced after the passage of this Bill, it will not be because of the passage of the Bill, but it will be the inevitable consequence of the economic conditions entailed by the reduction of rates by the Great Northern Railway, and consequently a reduction in rates all round.  But what I object to most strongly is the proposal that we shall have now a system of railway control which shall be neither railway companies' business nor the Government's business, but which shall be the business of both, and, therefore&mdash;probably&mdash;unfortunately the business of neither.  Nobody has demanded the actual proposals in this Bill.  Everybody has demanded a reduction in rates.  A reduction of rates is not even promised by this Bill, and certainly it is not guaranteed, and the proposals which are made in this measure are such that a great many of them were never asked for, and a great many of them we could do without. There are a considerable number of inconsistencies throughout the Bill.  Some agreements have to be kept because they are statutory agreements; other agreements are not to be kept because they are not statutory.  We were told in one breath throughout the Committee Stage that there was a moral obligation in one direction, and we are told on Report Stage, as is instanced by what occurred here this afternoon, that where an agreement was in favour of a county council that agreement need not necessarily be kept.  Therefore, what I sincerely regret is that this Bill was introduced in the first place at the time it was introduced.  This Bill is now going to become law.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is no definite boundary fixed between the Free State and the North.  We all hope, perhaps, that there never may be such a boundary fixed, but this Bill is going to operate upon certain railways in certain parts of the Free State and it is not going to operate upon certain lines in other portions of the Free State, and what we do not know even at this stage is how, when such a boundary is fixed, the other railways within the remaining portions of the Free State which <Col N="2134" /> are not touched by this Bill are going to be brought in and fitted in and adapted according to the system which will then be in operation in regard to the amalgamated company.  Is there going to be one amalgamated company embracing that portion of the Northern Railway which will be within the Free State, or is there going to be a group system such as exists in England whereby competition can be, and actually is in operation in that country. We do not know.  We are passing this Bill in the dark.  We do not know where we will be when the time comes for considering the railway problem of the whole Free State.  I said this is piecemeal legislation.  I say it is legislation which is untimely, which as far as reduction in rates is concerned, is inoperative, and which has had not the slightest shadow of foundation of support either in this Dáil or in this country.  Therefore, so far as I am concerned, if there is a division called in regard to the Third Reading. I, for one, shall vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister will conclude.  I have been amazed at the last statement just uttered by Deputy Redmond, when he said that there is not a shadow of support in the Dáil for this Bill.  That could scarcely be borne out by the records, in which, I think, the people who have opposed this measure have met with a rather extraordinary reception here, if one were to consult the votes that have been taken in connection with it, and still more if one were to examine the case that has been made against the Bill. The Deputy states that there is neither a promise nor a guarantee for a reduction of rates according to this measure. Apparently the Deputy has not read the Bill, or apparently he was not here when we were discussing that portion of the Bill which concerns itself with an almost immediate revision of the rates fixed about 1920 or 1921.  The Minister explained at great length. and with great care and precision, that <Col N="2135" /> during a period of something like nine months an increase of rates was allowed to cover a period of sixteen months, but the Deputy has probably forgotten that.  This Bill has been treated to opposition principally on personal grounds.  The Deputy is dissatisfied because he did not get the particular amendments which he proposed and which dealt with his own constituency.  If we were to deal here only with the rights and privileges and the representations that are put up exclusively from our own constituencies, then this would be a poor assembly, and the great national interests and the real needs of the country would be subordinated to parish politics.  That would be a poor position to have this House put in and the results would be poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the President, but with regard to the statement which he has made about my amendments, I wish to say that I voted against the Second Reading of this Bill before any of my amendments were proposed.  It was not for that reason, therefore, that I opposed the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy for one to cover oneself with regard to these matters.  The issue in this case is, that we put up a Bill, a sound, constructive proposition, for dealing with the railways, and the opposition to it is petty and miserable, and a peccavi sort of opposition.  I have listened to one or two speeches which have really amazed me.  One would think from these speeches that there was going to be no business in this country in future, that there was going to be no progress and no prosperity.  That is in keeping with some of the prognostications that we have heard of late.  If there is one thing in this country that we are going to be treated to in the future, as far as one can see, it is prophecies, but the days of the prophet are gone.  We do not want prophets, but we want business.  We want business to be conducted in this country on a basis which will benefit the country. There is an alternative to this Bill.  I understand it is incorrect to say that there are two alternatives.  There can be only one alternative, but if it <Col N="2136" /> be wrong to say that there are two alternatives, then I suggest it is possible that there may be three other methods That is to say, unification, which we are going for; (2) grouping, and (3) nationalisation.  These are the three propositions.  As regards grouping, I think that has been disposed of.  The proposal, as far as could be learned was to have the Midland and the Dublin and South-Eastern in one group, and to leave the Great Southern, with all the minor companies, or what are called by some people, the lame ducks, bearing all the burdens which are distributed over the whole lot according to this measure.  Another proposition is that the Great Northern should be cut, and that the Dublin and South-Eastern should be joined up with the mutilated portion of it, constituting a group by itself, and that possibly the Midland and Great Southern should be joined in another group.</P>
      <P>Then if such a method of dealing with these matters were to be resolved, we are promised competition.  What is competition?  Competition, as I understand it, means that two well organised institutions will vie with one another for certain traffic.  When we examine the history of competition with regard to railway companies what do we find? We find that where competition strikes at the vital interests of railway companies, where it possibly militates against the revenue earning capacity of either of the two concerns or of three or four concerns, if there be such, that a review of the whole circumstances of the case is immediately undertaken by the directors, and the war is declared at an end.  They seek other means of making up their revenues and so on.  The case that we are presented with is this, that instead of having a complete and final settlement of the railway question in the circumstances that we have at present before us, we are asked to adopt a half-way measure which would be unsatisfactory and give reasons for all the infirmities which Deputy Redmond has exposed here at such length&mdash;bad business, bad management, high railway rates, etc., and at the end of that time discount any improvements that might have been effected in the transit of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> We have been studying this question for two years.  Other Deputies may possibly have had much less time to concentrate their energies upon it.  We came to the conclusion, after very careful consideration, that we must eliminate every possible extravagance, and cut out every possible item of expenditure that could be cut out, in order to make the transit problem in this country free from every obligation that it could possibly be freed from, and leave it free as the servant of the State, doing a useful work for the State at the smallest possible price.  It is said that there are no opportunities for economies.  Where are they?  I think a perusal of the White Paper issued will show at once one particular economy that any business man would discover at a moment's examination. According to that Paper, you have an immense number of directorates, each concerning itself only with its own district, buying for itself and doing its business in its own way and indifferent to any other transit companies in its immediate neighbourhood.  Under the Bill all this will be under the one management.  Are we so short of business representatives on directorates that we are going to have twelve duds running this company?  Are we so short of business acumen that that tribunal will be a farce, and that business men on it will not be able to see whether it is possible to eliminate extravagance. to make economies and to secure better efficiency than we have had up to this? Even if there were grouping, you would still require a tribunal, and no better system for examining the railway business of the country has been suggested here or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the bogey of partition. Within the last two years I have been told that the key to the solution of this partition question is in the railways. I have not seen the key.  No one has produced it, and it has not come out.  It is held up as a bogey to frighten people and to arouse political antagonism against this measure.  If there be a solution of the railway problem let us have it.  If anyone holds that key he ought not to keep it, but ought to produce it for the solution of a great political problem.  At one <Col N="2138" /> period during the discussion on this Bill we were told that certain Ports were to be placed at a disadvantage, and that we could not protect them. The danger was held up, and to some extent bandied about on public platforms and boards that the great Port of Dublin was in danger.  When these people were asked: What securities do you want in order to secure that these ports will be safe guarded, very few propositions were put up other than those that we have inserted in the measure ourselves.  It is stated that one company, not in this country, a non-national company, and I mention the term now not with any degree of disrespect, is not getting its statutory rights.  We are prepared to give them their statutory rights, but we will give them no more than their statutory rights.  We shall do that with regard to that company, and we shall also give the same guarantee to the other non-national company, which I mention in exactly the same spirit as the one I have already referred to, the London, Midland, and Scottish in the first case, and the Great Western in the second case.  If the Great Western have got rights we have guaranteed these rights.  If the London Midland and Scottish have any rights which are not guaranteed in this measure, which they are guaranteed by statute, we are prepared to guarantee these rights, but no more in either case.  We have kept our bargain with regard to these non-national companies, and we intend to do so, but we are not going to allow any company, either national or non-national, to dictate to this country in what way it is going to regulate the transit of the country.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that one reason why the Deputies representing the agricultural community here voted for this measure was because of the relief guaranteed in the measure to the baronially guaranteed companies.  It has been put up to us on more than one occasion that the relief which is given in this case is going to interfere with the commerce of the country.  We have dealt with that.  If I have to say anything more about it it is this, that in putting on the baronies which are responsible for these guarantees a limit. <Col N="2139" /> we must also take into account, that they, like the rest of the country, may progress during the next ten years, and that during those ten years the lines which are at present uneconomic may become economic.  We have got to balance this possibility with the other possibility, that they may not be economic in that time.  But at any rate the amount placed on them here is a fair burden: it is fair to the new unified company and it is fair to the barony, and any other proposition would entail an expenditure which would not be justified by the results.</P>
    <P>A great responsibility rests upon this assembly for sending out messages to the country.  I deprecate very strongly indeed those messages which strike at the confidence that the people of the country ought to have in this, its first and most representative institution. Tales of woe and tales of bad times to come and bad business, and all that sort of thing, are not going to benefit the country; and they are not in accordance with what is in existence at the present moment.  The country is bound to progress, bound to progress if there is good honest work given to it by every section of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy Wilson's leave, and to gain his commendation I will be as brief as possible. There are about four points which have to be dealt with.  Deputy Davin has raised the question of the canals.  He wishes to know if the tolls and rates on the canals will be taken into consideration with a view to reduction at the time when the rates on the railway will be taken into consideration.  That is a question entirely different from the reduction of railway rates.  No case for the reduction of canal tolls is prejudiced by anything in this Bill.  The by-traders had always certain rights with regard to the reduction of rates on the canals, and these rights still remain to them.  If they raise the matter and make their case, the reductions will follow.</P>
      <P>One point has been stressed by Deputy Hewat with regard to the tribunal, on which I should like to make one remark.  He says the tribunal is to be appointed by the Government, and I think his words were that the whole doings, the whole atmosphere, around the tribunal will be permeated by politics.  That remark to me is significant.  It reveals to me a type of mind which I thought had disappeared from this country recently &mdash;the type of mind which wishes to accept, on the surface, the theory, for instance, that judges were above politics, and at the same time insisted, that judges were appointed only for political reasons.  There is no intention, and there is no way under this Bill, of removing the members of the railway tribunal, except as laid down in section 13.  During the period of their office they can only be removed by a vote of this Dáil and the Seanad for misbehaviour or incapacity stated.  We have set out to place, and I think we have succeeded in placing, the tribunal as far as possible from politics, and I do not consider it quite fair comment to have the tribunal described as being in a position in which it is going to be influenced&mdash;necessarily influenced&mdash;by whatever be the politics of the party supporting the Government or placing the Government in position at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2141" /> The question as to why the agricultural representatives here, who are mostly concerned with the Bill, did not take an interest in it, has to some extent been explained by Deputy Heffernan.  Deputy Baxter spoke one evening in this Dáil and stated very definitely that he and his party were refraining from very much discussion on the Bill, because they considered that the Bill met their needs in so far as they saw their needs could be met. And what Deputy Heffernan added to-day is simply supplemental of that statement.</P>
    <P>The question of the baronially guaranteed lines was raised, as one would expect that it would be raised, by Deputy Good; and he again quoted the £90,000 figure from the White Paper, a figure which the company that issued that statement do not now accept at all.  The stressing of the position of these baronially guaranteed lines reveals to me rather the mind of the investor than the mind of the person interested in the proper organisation of the transport undertakings of this country.  It is undoubtedly hard that the larger lines should have to bear what is called the burden of the baronially guaranteed lines, and from the point of view of the investor, it is deplorable. But take it from the other point of view, the small lines serve a useful purpose.  They have to be continued; they have to be taken account of in any scheme which sets about organising transport by railroad in the country; and it is no explanation to point out that the baronially guaranteed lines could have been left to their own fate.  It is well known what that fate would have been if this Bill had not come along.  Most of these lines would have gone out of operation.</P>
    <P>An important question has been raised with regard to the condition of the stockholders in these baronially-guaranteed concerns.  A certain amount of correspondence has taken place in the daily Press, and the position has not been quite clearly or fairly stated.  It has been represented by correspondents that the divdends which they make out were guaranteed in perpetuity are going to cease after the ten years' period.  That, of course, is not <Col N="2142" /> the case.  If I am asked now what is going to be the position of these stockholders under the amalgamation, I cannot define it.  All I can do is to point to the steps that have to take place under the Bill to give them a certain position.  The exact position of the guarantee that these stockholders have to-day must be taken into account. They are guaranteed by certain areas. Those areas have had to strike a railway rate which it is impossible to pay, and but for this Bill, steps undoubtedly would have to be taken to get that liability reduced, if not altogether done away with.  Now, the Bill does not in itself reduce, nor does it do away with the liability for dividends.  The Bill sets out that an exchange of securities may take place by agreement, that the parties interested can press their case, and press the point as to the perpetuity of the guarantee previously given to them, and can get the best possible terms by the arguments that they put up.  And, if an agreement be not reached, the railway tribunal has to decide, after hearing all parties.  It is not correct, therefore, to say that the guarantee lapses after ten years, as one of the effects of this Bill.  The fact is that there is a possibility of agreement, and if agreement be not reached, the tribunal&mdash;a judicial tribunal&mdash;decides, after hearing all the facts and arguments.</P>
    <P>The question of the statutory agreement referred to by Deputy Redmond has been dealt with by the President, and I need not go into it.  One other point is urged by Deputy Redmond. He said that to-day I had revealed myself as opposed to breaking a statutory agreement, because it told against a railway undertaking and told in favour of the County of Mayo.  Now, that again is not a full statement of the case.  What I have done is this: I have said that if the County of Mayo receives a remission of the loss over two of the railways in that county, it is only fair that the small surplus which accrued in a very peculiar way should be set off, and that they should not receive that surplus while having their liabilities reduced.  The Mayo County Council asked that the liabilities for loss should be reduced, and that they should have the profit on one line. <Col N="2143" /> What I say is that one is an equitable set-off against the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a motion, No. 13, which reads as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Dáil is of opinion that the incidence of local rating on agricultural land is unjust and needs immediate revision.&rdquo; I put that motion down at this particular juncture because at this time we are considering and overhauling the machinery of Local Government. It seems to me when a process of that nature is proceeding, we should also enquire into this very vital matter, which is of more importance to the agricultural community than is the working of the machinery of Local Government.  In order that I might make the matter clear, I wish to explain that the unit of administration is the county in most cases, that the supreme local authority is the county council, that yearly it receives estimates from subsidiary bodies such as the district councils, the boards of guardians, or boards of health, and the whole sum is then found by the county council by striking a rate on the valuation of the county.  The rate is struck under two heads.  One is what is called agricultural land, and the other is what is known as other hereditaments, such as farm buildings, railway buildings and towns not inside urban areas.  In <Col N="2144" /> 1898 the British Government considered this question in regard to Ireland&mdash;it was considered in respect to England in 1896&mdash;and after sifting the reasons very carefully, it was agreed by the British Government that in respect of rating the central authority should bear the burden of half the ratings which, in the ordinary run, would be placed on agricultural land.  That means that 50 per cent. of the rates on agricultural land should be remitted and payments should come from the Central Fund to the Local Taxation Account, and therefrom to the local authorities.  In order to find the amount which would be given in Ireland they fixed a standard year.  I am sorry that Deputy Redmond is not here because I wanted to point out to him that he and those with him who represented the country at that time were very remiss in not seeing that they gave us the same terms as were given in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There were others before him.  The Act of 1898 took the amount of rates which were paid in Ireland for a standard year, that is the twelve months preceding the 30th September, for Poor Rate, and the twelve months preceding the 30th June for the County Cess.  These two amounts were added together, and then it was decreed by law that in future half of that amount should be paid annually from the Central Fund in relief of what is known as agricultural land.  That is known now as the Agricultural Grant.  It was really a sop to the landlords at the time, because there was practically no purchased land at that time, and half the rates were paid by the landlords and half by the tenants. I want to give a concrete reason for the act of the Government at the time. You can visualise a holding of agricultural land valued at £20, and you know that an agricultural holding valued area, £20 is scarcely an economic proposition. Another property in the same area, which might consist of a publichouse, a grocery shop, or a drapery store, might be rated at the same amount, and the contribution which such property would pay to local utilities would be <Col N="2145" /> practically the same as that paid by a poor farmer on this uneconomic holding. We contend that we should have got the benefit of the Act passed by the English House of Commons in favour of the English tenants, namely, that half the rating attributable to agricultural land in any year should be remitted from the Central Fund.  The position here is that half the rating of the standard year is remitted, and by reason of democratic institutions in this country our rates have gone up so high that the preference we obtained by reason of this preferential relief for the standard year is of no value.  We ask the Government to give us what was the intention of the people who passed the Act of 1898, and to give us in relief what it was intended we should have got, and not take from us what is due to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. HEFFERNAN Mr. HEFFERNAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion.  I would like to say that this is now probably a matter of the most vital importance to the agricultural industry, and I think that the representations that are being made to the Government here to-day in regard to rates should receive their most careful consideration.  I believe that in the course of time the incidence of local rates and the reason for this incidence have been lost sight of, and that these have been taken as a matter of course by those who pay, no matter what amounts they are assessed.  It should be remembered that farmers and others who pay local rates, also pay ordinary taxes, such as income tax and other direct and indirect taxes. My contention is that this local rate is an additional tax on one particular section of the community, namely, the farming community.  It grew by gradual and slow degrees.  In all probability, when the local rates started it was a matter of very minor importance. I do not intend to go into the history of the Poor Law, but if you go back about 100 years you will find that the amount collected locally for the purposes of Poor Law was very small, in spite of the fact that the amount of relief given was considerably greater than that given now. Then came the cost of the roads.  The <Col N="2146" /> history of that is, that at one time the landowners who were at that time the only men of property in the country, were called upon to do a certain amount of work on the roads, and they had either to go themselves or send their workers or horses.  Gradually that work was commuted, and those landowners were called on to pay rates. This rate was at one time a minor thing, but now it has become very important, and is an enormous demand on the resources of those who live on the land.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in introducing the Bill for the relief of rates, stated: &ldquo;This grant, as Deputies know, is an annual grant paid by the Treasury to county councils for the purpose of giving relief to rates payable out of agricultural land.&rdquo; It does not say there, but I think the implication is that the agricultural grant is a direct grant in relief of the rates payable by farmers.  Deputy Wilson has shown that that is not so.  The agricultural grant of 1898 was a direct grant in aid of the landlords, and the landlords after 1898 had their incomes increased by the actual amount of the grant.  I think that is not understood. I think it was thought that the agricultural grant was a direct grant in aid of the farmers.  It was not.  Apparently that grant was given to the landlords because under the 1898 Act they lost a great deal of their local power. They lost control over the county councils.  I think it will be found if the records of the British House of Commons are gone over, that Mr. Arthur Balfour did not deny that such was the case.  In fact, I think he stated that such was the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the local rates.  I live in a county that has not been at all one of the highest local rated counties, a county that has been from the point of view of local administration, perhaps one of the best managed in Ireland.  I would like to say in spite of that, we are of opinion that the rates we are asked to pay, and in particular what the farming community are asked to pay, are intolerable.  I will give you an instance of the rates that had to be paid in one of the lowest-rated unions in the county.  The rate for 1914 was <Col N="2147" /> 1/10 in the £; 1917, 2/2; 1919, 3/9; 1920, 4/4; 1923, 5/10, and 1924, 5/-.</P>
    <P>That has been a steadily increasing rate.  It has steadily increased from 1/10d. in 1914 to 5/- in 1924.  I would like to call your attention to the fact that, that although it was 3/9d. in 1919, the year at which everything was at the highest price, the rate has still continued to increase and now it is 5/-, and there is no apparent possibility of anything like a reasonable reduction. The state of affairs is this: You may have a man farming, say, twenty acres; if it is fairly good land you may take the valuation as £1 an acre.  That farmer has to pay say, a 10/- rate, which is not an uncommon rate in various parts of Ireland.  That means that he has to pay £10 a year in rates, allowing for the benefit of the agricultural grant, and he has to pay the ordinary rate on the value of his house.  Roughly he has to pay £10 a year.  You will find in a town a trader or an occupier of a shop valued at £20 has to pay £10 a year also.  It is quite possible that the occupier of the shop valued at £20 may be making an income of £1,000 a year and the occupier of the 20 acre farm would be making not more than £40; still you ask the man with the 20 acres of land to pay the same rate as the man who is probably making an income of £1,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to that there were other grants, grants in aid of local institutions, which have not been kept up in the correct proportion.  There is a grant of 4/- for each inmate of an asylum.  That grant was made at a time when the average cost of the upkeep of an inmate was £20 a year. Now, I believe, the average cost is something like £60 a year.  Still the grant paid by the Government in aid of the asylum inmate is 4/- a week.  If that capitation grant was kept up in proportion to the cost of the upkeep of inmates in the asylum, it now should be about 11/6d. a week instead of 4/-. I have a letter from a constituent of mine; this is a quotation from it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Local rates amount to a second income tax on farmers.  It is really a tax on the letting value of the land.  I paid last year £45 6s. 7d. in <Col N="2148" /> rates.  My assessed income under Schedule A and Schedule B would be £152.  I, therefore, paid one-third of my income in local rates.  Any Clare or Dublin farmer may pay more than half his income in rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The local rates bear no relation to a man's ability to pay.  A man may be making no profit whatever on his farm; still he is called upon to pay this local rate.  That is very inequitable and very unfair, and I think it is time that a change should be made.  I think it should be recognised that the greater portion of the burden of the upkeep of local institutions should not be placed on the shoulders of the agriculturists, and that some relief should be given.  We acknowledge that the Minister is giving relief under this Bill, but it is only temporary relief&mdash; a relief that will eventually have to be paid out of the pockets of the ratepayers. What is wanted is some form of permanent relief.  The tendency has been too common in recent times to throw the expense of any local work which is being done, or any new works which are being carried out, on the local rates.  It is a convenient and a handy way of meeting the expenses. We think a stop should be put to that, and some effort should be made to make the incidence of local rates fairer than it is, so that a man will pay local rates just as he has to pay ordinary taxation, in accordance with his ability to bear them.  That being the case, the Minister will stand up probably and say: &ldquo;What suggestions have you to make?&rdquo;  That is a favourite form of query on his part. To start with, we say it is not our duty always to make suggestions.  We criticise; we show that things are wrong, and it is his duty, as Minister for Agriculture, and the duty of the Government, to come forward with constructive suggestions; that is what the Government is for.  But there are some suggestions which I will make, constructive or otherwise, Government or no Government.  One is the demand which we have been making for a long time, that the expenses of the upkeep of trunk and main roads should be borne by the national Exchequer. It is not necessary for me to <Col N="2149" /> emphasise that; it has been stated over and over again.  You have the small farmer, or the large farmer, preferably the small farmer; he will be tilling his fields by the side of the road, and he has to bear the dust and grime and smoke of the big motor cars and the lorries working for the trader or the people living in the town.  He has to pay for the roads over which the motor cars and the lorries pass.  The unfortunate little farmer with his horse and car, or his donkey and car, which do not injure roads at all&mdash;in fact, they improve the conditions of the roads&mdash; has to pay.  It is an actual fact, that the iron-shod cars, despite what has been said to the contrary, instead of injuring the roads, very often improve the surface of them; yet the owners have to pay for keeping up the roads. Is that fair or equitable?  It is time a change was made; it is time the national Exchequer took over the maintenance of the trunk roads.  A second suggestion that we make is, that the asylum services should be borne by the national Exchequer, and a third suggestion is that local boards might be rationed.  They might be told that so much is the limit of the paying capacity of the ratepayers in this district. You may make the rate 3s. in the £, but that must be a definite limit, and beyond it you cannot go.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for AGRICULTURE: (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to ask the question which Deputy Heffernan put into my mouth.  What are his suggestions. He made two.  I do not think he meant them seriously.  In fact he started by saying that he made them in order to anticipate any possible questions that I might ask.  He felt it his duty to make them in view of that appalling possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Grant was fixed in 1898 both for England and Ireland.  It was fixed at a definite sum.  It is a definite sum here, and it is a definite sum in England, unless it has been changed by the English Parliament during the past year.  I know the English Parliament have given relief to the agricultural rates in England, but I am not quite sure if that relief has been given by way of an addition to the Agricultural <Col N="2150" /> Grant.  From 1898 up to a few years ago it was a fixed sum.  It was fixed in 1898 in England, and it was half the standard rate for that year. It was fixed in Ireland at the same time at half the standard rate at that time, which was £599,000.  That sum was given in relief of rates paid out of agricultural land.  Whether they were paid by the landlord or the farmer does not matter twopence for the purpose of our discussion now.  The fact is that the farmer is now liable for the rates. He gets £599,000, and he thereby gets the benefit of the Agricultural Grant. The point Deputy Heffernan made, that this benefit was not passed on by the landlord to the farmer, is not valid, in view of the fact that fair rent courts have been operating and that practically, though not altogether, three-fourths of the farmers have purchased their lands and have had the requisite reductions fixed, not by reference to what rates they were paying or anything like that, but in accordance with the value of their holdings.  The position at the present date is that £599,000 is being paid in relief of agricultural rates and hence in relief of the farmer, to make up to the farmer for services such as water, light, heat, sanitation, etc., which are not supplied to him by local bodies and which are supplied to the people of the towns.  That is the position.  It does not matter what was said in the English Parliament when this Bill was being introduced; it does not matter what Lord Balfour or anybody else said; that was the real reason.  It may have been pointed out that landlords at that time were entitled to some relief, but the obvious reason to everybody was that agriculturists should not be asked to pay for services they were not getting.  I agree with Deputy Wilson and Deputy Heffernan, apart altogether from the position of the farmers&mdash;whether they are at the moment making fortunes or not making any profits at all&mdash;that they should not be asked, as a business proposition, to pay for services they are not getting.  The point is, whether this £599,000 they are getting now in relief of local rates is a sufficient set-off for the fact that they are not getting the benefit of services like water, light, heat, sanitation, etc., which dwellers in <Col N="2151" /> urban districts and in county boroughs are getting.  My answer to this question as to whether this £599,000 is sufficient and does actually make up for the cost of these services, is that I do not know.  I go further and say that Deputy Wilson and Deputy Heffernan do not know either, and I doubt if any Deputy in the House knows.</P>
    <P>It is an extremely intricate question and it does demand and require, I agree, immediate examination.  To say whether at the present moment, having regard to the increase of rates, having regard to all that has occurred since 1898, £600,000&mdash;it is not worth while fighting about the odd thousand &mdash;is sufficient to make up to the farmer for those services he is not receiving, to say whether that is the exact sum or that it should be, as Deputy Heffernan I think suggests, half the actual rate, would be difficult.  It would require extremely close examination of the intricacies and details of local administration. I agree with Deputy Heffernan that the examination should be made and made as soon as possible.  It is a matter really for the Ministry of Local Government and the Ministry of Agriculture.  The Minister for Local Government suggested to me some time ago that an examination should be made.  I agreed and I think the most effective way to make that examination would be by the departments concerned&mdash;that is, if we want to do business and if we want to get results, instead of having full dress debates in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I leave that point.  I would suggest ito Deputy Wilson and Deputy Heffernan and the other Deputies, that they would be on firmer ground if, pending such an inquiry, they concentrated their attention on the question as to whether they could not bring down all rates.  They could consider the question, for instance, whether three million pounds in the rural districts is not too high a rate on the farmer or house-owner or shop-owner or anybody else, whether in view of the fact that our revenue does not meet our expenditure, it would not be more like business if we could make the necessary changes in local administration by mere reorganisation, apart altogether from <Col N="2152" /> economies.  That is a side of the matter that has to be dealt with and is being dealt with&mdash;whether by mere reorganisation you could not do as effective work for two million five hundred thousand pounds as you are doing with three millions at present.  That is the real question.  It is a practical question, in all the circumstances, and it is a question that I agree should be tackled immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question. You will never get to business if you mix up one issue with another. There are three issues here.  Firstly there is the issue whether the incidence of local taxation is fair or unfair Secondly, there is the issue whether reorganisation of the local authorities would not give us the same services at 25 per cent. less.  Thirdly, there is the issue as to what economies you could make in salaries and other matters of local taxation without changing or reorganising local administration at all.  The second is the most fruitful source at the moment, while admitting that the first should be inquired into. Three or four Royal Commissions have sat in England to inquire into the matter. They went into it very fully but they have not arrived at any very definite conclusions.  It is quite obvious that it is an extremely difficult and intricate problem.  With regard to the reorganisation of local authorities, it does seem to me doubtful that the most efficient way of administering services like main roads and asylums&mdash;the two services which the Deputy mentions&mdash; is for twenty-six authorities to be charged with the work in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether nationalisation is the right solution, or whether you should have six, seven or any number less than twenty-six authorities dealing with this service, is a question I am not prepared to answer at the moment.  It is a matter for inquiry whether the most efficient way of dealing with what is a really national service is by getting twenty-six authorities to deal with it.  That is the question that has to be tackled.  Deputies are not on very strong grounds when they suggest, as <Col N="2153" /> this Motion suggests, to leave things as they are, spend a sum of over £3,000,000 on this service, and relieve the farmers to the tune of £1,200,000 instead of £600,000.  That means that you transfer that £600,000 on to taxation. I agree with Deputies Heffernan and Wilson that the farmer is in fact paying most of the taxation indirectly &mdash;paying the greater portion of it. That is the cold fact.  We must face the situation as we find it.  At a time like this, when taxation is extremely high, nobody with any sense of responsibility who looks at the whole situation, could suggest with any degree of confidence that taxation should be increased. I do not think the most practicable thing to do is to suggest that farmers should be relieved simply by giving a grant out of the Treasury of £600,000 or £700,000, or £800,000, and leaving the present system as it stands. I repeat again that the right way to deal with the matter is to concentrate immediately on the question of whether the services as they stand could not be run for far less than they are costing, while admitting that the question of the incidence of local taxation should be gone into in order to find out whether or not farmers are paying for what they are not getting, such as water, light, heat, and things of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the <Col N="2154" /> right and proper basis of rating should be on the value of the land, and not on the buildings.  Deputy Wilson will think that I am going contrary to his argument in this.  In effect I would probably arrive at the same conclusion. It would mean, of course, that those large areas of land which have not many buildings on them would be obliged to pay a higher proportion of rates than the more crowded and poorer land.  It would affect also, however, the rating in the towns.  Notwithstanding the argument used by competent people in dealing with this question, that all taxation is, in fact, upon income, and that this is the only way to levy a rate commensurate to a person's income, and that a town shopkeeper may have a shop by which he is able to earn an income very much higher than the farmer, though his valuation is only the same, the effect of the present incidence of local taxation is to keep the country towns in the slummy state they are.  There is no encouragement&mdash;there is a natural discouragement&mdash;to property holders in the towns to improve their holdings. A man having a shop in the country, earning plenty of money in a kind of rookery, who could well afford to turn it into a decent habitation, and improve the general aspect of the town, will not do it, because it would simply mean raising his annual charges without making any more money out of it. The incidence of local rating at present tends to prevent that development, and we ought to transfer the burden to the site rather than keep it upon the shop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>With the motion, because that is what he said.  I want to disabuse the Minister's mind, however, about the information he has.  The Bill which regulated the agricultural rating in England was passed in 1896, and provided that half of the expenditure of any year, as long as the Act was in operation, was to be taken off agricultural land.  The Act was to continue for five years.  It was again renewed <Col N="2155" /> for another five years, and the Commission on Agriculture, in its Report as to the present position, says: &ldquo;In England, where the system of local rating is essentially the same as in An Saorstát, this fact has been recognised by the Government, and approximately 75 per cent. of the rating on agricultural lands is borne by the general taxpayer.&rdquo; I do not ask for 75 per cent. I ask for half of the expenditure of the local bodies in any year to come off agricultural land.  That will give an opportunity to those in charge of the Central Fund to put the screw on.  It will give the authorities in Dublin an opportunity of refusing to sanction abnormal expenditure.  £599,000 was half the expenditure in 1897.  To-day, according to the Minister, the amount which agricultural land contributes is £2,315,000, plus the £599,000 allotted to it.  Therefore, the increase is in the neighbourhood of £2,000,000.  Had agriculturists here been legislated for in the same way as in England, we would have got half of that increase off our rates. That is the position.  The Minister may doubt it, but he will find if he reads the Act again that that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, we are at cross-purposes.  The Deputy is right in saying that relief was first given in England in 1896 and it was one-half of the amount which had been raised in respect of agricultural land in the year preceding the Act.  As to the Bill brought in in England last year for the relief of agricultural land, I will take the Deputy's word about the 75 per cent.  It does not matter whether that is by way of increasing the agricultural grant or not.  Up to two years ago, at any rate, the rate in England was the same as in Ireland, and it was an amount fixed at the time the Act was passed.</P>

      <P>I read the Act, and it said half the rates of any year.  I will have to examine it again.  I think I have made a case for this motion, and that there is no reason why we should be asked to carry a burden which has <Col N="2156" /> increased to the enormous extent I have indicated.  It is the result, perhaps, of democratic government.  We heard a lot about the grand jury system and how disastrous it was to be represented by those people.  But if we have to judge democratic institutions by the results achieved under local government, then I say we had better go back to the grand juries.</P>

      <P>And have no elections. Of course we admit that the remedy is better administration.  I did not direct attention very much to that particular aspect of the question, because there is a Bill before the Dáil which deals with the question of administration. I want to get this question of the incidence of taxation also brought under review, and if I have achieved that purpose, by bringing before the minds of Deputies the perilous position in which the agricultural industry is placed by reason of the incompetence of the local authorities, then I have done a good day's work.  I hope I have convinced the Dáil that this motion is justified and that it will be supported.</P>

      <P>I do not understand what the resolution means.  I understood it at first to mean that the whole country should be re-valued, and I want to put it to the Deputy that he cannot have a re-valuation of the entire country.  If it means that you are going to put a tax on the Central Fund of one and a half millions you will want to get another Central Fund besides the one you have.</P>

      <P>The resolution does not mean, as the President suggested, a re-valuation of land.  I think you would gain very little from a re-valuation of land alone.  It means a changing of the incidence of taxation. Deputies who have spoken in favour of the motion put the case of a valuation of £20 or £25 on land as compared with a big business in a town valued at from £20 to £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is, there are very big businesses in provincial towns with a valuation of £20 or £25.  We <Col N="2157" /> want the Government seriously to take into consideration the position now and what it was when the existing incidence of taxation was agreed to.  At that time the upkeep of county roads cost about 2/6 a perch.  At the present time the upkeep of the same road is costing more than £1 a perch.  The present incidence of taxation was fixed to meet a system of traffic that has disappeared. It is replaced by modern traffic.  I heard it stated in the Dáil the other evening that railways were obsolete institutions.  No wonder! Hitherto the business community had to have their merchandise carried by railways and had to pay the railways. Nowadays merchandise is carried over the roads of the country and the public have to pay for the upkeep of the roads.  The public are providing the roads where railway companies provided railways.  The business people would be very foolish indeed if they did not take advantage of the system that provides roads for them to use, and that other people pay for. They have free access to the roads and have only to pay for the petrol, and for the wear and tear of lorries.  It is up to the Government to meet that situation, and to realise that it is one the people of this country will not continue to tolerate.  The sooner the representatives of the rural areas and also the Government realise that a change is needed the better.</P>

      <P>Taking the motion as it stands, the Dáil would prejudice itself by passing it.  If there is a case for stating that the incidence of local taxation on land is unjust, surely a mere reiteration of the history of the last 30 or 40 years is not proof of that.  A mineral water manufacturer, a boot manufacturer, or any other manufacturer, might ask what is the reason for passing that motion? Was the Government right in 1898 in stipulating that it would give £600,000 in relief of rating on agricultural land? These are questions that are not resolved by the mere passing of a resolution in the absence of the particulars that are necessary.  I suggest that the Deputy should withdraw this motion and, if he likes, put down one suggesting that a Commission should enquire into Local Government, and that <Col N="2159" /> amongst the terms of reference should be one as to the incidence of rating. Having had that inquiry, and having got evidence, we have something to go on.  When you say that the incidence of agricultural rating is unjust, I suggest that mere statement is not proof of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on the First Reading, the object of the Bill which is under consideration is to simplify the forms of charges against accused persons in criminal cases tried before a jury.  Forms of indictment in <Col N="2161" /> the past might in many instances be described as a confused mass of technical words for which there were, no doubt, excellent reasons in the criminal jurisprudence of other times, but which are now rightly considered feudal and archaic.  It is thought that the charge in every every criminal case should be nothing more than a clear and explicit statement of the offence or offences which the accused person, is called upon to answer, together with such particulars as may be necessary for giving reasonable information as to its nature.  There are rules set out in the First Schedule to the Bill, designed, amongst other things, to secure simplicity in criminal pleadings, and the appendix which is given shows a large number of illustrations of the proposed working of rules in particular cases.  The outstanding thing in the illustrations is the absence of the use of any technical words.</P>
      <P>The Bill is arranged in twelve sections. Section I proposes that the rules contained in the First Schedule shall have effect as if indicated in the Act, and provides for additions and variations.  Section 2 provides that Rules made under the Act shall be made by the same authority as the authority which will make the Rules of Court mentioned in Section 36 of the Courts of Justice Act, and that Section 101 of that Act, which relates to the approval of Rules of Court by a Resolution of each House of the Oireachtas, shall apply to the new indictment rules.  Section 3 indicates the Rules which may be made under the Act, namely, Rules varying or annulling all or any of the Rules contained in the First Schedule, or additional Rules.  It provides that the Rules in the Schedule shall have effect subject to the modification or additions so made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 contains the central proposal in the measure.  &ldquo;Every indictment shall contain... the specific offence or offences with which the accused person is charged, together with such particulars as may be necessary for giving reasonable information as to the nature of the charge.&rdquo;  It shall no longer be possible to delay the jurisdiction of the court on a merely technical objection to the form of the indictment, <Col N="2162" /> if it is framed in accordance with the simple formulæ of the proposed rules.  This simpler method has the additional advantage of bringing home directly to the mind of the accused person the offence with which he stands charged, without legal assistance. Section 5 provides that the charges for more than one indictable offence may be made in the same indictment, and the right of the person accused to challenge jurors in cases of felony is preserved in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under Section 6 the court is enabled to amend defects in the indictment, where such a course can be followed without injustice.  Provision is made to ensure that no injustice or embarrassments will be done to the accused person by the fact that he is charged with more than one offence in the same indictment.  It is left to the discretion of the court to order separate trials for each offence if it is thought fit to do so, and in cases of amendment of the indictment, or orders for separate trials, the court is given power to order such postponement of the trial as may appear necessary.  The necessary supplemental provisions for such separate trials or postponement of trials is also included.  Indictments which are unduly prolix are discouraged by giving power to the court to order payment of costs of the prosecution incurred by reason of the indictment being of unnecessary length.  The provisions of the Vexatious Indictments Act of 1859 are preserved under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that in cases of indictable offences the charges shall be prosecuted in court at the suit of the Attorney-General, and it also provides that prosecutions in courts of summary jurisdiction shall be prosecuted at the suit of the Attorney-General, save where such may be done by a Minister or Department of State or by any person authorised in that behalf by the law for the time being in force.  This saving clause will enable Departments to prosecute in ordinary minor cases and it also preserves the right of the private citizen to prosecute where he is empowered by law to do so.  Section 10 prescribes the oath to be administered to jurors empanelled for the trial of any criminal charge or issue.  The <Col N="2163" /> oath is couched in simple language, and any juror taking the oath would have no difficulty in understanding its nature.  Section 11 is merely a saving clause to ensure that no implied changes in the law not intended will take place.  For example, it is provided that the place of trial shall not be altered by anything in the Bill, nor is the law of evidence to be altered in any way.  The first schedule contains rules which are partly concerned with the demands of administrative convenience; for example, the form of the paper on which the charge is written, and partly the model to be followed in describing offences.</P>
    <P>The indictment starts with &ldquo;The Attorney-General of Saorstát Eireann v. A.B.&rdquo;  The court of trial is named and the charge to be preferred to the jury is specified.  For example, A.B. is charged with the following offence&mdash; and then there will be a simple statement of the offence.  The statement of offence will be the generic title for the particulars of the offence.  The particulars of the offence will contain specific details of the actual facts and the circumstances constituting the offence.  The rules lay down models as to the description of any indictment. The appendix gives illustrations of a short statement of offence; particulars of offence, in 25 different types of cases.</P>
    <P>Cases which are not covered in the appendix will be described in a similar manner, and if this is done, the provision of section 4, which states that an indictment will be sufficient if it contains a statement of the specific offence and reasonable particulars as to the nature of the charge, make it clear that such forms of indictment will be given.</P>
    <P>In 1915, in England, an Act was passed which simplified the forms of indictment.  That Act was not extended to Ireland.  I think it is a matter that will be generally agreed that the reform in this country should not be any longer delayed, particularly having regard to the fact that a new system of courts is being established in the country under the Courts of Justice Act.  Many of the forms of indictment were cumbrous, archaic and <Col N="2164" /> feudal.  A habitual drunkard, for instance, was described under the former indictment as &ldquo;disturbing the King's peace and dignity,&rdquo; and there are many other forms of indictment calculated rather to confuse the prisoner than to convey any clear idea to his mind of the offence with which he is charged. I move the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'CONNELL Mr. O'CONNELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to give any considered criticism of this Bill because I think it is a matter more for lawyers than laymen.  But I would like to say I welcome the Bill as an effort to simplify the administration of justice in the country.  Anything the does that is, in my opinion, an improvement. I quite agree with the Minister that the forms which appear in the charges served to the accused persons were much more calculated to frighten them than the sentence which followed.  It is certainly an improvement to have these forms simplified so that the ordinary person who stands accused can understand clearly and definitely what the charge is that is against him.  I think now that we are starting out on a new system of courts, it is advisable that the form should be simplified so that, as I say, the ordinary man in the street who may be accused of an offence will understand what exactly is the nature of the offence with which he is accused. For that reason I support the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanRiccoCooper" hpid="Major COOPER Major COOPER">
      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one question I rather expected Deputy O'Connell to ask and which I certainly want to ask and which the Minister perhaps might answer: what is the urgency of this Bill?  We might admit its importance&mdash;I will deal with that later&mdash;but even admitting its importance is it absolutely necessary that we should consider it in existing circumstances when the whole programme of the Dáil is overloaded with business? Is it so important and urgent that it must be rushed through before the 4th July?  I do insist that this is a Bill of the type that might have been introduced in the Seanad.  If that was desirable a fortnight ago it is more desirable now.  The new Attorney-General has a right to speak in the Seanad; he has not a right to speak <Col N="2165" /> here, and there are doubtless various points that could have been cleared up by him in the Seanad.  Another reason why I think this Bill is not so very urgent as to necessitate proceeding with it now is this.  The Government has appointed a new judiciary; that judiciary has to-day begun to function. Would it not be wiser, before making changes of this character, to have the opinion of the judges after a certain experience?  They come to this question fresh, for the most part; they are not biassed by any tradition or outlook and I feel a reform of this kind would have greater weight and force behind it if it came as the experience of the Bench rather than to spring fully armed from the head of the late Attorney-General.  I cannot help having a certain suspicion that this is change for the sake of change; that the Government desire to alter things as much as possible; in that respect I am prepared to be called conservative. If there are to be alterations, if you make improvements&mdash;and I am not much impressed with these new indictments as given in the appendix to the rules&mdash;if there are to be alterations let them be made after due deliberation. Take the first of these alterations&mdash;&ldquo;A.B.&rdquo;&mdash;if Deputy Alfred Byrne was in his place he might wish to ask why always &ldquo;A.B.&rdquo;&mdash;on the blank day of blank in the county of blank, murdered &ldquo;J.S.&rdquo;  There is one very serious omission from that, and that is, that the place is only indicated by the county. If I were accused of murder, or of any other of those miscellaneous crimes, I should like to know more specifically the place I was alleged to have committed the crime in order that I might follow the advice of the elder Mr. Weller and secure an alibi.  Fancy if one were accused of murder in the Co. Cork or the Co. Dublin.  A man might have been in Cork or in Dublin when the murder was committed, but he might have been a very great distance from the spot where it was committed.  If the Minister is recasting these indictments he might well make them somewhat more specific in the matter of place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not yet impressed with the real necessity for this change.  If there is <Col N="2166" /> to be a change, and I think Deputy O'Connell would probably agree, a change should come higher up in the shape of codification or repeal of obsolete statutes and the bringing together of statutes that bear upon one subject in a combined law.  There is a great field for that in this country.  Very little of it has been done up to the present. Rather than tinkering with indictments and changes of forms, the better way, I would urge, would be for the Minister, not in this session, but later, to proceed with the condification of the law under the present constitution. There is in these obsolete things a certain value.  The traditions surrounding the law, though they may be bad traditions, though they may have had an element of evil in them, had, at the same time, some good. They were a protection against some kind of arbitrary force, and it is a mistake to shatter all these traditions at once.  You have altered the whole judicial system.  The judges appear in top hats and frock coats, rather than in wigs and gowns, though incidentally I think top hats and frock coats are as archaic institutions as wigs and gowns.  You have substituted one fetish for another, and I ask is it necessary to do that?  Should we not, having done that, pause for a little and see what the result will be before we embarrass it with these regulations? Tradition is worth something, if it is not wholly good.  It is one of the sanctions of the law.  I believe the Minister agrees with me that the greatest need probably in this country at the present time is to re-establish the authority of the law.  He has worked most whole-heartedly for that purpose.  I have no criticism to make of him on that ground at all, and that being so, and that need existing, is it wise to remove any of the old sanctions by which the law was supported unless it can be absolutely shown to be evil? And in this case I do not think the Minister has made out any stronger case than that they were unnecessary, than that they were cumbersome.  He has not proved that they were positively harmful, and unless they were harmful, I suggest we should proceed slowly and let the new machinery work for a little, and then if the form of <Col N="2167" /> the indictment and the form of the oath handicap and check it, then the Minister would be justified in coming here and asking us to sweep them away.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper has raised the question: What is the urgency of this measure?  A new system of courts has been established.  He might have asked in connection with them, what is the urgency?  Some of the judges are very old.  But it was thought wise by the Oireachtas under the Constitution to set up here a new system of courts.  There were good and solid and substantial reasons for that.  The Deputy, in considering a matter of this kind, cannot simply ignore the antecedents of the present situation.  The courts that existed here under the British administration were from the point of view of the vast majority of the people, prejudiced.  I say that without meaning in any way a reflection upon individual judges, whether of the High Courts or of the County Courts, or the magistrates functioning throughout the whole country.  But they were the courts of the stranger.  They were courts that were part and parcel of an administration here that was not here with the will of the people.  If it lay in the power of the people to remove them by their votes, they would have gone many a long year ago.  And so we fashioned here a new system giving a good deal of consideration to what we considered to be the needs of the people; what we believed to be the real reform for the country.  We set up a Judiciary Committee which sat for a long time, and which fortunately was able to bring in a unanimous report. A Bill strictly based on that report was passed through the Dáil and the Seanad, and became the law of the country, and this morning that new system of courts, set up by a Parliament responsible to the people, was inaugurated, and it is fitting that when they were set up there should disappear the old archaic forms of indictment belonging to the old system, and which contained and would continue to contain for the people the fragrance of the old system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> There is no use in ignoring the facts that the Juror's Oath, for instance, as it existed hitherto, was not palatable to a great many people in the country to whose lot it might fall from day to day or month to month to serve on juries.  There is nothing very terrible about it.  But the oath embodied in the present Bill is considered, for practical purposes, a better formula and will be calculated to ensure that each juror will, in fact, do his duty in an impartial, fair way with regard to the prisoner. The oath in the Bill is: &ldquo;I do swear by Almighty God that I will well and truly try the issue as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the offence charged in the indictment preferred against him (or her) and that I will give a true verdict according to the evidence.&rdquo;  The existing oath is: &ldquo;I swear by Almighty God that I shall well and truly try and true deliverance make between our sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar, and such other prisoners or traversers as may be given me in charge and a true verdict find according to the evidence.&rdquo; I do not believe it is an overstatement to say that 75 per cent. of the jurors who take that oath do not understand it or know what it means.  It is not strange that in setting up new courts here that we should do what the British did in their wisdom in 1915, but which in their wisdom or unwisdom they did not extend to this country.  They simplified the forms of procedure in connection with their courts.  On the point of appropriate time for this action it is appropriate, when we are making a change from one court system to a new court system, that there should be a change also then in the old feudal forms of indictment that, as I say, confused the prisoner as often as not, and did not tend to clear the mind of the juror as to what his real duty was.</P>

      <P>Oh, certainly not. The existing forms will continue until altered by law.  I can understand the Deputy's conservatism, but the Deputy is broadminded enough to realise that that conservatism is not shared by the majority of the citizens of this State. <Col N="2169" /> After all, we are here legislating for the people in accordance with the wishes of the people, and I do not think that in public or in private the Deputy would suggest that the people share his conservatism with regard to this or many other matters.  They want to see the old forms changed. They want every possible evidence that this new system of courts is their system, constituted by a free Parliament in accordance with their wishes to meet their requirements, and they do not want in and around their court system the remnants of the old regime.  That is the situation as we see it.</P>

      <P>I desire to move the amendment standing in my name and in the name of Deputy Johnson to this section.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 19, 22, and 24-25, to delete the word &ldquo;tenpence&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;twopence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of Section 2 is to provide from the insurance fund the cost of medical certification.  As far as I understand, that cost to-day is about £45,000 per annum, or something like two shillings per insured person.  Up to March, 1922, the whole cost was defrayed by the State, and at that time the cost was about two and three pence per insured person.  Then, what is known as the Geddes Committee came into existence, and as we all know, it successfully wielded the axe, so much <Col N="2171" /> so that the British Government decided to increase the weekly contributions by one penny, and that was to be borne equally by the employer and the employed person.  The approved societies who, of course, are intimately concerned in this whole question, at that time did not consider that the moment was appropriate for this increase, but they agreed to meet the charge for one year and nine months out of their own funds, that period ending, I think, in December, 1923.  Subsequently, there was an Act passed for Great Britain and Northern Ireland which did not operate in the Free State, as it was passed subsequent to the Treaty, and in that Act that agreement was embodied. No such Act was passed for the Free State, and the result has been that up to this the entire charge has been met by the State, but in Great Britain and Northern Ireland it was decided that there should be a contribution of twopence per insured person for the year 1924&mdash;that was, of course, subsequent to the termination of the period which I have mentioned&mdash;and that that 2d. per member of approved societies should be supplemented by a contribution from the unclaimed monies of the Stamp Sales Account, and also from the surplus on the investment account over the amount allowed by regulation. Now, that may seem rather difficult for Deputies to follow, but what it amounted to was this, that 2d. a head was the amount paid per member, and this was agreed to by the approved societies in Great Britain and Northern Ireland&mdash;2d. per head per insured person&mdash;and the balance was made up out of the funds which I have mentioned. Now, what is proposed here in this section is that 10d. a head shall fall upon the members of the approved societies and that the balance, namely, 1/2&mdash;the balance of 2/- &mdash;shall be derived from the funds which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Now, sir, the approved societies say that their funds are not able at the present time to sustain that burden, and that the result will be deficiencies in valuation.  And what the approved societies complain of is that the National Health Insurance Commission <Col N="2172" /> make this proposal without bringing forward any authorised report, say from an Actuary, showing that their benefit funds would be able to stand such interference.  The benefit expenditure, as everyone can realise, of these societies, has been very severe for the last two years, and the societies themselves have represented at least on one occasion to the National Health Insurance Commissioners that they would not be able to stand the proposed burden. And what they complain of is that this alteration should be proposed without some authoritative report from an Actuary upon the matter.  It is not that they desire that the old state of things should continue, or that they say that the State should bear the whole of this charge.  On the contrary, they say that they shall be willing to bear what they consider to be their proper proportion of the burden, and that that proportion as far as they know up to the present, should be similar to the proportion that has been agreed to by the approved societies both in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain, namely 2d. per head, the balance to be made up from the funds that I have mentioned.  Now, this fund of unclaimed monies from stamps runs, I think into quite a large figure.  I do not know whether the Government are able to supply the figure or not, but I think it is incumbent upon them, if possible, to do so; and if the Minister could, in his reply, inform me what is the extent of the fund derived from unclaimed stamp monies, I should be grateful to him for the information. But at any rate, the fund some time ago I think for the whole of Ireland amounted to something like £113,000; and that certainly would be sufficient to cover the deficit if the insured persons were to subscribe 2d. per head, and if the amount altogether only totalled £45,000.</P>
    <P>Now, sir, I think only a few months ago&mdash;perhaps it was last year&mdash;a conference was held between the representatives of the approved societies and the Insurance Commissioners, and at that conference, I am informed, the approved societies of Ireland unanimously opposed this proposed 10d. burden, and they gave their grounds for their opposition; and their <Col N="2173" /> principal ground was that they should have it in black and white, on paper, from an authorised actuary, that their society funds were able to bear this charge.  And what they complain about now is that the Government are bringing in this proposal and that they have not produced that report.  There is, I think, an Advisory Committee under the Insurance Act of 1911, and I think it would be a subject matter for that Committee.  However, there is also, I understand, a Committee of Inquiry about to be set up to inquire into the whole question of public health insurance administration.  And what I would suggest seriously to the Minister is this: that, pending that inquiry, this proposal should be dropped and that he should await the decision and the report of that Committee of Inquiry before he proceeds to make a proposal such as this, a proposal which the societies themselves concerned say would be an unbearable one as far as their funds are concerned.  If the Committee of Inquiry discover and are able to show that the 10d. burden would not be an unbearable one, if they are able to show that it would be a proper and a reasonable burden to be levied upon the individual members, or from the funds of the society, then the Government would be in a strong position, especially if they also had an actuary's report on the matter.  They could then come down to this Dáil and say: here are our reports, both from the actuary and from the Committee of Inquiry, and they both say that this burden is a right and a proper one.  Of course if, on the other hand, the Committee did not come to that conclusion, that would only be another justification for the amendment that I have placed upon the Order Paper and which I hope will be favourably considered by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put down an amendment in similar terms to this and I would like to supplement what Deputy Redmond has said in support of the proposal.  He has indicated generally the reasons why he thought that this proposal to reduce the sum by 10d. is inequitable and much of what has to be said was said, or suggested, on Second Reading, but there is something more to be said.  The proposals in the Bill are based, apparently, on <Col N="2174" /> the actuarial reports which were prepared for British Societies or, shall I say, for the whole of the institution, England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, and the valuations that have been made, did not, even when they were made for the whole of these four countries I would maintain, and do not justify this reduction of the State grant and the additional charge upon the funds of the Societies.  They are much less equitable when applied to Irish Societies.  The burden of sickness is heavier in Ireland.  The reports which were made for the last valuation period were made at a time when it was very unprofitable for a person to go sick and when it was easy in very many big establishments for a man to be allowed to remain on in work on pay while quite unfit for work, because employers said &ldquo;we must not lose this man; we are being paid by the Government for public work according to a percentage over and above our output.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Anybody acquainted with industrial undertakings during that period knows that very large numbers of men were allowed to remain on the pay-sheets and in the case of shipbuilding centres, allowed to hide away and were for days and days, and sometimes for weeks and weeks, doing nothing, though on the pay-roll, and were told by the foreman or manager to get out of the way, not to show themselves, and to lie down.  That sort of thing was very common and when people talk of the demoralisation of certain sections of the people they have to look to that kind of thing, for which the employer was responsible, as the explanation. That, however, is by the way. During that period there was the lowest possible rate of sickness and, therefore, the lowest possible charge on the societies.  Since that period societies have had a very much heavier sickness rate and it is believed by those competent to judge that the great majority of societies&mdash;societies taking in all kinds and qualities of insured persons, not selected societies&mdash; will have to call upon the margins that were allowed under the scheme to meet their sickness liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what is proposed is to apply <Col N="2175" /> these margins to pay those certifications. The Minister spoke of the 5d. which had been reduced from the administration expenses this year.  That 5d. was originally set aside to make a contingency fund to meet possible defects, or possible deficits, in case of emergency&mdash;contagious diseases, infectious diseases, and any other abnormal liability&mdash;and it was to be put aside more or less as a reserve fund, to meet the abnormal costs of administration. Now that has been reduced.  The societies contend, quite rightly, that it should go back to this emergency contingency fund because if it were ever required&mdash;it may well be required again&mdash;it ought not to be used for this medical certification.  That is so far as the 5d. goes, but then we are asked to agree that another 3d. which is a margin also to meet extra liabilities, extra costs, should be taken from the societies health insurance and paid over to the cost of this medical certification. Now, what is going to be the effect, supposing the opinions and judgment of experts in health insurance are justified, and that the societies are not able, even the best administered societies, to bear this extra charge?  It will mean that there will be a deficit on the next valuation, and that that will impose on every member of the societies the necessity for an extra levy to meet the deficit.  We will have again the spectacle&mdash;without having had proper examination of accounts, without having had an actuarial certificate proving to us that the societies could bear this new charge&mdash;of the societies forced into a state of what you might call insolvency, throwing upon the insured person of two years hence, an added liability.  Now, if it is the intention, as we understand it is, that there shall be a general inquiry into the health insurance scheme, then that inquiry should precede this change. This change should not take place until that inquiry has been carried through.</P>
    <P>The sum of 2d. is put down rather because it is a certain margin that was calculated as being available for extras. That margin of 2d. per year is suggested as a sufficient contribution to make towards this classification, <Col N="2176" /> instead of the 5d. that is now suggested. The 10d. is entirely too much; 5d. has been deducted already, and this, it is contended and believed, would simply mean that it is not in administration that the loss will be.  It can not be an actual saving to the State, because the effect will be that you are going to reduce administration.  You are going to reduce the allowances for administration, which will mean a reduction in the efficiency of administration, which will mean an added charge upon the societies, or, alternatively, it will force the societies to cut down benefits, and the insured persons will probably have to seek Home Help.  Sick people are either going to suffer, or get assistance from one place or another. There is no suggestion that anyone will get anything out of this amendment. It is simply affirming the belief that the scheme will not bear this charge, and if you are going to alter the scheme it had better be after full inquiry and any readjustments that an acturial report may involve, rather than to make your change now, and then have your inquiry.  The societies, I think, are unanimous in their view in this matter. I do not believe that the Commissioners could tell us, through the Minister, that this will leave societies in a sound position.  I believe it is against all expert advice and that it is simply a case of the Minister saying: &ldquo;Well, we will not allow these various funds, this Contingency Fund or Unclaimed Stamps Account, to be drawn on, even for this year,&rdquo; pending this full inquiry even.  We are going to make the poor pay.  I suggest that that is not a position we ought to allow, and we ought to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we must have regard to what the societies have escaped paying during the past couple of years owing to the fact that the Saorstát came into being and that the Exchequer bore the whole cost of medical certification.  The expense of medical certification to the societies in Northern Ireland for the years ending in 1922, '23, and '24, all-told, will be £29.300.  The amount that we are proposing to put on the societies this year will be £14,300.  The number of members in the Saorstát is about 440,000, <Col N="2177" /> over whom the £14,300 will be spread. The number of members in Northern Ireland is 280,000, so that if this arrangement that we propose this year were to end with this year the societies here would get out of it very cheaply, indeed.  Their total would be less than the total of Northern Ireland; it would only be half the total of Northern Ireland, with a great many more members. Even if it were to be continued for two years, and £14,300 were to be charged for a second year, the societies in the period beginning in 1922 would have paid less than the Northern societies have had to pay, and with a great many more members, so that it cannot be said that we are imposing an unduly heavy burden on the societies.  If we take the question of the effect of this extra charge of 8d. beyond what the amendment suggests&mdash;the 8d. per member spread over a period of five years&mdash;I do not think it would be very likely to have any appreciable effect on the valuation.  I should think that a society that would be put in a wrong position and valuation because of this 8d. per member must be conducted in a very unsatisfactory way, and must be very near the margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not 8d. per member per year?  The Minister said spread over a period of five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I have stated that we have proposed to have this for this year only, or at most for two years, when we hope that the whole state of insurance can be looked into and dealt with.  What is proposed in the Bill is simply a provision to meet the requirements for medical certification for the present until we can have an examination into the whole system of National Health Insurance, and until we can see what reforms can beneficially be carried out in the system.  This is, as you might say, a stop-gap arrangement, and there is no intention of making it a permanent one because, as I have already pointed out in regard to one part of this proposal, it could not possibly be permanent.  We propose to find 1/2 of the 2/- required for medical certification out of the Unclaimed Stamps Account.  We could not, I think, take it from that account for more than two <Col N="2178" /> years in succession, and in fact it would be undesirable even to take an amount from that account for two years.  At the conference to which Deputy Redmond referred the societies objected to the 5d. which was going to administration, not to the other 5d., which is made up of the 2d and the 3d. I do not think that they would have urged that the administrative expenses should be cut down and that the Benefit Fund or the Contingency Fund should have the advantage of the 5d. which is being saved on administration. I believe that that 5d. taken off administration is at the bottom of the objection of the societies to the proposal, and if the 5d. had been left them and they had continued to receive 4/10 for administration, and the other 5d. had been found as we proposed, there might not have been so much objection at all.  There is no particular advantage in taking this amount required&mdash;supposing we are to take the 10d. from these funds&mdash;from the other funds rather than taking it directly from the Benefit Fund, because these other funds will have to be taken into account at a valuation, and the effect on the societies will be the same when it comes to a valuation, whether it comes from this particular fund or not.  We do not desire to take more from the Unclaimed Stamps Account than we are already taking, because we are not able to estimate the precise amount of that fund.  Of the £113,000 for all Ireland to which Deputy Redmond referred there must be a deduction for cards that have not come in and for stamps that are in the hands of the public and have not been affixed to cards.  This is not the surplus fund.  Even if we did know the exact amount that was surplus at present there is the fact that the fund has still to be apportioned between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Saorstát, and we do not know the precise amount of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That fund in any case is charged with other liabilities.  The expense of keeping in benefit unemployed persons who are unable to stamp their cards, and whom it is not desirable to allow to fall out of benefit, is being charged to that fund.  There are four years' cost of that service to come out of the <Col N="2179" /> fund, and, as a matter of fact, the bills are only falling due at present. Although it has been a couple of years in operation, we do not know the amount of the cost of keeping unemployed in benefit will be, and how much it will take out of the fund, and we do not think it is desirable to risk exhausting that fund competely, or to make it unable to bear the charge of keeping unemployed uninsured persons in benefit.  The same consideration practically applies to the Surplus Interests Fund.  The societies in this country which have British securities, owing to the fact that the income tax exemption for charities will not, I think, be extended a further year&mdash;certainly we have not on general grounds desired to extend that exemption to charities, and the British authorities I understand, are equally reluctant&mdash;will necessitate existing societies which have investments in England realising them. Some of these investments were bought when prices were a good deal higher than they are at present, and the surplus interest will probably be required to meet the loss on capital which will be occasioned by the transfer.  As I say, there has been no apportionment of that fund, and we do not know what it is.  We do not think it is sound and desirable to charge part of the cost of this to a fund about which, until an apportionment takes place, we know practically nothing.  We feel that the best thing is to charge 10d. of the 2/- to the societies, and the other 1/2 to the unclaimed stamps account, which can bear that amount, but we do not wish to burden it further.  The societies, taking an average of years, are coming out of it a great deal more cheaply than they would if they had been in the Northern area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear the Minister state that this is only a temporary proposal.  He says that it may only apply to one year, and that at most it should only apply to two years, but, if he would only put that into the Bill, I think it would be a great advantage, because I have seen other temporary Bills brought in for temporary purposes that have been renewed again and again, and I cannot find it stated that this is only for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister could see his way to make that clear, that at any rate would dispel some of the fears the approved societies have given expression to.  But apart from that the Minister has not quite answered one or two questions that I put to him, especially the question as to whether any actuarial report had been received by him, and whether he is acting on this report or not, and secondly, whether it would not be advisable, now that the Committee of Inquiry is shortly to sit&mdash;I think it is to sit within the next few days&mdash;to await the report of that inquiry, before proceeding as, indeed, he appears to be, without any expert advice upon the matter.  It is perfectly true, as he said, that for a few years the approved societies in Ireland were not taxed to the extent that they were in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, but it is also true, I think, to say that the approved societies were taxed more heavily in Ireland on account of the calls upon them in the shape of disease and the general conditions that prevailed in the country.  Therefore, I do not think it quite fair to compare the present position of the approved societies in the Free State with the position of societies in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  If the societies were, as he suggests, to be severely hit by this, it would show that they were existing upon a very narrow margin at present, and I do not dispute that statement at all.  On the contrary, I should say that that was a fact, and that being so I would suggest that it would be wiser before proceeding with this proposed extra levy to <Col N="2181" /> stop until he had good grounds, whether from an actuarial report, or from the report of the Committee of Inquiry, which is about to go into the whole question.  As to the Unclaimed Stamp Fund which I referred to, the Minister evidently cannot inform us of the extent of it at present.  Well, I think it is about time we did know where we stand in that matter, and what the amount is that will have to be apportioned between Northern Ireland and the Free State.  Would it not be wiser, if he does not know the exact amount of that fund now, to wait until he does and then perhaps he would have more at his disposal from that fund than he appears to think?  That fund, as he has stated, will be drained for other purposes, but that fund was used as far as Great Britain and Northern Ireland are concerned, and is still used for this purpose.  Taking all these things into consideration, later on I think that the Minister will consider this step to have been a hasty one, and that it would have been better in the interest of the National Health Commissioners, of the approved societies and of the country generally, if he was to stay his hand and await the decision and report of a duly qualified actuary and of the Committee of Inquiry, and also to await the time when he would be in a position to know the exact amount of this Unclaimed Stamps Fund&mdash;how much can be apportioned to this country, and what fund there will be to draw upon for this sum.  I think these facts make a strong case why the Minister should not proceed, and I would strongly urge upon him to take these facts into consideration, and if he does not see his way to do so, at any rate, to make it clear in the Bill that this proposal is only for the present year.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Redmond <Col N="2182" /> would look at Section 4 he will see that this is only a temporary Bill: &ldquo;There shall be paid out of the Medical Certification Fund&mdash;(a) such sums in respect of the year 1924....&rdquo;  To continue it even for another year will require a fresh Bill.  In regard to getting an actuarial report, that would involve a valuation of the societies, and we felt that there was sufficient ground for holding that the societies could bear the small burden of seven-ninths of 10d. without crashing.  We have not provided in the Estimates for this year for medical certification, and if this Bill, or something like it, were not passed, either the medical certification scheme would fall to the ground, or we would require to present a Supplementary Estimate to the Dáil to provide a sum of £35,000 to meet the costs of this service, which we do not feel we could well do in all the circumstances.</P>

But then Section 2 provides for the method of forming the Certification Fund, and to make it clear, in that Section 2 there should be words to the effect that this method can only be adopted for this year.  The fund may be made up as proposed in Section 2 from this on <i>ad infinitum.</i> It is in the actual compiling of the fund that I would suggest the method should be limited to this year. I respectfully put that to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end a sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The sum due to any medical practitioner in respect of medical certification shall not be paid in full unless and until the Insurance Committee for the area has notified the Irish Insurance Commissioners that it has no objection to final payment or that, having raised objection, it has, after consultation with the medical practitioner, agreed to withdraw its objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is an attempt to secure that Insurance Committees will have some kind of control over medical certification. I gather that there has been a considerable amount of dissatisfaction with medical certification, and local Insurance Committees&mdash;that is County Committees&mdash;should have some check upon medical practitioners who are directly responsible to the Commissioners. It is only when specific complaints may be made to the Commissioners <Col N="2185" /> that any action can be taken.  It is alleged that in many cases perhaps, here and there, medical practitioners are not&mdash;shall I say&mdash;very honest in their issuing of certificates, and that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction. This is an attempt to give the local Insurance Committee some kind of suspensory veto upon the payment of the sums due to the practitioners. It ought to be, I think, acceptable. If the Insurance Committees are to be given any rights or authority at all, this certainly should be included.  Therefore, I move the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment arises from some idea of an analogy with conditions in Great Britain, where there is medical certification, and where the local societies keep registers not only of the insured people in their area, but also of the medical practitioners, and pay out the funds to the doctors.  Now there is no such arrangement here.  The duty of the Committees has been confined practically to sanatorium benefit.  They have had nothing to do with this matter and to make any change would involve some increase of staff to the Committees at a time when we are about to consider the whole system.  I do not think that extra burdens of a type of work that has not existed up to this should be thrown on Committees or that committees should be compelled to employ new staffs and to undertake new duties.  Then there is the question of our arrangement with the doctors.  We have arranged with them to undertake the work at a certain fee under certain conditions.  If we impose new conditions, that bargain will have to be re-opened and I do not think that that should be done when we are dealing really with an interim arrangement.  There are means of inquiring into the conduct of a medical certifier and I think that on the whole those means are working reasonably well.  Certainly there has not in my time come to my knowledge any considerable number of complaints and I think that the system that exists at present for inquiring into the way that the certifiers do their work will serve for the interval that will elapse <Col N="2186" /> before this and other questions can be considered.  I do not think it would be desirable at all to make this amendment, and I think there is no particular demand for it.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the motion on the Orders of the Day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That for the purposes of any Act of the present Session to make provision for the better administration of the Dublin Metropolitan Police and for that and other purposes to amend the law relating to the said Police, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred under such Acts by reason of the alteration of the conditions of certification prescribed by Section 3 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923 (No. 34 of 1923).</P>
      <P>The reference at the end of the motion to the change in the conditions of certification prescribed by Section 3 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, arises from the fact that certain ex-members of the D.M.P. who would have been entitled to reinstatement were in the National Army last year, and failed within the statutory time to produce the evidence to secure reinstatement. The wording of the Act was that they should be reinstated in the force after the 6th day of December, 1921, and not later than three months after the passing of the Act. The Act was passed in August, 1923. They are now given a further period of three months for reinstatement.  I think there are only five or six men altogether involved.</P>

      <P>I have two amendments on the Paper to the Bill, and these amendments may be affected by this resolution.  They were tabled before I saw this resolution.  I only saw it this morning.  The amendments do <Col N="2187" /> not, in intention, though they may in actual fact, differ from the purpose of the resolution.  I have no intention of increasing the pensions, other than the pensions that the various officers would be entitled to under this Act.  I have no intention of giving them a larger pension than that given under the Bill, but I would like to know if my amendments will be in order, or if the Minister in charge will give me any information as to his intention in dealing with them, because I do not want to be estopped because this resolution has been passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Without presuming to rule on the question of order, I will venture the opinion that the Deputy's amendments go outside the scope and purport of the Bill.  But I am quite willing to deal with them now on this financial motion and to give him information which I think will meet his point and meet his object in putting down the amendments.  The amendments seem to have been put down under the impression that the tenure prescribed in this Bill for the Commissioners of the Dublin Metropolitan Police differs from the tenure of permanent civil servants.  It seems to me that the Deputy would be satisfied if I gave him an assurance that the tenure prescribed for Commissioners of the Dublin Metropolitan Police is precisely that prescribed for Civil Servants.  Under the Civil Service Regulation Act, the Minister for Finance has power to prescribe the terms and conditions of service of permanent Civil Servants.  Under those powers, the Minister, by Regulation dated 26th April of the current year, prescribed that Civil Servants should hold office under the will and pleasure of the Executive Council which, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, is the identical tenure by which Civil Servants in England hold office.  The Deputy will appreciate that the tenure prescribed for Commissioners of the Dublin Metropolitan Police is therefore really Civil Servants tenure.  The tenure of Civil Servants in England is tenure during pleasure and I doubt if anyone will contend that a Commissioner of Police is entitled to any greater safeguards than those accorded the permanent <Col N="2188" /> Civil Servant.  With regard to pension rights, pension rights for Civil Servants are prescribed by the Superannuation Act, and pension rights for police are prescribed by orders made under police statutes.  The Deputy will appreciate that, while theoretically the tenure of permanent Civil Servants is the tenure of the Police Commissioners &mdash;during the pleasure of the Executive Council&mdash;that, in practice, there is no possibility of either a permanent Civil Servant or a Commissioner of Police being arbitrarily dismissed.  The position of the permanent Civil Servant and the position of the Police Commissioner are analogous and there is no intention, and there will be no intention, of discriminating.  Under the Bill these officers get the highest tenure that is known.  Their pensions are already fixed, and I think the Deputy scarcely adverted fully to these facts in putting down an amendment which seeks to fix pensions at a larger sum and seems to aim at giving some greater tenure to these officers than they at present possess or than they will possess under the terms of the Bill.  Perhaps the Deputy would like to say whether I have met his case as fully as he would have wished.  The position, as it appears to us, is that the amendment is superfluous.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the information he has given, but he has not met my case as fully as I would wish.  I would like to ask the Minister a question.  It is necessary for me to ask the Minister this question, because private Deputies of the Oireachtas have no access to the volume of statutes.  We were promised that three months ago but we have not got it yet.  I want to know, in the first place, will not this Bill we are now passing, when it becomes law, over-ride all previous police statutes. Is it contended anywhere, outside Northern Ireland, that a subsequent statute does not over-rule an earlier one?  Because, if so, that removes from these officers the rights they hitherto possessed.  They may at any time be removed from their office by an Executive Council.  That is certainly a new condition.  The second point I would like an answer to is in <Col N="2189" /> respect of the statement that a Commissioner of Police is in just the same position as any other Civil Servant, and is no more likely to be removed.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner of Police is an active agent in the policy of the Government to my mind and in the event of a change of policy or a change of Government it might be found impossible to continue that officer. I am endeavouring to make what is at the back of my head clear to the Minister.  Is the Minister quite certain in his own mind that there is no danger in consequence of a change of policy or Government of the Police Commissioner being removed, not through any fault of his own, but because the policy he carried out is unpopular with the new Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point Commissioners of Police have as much and as little tenure as any Civil Servant, as any of what are called permanent Civil Servants&mdash;Executive heads of departments&mdash;who may be regarded equally with Police Commissioners as active agents of the policy of the Government which is in being at any time.  Practically all the important Civil Servants are that.  The Executive head of the Ministry of Justice&mdash;the Chief State Solicitor&mdash; any of these officers of the State are active agents of the policy of the Government which will change from time to time with a change of Government; but the tenure of these officers is not altered by the Bill.  The Deputy says that under the Bill they can be removed by the Executive Council.  They could be removed by the Executive Council before the Bill.  Their pension rights are not altered; they remain what they were and I know of no device unless to say that these men by statute are to be made irremovable. Unless you are going to say in their case what is not said in the case of any other employee of the State, I do not see how one could improve on the existing position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major COOPER</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this section.  I am not speaking in order to obstruct or to delay the progress of the Bill in any way.  My one desire is to try and obtain some sort of security for the occupant of the post of Chief Commissioner.  In the absence of the light and leading we used to have from the Attorney-General, and speaking as one layman to another, I am not entirely satisfied with the proposal contained in this section. I think it will lead to what is far more undesirable than having the matter set forth in a statute.  It will lead to private negotiation on the part of the person occupying the position to secure that in the event of his being dismissed he will not suffer.  I know a case that occurred in the past.  An inspector-general was appointed to the Royal Irish Constabulary.  Being a man of foresight, coming from the Co. Derry, he got an undertaking from the British Government that he should not be removed from his post unless he was given a better one.  As a result of a change of policy the British Government desired to remove him.  They found they were up against this undertaking, and they found they had to pay him fully for two years as inspector-general while he lived in London, and another inspector-general ruled <Col N="2191" /> here.  And they had to find a post as Governor of a Colony for the former man.  That is intensely undesirable, and it is because I want to try to avoid it that I am importuning the Minister and asking him to make it clear that in the event of an official being dismissed, not through any fault of his own, he should be protected.  I contend he should be dismissed if guilty of misconduct or if inefficient, but if dismissed in consequence of a change of policy of Government, his pension rights should be clearly set out in the statute.  There is an enormous difference between the assurance of the Minister buried away in back volumes of the official debates and a statutory right given to an individual which can be quoted chapter and verse.  Ministers come and go, but the law remains, and that is why I have urged, and will continue to urge, so far as in me lies, the desirability in this particular post, for giving that security.  I do not think the Minister will contend that the pension rights are so fixed that if the occupant of this post is dismissed for inefficiency or incompetence or misconduct, then he will be entitled to his pension.  I speak without having very carefully studied the statutes.  I wish we could have these statutes and study them.  At present we are working in the dark, but unless the Minister contends that, then there is a case for putting something in the Bill that will safeguard men&mdash;it might be put in on Report or when the Bill goes to the Seanad&mdash;who run far more risk of unpopularity with certain individuals than other Civil Servants.  A man like the Chief Commissioner must make himself unpopular with certain individuals, or he does not do his duty, and that is the reason why when legislation of this kind is before us these officers are entitled to exceptional treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess, that I have some difficulty in understanding the Deputy's persistence on this point. I wonder if it would in any way ease his mind if I were to state that the position, tenure and pension rights of these officers are identical with the position, tenure and pension rights of the corresponding officer in the Gárda <Col N="2192" /> Síochána, and that, as I have said before, the tenure of both is the tenure of the most permanent Civil Servant in the employment of the State, whoever he may be.  I ask the Deputy a question. He has asked me many, but I ask him one: Does he want us to fix these men in office by statute so that they shall be irremovable by the Executive Council, so that they shall differ essentially in their tenure from the tenure of permanent Civil Servants, or so that they shall be like judges?  There is some idea in the mind of the Deputy that this Bill alters their position either in respect of tenure or in respect of pension rights.  It does not.  Yesterday or the day before they were removable by the Executive Council, just as they are to-day and will be to-morrow, and this Bill does not touch at all on the question of their position rights.  We are told that a policeman, from the nature of his duties, will incur odium and will incur unpopularity, and that, therefore, these men must be protected from this or from some future Executive Council, and that they should be so protected by statute of the Oireachtas.  We cannot legislate on the assumption that Executive Councils in this country are going to behave in that reckless, irresponsible manner that they would remove policemen from office for doing their duty or because of odium or unpopularity incurred in the doing of their duty. That would be Bedlam; it would simply be to suppose that this Dáil or some future Dáil is going to entrust the destinies of the country into the hands of men who would be capable of acting in that manner, and presumably would not deal with them promptly if they should so act.  The tenure of any Civil Servant is this, that Governments did not and Governments will not act in that manner, and that in fact an employee of the State will not be arbitrarily removed from his position. These men have the same tenure as the executive head of my Department, as the executive head of the Department of Finance, and as the executive head of any of the Departments of State.  Does the Deputy wish to give them more than that?  Does he wish to put them in the position of judges so that they shall be removable <Col N="2193" /> only by the vote of both Houses of the Oireachtas and for cause shown?  That would be, as it were, setting up a Government above the Government.  Their position is the position of the Commissioners of the other police forces, and I see no reason for dissatisfaction with that position.  It is the highest tenure known in State employment here hitherto, and I do not think we should lightly alter it.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Minister's question, I do not wish to have these officials put in the position of judges, and I do not wish to have them made irremovable.  I have never contended that they should be irremovable, but I do contend that if they are removed through no fault of their own that they should have the statutory right to pensions clearly asserted in this Bill, which overrides any previous Bill.  That is my point.  As regards the rest of the Minister's argument, may I express the regret that he was not a member of the delegation which negotiated the Treaty.  I am sure that the Minister for Finance regrets that, too.  His argument on this matter was a powerful argument against Article 10 of the Treaty, and I am sure the Minister for Finance would have been delighted if Article 10 of the Treaty had not been inserted therein.  I am not speaking to obstruct the Bill, but I am disturbed at the position in which these officers may be left.  I am an older man than the Minister, and I have seen many changes in my life. There is no great certainty for anybody in the country.  So far as certainty can be secured by Statute let us endeavour to do so in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to draw attention to a requirement here as regards the appointment of the Chief Commissioner.  The appointment is to be confirmed subject to his making a declaration in the form contained in the First Schedule.  When we turn to the First Schedule it speaks of his employment by the Ard Comhairle of Saorstát Eireann, but in Section 3 he is to be appointed and removed by the Executive Council.  It is possible that the Commissioner may be Guard McGill, from Letterkenny; he may be, <Col N="2194" /> for instance, a man like myself, who may not be able to connect &ldquo;Ard Comhairle&rdquo; with the Executive Council.  If we have the Executive Council in the section as the body which is to appoint and remove, we ought, I think, to have the same phrase in the declaration which this person has to make, or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>I just want to call attention to the fact that there is a discrepancy between the two and it may be that, amongst the very numerous interpreters and translators, there may be a difference of opinion as to whether &ldquo;Ard Comhairle&rdquo; is the true translation of &ldquo;Executive Council,&rdquo; and inasmuch as there are members of this force who are not able to decide that question for themselves, it may be better to have a change either in the declaration or in the section.</P>

      <P>Before passing from Section 8 I should like to find out from the Minister whether he has considered the question I raised on the Second Reading regarding the effect of Section 8, which gives the Minister power, subject to the approval of the Executive Council, to punish members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, whether that in fact might be said to constitute a court and to give him the status of a court in respect of this, and whether that has any bearing upon the provisions of the Constitution regarding the appointment of a court.  Perhaps the Minister has considered it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of the sub-section is, of course, clearly intended <Col N="2195" /> to cover disciplinary action within the organisation, and to cover such matters as fines for misconduct, and so on.  The system obtaining in the other police force is that fines imposed upon members for various minor breaches of discipline go into a fund which in turn is used as a reward fund, to be distributed at the discretion of the Commissioner, with the assistance of certain senior officers.  The Deputy's point that it could be extended to cover imprisonment and so on, is, I think, scarcely a sound one or a substantial one.  No one suggests that these internal disciplinary measures in the organisation will encroach upon the proper functions of the courts of the country.  When I pointed out to the Deputy on the last occasion, that to do that would be contrary to the Constitution, he quoted as against my contention the decision of one of the late courts, and in reply, the President reminded him that that court, which purported to pronounce on the Constitution, had in fact no right to so pronounce. And we are not prepared to admit, and we are not advised, that legislation can casually or without explicitly purporting to do so, alter the Constitution.  It turned out that the Deputy's whole point rested on this court's decision.  Now, the advice of the Government is that No. I, the court had no authority to pronounce upon the Constitution, and No. 2, that we differ strongly from the opinion expressed. The word &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; there must be taken in its context&mdash; punishment within a disciplined force. And because regulations may be made dealing with &ldquo;the promotion, retirement, degradation, dismissal, and punishment of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police,&rdquo; no one would suggest that a court constituted by officers of this force could imprison members of the force, which is the Deputy's fear, or alleged fear.  I do not know any word that could be substituted, because &ldquo;disciplinary measures&rdquo; or anything of that kind would be too broad, and would include degradation and dismissal.  But I am not convinced that there is any case made out by the Deputy for a change.</P>

      <P>This incidentally, and perhaps in a rather unfortunate way, raises a very important question. The Minister is seeking powers to make regulations in respect to the force, which include regulations for the promotion, retirement, degradation, dismissal and punishment of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. As has already been said very frequently, and even again to-night, it is not what the Minister assures the Dáil is his intention, but what some future Minister may do or possibly will do under the cover of an Act, which up to a week or two ago we might have said, without any question whatever, was subject to the Constitution which limits the authority of persons to inflict punishment to duly qualified courts.  Well, notwithstanding what Ministers may be advised in regard to the powers of the Constitution, and the effect of the Constitution Act, notwithstanding what Ministers may argue were the powers of the court, which dealt with certain cases brought forward under another Act of the Oireachtas, it remains the fact that three judges, who were up to a few days ago competent to deal with the ordinary law, took the view that any Act that we pass in the ordinary course of law may be held to be an amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, of course it is to the ordinary layman a preposterous attitude for anybody to take, and certainly nobody ever intended that the Constitution could be amended, even in the period of eight years in the ordinary course of legislation, but we are faced with the position that judges who were competent and well qualified judges and other high legal authorities who were judges once, believed, or at least held, that that provision of the Constitution Act is a weak one and allows it to be argued and, as they think successfully argued, that any Bill coming forward at any time under the ordinary process of legislation can be held to be an amendment of the Constitution, even though not specifically stated in the enactment itself.  Unless we in this, or any future Act, specifically say that this shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution, <Col N="2197" /> or until we amend the Constitution and remove any doubt, I say that this section may be held to give power to a Minister to act as a court to inflict punishment.  That is why I raise the question as to whether the Ministry had any intention regarding the amendment of the Constitution, or, alternatively, any intention of inserting in any Act that is passed, a proviso that nothing shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution unless specifically declared to be so.  I would like to raise this matter more formally, and perhaps an occasion will arise when I shall do so; but, as the matter has been referred to, I find it necessary to state what I have stated, namely, that this section, having in view the attitude of the judges in the case I have mentioned, leaves this Bill in such form that possibly it will be interpreted by future judges to empower a Minister to inflict punishment, such punishment being possibly even imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 agreed to, and ordered to stand part of the Bill.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;I ..................................... do solemnly and sincerely before God declare and affirm and my word and honour pledge that I will be faithful to the utmost of my ability in my employment by the Ard Comhairle of Saorstát Eireann in the office of ........................................ in the Dublin Metropolitan Police and that I will render good and true service and obedience to Saorstát Eireann and its constitution and government as by law established, without favour or affection, fear, malice or ill-will, and that I will see and cause the peace to be kept and preserved, and that I will prevent to the best of my power all offences against the same, and that while I shall continue to hold the said office, I will to the best of my knowledge discharge all the duties thereof faithfully according to <Col N="2198" /> law, and that I do not now belong and that I will not while I hold the said office, join, belong, or subscribe to any political society whatsoever, or to any secret society whatsoever.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: To delete all words after the word &ldquo;law,&rdquo; line 52, to the end of the Schedule.  The proposal is to leave out the last four lines in the formal declaration, declaring &ldquo;that I do not now belong and that I will not while I hold the said office, join, belong, or subscribe to any political society whatsoever, or to any secret society whatsoever.&rdquo;  I do not want it to be understood that I am desiring to encourage members of the Police Force, or any other of the forces, to become participants in political activity, in political societies of any kind, or to join secret organisations.  I am asking that these words shall be deleted, simply because I think it is impracticable, and because insofar as the latter part is concerned, I find that any and every citizen is prohibited by law from being a member of any secret society whatsoever, so that you are asking a policeman to declare that he will not break a law.  I think, as I said earlier, that a definition of a political society will be a rather difficult thing to insert in a declaration, and it will not be much easier to define a secret society.  The attempt to define a political society or a secret society is not easy, and there is no use in asking a man to declare that he will not join a secret society or a political society unless he knows what either of those bodies is.  A political society may be a gymnasium, as it has been on the Continent, or it may be an athletic club, as it was in Ireland; it may be a friendly society, as many of them have been in Ireland.  It may be anything, and we all know that societies were established, apparently, for innocent purposes, and still perhaps innocently, changed their character and purpose, and yet a person who joined was not a member of a political society.  Similarly in regard to secret societies.  Ten men come together saying: &ldquo;We are going to form an organisation,&rdquo; for some quite innocent amusement, but they are going to keep it quiet.  Is <Col N="2199" /> that a secret society?  Of course, you will say that it is preposterous; nevertheless it is an attempt at a definition. If you ask a man to make a declaration that he will not join any society you are asking him to declare what is quite foolish, and I therefore say that it is unwise to ask a man to make this declaration. Anything of the kind that you want to do ought to be done in a more regular form by regulations within the service itself.</P>

      <P>I listened very attentively to the Deputy, and I did my best to follow him, but when he was finished I was a little vague as to the real purport of what he said.  I do not know whether he is suggesting that a person could be a member of a secret society without knowing whether he was a member of a secret society or not; that he could, say, join a gymnastic club or a language class, or something of that kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To my mind, at the stage when he became aware that it was a political society, then, according to this declaration, it would be his duty to sever his connection with it. So much for the political society.  Now as to the secret society, the Deputy has attempted in a later amendment&mdash; I use the word &ldquo;attempted,&rdquo; and I rather stress the word&mdash;to define a secret society.  It seems to me that a secret society, like an elephant, is something very difficult to define; but you have no difficulty in recognising it, and I think that a man who has taken this declaration, and who had subsequently by accident strayed into a secret society, would have very little difficulty in recognising it either.  It comes down to this, whether you are going to have a man in your State organisation, in your police force, who will join groups, combinations, or societies with commitments unknown to their employers, the people, and with commitments which for all their employers, the people, may know to the contrary, cut across their line of duty, and their line of allegiance.  That is the point.  The wording of the declaration may not be perfect.  It may be as imperfect as the wording of Deputy Johnson's amendment, but it is the best shot we were able to make at effecting something which the great majority of the people consider highly desirable.  I do think that the recruit coming up from the country and taking that declaration, knows very well from what kind of activities he is precluded by the declaration, and will have no difficulty in recognising a secret society when it looms on his horizon.  The alternative is to accept the Deputy's amendment, and leave out any such restriction, leaving the recruit to his own sweet will as to which of the competing organisations he may wish to enrol himself in.</P>
