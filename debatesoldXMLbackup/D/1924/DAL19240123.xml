      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether, in the proposed examination to be held early this year for officers of Customs and Excise, special facilities will be granted to demobilised and serving officers and men of the National Army; whether the age limit will be extended to 35 in that examination, and, if not, whether he is aware that the age limit, which it is stated is about to be fixed, will disqualify many men who rendered valuable service to the State within the past few years.</P>

      <P>The previous examination for the Customs and Excise service to which the Deputy refers, was confined to officers and men of the Army, and fifty posts were given as a result of that examination to Army candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forthcoming examination is an open competition for candidates between the ages of 19 and 22.  Candidates who have served in the National Army will, however, be given special privileges at this examination.  Twentyfive posts will be reserved for Army candidates who reach a qualifying standard in the examination, and I propose to recommend to the Civil Service Commissioners an extension of the age limit to 35 in the case of Army men entering for this particular examination. It must, however, be understood that in view of the disadvantages of admitting <Col N="448" /> men to the Civil Service up to the age of 35, I cannot undertake to recommend a similar extension of the age limit in the case of any future examinations.</P>

A final decision can not be reached as to the manner in which this money will be allocated until the claims of all innocent persons have been considered and dealt with.  The question of granting compensation over and above the amount of the fund available cannot be considered, and no charge will be placed on public funds to compensate persons whose cattle were seized while engaged in illegally occupying the lands of others.</P>

The request was not acceded to; and while I am not prepared to initiate the practice of disclosing the particular grounds on which petitions of this nature are rejected or acceded to, I would point out that in this case a period of over two years was allowed to elapse before any appeal was made by the memorialist.  The remission of fines will not be considered where the application is deferred for an unreasonable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>With the consent of the Deputies concerned, I will answer these three questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asked when the Land Commission propose to acquire certain lands in County Clare and County Wicklow. The answer is that at this stage I cannot say.  The Land Commission have already completed all preliminary work in connection with arrears, payment in lieu of rent, the preparation and issuing of new rules and forms under the Land Act, 1923, and have for a considerable time been engaged on purchase work under the new Act.  Already forms of particulars for obtaining the necessary information to lead to acquisition and vesting, have been prepared and issued, and particulars in regard to several hundreds of estates have been lodged in the Land Commission with these forms completed.  Provisional lists of lands to be acquired are appearing weekly in every gazette for the last six months, and will continue to appear in every gazette for the future.  Several estates have been surveyed, and appointed days can be fixed as soon as the time limit for objections expires.  Now that the preliminary work has been done, the purchase work in connection with the new Act can be doubled, and in a few weeks trebled.  I anticipate that by the end of the year appointed days will be fixed for far the greater number of unpurchased tenants of the country, and very large areas of untenanted land will have been acquired and considerable areas divided.  That is the general position. Deputies are, of course, entitled to information as it becomes available, but at this stage I cannot answer as to <Col N="454" /> when particular estates will be dealt with.  I can only say that the Land Commission will take the most urgent cases first, and I am sure that the Deputies concerned will agree that that procedure cannot be departed from and estates taken out of their order of urgency merely because questions are asked about them in the Dáil.</P>

    <P>The civilian doctor who attended him at the time of his death has expressed the opinion that tuberculosis, to which death was due, was contracted on military service.  As, however, a case of <Col N="457" /> this kind does not come within the scope of the Army Pensions Act, it is regretted that it was necessary to inform Mrs. Quinn that no financial provision could be made for her.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the Minister for Home Affairs, I move that this Bill be read a second time.  This matter was debated to a considerable extent last year, and I suppose that most of <Col N="464" /> the Deputies are familiar with the arguments.  We feel that this arrangement in regard to Summer Time is of substantial benefit to large numbers of people in the country, and that it is of particular benefit to towns, and to the dwellers in towns.  For instance, in the City of Dublin, and in some other of our Irish cities, we have very large numbers of the population living under deplorable housing conditions.  We feel that this particular arrangement proposed under the Summer Time Bill enables them, during part of the year, to be out a good deal more in the open-air than they would be if the Bill were not passed.  We think that this is a measure that is good for the health of the community, and that it is, consequently, good in other respects as well. We think that the passing of this Bill is the only way in which you can confer the benefits I have referred to on large numbers of the population.  You cannot confer the same benefits by some sort of a voluntary arrangement, because that would require the cooperation of too many people.  We feel, too, that this Bill will not do any damage to any section in the community, because those who do not require the benefit of this arrangement can easily ignore it.  They need not alter their ordinary lives or make any change, because they can ignore it, whereas the people who would benefit by the arrangement could not bring it about voluntarily.  Most countries have adopted this arrangement, and even in countries where last year there was first a defeat of the Bill, it had afterwards to be brought forward again and adopted.  I do not know whether or not there will be any opposition to the measure, or whether, as it was threshed out very fully previously, the Dáil will be inclined to hold to the opinion that it then held.  I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was passed last year we had the same kind of explanation from the Minister in charge of it, as we have just now listened to from the Minister for Finance. There is one question in connection with the Bill that I would like to ask. It has relation to the hours during which licensed premises may remain <Col N="465" /> open.  The Minister has just told us that the Bill will not be a compulsory measure, that anyone who wishes to avail of the Summer Time regulations can do so, and that those who do not want to make a change in their ordinary lives, will not be compelled to do so.  I would like to know from the Minister if licensed premises will only be allowed to keep open during the hours as set out in this Bill, or can they keep open according to old time.  The Minister also said that this Bill would afford great relief to people living under deplorable housing conditions, and would enable them to get more of the open air.  In my opinion, the majority <Col N="466" /> of the people have too much open air at the present time.</P>

    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government in considering the fiscal problem should have regard not merely to the admittedly restricted view of the matter taken by the Fiscal Inquiry Committee as indicated in their final Report, but should examine the problem in the broadest possible aspect&mdash;due regard being taken of all the factors affecting the general well-being of the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I would like to congratulate the Government on the action which they took when appointing this Fiscal Committee.  I think they did exactly the right thing.  They appointed five independent men, five men who are experts on this fiscal question, many of them men with world-wide reputations, men who have written books on the question of Political Economy that are studied all the world over.  Great exception has been taken to this Committee. I would ask those men who take exception to it whom they would have appointed if the appointment rested with them.  Would they suggest that business men should have been selected to deal with these matters or would they have suggested that farmers should have been selected to consider this fiscal problem?  I think if we want the question decided the proper men to deal with it are experts.  The Government did appoint experts and we have reason to be thankful to them for doing so.  At the same time I would like to congratulate Deputy Milroy on the excellent exposition of the case which he gave and the excellent defence which he made for Protection.  I think those whom he represents in this matter have every reason to be grateful to him for the wonderful defence which he made. At the same time I would say that the attack which he made upon the Fiscal Committee was uncalled for, and the terms of opprobrium which he applied to them were not just and were, to say the least, thankless in the circumstances of the case.  These men devoted their time, their energy and their brains to the making of this Report, and I think it shows great thanklessness on the part of a member of the Government Party to attack them in the manner in which he did.  The only comment I would make on Deputy Milroy's statement&mdash;if he would forgive my saying so&mdash;is that he enshrouded his facts to a certain extent in a curtain of words.  I find reading over his speech that it is rather difficult to get full control of the facts which he adumbrated. Exception has been taken that the Committee did not deal with this matter in its broad sense, that there were many matters they should have taken into <Col N="468" /> account which they did not, while it was stated that they took matters into account which they should not have done.  I think the terms of reference which were laid down for them account for this.  I will quote from the Committee's Report in regard to this.  They state&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Committee has not presumed to suggest or to forecast a Fiscal policy for the country; it has taken its task to be rather that of collecting and analysing facts and presenting them to the best of its ability for the consideration of those with whom the final decision and the shaping of the National policy must rest.  In adopting this course the Committee has strictly conformed to the line of conduct set forth by the President in his statement in the Dáil on the 15th June, 1923.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to read here the statement of the President. I think the Dáil is quite familiar with it.  At the same time, I think it was a mistake that the Committee was confined within rather narrow limits, or if they were not deliberately confined that they should think themselves so confined.  They omitted to take into consideration certain matters which, though not of vital importance, in connection with this inquiry, would at least have absolved them from the blame and the attacks which have been made upon them.  I presume on account of my opening statement some Deputies will think that I am an absolute &ldquo;Free Trader.&rdquo;  Well, I do not think, as a matter of fact, that the term &ldquo;Free Trader&rdquo; or &ldquo;Protectionist&rdquo; applies exactly to this case.  I would say, as conditions are at present in this country, I am what is called a &ldquo;Free Trader,&rdquo; but I do acknowledge that conditions might prevail and might arise in the future when it would be unwise for me to nail my flag or any other flag to the mast of Free Trade.  I am of opinion that, in the conditions which exist in the country at the present time, the policy we are pursuing is the most hopeful one for the future of the country.  My reason for saying that I am a conditional &ldquo;Free Trader&rdquo; is that I believe, under certain conditions, one of which is that agriculture <Col N="469" /> should be in a much more prosperous condition than it is at present, it might be advisable for the nation as a whole to consider the question of protecting certain selected industries.  In connection with that statement I would like to quote from Deputy Johnson's speech in regard to the fiscal policy.  Subject to those conditions already mentioned, I support that statement.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am driven to this conclusion, reluctantly, I admit, that there must be tariffs based upon imports of such a nature as are capable of being produced with a reasonable expectation of success in the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I support that statement only on the condition I mentioned.  The conditions I referred to do not exist in the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of comment and a great deal of adverse criticism on the agricultural condition of the country at present.  Particular stress has been laid on the form which agricultural exports take at the moment.  Deputies referred, in the most slighting terms, to the store cattle, grass-fed beef and similar branches of the industry, insinuating or stating that these exports do not lead to any employment.  I am quite willing to acknowledge that the producing of fat store cattle does not lead to as much employment as certain forms of tillage, but I think it would be wrong that the Dáil should be under the impression that a considerable amount of work is not given in connection with these cattle.  We must remember that store cattle or fat cattle are not always fat cattle or bullocks, as they are generally called.  Those cattle are at one time of their existence, young calves.  Nobody with an elementary knowledge of farming can deny that the rearing of young calves necessitates labour and gives work to the small farmer and his family.  Up to recently it was one of the most remunerative forms of agricultural work.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with store cattle, that they are the finished product of the younger stock, and that although we may use terms of opprobrium in regard to grazing, it is a necessary evil under the present conditions. Were it not for the fattening <Col N="470" /> land we have in Ireland, and which no other country in the world possesses, there would be no market for the store cattle which are reared on the holdings of the small farmers.  Other matters which are to a certain extent slightingly referred to, are: butter, eggs, poultry and bacon.  Surely, any man with the most elementary knowledge of agriculture, must know that those very items are the items which give most employment in the agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>I do not refer to you, Deputy Johnson.  All things indicate that, if we are to develop the agricultural industry, it will be along the lines of greater production of bacon and butter and poultry and eggs.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into details of the employment given in connection with those items.  I am strongly of opinion that the future of agriculture depends upon the extent to which we will develop those matters. Our fiscal policy will also depend on the extent to which they are developed.</P>
      <P>A great deal of emphasis has been laid upon the question of unemployment. It has been stated that unemployment would cease to exist, or would be limited considerably under a Protectionist policy.  I am rather inclined to think that, judging from the published figures, this matter of unemployment has been exaggerated in this country, unless there are a great many unemployed who are not registered.</P>

      <P>The actual percentage is about 1½, and that is not large, as compared with 12 per cent. in England, and large percentages in other countries.  Deputy Milroy, I think, says: &ldquo;One wonders whether unemployment and emigration are phenomena which are peculiar to any food-producing country except Ireland,&rdquo; and he gives as examples, Australia, New Zealand, the Argentine, the United States and Canada.  I maintain that this comparison or analogy is quite unfair.  It is quite out of the question and ridiculous to compare a <Col N="471" /> country of the size of Ireland, with countries like the United States and Canada, which are in themselves continents. These countries have enormous natural resources which have not been developed, and for that reason it would naturally be expected that there would not be so much unemployment in these countries as in Ireland.  At the same time I would like to remind him that the statement is incorrect.  To say that they have no unemployment in the United States is incorrect.  They have had considerable unemployment in the United States.  Three years ago there were between three and four millions unemployed at one period.  In that country, too, it is well known that they are subject to periodic conditions of depression and periods of advance in trade.  During those periods of depression there has been considerable unemployment.  It is well known that in Canada there are periodic conditions of unemployment, and it will be found when enquiries are made that during the winter months there are hundreds of thousands of people walking the main streets of large towns in Canada, out of work.  A great deal of stress has been laid upon the success that Germany is supposed to have made by protection of her industries.  The same arguments apply to Germany as apply to Canada and America.  She has immense natural resources which we have not got; she has coal and iron which only want to be developed, and I think it will be found that there are States in Germany which, despite the Protection Policy, still remain agricultural, that is to say that those States which are most suited for agriculture, confine their attention to the pursuit of agriculture, and of the agricultural industry.  Well, then they have in Germany natural resources which we have not got, such as coal and iron and other minerals of that kind.  They can devote their attention to the development of those minerals.  It is also well known that Germany protected the sugar beet industry and made it a success and got a world monopoly.  We must remember that we have not at all the boundless wealth which Germany had at that time, and that she was able by bounties to the growers of sugar <Col N="472" /> beet to reduce and ruin the cane sugar industry in the West Indies.  She was able to compete with America at her own prices.  To endeavour to do any such thing as that would be for Ireland a foolish policy.  We have not got the monetary resources at our disposal that these countries possess. Deputy Milroy says: &ldquo;Every food producing country except Ireland is protected.&rdquo; I am sure he did not intend to mislead, but I think he must have omitted to make enquiries about food producing countries.  I am not aware that Denmark is Protectionist.  As far as I know the only tariff Denmark has imposed are revenue tariffs, and revenue tariffs are not for protection. And of all those countries in the world, if we are to base our policy upon any country it must be Denmark.  The conditions there most closely approximate to the conditions which obtain in Ireland. New Zealand is not a Protectionist country, or if so, only in a small way, and to a small extent.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEFFERNAN</NameTxt>
      <P>My facts may be wrong, but these are the facts which I have been told.  It is also a country which exports large quantities of agricultural produce.  Now it was stated that Protectionist countries have no emigration problem.  That is not correct. There has been considerable emigration from Germany, Italy and some other Protectionist countries.  Everybody aware of the conditions prevailing in America knows that there are immense numbers of Germans there, and those people emigrated from Germany despite the prosperity we are told was prevailing there, in order to find a home for themselves in a foreign country.  I have already said in regard to the comparison with the United States that it is not reasonable and not just in this case.  If the comparison was made with one of the individual States of the United States, if Ohio or Nebraska were compared with Ireland, it would be more just, and it would be more reasonable.  But comparison with the United States is different.  It is itself a continent; it has within its boundaries all the natural resources which a country requires, and the <Col N="473" /> United States could at any time become absolutely and completely self-contained. That advantage does not exist in Ireland and never will.  We have in Ireland several valuable natural resources, particularly the resources of the fertility of the soil.  But we have not the natural resources which prevail in the States, and we never could become a self-contained country.  If any of those individual States in the United States took it upon herself, if she had the power to do so, to establish a Protectionist policy, the comparison would stand, and it could reasonably be made. I think one of the things that has caused the greatest confusion in this country is that people do not seem to realise the fact that we are now an independent State.  When the matter had previously been discussed, we were part of the United Kingdom, and a Protection policy would be a reasonable one when we were part of the United Kingdom, because at that time a Protectionist policy introduced for England, if it were reasonable and just, should be made to protect agriculture as well as manufactures.  England, being a great importing country of agricultural produce, could protect agriculture, and if such had been the case it would have been a very wise policy for Ireland to be a Protectionist country and to demand protection for her agriculture.  By such means we would obtain enhanced prices.  But now we are cut off from England.  We are an independent country and we have to make our own future, and if we protect agriculture in Ireland we cannot protect it in England and so cannot have protection for our agricultural produce in England.  The result would be that we would have to produce agricultural produce in a protected market and sell it, to a large extent, in a free market in competition with the agricultural countries of the world.  That is a matter to which the least attention has been paid, and it is, in my opinion, at the present moment a vital point in the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of stress has been laid by some Deputies on the advantages which would accrue to this country if, under the system of protection, these <Col N="474" /> enormous trusts and combines would come and establish their industries within the country.  I do not know if the Deputies who advocated this policy have thought the thing out to its final limits.  Have they realised what might happen if every important industry we have got into the hands of foreign combines? Have they realised the amount of money which would be sent out from this country each year in dividends? The Deputy talks about 5 per cent. dividends.  Does he think that those big commercial combines would be content with that?  Very often it is more like a 25 per cent. dividend they would require.  What, for instance, is the dividend of the Imperial Tobacco Company?  In the case of one individual industry, the matter might not be of vital importance, but in the case of numerous industries controlled by foreign combines, it might mean that between five and ten millions would be sent out each year in dividends from the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to call attention to the fact that these dividends would have to be sent away finally in the form of goods.  At the time they might have to be sent in the form of money, either in cash or by cheques, but eventually we would have to export goods.  That would be a bad thing for Ireland.  We would be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water and the wage slaves for English combines.  There would be very little use in securing political freedom if we have to give it away and become economic slaves.  I would like to say a few words in connection with the unemployment problem.  I may say I am largely in sympathy with paragraph 120 of the Report, in which it is stated: &ldquo;An argument frequently urged in favour of protective tariffs is that an increase in the number of persons employed in the protected industries will result.  Assuming that this will be so as regards the protected industries, the immediate effect of the tariffs upon employment will be different, if it be imposed in normal times from that which it will be if imposed during a period of depression.  In the first case, the increased employment in the industries concerned can only be obtained by withdrawing labour either from agriculture or from some other <Col N="475" /> existing industry.  The ultimate as distinct from the immediate effect of this will be not to increase the total amount of employment, but to redistribute the labour power of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me the best we could do would be, by the establishment of protective industries, to give employment to the 39,000 unemployed in this country.</P>
    <P>When these had been used up, if it were possible to use up the full amount of unemployed, they would have to draw upon other industries to supply the extra hands required.  I am not sure if it would be at any time possible to absorb the full number of unemployed. There are unemployable as well as unemployed.  It is well known that there are some who do not wish for employment.  Even allowing that practically the full amount of unemployed would be employed, the number is not very great, and when they would be absorbed other industries would have to be turned to, and workers would have to be taken from them. The only alternative to that would be the immigration of foreign workers.  I do not expect any Deputy is seriously putting forward a proposition that we should be obliged to import workers in order to keep these protected industries going.  Deputies who are so strongly in favour of this protection, and who condemn the findings adduced by the Fiscal Commission, try to make out or believe that protection would not increase the cost of living, and that it would not increase prices and wages. I would refer the Dáil to paragraph 108 of the Committee's Report:&mdash;&ldquo;That a protective tariff will increase the cost of living in proportion to its extent, and especially if it be applied to articles of general consumption, and, in particular, to food, is self evident.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the words of the Fiscal Commission.  With those words I agree, with the exception that I do not quite understand what they mean when they say if it be applied to food, it would increase the cost of living.  I cannot see to what extent protection can be applied to food at the present time.  Our food cannot be protected. <Col N="476" /> They might protect a few of the smaller items, such as tea.  A protective tariff there would be a revenue tariff.  In the Report, further on, it is stated:&mdash;&ldquo;Small reductions of this kind, while they may lower the wholesale prices of the revenue-producing commodities, will hardly be reflected to the same extent, if at all, in the retail prices to the general consumer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a matter which I would strongly emphasise.  Small reductions at the producing source, even if obtainable, would not be reflected in the wholesale or retail prices.  That is a matter which we are unfortunately too conversant with at present.  When reductions are made in the manufacturing or wholesale prices, these reductions do not percolate to the consumer. Take the farming industry, and if there are reductions in the cost price of pigs and other things incidental to agriculture, those reductions do not percolate to the consumer.  Sometimes they never reach the consumer.  We are not at all sure that systems of changing revenue duties from tea and sugar and putting them on to clothing, boots, etc., would enable the public to derive any benefit, worth talking about, in the price of tea or sugar.</P>
    <P>There has been a great clamour for protection, but it has not been proved that this clamour applies to the majority of manufacturers in this country.  A great deal of noise has been made, in my opinion, by a comparatively few and insignificant number of manufacturers in this country.</P>

      <P>They may be British agents.  I would refer now to paragraph 66 in which the Committee state: &ldquo;This rapid survey of the evidence tendered to the Committee suggests certain general reflections.  In spite of the number of witnesses and the great importance of some of the industries which they represented, it would appear nevertheless that the volume of industry which is anxious to obtain a protective tariff is small compared with that which desires no change in the existing system.&rdquo;  Either that is correct or not, and I presume this Committee was set up to report on facts and that this statement is correct, <Col N="477" /> that the volume of industry which is in favour of protection is much more clamorous in proportion to its size than the volume which is content with present affairs.</P>
      <P>I notice the following industries asked for protection in some shape or form: Wooden bedstead manufactures, tanning, fell mongering, agricultural machinery, cycle manufactures, structural steelworks, galvanised hollow ware, furniture making, paper-making, artificial fertilisers, and some others. The woollen industry also asked for Protection.  These industries asked for protective tariffs ranging from 10 per cent. to as high as 75 per cent.  The woollen manufacturers, if I may use the expression, had the cheek to go before the Fiscal Inquiry Committee and say that they wanted a protective tariff as high as 75 per cent.  According to my method of reasoning, if the woollen industry were given a protective tariff of 75 per cent. it would eventually mean that for the clothing we buy we would have to pay an increased price of 75 per cent.</P>

      <P>It is rather difficult to prove statements of this kind, or, indeed, of any kind, which have been made in regard to Protection versus a Free Trade policy.  The question is one that could be dealt with from a hundred different angles and from a hundred different points of view, and I suppose a hundred different proofs could be brought forward to prove a hundred <Col N="478" /> different ideas in connection with the matter.  In support of that I would say that the practical examples existing in other countries will prove that.  I think the Deputy will find that, if he makes inquiries, and doubtless he has already done so.  If he makes inquiries in the United States, Canada, France, or other protective countries, he will find that the cost of clothing in these countries greatly exceeds the cost in a Free Trade country such as England.  He will find it an actual fact that a suit of clothes which costs, say, £5 in England will cost in America or in Canada £10.  The Deputy may say that that is not the result of a protective tariff, but whether it is so or not that is the position in countries which favour a policy of Protection, and we have very good reason to expect that the same position would prevail in this country if we had a protective tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give another example of increased prices caused by protective tariffs.  Canada is a protective country, side by side with another country which also favours a policy of Protection, and in spite of the fact that goods are produced in the United States at a higher cost than in a Free Trade country, still it is well known that the prices which have to be paid for commodities in Canada exceed the prices in the United States almost exactly by the amount of the protective tariff. You find the eastern manufacturers, in most cases, have taken advantage of the protective tariff to increase their prices almost up to the level of the United States price, plus the protective tariff, and allowing a small margin to prevent the importation of the foreign article.  The agriculturists in Western Canada are strongly opposed to a protective policy.  I read in the papers a few days ago that a certain resolution had been passed by the united farmers of Alberta, calling upon the Government to abolish protective tariffs and to return to a Free Trade policy for the country.  These were the conditions existing out there.  The farmer had to pay for his binder a price approximating to about 30 per cent. more than it could be bought for across the border, which was sometimes only a mile away. When he went into a town to buy a suit of clothes he also had to pay from 30 <Col N="479" /> per cent. to 50 per cent. more for the clothes than he could get them at in a shop across the border.  The same applied to boots, to furniture, and to practically everything that the farmer required in his household.  He was in a somewhat similar position to what we are in this country, in this respect, that he had to export his produce, and sell it in an open market where his produce could not be protected, and the result was that the protective industries of Canada were, to a certain extent, parasites upon the agricultural industry, and became established at their expense.</P>
    <P>Great play was made with the suggestion that revenue would not be decreased by the remission of duties on tea and sugar, if these duties were applied to clothing and other articles of that kind.  I think that argument is an apparent fallacy, because if the duties were taken off tea and sugar, and applied to clothing and other matters of that kind, so long as they acted as a revenue-producing tariff they would be worthless, or almost worthless, as a protective tariff.  But as they became more useful or more potent as a protective tariff they would become less useful as a revenue-producing tariff; that is to say, as the home manufacturers gain the benefits which they maintain they will gain by such protection, the revenue on the importation of similar articles would decrease, with the result that the Government would eventually lose almost all the revenue which they had derived from this source hitherto, and would have to turn to some other form to produce revenue.</P>
    <P>Statements have been made by Deputies advocating this protective policy here, and have been made in other places to the effect that protective duties would not injure the export trade of the country.  I notice that Deputy Milroy stated: &ldquo;Those experiences are a flat contradiction to the Free Trade theory that import tariffs will kill the export trade in manufactures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say, if import tariffs do what I say they will do, increase the cost of living, and therefore increase the cost of wages, they will seriously injure, if not altogether destroy, the export industry. <Col N="480" /> They may not kill agriculture, because it is extremely difficult to kill it. Agriculture has the trick of hanging on by the skin of its teeth, and practically it cannot be killed for the simple reason that farmers have no other alternative except to pursue this industry. No matter how low the cost of living, or how the standard of living may be reduced, they have to exist on the farm. If Protection increases the cost of living, and increases wages, it will have a detrimental effect upon the other export industries.  Who can deny that the biscuit-making industry will not be injured by a protective tariff?  It would mean increased wages for the operatives, and how could the owners of the industry be expected to compete with outside industries when they are obliged to pay a higher rate of wages than their competitors?</P>
    <P>I propose giving a quotation from a well-known writer on political economy. The writer is Mr. Harold Cox, the editor of the &ldquo;Edinburgh Review.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this connection I may say that I am not dealing with the question of tariffs at all as applied to Ireland, but I am dealing with them as they apply to England.  This writer says: &ldquo;Any tariff which is imposed to give Protection to the producer for home consumption almost invariably injures the producer for export.&rdquo;  That is a quotation, not from a German professor who lived eighty years ago, but from an English economist living at the present time who should be thoroughly conversant with economic affairs, and his words are not meant to apply to the Irish question at all, and have no reference to it.</P>

      <P>What I say is that the writer's words had no reference to the Irish question at the time they were written, but they have reference to the Irish question to-day. According to some advocates of this policy all the evils which have befallen Ireland during the last 60 or 70 years are due to this lack of Protection, and according to them if we had Protection we would now have an immense population and would be, generally speaking, in a very advanced condition of wealth, culture and other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> Now I do not think that all the evils that have occurred in this country are at all due to the lack of a protective policy.  It must be remembered that amongst the opportunities opened up to the youth of this country in the past century there were the attractions offered by the Great Western Continent which drew to them many of the youth of the country, and even acknowledging that we might have had a much better economic condition of affairs in this country it is doubtful in any circumstances whether we would be able to maintain our full population in Ireland. Deputy Milroy gave instances of the establishment of an industry in a small town in Ireland, and he tried to show us the advantage which this would have upon the agricultural industry. He mentioned the town of Cavan and suggested if a manufacture was set up in Cavan there would be increased demand for agricultural produce there.  I agree that in Cavan there would be an increased demand for agricultural produce, but where would the employees and the operatives come from that caused that increased demand for agricultural produce?  Would they not come from other parts of Ireland? and would not that mean that in some other parts of Ireland the demand had become correspondingly less?  If it does not mean that it means that the standard of life is so low that the ordinary inhabitant does not eat that amount of agricultural produce which a man could eat if he had the means of purchasing those commodities. I do not believe that that condition of affairs exists or that there is any large bulk of our inhabitants going short of the ordinary articles of consumption that they require.  I am speaking generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Milroy very carefully refrained from dealing with the question of the efficiency or the inefficiency of labour, management or otherwise. Apparently that is a thorny question upon which he thinks better not to dwell.  He gave us a comparison between the United States and Germany and other countries, and he said in the United States we have efficient labour and efficient management; in Germany we have efficient management and efficient labour, and <Col N="482" /> also, I believe in India we have inefficient labour and probably efficient management, but he did not mention that in India where there is very inefficient labour I believe the remuneration of the workers is only a very nominal amount.  Deputy Johnson referred to the protection which low wages gave to industry before the war, and that, I believe, is a fact.  The workers had in Ireland lower wages than in outside countries, and it is to a certain extent a reflection upon the efficiency and the ability of Irish manufacturers. Taking into account the disability under which these manufactures are worked, lacking natural resources, lacking coal for their manufactures, which they have in England, lacking cheap power, and other matters of that kind, it does seem to me that if ever Irish industries are to get a chance of prospering and of competing with those outside industries, hampered as they are by these great disadvantages which I have mentioned, that it is not unreasonable to expect that their workers, whether efficient or inefficient, will be willing to accept a wage which will not place the employers at a disadvantage when competing with outside industries.</P>

      <P>The Fiscal Report goes on to refer to certain disabilities which Irish manufactures are subject to.  It classes them under the heading of permanent disabilities and abnormal disabilities.  I am not at all in agreement with that classification. Amongst the permanent disabilities it includes the following: lack of raw material, lack of industrial power, transport difficulties, lack of skilled labour, higher wages, lack of capital, over-rate charges and a variety of requirements lacked by the Irish system in marketing produce.  I do not think it right to include such matters as difficulty of transport and the obtaining of skilled labour and the insufficiency and the lack of capital as amongst permanent disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In time these are disabilities that will be overcome.  I am not at all in favour of that statement.  I think a great many of these difficulties can be <Col N="483" /> overcome if faced and met in the proper spirit.  Industrial power may be a difficult matter to obtain.  It is generally acknowledged that we have not got the coal, or coal of a type suitable for industrial power, but we have immense water power resources. Transport difficulties we have had, and it is to be hoped that the transport difficulties will be improved, and it is earnestly hoped, indeed, that they will disappear altogether.  It is said that we have not got skilled labour in this country.  That may be a fact, but in this regard I believe we have the inherent ability to produce labour as skilled in this country as that of any other country in the world, but owing to the political troubles we have been passing through, and owing to the lack of proper training facilities, our labour is not brought up to that skilled standard which eventually it ought to attain under proper guidance.  I believe capital will be obtained in this country. That is proved by the way in which the Government were able to obtain capital when they floated their loan.  I believe it will be obtainable in Ireland for industrial undertakings, provided those responsible for the capital are satisfied that they will have security, and that they will get a reasonable return for the capital invested in those industries.  Then the Report refers to the abnormal disabilities, which it regards as due to the political conditions. These are abnormal conditions, and I believe they are passing.  It then refers to the dumping and the depreciated currency.  With the matter of dumping I do not intend to deal, because, in my opinion, it is made an excuse for every industry which is not able to pay its way.  The industry says that foreign goods have been dumped here; in reality they are not being dumped; they are sent in and sold at competitive prices, which is not dumping at all.</P>
    <P>As regards depreciated currencies, I acknowledge that in recent years, in countries where currencies have depreciated, they have been able to manufacture goods and to send them to other countries at lower prices than they could be manufactured in those countries where depreciated currencies did <Col N="484" /> not prevail.  We can see the result of such a course, and I cannot believe that that course can possibly be a permanent one.  We can see that those countries which have resorted to the system of bolstering up industries are fast coming to the end of their tether, and will eventually have to make some attempt to stabilise their monetary system.  We see that prevailing in Germany, France, Austria, and other countries.  It is not a course that would be advisable to follow in any country, and it is not a course that could in its nature be permanent in any country.</P>

      <P>Mr. Johnson is very anxious to see all the workers in the country employed in productive work.  He seems to have a strong objection to their being employed in producing enjoyment or recreation for the people of the country.  He speaks about turning Ireland into a circus for foreigners.  That may not be a very estimable idea, but it seems to me, if we are going to cater for tourists, that we must provide amusements for them also, and that the actual work of providing amusements for tourists cannot be called unproductive.  I think it is a mistaken idea to suggest that only the man who is actually engaged in the manufacture of some article&mdash;making boots, making clothing&mdash;is a productive worker.  I am sure the Deputy will admit that the clerk who is engaged in keeping the accounts of an industry is also a productive worker, and that even in certain circumstances the actor who provides amusement for that worker at night is also engaged in a productive occupation.  I think it is misleading, though I do not believe it is intended to be deliberately misleading, to suggest that only the man who is actually engaged in the production of a certain article is a productive worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated in the beginning that my reason for being opposed to the idea of protection at the present moment in Ireland is that we are not in a position to afford the financial strain which it would put upon the country.  I <Col N="485" /> have endeavoured to prove that the eventual cost of protective tariffs would have to be borne by the producing industries, and agriculture being the predominating producing industry in this country and having its finest market in an unprotected country, would, in my opinion, have to bear the expenses of a system of Protection, but I am not so narrow-minded as to say that agriculture should in all conditions maintain that it was not prepared to make a sacrifice that might eventually result in the good of the country in general.  I do say in the present condition of agriculture it is not in a position to have extra burdens placed upon it; in fact it is in the position that if it is to survive it will be necessary that steps be taken to relieve it of some of the intolerable burdens which it now bears.  A day may come when agriculture will be sufficiently remunerative and financially strong that it will be prepared for the sake of the good of the country in general to contribute portion of its profits towards the establishment of certain protected industries.  Even at that I would not suggest that this protection should take the form of indiscriminate bolstering up of every petty industry that thinks it is entitled to protection.  It is possible that it would be advisable to select certain industries for which we have natural capacity and for which we have natural resources, and by means of protective tariffs to bolster up these industries in their infancy and to establish them in a position where they might be able to stand the competition of outside countries.  I think it must be acknowledged that under modern conditions no country of the size of Ireland can be self-contained, and it would be futile and ridiculous, from the economic point of view, to attempt to produce and manufacture all the articles which we require.</P>
    <P>I noticed in reading a newspaper a few days ago that one correspondent had a very bright idea; it was that in order to establish firmly on their feet the manufacturing industries of Ireland we should adopt, for a period of five years, a system of not exporting or not importing, simply to build a wall around our country and refuse to allow any imports to come in or any exports <Col N="486" /> to go out.  That is a very nice idea.  I wonder what would the people of Ireland think of it.  I wonder how they would like to go without the things they have been accustomed to, resorting for five years to the simple life.  That is one of the types of argument which we come across in the Press with regard to this matter.  The correspondent does not think for a moment what has got to be done with the 23 million pounds worth of cattle, the 8 million pounds worth of bacon, the 11 million pounds worth of poultry, and the 6 million pounds worth of butter, which we export each year.  Does he mean to suggest that the consuming capacity of the inhabitants will be so great that wherever we consumed one cow in the past we will consume two in the future, and that wherever we consumed one side of bacon we can in the future consume three?</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that circumstances may arise when, as I said before, agriculture may say it is willing to contribute its portion towards the establishment of certain industries.  Reference has been made to the consumer. I believe that all increased prices eventually fall upon the consumer, and I believe that to all intents and purposes, in this country, the agriculturist, the farmer and his worker, are the consumers that count.</P>
    <P>The other members of the community are able, either by increasing the prices of the articles they handle or by increasing the remuneration which they demand for their work, to force the extra cost upon some other indefinite members of the community, until eventually the cost falls upon the producer for export&mdash;the farmer.  The farmer cannot place this cost upon the shoulders of any other person; he must bear it.  He cannot send his produce across to the English market and say: &ldquo;This has gone up 25 per cent. on account of the increased rates, the increased wages, the increased cost of production, due to Protection.&rdquo;  He may send his produce across and say that, but it will not get him a halfpenny more in a foreign market.  For that reason I maintain that all this increased cost falls upon the industry which produces for export.  That, in the main, is the farming industry in <Col N="487" /> this country, and if Protection is to be established it will have to be established at the expense of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Such being the case, I would suggest that the Government should have this matter considered in all its phases, and every possible opportunity should be given for discussion.  They should not allow themselves to be stampeded, as it is evident efforts are being made at the present time to stampede the country into a protectionist policy.  A cool and a cautious examination of every phase of the problem should take place, and we should not be rushed to any conclusions.  Speaking for myself, and on behalf of certain members of the agricultural community, I would say that if agriculture can be placed in a position where it is free and able to do its part in the establishment of other industries, we will not stand back, and we will not grudge the call upon our purse.  But that day has not yet come.  The agricultural industry is in a dire condition.  It never has been worse, and I believe that the energies of the country and the energies of the Government should be devoted to establishing and maintaining this industry upon the foundation that is necessary. If we attempt to build up a superstructure of protective industries upon a rotten and fragile base, we will find that that base will crumble, and bring down with it the superstructure we have raised.  In connection with the industry of agriculture, there are many possibilities for enlargement, and for additional employment.  I believe we should rather concentrate upon improving this industry, and upon building up in connection with it the numerous subsidiary industries which are possible.  Agriculture is our greatest natural resource, and if we would attempt to emulate the example of other countries, I think we could for a considerable time absorb our growing population, and find employment for them in agriculture and its subsidiary branches.</P>

      <P>It is always a pleasure to listen to the fervid oratory of the Deputy from Cavan, even when he propounds such a worn-out doctrine as that <Col N="488" /> of Protection.  Realising the weakness of his arguments and the hopelessness of his advocacy, Deputy Milroy tried to throw a glamour over the system&mdash;in fact to delude the members of the Dáil by his display of eloquence, in which he ranged the world over, trying to find proofs to aid him in the imposition of a worn-out, medieval theory on the long-suffering people of this country.  Eventually, he wound up by asking the Dáil to admire the practices of the, no doubt, progressive and law-abiding Republics of Central America, and the West Indies, and the West Coast of Africa.  The Commissioners' estimate of the capacity of the business-lords in the Saorstát is not very flattering.  But was not the estimate justified by the attempt of the Irish manufacturers to prove that a tariff could be imposed and the price of labour crushed down at the same time? Arthur Griffith has been quoted. Arthur Griffith's opinion was that Irish manufacturers should get a preference, everything else being equal.  Under Protection I would remind members of the Dáil that rich men become richer quickly, and all at the expense of the community, and that there is nothing surer under the sun than that the protected pay for the protection.  What constitutes the price of an article?  It is the original price paid for the article, plus the tariff, and it is upon this basis that all the charges are calculated. Can any man prove to me that a manufacturer or merchant can sell any article more cheaply simply because he pays more dearly for it?  It is quite impossible.  The real contention of the manufacturer is that the community should extend to them protection and at the same time that they should pay to the workman 2d. in order to buy a 4d. loaf.  In Free Trade countries a workman can procure the products of other countries at a cheap rate.  Often they may be cheaper than the consumer could buy them in the country of manufacture. You can buy butter in London, Dublin, Glasgow, or Liverpool, more cheaply than you can buy it in Paris.  The United States has been quoted, but the United States is a world in itself, and there is Free Trade between the States of the United <Col N="489" /> States.  They have a population of over 150 million, and therefore the comparison is not just.  Notwithstanding that they have tariffs in the United States on flax and linen, they are not able to produce linen equal to that manufactured in Ireland.  Every country can produce some special article better than any other country. Notwithstanding Protection, America cannot produce shipping economically, nor can France.  It is asked why the tariff is not taken off tea.  The Revenue Commissioners would tell you that tea is such a very extensive article of consumption in Great Britain and Ireland that it is very much cheaper and more convenient to collect the tax from tea than anything else.  You must remember that tea is not an article of consumption in other countries.  I remember when I used to go to Paris there were only three tea shops in the whole of the city.  I believe since the war there are considerably more. Scandinavian countries have been quoted as examples of Protection.  But is it really Protection that makes Scandinavian countries prosperous? It is not.  It is the invisible imports that make Norway prosperous.  It is the timber trade, the iron trade and the engineering trade&mdash;all export trades&mdash; that make Sweden prosperous.  It is the engineering trade and the despised professor, particularly the agricultural-research professor, that have made Denmark prosperous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dumping is a very convenient word, but people never consider what real dumping is.  Real dumping is the selling of an article in another place, maybe in another country, at less price than it takes to produce it.  Thus, if an article takes 50s. to produce in Manchester, and was brought here and sold for 30s., well that is real dumping.  The dumping for which the Safeguarding of Industries Act was passed in order to protect certain manufactures is not real dumping at all.  It is a state of trade that arises really from the abnormal condition of the Exchange. Now, real dumping will not continue for any length of time.  Real dumping will take place when the manufacturer has produced more than he should produce, and in a falling market, tries to <Col N="490" /> sell it for anything he gets outside his own door or in another country.</P>
    <P>The exodus from Australia has been quoted, and the imposition of the tariff some years after the exodus, as an example of the revival from protection. What brought about the exodus in Australia was the working out of the gold diggings.  That was what brought about the exodus.  After some time, when those great big mining companies came into being and stimulated other works, the people flocked back again. That is really what made the industries prosper there.  Now it has been argued that under Protection new firms will come to Ireland.  That is what we might expect.  Firms will not pay a high tariff when they can make the goods in the country.  What will be the result?  All the small Irish firms in the same industry will join the combine, or else be wiped out, and the whole trade will go to the new firms, who will all be foreign firms.  Germany has been quoted as to the effects of Protection. Was it Protection that made Germany prosperous?  It was no such thing.  It was the despised Professor that made Germany prosper.  It was the hard work and research of the German Professor which, combined with the skill of the business-man, made Germany prosperous.  Protection had nothing whatever to do with it.  It was the Professor brought about prosperity, he and the business-man.  I do not think that I can say very much more on the subject.  I have said all I wanted to say in the matter.  But I would like those who argue about Protection to look to those Protected countries in Europe rather than to the United States.  We are more connected with Europe than with the United States.  Now, if we look to Europe, is the standard of living better in Protected countries or in Free Trade countries? No, the argument is against Protection, because food and accommodation and living are cheaper in the Free Trade countries.  The workingman buys his food cheaper.  In a Protected country everything is dearer. The food you eat, the clothes you wear, everything is dearer in the Protected countries, and even the celebrated boot factory that is to be established in <Col N="491" /> Cavan, and which is to make of Cavan a new El Dorado, would not convince me or anyone that Protection is necessary in this country.</P>

      <P>I had not the advantage of listening to this debate which is being concluded, I hope, this evening.  Perhaps that may be too optimistic.  I read most of the debate, and while I join with other Deputies who congratulated Deputy Milroy on his industry, I wish to deprecate the unjustifiable and ill-tempered references to the distinguished men who are members of the Fiscal Committee.  These references were absolutely uncalled for, and in the circumstances just a little bit foolish. Some of the Committee were economists of European reputation, and one of them happens to be the greatest living authority, judging by his published works on Irish Economic History.  So that the mere reference to Professors and innuendoes of that sort, and adjectives like malignant and sinister, get us nowhere, and in the circumstances of the case are merely foolish.  I thought that at this hour of the day, with the experience of other countries and other times at our disposal, that we would really be saved from a debate on such an unreal issue as Protection on one side, and Free Trade on the other.  That issue is absolutely unreal. There is no use blaming Cobden, and there is no use praising List.  There are absolutely no Cobdenites now, and there is only one List or one Chamberlain to-day, and that seems to be Deputy Milroy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>America is a country that has prospered under Protection and without Free Trade&mdash;prospered industrially. England is a country that has prospered with Free Trade and without Protection.  That is really the position put in the simplest way.  The real fact of the matter is that you can only discuss this question of Protection or Free Trade by reference to a particular tax, by reference to a particular tariff on a particular article of import in the particular country at a particular time and taking all the particular circumstances into account.  That is the only intelligent way we could discuss it.  I did think that in the year 1924, with experience at our disposal, that we would have realised that, and that we would be saved from the hot argument and the hot air and the useless argument of such an unreal issue as Protection and Free Trade.  Now, I want to repeat that.  Deputy Johnson put the point in another way.  He said the business of a statesman or a politician is to do the best thing possible for his country.  It means this&mdash;I do not profess to quote his exact words&mdash; to do the best for a given country in given circumstances at a given time.  I agree.  In other words, you can only discuss references to Free Trade by a concrete example.  If you want to indulge in generalities, there are one or two general principles that we can all agree on.  The first is the resolution, or, I should say rather, the latter part of the resolution.  In fact, really the whole of the resolution, &ldquo;and examine the problem in the broadest possible aspect, due regard being taken of all the factors affecting the general well-being of the Saorstát.&rdquo;  We all agree to that; we are all Cobdenites, and we are all Lists, and we are all Protectionists and Free Traders for the purpose of that resolution.  That is a generality with which we all can agree.  I doubt if there is a single Deputy in the Dáil who will <Col N="493" /> venture to disagree with that pious aspiration of Deputy Milroy's.  The second general principle affects the other side&mdash;perhaps it follows from the first.  I stated quite simply that it is not the business of any Government or State to protect inefficiency.  These are the only two principles left unchallenged at this hour of the day in connection with Free Trade or Tariff Reform. Very well, then, let us come to the question as far as we can and as it affects Ireland in the present circumstances.</P>
      <P>Now, the first fact which we must remember in considering whether we will impose a tariff on any article of import or protect any existing industries or protect the birth of any possible potential industry in the country, is that agriculture is our main industry, that in fact for all practical purposes if you take beer and whiskey which are partly agricultural products and if you include them just for the sake of using one, or to cover both, it is the only industry worth talking about.  In fact it is so important at the present moment, and in the existing circumstances, that every other consideration fades into comparative insignificance.  That is the first fact. I wonder if any Deputy or any Party will deny that.  What are the figures? They are these&mdash;68 per cent. of the exports of the Free State are agricultural products; 13 per cent. of the exports of the Free State are beer, whiskey and tobacco.  Take these figures.  Am I overstating the case when I say, therefore, that over 75 per cent. of the exports of the Free State are agricultural products?  If over 75 per cent. of the exports are agricultural products am I right when I say that certainly 80 per cent. of the wealth of the country is agricultural products?</P>

It is one of those factors which Deputy Milroy wishes us to take into account, due regard being taken of all the factors affecting the general well-being of the Free State.  That factor is of considerable importance.  What produces 80 per cent. of the wealth of the country is a thing which we should take seriously into account.</P>
      <P>That is the first factor.  What is the second?  The particular industry to which I am referring produces 80 per cent. of the wealth of the country, under conditions which are seriously uneconomic. That is a matter which the Government, the Farmers' Party, and the Labour Party, and, in fact, everybody must take seriously.  That industry is producing under conditions which are seriously uneconomic.</P>

      <P>I intended to tell the Deputy, and I am glad he asked the question.  I might be charged with repeating what I said here often.  The Deputy asked me why.  Well, the matter is simple.  I will try and state it in terms which you can consider with unanimity, by putting the figures against <Col N="495" /> myself.  The cost of living figure is 80 per cent. over pre-war.  That is to say, what the farmer has to buy in order to live, is 80 per cent. over pre-war in price.  Deputy Johnson shakes his head.  I quite agree that it is a little higher than the ordinary cost of living figure, but I do not want to enter into contentious details which have nothing to do with the real point.  I can easily prove it from records kept by the Department of Agriculture.  I wanted to state a figure which would be non-contentious. I did not inquire what the cost of living figure for the last three weeks was; it may have fallen to 79 per cent, but I am quite sure I will not be taken up on a point like that.  A round figure like 80 per cent. is easier to deal with.</P>
      <P>What the farmer has to buy in order to live costs 80 per cent. over pre-war. What the farmer has to pay in order to produce&mdash;I want to put the case absolutely against myself&mdash;is between 80 and 100 per cent.  It is not lower than 80 on the average, and probably not higher than 100.  Perhaps 80 per cent. would be an under statement?  What is the index figure for the price which the farmer receives for his produce?  I will put it at 40 per cent.  That is the maximum.  I hope that answers Deputy Davin.  He may not agree with me, but I call it producing under absolutely uneconomic conditions.  The wealth that pays the lawyer, shopkeeper, doctor, journalist, politician, and all the rest, is being produced to the extent of 80 per cent. under conditions like that.  That is the present economic condition of this country, and these are hard facts.  Do not let us have any adjectives about it.  If anybody wants to deny those facts let him produce figures.</P>

    <P>When we are discussing a very important question like a change of the whole fiscal policy of our country we should, at least, if we are worthy of the name of a Parliament, take cognisance of a fact of that kind.  I make no apology for referring to it.  It is one of the factors that must be taken into account, and it is certainly one of the factors which Deputy Milroy wishes to have due regard to.  Deputy Milroy talked about pastoral conditions.  I <Col N="496" /> thought I was reading Keats.  He talks about a land of graziers, of the shepherds and shepherdesses playing under the trees in a sort of Arcadia.  It was suggested by Deputy Milroy and Deputy Sears that not only did they wish to protect the industry, but they wish to protect the agriculturist. We are at one there, for so do I.  Deputy Milroy's speech was in very general terms.  His suggestion, undoubtedly, was that if we adopted a comprehensive system of protection, this country would develop from being what it is at the present moment, at least, according to him, and I think Deputy Johnson made a somewhat similar suggestion, that the country will turn from being a pastoral country into a country where you will have tillage, industry, with every man working his own land, turning out his own grain and roots and vegetables&mdash;in fact, that you will change it from a pastoral country to a tillage country. That was the suggestion, that was what was to result from a comprehensive system of protection.  Deputy Johnson made much the same point.  He asked what was the article we could produce more efficiently, more satisfactorily, more cheaply in comparison with similar articles from any other country, and he said the history of the country supplies the answer.  Store cattle and grass-fed beef.  And his conclusion is that our energies as a nation should be directed to producing in increased quantities that which we can produce most efficiently, more satisfactorily, more cheaply namely, store cattle and grass-fed beef.  The suggestion is that that is what free trade has done and will continue to do, and that if you adopt Protection you will have the opposite.</P>
    <P>It is tillage that is suggested in Deputy Milroy's speech and Deputy Sears' speeches.  They never made the slightest attempt to explain how a comprehensive system of protection is going to increase tillage.  That is the dilemma which Deputy Johnson put up, too, but it is a false dilemma.  The suggestion is that our most efficient farmer is raising all stores and grass-fed beef.  He is not.  That is not a fact, and it is not the most efficient aspect of farming. Deputy Johnson's premise is false, and, <Col N="497" /> therefore, his conclusion is no good. It is not a fact, and it is not efficient farming by itself.  Every farmer knows that, and, therefore, any inferences that he draws from that statement are not good.  The raising of grass-fed beef though an extremely important part of the industry, is at present small&mdash;it is a by-product of the great dairy industry.  Anyone who knows anything about farming knows that, and as the dairy industry gets more and more efficient, as I hope it will, the less stores and the less grass-fed beef you will have in the country. So that dilemma is unreal; it means nothing; it is based upon a false premise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, certainly.  Let us not be at cross purposes.  My statement is that the immediate effect of a comprehensive system of protection would lead to an increase in prices.  I wonder does Deputy Milroy deny that. He interrupted me a good many times, but he did not deny that.  Of course, it is axiomatic.  After all, why do existing industries want Protection? Because they cannot sell at the same price as their competitors, and they want to be put in a position to sell at a little higher price; that is all that there is in it.  But remember, I say the immediate effect, I do not say that ultimately it may not adjust itself.  That may be, and it depends upon efficiency, hard work, and upon the intelligence of the people in the industries that are protected; but we need not go into that for a moment.  It is quite possible that ultimately things may adjust themselves; indeed, not only is it possible, but with anything like efficiency, it is probable, and that you will get your goods at the same price in a protected <Col N="498" /> country.  That is, after all, a first principle of the question.  But I am saying first that the immediate effect of Protection would mean an increase of prices, and that to say a comprehensive system of Protection would mean an increase in prices is simply axiomatic. When I say &ldquo;immediate and ultimate,&rdquo; I am not thinking of a time far ahead.  I am really only thinking of this year and next year, and these are the vital years from the point of view of the agricultural industry which is producing 80 per cent. of the wealth of the country and under the conditions that I explained.  Now anybody interested in agriculture when asked: &ldquo;Do we wish for a comprehensive system of Protection,&rdquo; can only have one answer, and that is that &ldquo;We do not.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HOGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has put the point.  It would be necessary to read the whole speech.  Deputy Milroy suggested that Ireland was the fruitful mother of flocks and herds, and that was because of Free Trade, and he was right.  We are not now going into past history.  He was right that it was because of the policy since the Union, but that is no good to us to-day.  He also talked of the necessity for increased tillage and giving more work.  Let him contradict me if I am wrong there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not straining the case very far when I say that his whole suggestion was that if we could keep out the foreign feeding stuffs, fertilizers and foreign machinery, that it would lead to an increase in tillage in this country.  I wish to make this point clear.  If you put an import duty upon feeding stuffs and place a comprehensive duty on fertilizers and agricultural <Col N="500" /> machinery you will increase their price.  You must increase their price but it may be only for a year or two, but these are the critical two years.  Are you seriously now telling the farmers of Ireland that they are to pay higher over-head charges for the next two years, and if you are, then what are you going to give them in exchange?  These are factors you must take into account and these are factors referred to in that resolution which we are asked to vote for.</P>
    <P>Now, the fact is that the sudden adoption of a comprehensive system of tariffs would put the farmers out of tillage.  The dairy farmer, who is a mixed farmer, feeds his stock on a certain amount of home-grown feeding, and a certain amount of foreign food, and if you tell him suddenly he will get no more foreign food because of the increased price, I tell you that with the conditions he will find himself burdened; if he has to pay a further high price for his over-head charges I know what he will do, and I know what I would do.  If the prices for the farmers are made higher without any countervailing advantage, he will simply have to sell out, sell his cattle and go into grass, and he would simply have to struggle along until good times come again, and incur as few over-head charges as possible.  None of us wants to see that.</P>
    <P>This is not a debate on agricultural policy.  If such measures were proposed to be put into operation without the intelligent co-operation of the farmers of the country we would not be able to avoid driving them out of tillage. That will be the effect on agriculture, and I am merely examining the specific remedy for agricultural depression at the moment and the specific proposed by Deputy Milroy and agreed to by other Deputies.  The fact is that the simple position at the moment, without going to America or Nigeria, or any other country for drawing analogies, without examining the writings of Frederick List or Cobden, or the Manchester School, or any of the various authorities&mdash;the fact is that we could not at the present moment adopt any policy which would seriously interfere and injuriously affect the present <Col N="501" /> overhead charges and other charges in connection with agriculture.  We could not do anything which would injure agriculture.  I am not saying for a moment that it may not be possible, even now, at this stage of our affairs, to select a system of protective tariffs which will help to develop certain industries in this country without seriously affecting the position of the farmer or affecting the position of the farmer to any extent.  I think it can be done, and I hope it can be done. Everyone admits the necessity of a policy aiming at the absorption of the increasing population and the population which is bound to increase in this country.  Everyone admits that the national economy at the present moment is lopsided, and that it is necessary to develop the industrial side.  We all admit that, and, as I said, I believe it is quite possible to make a beginning now, but we must be very careful, and it must be made with full realisation of the fact that the next year or the next two years will be the critical years for the industry which produces practically the whole of the national wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>No policy, aimed at developing a few industries which do not exist in the country at the present moment, can be allowed by any sensible men to seriously affect the position of the one great industry which we have. That is my position in the matter. Speaking from the point of view purely of the agriculturist, I do not believe that the intelligent farmer in this country is unaware of the possibilities of gradually developing an alternative market to one or other of the various markets which he has at the present moment.  I believe that the farmers of the country hope to see the industrial side of the country developed.  I believe they appreciate the advantages to themselves, apart altogether from the question of unemployment, of having the industrial side fully developed. But safety first.  We must lay our foundations absolutely securely first, and the foundation of this State at the present moment is agriculture.  Agriculture must be placed on a firm and unassailable foundation before we indulge in any experiments.  I say all that, while fully conscious that even at <Col N="502" /> the moment we can make a beginning. We can pick out articles, even articles of food&mdash;I do not want to go into details&mdash;we can pick out articles which could be protected, which would do a good turn to Irish industries, which would do good for the unemployed, and which would not affect agriculture. But we must proceed slowly.  It is only when our policy, with the co-operation of the farmers of the country, has placed agriculture in a somewhat better position than it is now, that we can afford to take any risks in that direction, and only then.  As I said, this resolution itself is quite innocuous. We can all agree with it, and personally I propose to vote for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose, in the very few observations I have to make on this motion, to say anything that would be calculated to rush the Government into the sudden adoption of a comprehensive policy of Protection. That was rather insinuated in the statements that were made by Deputy Heffernan.  I do not think that the statement that was made by Deputy Johnson had that desire behind it.  As regards the statement that has been made by Deputy Johnson, I wish to say that I am in complete and thorough agreement with it.  President Cosgrave, on the 15th June last, in dealing with the setting up of this Fiscal Committee, stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the facts and not the policy which the Committee is intended to determine.  Every proposition that is advanced will be examined solely with a view to ascertain and to inform the community as to all the facts.  The Committee is not expected to advocate policy.  That will be a matter for the people and the Government when they have the facts before them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that no one from the Government Benches who has yet spoken has given us all the facts, which I think it is the duty of the Government to give before they ask this Dáil to come to a definite conclusion with regard to this question of Protection.  We have had an Imperial Conference during the last six or seven months.  It was attended by five or six Ministers, and by two ordinary members of this Dáil.  It is <Col N="503" /> strange to say, and I think everybody will agree if they go over the names of these Ministers and members who attended that conference, that not one of the Ministers who represented the Free State, or not one of the ordinary members, or not one of the officials who, of course, cannot speak here, has yet made any statement with regard to the proposals which are stated to have been approved of at that conference.  I read during the week a statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the recent debate in the British House which ended in the funeral of the Tory Government.  Speaking of this question of Imperial preference he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The country rejected our proposals, not because they objected to Protection&mdash;I have found no one who objected to Protection, and certainly no Labour man&mdash;but because they were afraid that with Protection there would come dearer prices, and because they had not had time to assimilate the truth that in every other country in the world where Protection is in force the results they feared have not, in fact, taken place. I wish to say a few words on the question of Imperial preference, which, it is true, does not affect the question of employment to-day, and perhaps will affect it but little tomorrow or next year, but some time in the future, and maybe not in the very distant future, is going to have a profound effect upon the state of trade and employment in this country.  I want to ask Mr. Thomas, if he assumes office, not hastily to dismiss proposals which have nothing whatever to do with the general question of a general tariff, but which were arrived at after discussion with representatives of the Dominions, in full agreement with them, and with their full and enthusiastic approval. I ask him not to reject these proposals out of any pedantic theories.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I contend what has taken place at that Imperial Conference at which our Ministry was represented has some bearing upon the matter which is being discussed here to-day.  I had the opportunity of listening to the Prime Minister on last Monday night when <Col N="504" /> he emphasised the statement in a manner which made me feel that there was some form of protection discussed at that Imperial conference, and that it was as a result of the discussion, and as a result of the decisions which were arrived at there, with the approval of our Ministers, and those who represented us at the conference, that the British Government declared a dissolution and went to the country.  For that reason, and for other reasons, we are entitled, before this debate comes to a close, to have a statement from some representative of the Ministry as to what these proposals were, or as to what the decisions were that were arrived at.  I do not intend to go into the general question of Protection or Free Trade.  If I followed rightly the statement that has been made by Deputy Milroy, in the very eloquent address that he delivered to the Dáil, I read into it something the late Arthur Griffith stood for.  I felt after listening to him for two-and-three-quarter hours that I could describe him as a faithful and ardent disciple of the late President Arthur Griffith.</P>
    <P>One has to look back over the struggle for freedom that has taken place in this country to try and interpret for himself what was the real meaning of the people in fighting for political freedom.  They were not altogether led away in their enthusiasm for either the Home Rule Bill of 1914 or the Republican policy as against it at the moment.  What mattered was not the label that was going to be tied on to the system of political freedom. When a very big section of the people of this country thought fit, and rightly thought fit, to oppose the milk and water Home Rule Bill of 1914, it was because they believed that they had not, within the terms of that Bill, the freedom which they hoped to have, and which they believed they should have in order to develop the industries of this country.  That was their real reason in opposing the Home Rule Bill of 1914.  Having, therefore, fought for, and having lost many lives to get a greater freedom through the Treaty, I ask you, is it the position of the present Government, or does it believe that the Free State, having, by its very <Col N="505" /> name, given us all the political freedom we desire, that it should not use that freedom in order to develop the industries of this country, wherever it may be thought fit to do so, in certain accidental circumstances?</P>

      <P>The Fiscal Committee set up to deal with this matter were, by their terms of reference, prevented from dealing with it from the point of view of policy&mdash; and perhaps rightly so.  Deputy Egan, in speaking on this question the other day, gave all the reasons it was possible for him to give against the adoption of a policy of Protection, but he told the Dáil in the end&mdash;to the surprise, I think, of some of us&mdash;that although he gave those reasons in a long speech against Protection, he had an open mind on the whole matter.  That is not exactly the attitude adopted by the Minister for Agriculture, though having heard the Minister, I think we might describe Deputy Egan's speech as being on the same lines as the speech to which we have just listened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>My real object in rising was to deal with a clause in the Report concerning an industry which I believe has made a case for Protection. I refer to the furniture industry. My reason for bringing the matter up at the moment is, that an old Irish furniture industry, in existence for years in a big town in the constituency I happen to represent, has been actually crushed out of existence by dumping from the other side.  We have an industry which gave employment to from 380 to 450 workers, at present closed down, and the workers trying to live on the dole.  Clause 45 in the Report states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two witnesses were examined on behalf of the Irish Furniture Manufacturers' Association.  It appeared from the evidence of these <Col N="506" /> witnesses that the furniture-making industry is at present in an extremely depressed condition; six large firms have closed down in the last few years and the surviving firms are all suffering from depressed trade.  The cause of this state of affairs is said to be the competition of the English furniture manufacturers, who produce under more favourable conditions, including large scale factories and a supply of hereditary skilled labour.  These English manufacturers are alleged to have &ldquo;dumped&rdquo; extensively in Ireland in the last two years.  In contrast to his competitors the Irish manufacturer labours under the disadvantage of a restricted market, a lack of skilled labour, and high railway rates.  Complaint was also made of the exportation of unmanufactured Irish timber.  These witnesses suggested a duty of thirty-three and one-third per cent. on imported furniture, and believed that the imposition of such a duty would not raise the price of the Irish article.</P>
    <P>I have made up my mind definitely, after listening to a deputation of the employers and the workers, and afterwards to a deputation of the same kind which interviewed the responsible Minister, or his representative, on this question, that a case has been made for some kind of Protection in that particular industry.  We have heard the argument from many of those who have spoken that Protection for this industry, as well as for other industries, would mean an increase in the prices of the articles produced.  I contend&mdash; and my main reason is the evidence submitted by the representatives of this trade to the Fiscal Committee&mdash; that that does not arise and would not happen in this particular case, particularly in view of the very definite assurance given by the Chairman of the Furniture Manufacturers' Association. We have been told also that the question of wages entered into the argument, and that it is as a result of high wages in this, as in other industries, that we are unable to compete with those who are alleged to be dumping this particular class of furniture. It is rather strange that, in summarising <Col N="507" /> the evidence on this particular matter, the Fiscal Committee did not give the actual facts, as stated, in regard to the question of wages.  I can scarcely imagine their reason for not doing so, because I think it was their duty to present the facts in this, as well as in every other case, as they were presented to them.  They take the wages in this particular industry for Dublin and Cork, when, as everybody knows, the principal firms engaged in this industry, trying to keep their heads above water, do not come from either Dublin or Cork.  I cannot understand why the Fiscal Committee should ignore the true facts as given them in the evidence submitted at the Inquiry.  On the subject of wages, I quote from the verbatim report of the evidence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The wages are the same as paid in England?&mdash;Taking an average the wages are very much the same, but it is very hard to say they are the same because you have 1/9 in Liverpool and 1/10 in Dublin.  In Richill, which I do not think comes into the Free State, they are only getting 10d. an hour.  There is nothing in England at 10d. an hour.  We (in Edenderry) are only paying 1/5. That is the same as the High Wycombe rate which I insisted upon.</P>
    <P>I think the Fiscal Committee ought not to have ignored statements of that kind, and led Deputies to believe that wages in all parts of the country were the same in this industry as in Cork and Dublin, being the only figures quoted.  I have tried, therefore, to disabuse the minds of any Deputies of the idea that the absolute failure of this industry, as it is likely to be, is due to the high wages alleged to exist here. The real position is that in the furniture business you have long-established firms in places like High Wycombe equipped with up-to-date plant and machinery, and able to turn out a particular class of furniture in mass production. At present they are able to manufacture 100 suites of furniture, sell 50 of them in England at a fair profit, and dump the remaining 50 in Ireland, to be sold at a lesser price than they <Col N="508" /> sell them in England.  They are doing that at the moment in order that it may destroy what appears to me to be an industry that is going down.  Having destroyed it, and got a monopoly of the Irish market, they will be able to make their own price.  Dealing with the question of the cost of articles and question of dumping, I quote further from the report of evidence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Could you give us specific figures or price lists?&mdash;I think we could if you require them.  I came on an instance yesterday of a London-made Sheraton suite selling in Dublin, carriage paid, for £14.  The nearest Free State price would be £24, but I am told that in England they have to pay £20 for that same suite.</P>
    <P>That notwithstanding the fact that the cost of labour is higher there than it is in Ireland!  I ask the Minister to take these facts, which were submitted at the Inquiry, into consideration, and to say whether a case has not been made for protection in this particular industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heffernan, referring to the question of Protection, stated that if Protection was adopted as a general policy it would be likely to force manufacturers into this country, with the result that five to ten million pounds&mdash;I think these were the figures&mdash;would go out of the country every year in dividends. I would far prefer to see five to ten million pounds going out in dividends than to see a whole lot of the money that we have to pay for the article going out without leaving any of it in circulation in the country.  I think that position does exist to a certain extent in connection with the tobacco industry.  We have, as a result of the duty that was imposed on cigarettes from the 1st April last, several firms&mdash;Players, and Wills, and others&mdash;coming into Dublin and setting up factories, and setting them up not, I suppose, for the purpose of manufacturing cigarettes for pleasure. I dare say they will get more than pleasure out of the work in which they will be engaged here in the future.  If that is one of the results, at any rate it will give employment to from 300 to 3,000 workers, at from £3 to £5 per week, with the result that whatever is paid out in wages in the Free State comes <Col N="509" /> into circulation and everybody has a whack out of it.  Take that as against as at present, sending all the money out of the country so as to enable more Englishmen to be employed in that country.  I am influenced in my attitude by my wish or desire to keep as much of the wealth of the nation in circulation within the Free State so that this State in its infancy will be enabled to build itself up on a most permanent and solid foundation.  Deputy MacBride said that the late President Arthur Griffith was in favour of a preference for Irish goods, all other things being equal.  I think that there can be no such thing as a quality in this matter.</P>
    <P>Everybody who knows anything of the nature of Irish industry will agree that things are not equal in as far as we have not the same machinery, nor plant, nor business methods of management, nor experience at our disposal as they have in England for generations. I think what he meant was when we in Ireland are asked to buy a certain article we should buy an Irish article, provided that the price and other things were equal.  Now, with regard to the particular question to which I have referred, I do not think that the putting of a protective tariff on furniture that has been admitted into the country would increase the cost of living. We have the duty that was imposed upon motor cars since the 1st April last, and surely there is no one in An Dáil will contend that that has any considerable effect generally on the cost of living.  It may have had an effect upon the cost of high living of people who are in the habit of buying motor cars, and who have had the pleasure of using them.  But so far as the general body of workers are concerned, so far as the masses of the people are concerned, it has not had, so far as I know, any effect in increasing the cost of living.  People who claim, and I think they have a right to claim, that they have a right to protection, do claim that they wanted it for a limited period and for a good reason.  They say that a particular industry has never arrived at the stage which would enable it to have a lot of money put into it by the owners in order to develop it properly.  That refers particularly to the furniture industry. <Col N="510" /> It has been claimed that if they got protection for the limited period of two years they would be able to compete on fair terms which they did not have up to this in so far as they would be able to have capital to put into their business, and lay down new plant.  At the end of that period they would be able to compete with all comers.  In the furniture industry it is stated that £1,000,000 worth of furniture is dumped into this country every year.  There is supposed to be £2,000,000 purchased within the country.</P>
    <P>If the Government's proposals as to housing are carried out, the result will be that thousands and thousands of houses will be provided within the next few years. People who are now living in flats and tenements will be moving into houses, and they will be buying furniture, and I say, therefore, that this is a very appropriate time for the Government to give protection to this particular industry. The question of skilled labour has been also referred to.  I am informed that in the case of the furniture trade two out of every three skilled workers are now walking the streets of the town idle, or else they leave and go to England or elsewhere and find work.  So that there is no lack at the present time of skilled labour in that direction.  It is also argued by the Fiscal Committee that by giving protection to certain industries they would be taking labour from the agricultural section of the community.  I think there is enough unemployed efficient unskilled labour in Ireland at the present time to put into any industry without interfering with the people who are employed in agricultural labour, so that that argument falls to the ground so far as Ireland is concerned.  With the development of agriculture, and the splitting up of the big ranches which has been foreshadowed this evening by the Minister for Agriculture, there would be room for the development of industry keeping pace with the development in the splitting up of the lands. In view of that, the question of protection for some industries should be considered. As I stated in the beginning of my observations on this matter, I intended to be very brief, because I feel <Col N="511" /> after listening to the statement of Deputy Johnson I can thoroughly agree with everything he has said.  I merely rose in the debate to put before the responsible Minister a case which I believe has been made out for Protection, and I would urge on him seriously to consider the case that has been made before the Fiscal Committee and the many representations that have been made to his own Department on this matter.  I trust also that the Minister or some other Minister who represented the Free State at the Imperial Conference will give us some inkling as to how far they were committed at that Conference to an Imperial preference.</P>

      <P>This has been one of the most extraordinary debates that I have listened to since I came to the Dáil.  It has been possible to agree not only with the resolution and with those who spoke of it in most of what they said, but with those who opposed what the supporters of the resolution said.  Until the Minister for Agriculture spoke, the whole debate was very much in the air.  It consisted of general statements quoted from the report of the Commission, and equally general statements, without very much definite argument except vague statements, also quoted against the findings of the Commission. As the Minister for Agriculture pointed out, the resolution itself is one of the most harmless ones that has been put before the Dáil.  In a way, it is a marvel of drafting; it commits nobody to anything that he would afterwards have to repudiate.  Every section in the Dáil could give it support.  But when you come to the speeches made in support of that very harmless and indefinite resolution, though the arguments made have been indefinite, still nobody can suggest that the purpose, the aim, the policy behind the speeches was quite so indefinite as the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus I think we are really presented with two rival reports&mdash;one the Smiddy Report, and the other the Milroy Report. They differ in their ultimate conclusions, perhaps; they differ certainly in their tone and in the way in which they were put forward.  I doubt if Deputy Milroy improved his case by <Col N="512" /> the invective in which he indulged against men with no more obligations than other members of the State who had given a large amount of time to this particular matter.  Why?  Because these men are particularly acquainted with the subject, and they have devoted practically all their thinking moments to that subject.  Why should they be supposed to know nothing about it?  That, after all, was the attitude taken up by Deputy Milroy as regards the members of the Commission. Personally, I am rather sorry there was not a doctrinaire protectionist on this Committee who, in the face of the actual evidence presented as regards this particular country at this particular moment, would find in favour of Protection, because then we would have the Protectionist case put less vigorously, perhaps, but possibly a little more convincingly before us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Milroy, so to speak, has swept into the breach.  He has presented us with the protectionist side of the case.  He finds fault with the conclusions of the Commission, not only with the conclusions, but suggests that there was no definite evidence for those conclusions.  I suggest that in not one of the conclusions that Deputy Milroy arrives at, does he put forward convincing arguments; all the time he remains in the jungle.</P>
    <P>As between Protection and Free Trade, you could argue until you were tired.  It is useless to suggest that the members of this Committee were out and out Free Traders&mdash;doctrinaire Free Traders.  From what I know of some of the members, they were the very opposite; at least, they were not doctrinaire Free Traders.  They would not have found for Free Trade in all circumstances.  I believe some of them would have found for the Protection of certain industries if the evidence they had before them seemed to them at all to justify such a finding.</P>
    <P>The fact that there was no out and out Protectionist on this particular Committee is significant.  I presume that the Government, in trying to get impartial men, tried to get different views.  I suggest it was extremely difficult to get men of standing who, in the face of the present position of the country, would present a report very <Col N="513" /> different from the one we got.  I think that in itself is pretty significant. What I do object to is not so much the resolution, because that commits neither the country nor the Dáil to anything.  It simply amounts to the Dáil telling the Government: &ldquo;Be very good; be careful and do not do anything rash.&rdquo;  Does anybody suggest that it amounts to anything more than that?  &ldquo;Do not do anything without fully investigating the circumstances.&rdquo; Despite what Deputy Davin said at the beginning of his speech, I do think there is an attempt made to rush the Government into a policy of Protection before either the country, the Dáil, or the Government has had time to examine the full circumstances.  I think Deputy Johnson did point out that we were within a month or two of the Budget, and that now was the fatal hour in which we ought to decide which fiscal policy we would adopt.  Is it suggested that the publication of the Commission's report really commits the Government to a Free Trade policy?  Is it the uniform experience of members of the Dáil, even on the Labour benches, that the Government unhesitatingly adopts the report of Commissions?  I wonder will Deputy O'Connell reiterate his statement of a few days ago, that at last the time had come when the Government should adopt the report of one of its Commissions?</P>
    <P>I think there is a tendency to commit the Government to a policy of protection&mdash;a wide policy of protection as a whole.  I do not think, in the evidence submitted to the Commission, or in the speeches put before the Dáil, that there is any justification for plunging into a policy of that kind.  To show the extraordinary argument which the report of this Commission has aroused, a member of the Dáil in another place suggested, as a result of the publication of the report, that there was a terrible amount of dumping in Dublin.  How could that possibly be the result of the publication of the report, seeing that its publication does not change the legal aspect of the thing, or the fiscal policy of the Government?  The report has not been adopted.  If it had commended a policy of protection.  I <Col N="514" /> could understand why there would be a rush in case the Government would adopt it; and before the Government could adopt it I could understand there would be an effort made to dump goods.</P>
    <P>The report, as a whole, merely says: &ldquo;Stay as you are at present; that is the only safe advice we can give.&rdquo; How that could lead to dumping I cannot imagine.  The arguments were mainly of a general character.  There were references to other countries and references to other times.  As far as I can gather, all that arguments of that kind prove is that protection will not kill a country and free trade will not kill a country.  Deputy Milroy went to Germany and to America, and he went back as far as 80 years ago.  Incidentally, I may say that one of the charges made by Deputy Cooper against him was not quite accurate.  Deputy Cooper implied that Deputy Milroy left us under a certain impression.  There was a quotation from List and there was an extract of an argument of his with a certain English representative.  I think that Deputy Milroy made it quite clear that the incident occurred eighty years ago.  I refer to List's speech because it is rather interesting and it refers to the Zollverin.  It may interest Deputy Milroy to hear that one of those who did most to secure the success of that Zollverin, of which List speaks, was one of the earliest practical disciples of Adam Smith on the continent.</P>
    <P>I will not say the Zollverin policy was a policy of Free Trade, nor was it an out-and-out policy of Protection.  Since that time German economists have been arguing, as economists will argue, that the prosperity of Germany was due not to the imposition but to the removal of tariffs, whereas their opponents argued, as opponents will argue, that it was due to the imposition and not to the removal of tariffs.  These general discussions carry us nowhere, because, after all, everything will depend not on a few general arguments, but on the conditions existing in a certain country at a certain time.  Free Trade suited England because England at that time had the carrying trade of the world, but Free Trade did not suit Ireland at that particular moment.  We are not <Col N="515" /> considering now the Ireland of eighty or ninety years ago; we are considering the Ireland of the present day, and everything depends, therefore, on what the actual situation is at present.  None of the speakers, except the Minister for Agriculture, really attacked that particular problem in a definite fashion. I admit that the report of the Committee is a depressing one, but I think the most depressing portion of it is the first portion; that is to say, where the representatives of the different manufacturers were giving their evidence. There is nothing inspiring in that portion of the report, and from their evidence it becomes quite clear that, even if you granted them the protection they sought it is very doubtful whether they would be able to preserve themselves with the tariff they say they require. The evidence on that point is obviously overdrawn, because it only deals with one factor in the situation.  There are other factors still that the imposition of a tariff will not wipe out of the way. There were certain things that I wanted to be quite clear about.  I looked in vain to the Farmers' Party to speak on one of these matters, and that is the immediate effect of the imposition of a tariff on agriculture.</P>
    <P>The only speaker that gave me a definite answer as to the effect of the imposition of a tariff on agriculture was the Minister for Agriculture.  At the present moment, I think so far as this country is concerned, it is out of the question to interfere with agriculture. While it may not be on its last legs, agriculture is, from all we have heard in this House, far from being in a flourishing condition, and I think it has not been seriously controverted that agriculture cannot bear any further impositions.</P>
    <P>I quite admit that some of the manufacturers who gave evidence before the Committee suggested that agriculture would not mind an extra little tax.  But I do not think, judging from the figures given to us by the Minister for Agriculture, that agriculture is in a condition to stand any more burdens of that kind.  I do not think it has been sufficiently considered, apart altogether from that most important of all aspects, the agricultural aspect, what <Col N="516" /> the effect of Protection would be.  I do not think it has been sufficiently considered what will really be the effect of Protection on manufacture itself if it gets Protection.  Will it produce the result assumed here practically without argument: that a tariff will benefit the manufacturer?  I admit it may for the moment bring more money into the pocket of the manufacturer, but will it mean increased efficiency?  That was one of the charges made by some of those who gave evidence before the Committee, that one of the reasons for the failure of manufacturers in this country was their inefficiency in running their business. Will, I ask, an increase in tariffs make them more efficient, and will that be the natural result of them?  I feel certain that the opposite would be the result.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the general consumer, Deputy Milroy waxed very indignant at the suggestion that the manufacturers were very human, in other words that they would utilise the imposition of a tariff to raise prices.  Have we no profiteers, and will not every class in the community take advantage of a monopoly of that kind? The manufacturers must be gifted with great virtue if they resist a temptation of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is not a slur on their honesty in the sense of suggesting that they are particularly dishonest.  They are simply like the rest of the community, and if you give them the opportunity, well then they will use it.  I suggest, from the moral point of view, it is not fair to the morality of the manufacturing community of the future to tempt them in that fashion.  I must confess that though we are undoubtedly faced with a very serious situation, not merely so far as agriculture is concerned, but so far as our general industries are concerned, there was really no suggestion made in what I may call the Milroy report as to how we should meet that situation.  He simply recommended that a general tariff should be imposed, but he was very careful not to commit himself as to which particular article should be taxed, and which should not.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Milroy was speaking I think he attacked five <Col N="517" /> professors.  During the course of his speech we heard him use very strong comments, indeed, on the five professors. He can now add another to his list, and make it six professors.  The Deputy told us that the Professors' report was not a satisfactory one.  In my opinion it is.  He also said it was malignant in its conclusions.  I do not think that is a fair statement to make.  It may have been malignant from Deputy Milroy's point of view, and it may have been malignant from the point of view of a small section of the community, but from the point of view of the nation as a whole, I think the report was quite fair and not malignant.  This Committee, to my mind, in issuing their report, issued it for the nation as a whole, and not for one section or for two sections, or for one industry or for two industries.  Their report, to my mind, was based on the national need, and not on the need of one or two isolated industries.  I do not think the language he used has helped Deputy Milroy's case from the point of view of the people for whom he was supposed to be speaking.  I am not an authority on nice language myself, and I do not intend to comment very freely on the language used by Deputy Milroy.  I think I will let that pass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use the word Parliament at all.  The subject, as far as it relates to the agricultural industry, has been ably debated, especially by the Minister for Agriculture and some other Deputies who have spoken. I also hold the point of view that Protection for some industries, and without taking into account all the industries, would mean an advance in the cost of living to the general community.  If a duty were to be imposed on manufactured articles coming into the country, it would mean that the taxpayers of the country would have to bear it.  It is not the manufacturers of the article would be at the loss, but the people obliged to buy would have to bear it, and unless you give Protection, not alone to a few industries, but to all the industries in the Saorstát, there is no use in talking <Col N="518" /> in terms of Protection.  I am a Protectionist, provided you can protect all the industries in the Saorstát.  If you can only protect a few and offer no protection whatever to the greatest and most important industry there is in the country, I am against Protection, and I ask are we in a position to protect the agricultural industry?  Is the home market a sufficient protection for Irish agriculture?  Will anybody risk their reputation and tell us it is?  I think that not even Deputy Milroy will go as far as that.  Again, I ask are we able to protect Irish agriculture in the foreign and open markets?  It would be all very well if we were all the one country&mdash; the British Empire, or the British Isles &mdash;but we are not one country for economic purposes.  It would be all very well had we a general policy established for the three countries; then we would all be whole-heartedly Protectionist perhaps, but in the absence of Protection in England, we here are in the position of a foreign country competing in the English markets.</P>
      <P>What is the use of talking about Protection? I say there is no use whatever. Deputy Johnson in his speech made some suggestions that, I think, were not worthy of the Deputy.  He left great emphasis, I think, on his description of the present state of agriculture. He described it as herds and flocks.  Perhaps Deputy Johnson knows more about agriculture than those engaged in it, and perhaps he knows more about, what would be, and what would not be, a paying proposition for the people who have spent their lives at, and who derive their existence from, agriculture.  I do not think he gave the question due thought.  The Deputy referred to our cattle, but, as the Minister for Agriculture pointed out, the production of cattle is only a by-product of the dairy industry.  I do not know that I need remind even Deputy Johnson that we could not have milk, butter and cheese without cattle.  Cows are not a machine, and will not continue to give you milk year after year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that they destroy their stores? Does he suggest that the cows will continue to milk without calves?  I do not think it is seriously suggested that there is any mechanical operation in Denmark for producing milk, butter and cheese.  Wherever you have a dairy industry, you must also raise cattle.  You will have to rear cattle from the time they are a day old up to the age of three years, and you must continue to do that.  The only alternative to the present system of agriculture is that we should break up the lands of Ireland and grow something that nobody wants.  I wonder if Deputy Milroy and Deputy Johnson are suggesting that they do not want our wheat, our oats or our barley.  I daresay some of them may want our barley, or may want our potatoes and vegetables, and that they are prepared to pay for them.  There is no use, I think, in using this sort of cheap rhetoric. Anybody who has been cut in the country or in the city of Dublin for the last fortnight knows that if this tillage craze of Deputy Johnson's is to succeed, the first essential, I think, would be a roof for the island to keep the water out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it will be news for Deputy Johnson when I tell him that the East coast of Ireland is more suitable for tillage than the West or the Midlands, and that what is possible in the East is not possible in the West or the Midlands. I would suggest to those who criticise agriculture that they should seriously consider the desirability of altering the climate, and I am sure that is not impossible either to Deputy Johnson or Deputy Milroy.  My opinion is this: that those who are the readiest to criticise agriculture are those who know least about it.  I hope that is not offensive.  The debate so far as it has gone, and the arguments in favour of Protection that I have listened to on this resolution seem to me conflicting.  We have a nicely worded resolution placed before us with nothing of any harm in it, and it is one that we could all vote for except for the fact, as some Deputies have pointed <Col N="520" /> out, of the tone of the speeches.  It was the interest behind the speech-makers that set us thinking.  One listening to the speeches, and reading the motion, could not reconcile the substance of the one with the substance of the other.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, there is no use in talking here about Protection except we are able to protect all our industries. Where you have your biggest market at our door, except you are able to influence that market, you have no use asking the people here engaged in the production of the articles to be put on that market to give Protection to certain industries, or to subsidise, as Deputy Milroy's argument amounted to, all the other petty manufacturers of the nation.  You might as well take the cobwebs off the issue and tell the people plainly it is the agricultural industry, the non-productive industry of the nation, that is going to subsidise all the other industries that have been mentioned, because that is the truth of the matter.  Be honest, I say, with the nation, and do not be dabbling in phrases and words.  My experience of Protection in this country has not been very happy.  We may be told that we had Protection.  I say that we had not, except a sentimental kind of Protection. We had an appeal made to us time and again to support Irish industries. The people have supported Irish industry and have responded to the appeals made to them.  They have consistently bought Irish manufactured stuff in preference to any other.  But how have they been met by Irish industry? Some of them have certainly been met by getting good value for their money, but, I ask, have all Irish manufacturers done that?</P>
    <P>Those engaged on the industrial side of Irish life here had better put their house in order, and had better make quality their motto rather than sentiment. They had better make &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; their motto rather than trade on sentiment.  I had a little experience of that.  I remember buying a suit of clothes in Dublin about two years ago for £13 10s.  The value of the clothes would be about £5, so that there was £5 of clothes and £8 10s sentiment. The trader probably had more <Col N="521" /> profit on sentiment than on the article. That is the sort of thing that the average man meets with.  The people have not been met fairly in this question of supporting Irish manufacture. There are two things against manufacturing industry&mdash;these are, the will to make our industry a success, and the ability to do so.  Unless our manufacturers and those handling our products are prepared to give of their best and adopt proper business methods and are prepared to give reasonable output, you cannot have success in manufacture. In the absence of that will and in the absence of trying to model ourselves on the English, German or American methods of enterprise there is no use talking of protection.  There would be little need for it had we the German or American idea of work and output.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. MILROY Mr. MILROY">

      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, what would be Protection for Germany considering their output would be a drop in the ocean to us considering what we mean by output and value.  This country has been criticised for what it grows.  We farmers grow what we can find a market for, and we grow what the people want.  An American said recently that he could sell any amount of our stuff if we manufactured what he wanted.  We farmers produce what our customers want&mdash;namely, beef, butter, milk, cheese and bacon.  They do not want anything else such as Deputy Johnson suggested.  They do not for instance want our corn or grain, and we do not want the native grain products of the land.  We do not use them, and therefore why should we grow them?  What is the object of growing what neither ourselves nor anybody else wants? We do not intend to follow Deputy Johnson's suggestion, but we intend to grow what we can sell, and we intend to grow something besides that which will rot.  What is the use of having a big crop if there is no use for it for anybody?  I suggest that there is a great way to help industry in Ireland, and that is by everybody engaged in it putting their backs into it and giving <Col N="522" /> value for money and not being dependent on spoon-feeding.  Anybody dependent on the dole or spoon-feeding goes to the wall.  Let us try to get a spirit of self-confidence and self-reliance, and let us try to put a good article on the market and we will get a good market for it at home.  In the absence of such ideas there is no use in talking about Protection.  Let us make quality and output our motto, and if we are able to do that we will be going on the right road.  Our industrial people will have to become what they are not at the moment, and that is keen business people.  The Southern Irishman is not as keen a business man as the Northern, the Englishman, German or American.</P>

The duty on motor cars was referred to by a Deputy who said that it did not affect the cost of living.  I can understand that motor cars are not a necessity.  They are only used by a few fortunate people in this country like teachers, railwaymen, and a few farmers.  The tax on motor cars does not affect the cost of living, but food affects the cost of living, and so does clothing.  I think that taking it on the whole, and taking the possibilities of the country, and what we are able to protect, and what we are not able to protect, I am confident that we are not able to protect our manufactures or agriculture, and in the absence of being able to give effective protection to agriculture, I and those associated with me remain Free Traders.</P>

      <P>As one who has taken a very active interest in the industrial movement for many years past, I desire to offer a few remarks on the motion before the Dáil.  I do not propose to go into the details already traversed by Deputies who have spoken, but I propose to confine my remarks to the principle of the motion <Col N="523" />&mdash;that the problem should be examined in the broadest sense possible in the interests of the general well-being of the State.  With reference to the Report, I do not wish to criticise the gentlemen who composed the Commission. I have no doubt that from an expert point of view they possess all the qualifications that men could have, to deal with such a problem, but I doubt very much that they had the interests of the country in view, or that they were acquainted with the conditions under which many of the people live.  The Report does not give us the facts necessary to determine the policy of fiscal tariffs.</P>

      <P>It undoubtedly gives us what we may say are the pros. and cons. of how some Irish industries would be affected by Protection. It suggests that we ought to remain as we are and be satisfied with the conditions that exist at the moment.  It does not inform us what is to become of the remaining existing industries of the country if foreign countries can send their goods into Ireland free, in competition with similar goods made in this country, and the manufacture of which gives employment to our people. On page 23 of the Report, the Commission deals with the railway rolling stock.  All I will say on this, seeing that I have dealt with it before in a recent debate, is that from a practical knowledge of this industry, which is a progressive one if properly handled, I believe there is no necessity whatsoever for the free importation of the requirements of railway rolling stock in the way of engines, carriages, etc., as is carried out by the Irish railway companies. I think that when an opportunity is given for the consideration of those matters on their merits, whoever will have the opportunity of dealing with them will be well advised that in this particular instance, at any rate, most of the raw materials ought to be admitted free.  The same thing applies with regard to the finished article, with a few exceptions, on which there ought to be a tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> I do not presume to be an expert, but I think some protection will have to be afforded to this industry, and I believe it is worthy of consideration in that respect. I noticed an absence of any comment in the report in connection with the evidence on this industry.  I do not know the reason for that, considering that they have given us a full comment on the other items in the Report.  There are many existing industries in the country which cannot continue unless some protection is afforded, and I think Deputies can cite a number of industries of this sort with which they are familiar.  The one I will mention is the horn, comb and rosary bead industry. Sixty thousand pounds worth of such articles are imported into Ireland annually.  That would give employment to six or seven hundred of our boys and girls, while at the moment it is only giving employment to something like 150. Here we have the export of our cattle returned to us in the form of dead meat in one instance, and in boots and shoes in another, while people who are interested in the industry which I mention cannot secure the raw material we are exporting.  There is a boot manufacturer in the city of Dublin who caters for English-made boots.  It came to my lot to go to this particular place, and I had forced on me a foreign made pair of boots.  I had to insist on getting Irish made ones in preference.  There are a considerable number of firms in Ireland to-day who are really only agents for foreign goods, but who sell them under their own manufacturing title.  I presume that this explains the absence of some of the witnesses from the Commission to which they were invited.  We read in the report evidence of witnesses regarding the insufficient supply of skilled labour in various trades.  What are the prevailing conditions?  Huge consignments of finished articles that could be easily made in Ireland are imported, while our young men and women are forced to leave the country. Anyone connected with the various trades in the city knows that such is the fact.  They are forced out of the country or otherwise are idle unless some other form of employment is forthcoming.  The so-called manufacturers who favour free trade are not <Col N="525" /> concerned in this way.  Free Trade to them means their success.  Their outlook is secure, and no consideration is given to the masses of the people.  I refer particularly to those of the working class community or middle class, and I think that we, at any rate, ought to consider our responsibility to them.</P>
    <P>We ought to take some steps to stop the decline of our population, and I think that each Deputy, when considering this problem ought to try and picture to himself the anxiety that confronts thousands of heads of families as to the outlook that faces them in the matter of endeavouring to secure some form of employment for their children. A very considerable number of our population between the ages of 18 and 20 are seeking everywhere for employment, while we are continually importing and forcing on the country many articles that should be, and in many places are being made here, but for the want of support we are without the employment that they should give.  It is being constantly dinned into our ears by noted experts of national economy from Birmingham and elsewhere&mdash;and in referring to professors or experts I do not believe Deputy Milroy and others meant any personal reflections on them, although some of them seem to take it so&mdash;who are exponents of Free Trade in England that it is the best policy for Ireland, and that it is a policy that will make Ireland prosperous. A man may be thoroughly competent to deal with a given subject and possess, possibly, a greater knowledge of that subject than a professor, and such a man in national economics was the late President Arthur Griffith.  Fortunately, he has left us, his teachings in his writings and I, at any rate, am prepared to follow his opinions and teachings in preference to any other man, be he expert or professor.  The late President Griffith said: &ldquo;Without economic independence there can be no political freedom.  Here, in the Dáil, we have an instrument of national legislature which can foster and preserve the nation.  What we want is the courage to believe in a great national future and in that belief march on.&rdquo;&ldquo;Above <Col N="526" /> all,&rdquo; said Griffith, &ldquo;let us have national spirit enough to at once plant and protect that trade which will yield its richest fruits to future generations. First, let us gain possession of the home market so far, at least, as respects articles of general necessity, and secondly, let us procure the goods of other countries direct from those countries and pay for them with our own manufactured goods.&rdquo;  We have got to cease thinking of the interests of any other country and look to our industries and commerce, and determine how best we can protect and develop them.  I am not unmindful of the fact that this is a very difficult problem to deal with, and is one that will require the very fullest consideration possible.  I am quite confident that the President and the responsible Ministers will give this matter the attention it deserves and I, personally, have the fullest confidence in their judgment. In conclusion, I should like to refer to the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture when he said that the proper way to deal with this complex problem was by taking a particular industry at a particular time, and under particular circumstances.  I believe if that is done a start in the right direction will be made.  I think that the time is opportune to make such a start, and if it is done I will be satisfied with the consideration it has got.  I have great pleasure in supporting the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers' side of this question has been discussed, but I think I might say a few words to make their position more clear.  As I know the farmer he is not a Free Trader, and he is not inclined to take up an impossible attitude on this question at all.  What he fears is that by changing the fiscal arrangements we are living under you may raise the cost of production and living, but if you bring in any scheme by which the cost of living to him will not be raised, he will not take up an attitude that will prevent a re-arrangement of fiscal policy, and it can be done, I believe. I am very much impressed with the arguments we had about taking something off tea, or sugar, or some other commodity, and spreading it over other <Col N="527" /> commodities, that thereby you might give protection to industry and at the same time not raise the cost of living. If you do not raise the cost of living from the farmer's side, he is quite prepared, as far as I know him, to allow you to do anything in connection with fiscal arrangements.  I am not satisfied that we are progressing.  I know the country ought to carry a bigger population than it does.  We have given Free Trade a fair trial.  Since the Land Acts were passed farmers have had a reduction in their rents, and yet the country is depopulated. With regard to this question of population, emigration has taken place from Germany and from Italy, but that has no relation to what is taking place in Ireland.  That is emigration caused by surplus population.  In our case, it is emigration taken out of a depleted population, and we are not satisfied that we are doing everything possible to keep our young men at home and provide them with a means of living. The Committee has assumed that by Protection you will raise the cost of living.  Deputy Milroy has advanced arguments against that, and I have not yet heard an argument disproving what he has proved, that by a re-arrangement of fiscal policy you can do these things.  If you take 2s. a week off tea and sugar in the case of a family, it will be £5 a year, and could not families be well able to afford £5 more for their clothes?  You want £30,000,000 to run the country, and you must get it; and if you change the fiscal system so as not to raise the cost of living the farmers will not stand in the way of any re-arrangement.  I would like to emphasise that that is the farmers' policy.  It was expressed as being in favour of Free Trade, but it is not; its policy is not to raise the cost of production, and not to blot him out of the markets he holds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in supporting the motion, and I think that motion should appeal to each and every member of the Dáil, because it simply means that the Dáil asks the Government to consider carefully the line of action they will take on this very important matter of our fiscal conditions. <Col N="528" /> I do not agree with all Deputy Milroy has said as regards all that the report means, because I take it merely as a report from those appointed by the Government to secure evidence and place a report before them.  The fact of that report going before the Government does not of necessity mean they will adopt it, or that they are going to lay down the lines of their fiscal policy according to it.  A great deal has been said on the question of adopting, as a policy, the principal of protection.  I do not believe in the principle of protection, but I do believe in your policy of protection, if you are going to develop the industries.  It may be necessary in order to preserve some of the existing industries that you must have a policy of protection.  We have had for some years past a policy of subsidising certain industries.  That was done by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, with the result that after a few years some of those industries became self-supporting, and the subsidies were withdrawn.  I do not see why it could not be possible for the Government to subsidise industries that are possible and native to the country, and I do not see why the agricultural industry, which, as the Minister for Agriculture pointed out, accounts for 80 per cent. of the products of the country should not be subsidised to the advantage of the country.  Much has been said from the Labour Benches, and other parts of the Dáil, on the question of lack of employment, and the inability of the farmers owing to the present state of the markets and want of profit on their produce to give employment. Would it not be possible for the Government to subsidise the farmers and enable them to employ more, and thus give the workers an opportunity of being a help instead of a burden on the country?  There are many industries connected with farming which could be developed with great advantage to the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Report we find that only one-fifteenth of the boots sold in Ireland are made in Ireland.  The rest are imported, and we know that all the hides and horns are sent to England.  There is the cost of transit, and the leather is sent back again, except in rare cases to <Col N="529" /> be turned into boots and other articles. This means an absolute loss to the farmer.  I think a form of protection will be found necessary, and I do not believe that the Government in considering the Report will take it as being final, or as the lines on which they will adopt their policy, but that they will take it merely as a Report and consider the evidence that has gone before that Committee and act on it accordingly, remembering one very important fact that we are practically a new country, and that whilst we have very heavy taxation there would be an expenditure, by protection of certain industries, that would be justified, because it would keep our people with us. They would be retained, provided that money could be spent in a judicious manner, and not be spoon-feeding industries.  That would enable industries to get, perhaps, round a particularly difficult corner at the start, against the competition they have to contend with, and which has gone fifty or sixty years ahead of them.  This will require care and this also will require, as Deputy Gorey said, more industry. For that development Protection is necessary but the workers will have to get more in touch with the employers, and both will have to consider the interests of the country as high or higher than their own individual interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that even at this stage it would be well for the Dáil to try and find out what we really are discussing.  As other Deputies said this motion means anything or nothing. Everybody realises that in certain industries in the country there is certainly a need for protection, and, to my mind, it might be necessary even at this stage to have a committee appointed from the members of the Dáil to go into the question from a purely national point of view.  I can quite understand the academic mind that prevails all through the Report.  I, for my part, am not an out and out Protectionist. I realise like many more that this is an undeveloped country.  It has been held in subjection for 700 years by another country whose sole object was to crush and ruin it and to put out of existence any new industry which tried to show its head. <Col N="530" /> Now, in view of that, and in view of the fact that this country for the past four or five years has to a great extent, in consequence of the war between England and this country, and the internal strife during the past twelve months, neglected its own interests so to speak, I think it is absolutely necessary that something should be done to try and put the industries that we have, properly on their feet, and to try and develop the country in the interests of the people of the country. To my mind, the report does not deal thoroughly enough with the all-important matter of the development of Irish industries.  Now, agriculture has been mentioned, and I was rather surprised to hear the last words that dropped from Deputy Gorey's lips&mdash;&ldquo;In the absence of our being able to protect our own industries, I, and those sitting with me, are free traders.&rdquo;  Now, that is a statement that should not be made, at least to my mind in a national assembly like this. If we are to develop this country we ought to look at the matter from a broader point of view than that; we should not look at it in that way from the point of view of Party or class. Charges like that are continually being levelled against the party that I represent here.  I want to assure the Dáil that those charges are not deserved. We are trying to look at things from a national point of view.  It is necessary sometimes, that we should fight for the interests of the people we represent, but in matters of this kind we try to think nationally.  So far as agriculture is concerned I admit candidly that agriculture is not paying in this country at the moment.  And I wonder when we are to expect the findings of the Commission that has been set up by An Dáil on that important matter.  It is over twelve months ago since that Commission was set up, and I think we ought to know what the prospects are, or what we are to expect from this Commission so far as agriculture is concerned.  That, to my mind is an industry that should be protected to some extent.  A large amount of foreign barley comes into this country every year, and I was led to believe that it was absolutely essential <Col N="531" /> that some foreign barley should be brought in for the purpose of brewing. I think that may be so.  But everybody who is connected with the industry knows that that foreign barley comes in, in a greater proportion than is needed.  I do not think it would be beneath the Government in any way to try and arrange a conference between the farmers' representatives and the people who buy barley for brewing or distilling, in order to secure a guarantee for the farmers, that if they grow a certain amount of barley that it will be taken from them by the brewers and distillers.  I do not think it would be beneath any Government's dignity to do that, and I believe that, if that were done, it would greatly tend to solve the agricultural problem.</P>
      <P>As I said at the beginning, there are various industries that want protection. This nation knows that from time to time combines and syndicates have come into this country for the purpose of buying up small industries in order to wipe them out.  I can instance one case in my own district. Some time ago a cement works in Wexford was bought up by the Associated Portland Cement Company, and after they purchased the place they kept it going for some time.  Then they closed it down and dumped English cement here.  They tried to make us believe that the works there were not paying. I brought it before An Dáil and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the result that it was opened up again.  Some time after they again closed it down, and it was only when we decided, in Wexford, that we would not allow English cement in, they realised that we would have none of their nonsense.  This thing has prevailed in this country for a long time, and something ought to be done by the Government in order to protect these and other industries.  Even though to my mind Deputy Milroy's motion does not set down in very clear terms what he wants, I do hope that the discussion that has taken place will have the desired effect of making the Government realise their responsibility to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention whatever of intervening in this debate. <Col N="532" /> It seems to my mind that everything has been said on both sides, and I would not have risen only for the fact that Deputy Corish has made a statement that I think needs some reply from the Deputies on these benches.  I do not know whether Deputy Corish means it as a sop to some of the farmers in the Midlands when he suggests that agriculture might benefit by a tariff on foreign barley.  I doubt if Deputy Corish understands agriculture in Ireland when he suggests that a tax on foreign barley would help agriculture in Ireland, or help agriculture in the Saorstát.  As far as I know, barley is grown in about six counties in the Saorstát, and what remedy will Deputy Corish suggest to protect agriculture in the remaining twenty counties? And these are the poorer counties.  He would need to suggest a remedy to us in those poorer counties where we are not growing barley, and where we should be satisfied that a tariff on foreign barley would really be beneficial to agriculture.  We in these benches do not say that if we did have tariffs on imports, that barley ought not to get consideration.  We feel it should, if there are to be tariffs at all. I do not propose to follow Deputy Milroy or some other Deputies to the ends of the earth to discuss the fiscal systems of foreign countries, and make comparisons with this country, comparisons that in many cases I think could not be honestly made.  Comparisons were made with countries where the conditions were not comparable at all.  It seems to me that after discussing the fiscal policy of this country, we cannot leave out of account the mentality of the people that we are trying to arrange a fiscal policy for.  No Deputy in An Dáil has ventured to contradict the Minister for Agriculture when he stated that agricultural industry produces 80 per cent. of the wealth of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means that every Deputy accepts it that the agricultural industry represents 80 per cent. of the wealth of the Saorstát and that, in other words, it is practically the Saorstát itself.  I think that cannot be left out of account by any Deputy, and if any Deputies urge protection for any industry, what they have got to do, if they are going <Col N="533" /> to be fair and honest to the State, and to its main industry, is to recollect what effect it will have on the nation's main industry.  I am afraid that they have not done that. They are more concerned about particular industries that they may be interested in than about the nation's main industry.  Now, the question is, would Protection really bring to the industries that are seeking it the blessings that they think it will?  Some of the evidence before the Fiscal Commission, from the representatives of the manufacturers, was to the effect that if some of our industries got protection the manufacturers would be very decent, and they would not raise the prices of their products.</P>
    <P>I am afraid it was just a pious expression of what they might do in certain conditions.  I have very great doubts that if they got the protection they seek they would act in such a public-spirited manner as they say they would.  I would not like to be unfair to any Irish industry, but I think we ought all be honest, and I would ask Deputies, those who smoke in particular, what effect had the tariff wall on the manufacturers of cigarettes in this country?  Ask the smokers all over the country what did the manufacturers do.  Did they keep to the promise that some of them made before the Commission, that they would give as good an article and not raise the price?  If they did not raise the price, at least the standard of the article was very considerably decreased.  The result was many of our smokers all over the country became so tired of the Irish manufacturer and the stuff he gave them, that any foreigner was welcome. Now our tobacco manufacturers urge that the Imperial Tobacco Co. should be either closed down or their output should be prohibited.  Somebody else in the Dáil suggested against that, that they would welcome the coming into this country of firms or combines who would establish the industries.  Where do these arguments lead?</P>
    <P>You have the argument of the manufacturers' representative before the Commission, and he wants the Imperial Tobacco Co. closed down, or its output <Col N="534" /> prohibited.  Then there is the argument of the Deputy over there who would welcome any foreign manufacturers and combines.  These people are not seeing eye to eye.  I am inclined to think protection for Irish industries will, in other words, be really a protection for a good many of the workers who prefer to be well paid, irrespective of what work or services they give, whether it is really good, honest service, whether it is middling service, or whether it is bad service. It would also be protection for many of our manufacturers who are unable to compete with the manufacturers of other countries, simply because they will not pay the attention to their business that the manufacturers of other countries give their business.  Some of them went before the Fiscal Commission and they were not able to tell what it cost to produce certain articles.  They wanted protection and they were not able to tell what it cost them to produce certain articles.</P>
    <P>I do believe, and the feeling is general in the country, that a higher standard of perfection might be attained by the workers in our industries and the managers of those concerns. It will be no harm to imitate the foreigner in this.  Let us try to imitate him in doing something better and in doing more honest things.  We ought to do that and our manufacturers ought to do it.  It is not good enough for an Irish manufacturer to supply a consumer with a decent article once, twice or a third time, and then reduce his standard.  The customer recognises that and is not so foolish and he cannot and will not be taken in.  He will go to the foreigner in preference.  Let us be as honest as the foreigner and give as good an article with as much despatch and regularity, and with the same punctuality as the foreigner.  Let us not have to wait for six weeks or two months for an article that might be supplied within a week.  These are our failings.</P>

And I think it would be a better and more honest thing for our manufacturers to recognise their own weaknesses and failings and try and run their businesses better than coming to this House to seek protection for their own failings, and failings that will leave a mark on Irish character and prevent us and future generations from attaining that standard of perfection and honesty in business that we must attain if this nation is ever to be built up.</P>

      <P>Before submitting the statement that sets out the views of the Government upon this important matter, I would like to say the Government welcomes the motion moved by Deputy Milroy. But they expected that the Deputy, or at least some of the Deputies taking part in the debate, would have gone into more details than they have done, because almost every speaker dealt with the matter only in a general way.  All the speeches in support of the motion dealt in generalities, and, as Deputy Egan pointed out: &ldquo;I say that in a debate of this sort you cannot reach any finality, and in discussing this problem you must have definite concrete cases put before you.  Each individual industry must be taken on its merits and so on.&rdquo;  Deputy Milroy, armed with all the information he had might, at least, have kept the House another ten minutes, and taken any one of the industries he brushed over and dealt with it as concrete fact, and tried to show in black and white the actual advantages to be gained by the State by having a particular industry so protected taking everything into account; and, on the other hand, showing the disadvantages which the State would suffer as a result of not adopting protection.  If he could prove beyond yea or nay and challenge even the Committee that issued the report to prove that he was incorrect when he asserted that there was a distinct advantage to be gained by the State, he might have made a really good case, and if he had been able to arrive at that stage we might have saved a good deal of time and debate, <Col N="536" /> and we might have even had a resolution instructing the Government to come to business and see that something should be done on those lines with similar industries.  I think if the Deputy had been able to do that and brought forward an argument of that kind, he might have suggested something useful.  The nearest approach was that made this evening by Deputy Davin.  It was a poor effort at making a case, and I do not think he made a definite case when he mentioned the case of the furniture trade.</P>

      <P>I mentioned that to show it was one of the nearest possible approaches to dealing with one definite industry in the country.  The Deputy made the extraordinary statement that there was two million pounds worth of furniture imported into Ireland, and that one million was dumped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGRATH</NameTxt>
      <P>That is 50 per cent. of what I think you said was dumped. <Col N="537" /> You will see in the Report of the Fiscal Committee that the word &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; appears in the evidence of almost every witness.  I have experience of people coming to see me about various matters, and I find that this word is really used very loosely.  When you ask for proof as to dumping you can get no one to come up to the scratch in order to produce proof.  Deputy Johnson, and I think Deputy Milroy also, made one very good point when they referred to the fact that the principal industry of the country, or what was supposed to be the principal industry, was the raising of stock and the exporting of it.  They made the point that this industry only gave the minimum amount of employment.  That is a very serious state of affairs, and it is one certainly that the Government must take into consideration; the growing population of the country, and the fact that employment must be found for the people in some way or other.  Agriculture cannot absorb the labour that is floating about presently, and it will surely increase as the years go on.  Before reading my statement there was one important point raised by Deputy Davin that I wish to refer to. It arose, I think, as a result of his being present on Monday last when the English Premier was making his speech.  It struck him from hearing that speech that the English Premier had actually gone to the country on his policy of Protection, as a result of decisions arrived at at the economic conference at which the Free State was represented. The Deputy asked that some information should be given to the Dáil as to the nature of these discussions. Our position there was simply this: We went there, and at the opening, as some of you have seen, it was definitely stated that we were going there to listen, and if and when anything came up for discussion that concerned the Free State, we would take part in it.  Now the result of the conference, as far as Ireland is concerned, was very little.  Any decisions arrived at there were simply an extension of Imperial preference on commodities such as tinned lobster, dried fruits, apples, and things like that, and these decisions really did not affect us at all. <Col N="538" /> I, with the Minister for Agriculture, share responsibility for the setting up of this Committee, and we feel bound to express regret at the tone of some of the criticisms on the Committee's report. It is only natural to expect that Deputies should feel strongly on a very important matter such as this.  I can quite understand the attitude of Deputy Milroy, in view of the fact that he told me when he read the report he could not sleep for the night.  That must be a fact, because I met him a couple of days afterwards and he was really foaming.  It is quite proper, of course, that Deputies should express their opinions forcibly, but I hope it is the last occasion when comments of the kind that were made on this report will be made on the report of a Committee, particularly one like this.  I hope it will never be the custom to impute motives of a sinister or malignant character to the persons who form these Committees, and after all it must be remembered that their work was gratuitous. They had very long distances to travel; they sat very long and laboured very hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard no Deputy refer to paragraph 137 of the report.  The Committee there indicates that it has been mainly concerned to set out the economic considerations arising out of the proposals actually made to it for changes in the fiscal system, while recognising fully that the question has other aspects, all of which must be taken into account before a policy is decided on. Deputy Milroy's speech seemed to be based on the belief that any person who did not regard Protection as the obvious and immediate remedy for all economic difficulties must be stupid at the best, and animated by a sinister or malignant purpose at the worst.  I know he does not really mean that, and I have been struck by the fact that the speeches delivered in this debate have shown a remarkable freedom from prejudice or dogmatism, a readiness to consider honestly and carefully what we can do through our fiscal system to benefit the nation and a general recognition that this question is very much more one of expediency than of principle. In such an atmosphere there is <Col N="539" /> every hope that the combined wisdom of all parties will be applied to the general advantage.</P>
    <P>It would appear as if many believers in Protection regard the mere mention of the word as establishing their whole case, the onus then resting on their opponents to disprove the case if they can.  But the matter is not so simple as that.  What is the essence of Protection?  It is an artificial device whereby certain activities are stimulated and fostered at the cost of preventing the general community from buying goods where they are offered at the lowest price.  I am far from saying that any community is naturally so wise or virtuous that it can be left to attain to its full development by the mere play of its natural inclinations.  But it must be recognised that advocates of Protection necessarily have the onus of proof on themselves and that the onus is not adequately discharged by reference to the practice or policy of other countries whose conditions are essentially dissimilar, and whose present state is not the best advertisement of their policy. War is not so distantly related to industrialism and high protection as to be left out of account in examining their results.</P>
    <P>Protection has obvious disadvantages, Its immediate effect is to raise prices, though this effect may ultimately be modified in greater or less degree.  It thus develops one economic activity at the initial expense of the rest of the community.  The ultimate results of protection may more than counterbalance this disadvantage, but that this advantage is inevitable, as well as being serious in the present condition of this country, is to my mind a matter beyond argument.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, Free Trade has its disadvantages, some of which are obvious to-day and have been commented on by the Deputies.  There is, I think, general agreement, and it is a fact of which there is much evidence in the Fiscal Committee's Report, that what a Deputy has described as our industrial limb is under-developed.  Our main industry is agriculture, and that is an industry subject to so many fluctuations due to world conditions over which we have little control as to make our present economic condition <Col N="540" /> one of instability.  Unemployment here is a serious and pressing problem for which no early solution can be offered by agriculture.  On a general survey of the economic life of the country, I think few will be found to deny that our industrial limb is not only capable of development, but that its development is necessary to a healthy economic balance.</P>
    <P>The Government has given much consideration to this question.  It has no preconceived opinions in favour of one economic dogma against another. It regards the problem as one entirely of expediency, and, so regarded, is of opinion that its solution does require some re-adjustment of our fiscal system, particularly having regard to its present anomalies.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally realised what the difficulties confronting Irish manufacturers and industrialists are to-day.  The European war which began in 1914 effected an immense revolution in industry and trade.  The tremendous expansion of manufacturing operations necessary in all countries to carry on the war resulted in abnormal changes in productive capacity in the distribution of markets and in the nature and direction of trade.</P>
    <P>New influences appeared in the control of finance, of raw materials, of production and of distribution.  Countries, such as Russia, or Germany, on whose consumption of manufactured products the prosperity of other countries largely depended ceased to be able to buy.  I need not pile up details of the economic revolution that the war caused; they are in greater or less degree familiar to everyone.  With the end of the war there began a strenuous competition for the restricted markets then available, and a concentration of political energies everywhere to secure a foot-hold in the new economic field.  Ireland lost four years in this matter.  From 1919 to 1923 the country was in one political upheaval after another, and now that stable conditions are restored we find that we are considerably behind-hand in the race.  Ireland is one of the few countries, not itself industrial, in which the immense productive plants created by the war have been able to find a <Col N="541" /> market unimpeded by any serious fiscal barrier or by any general inability to buy.  Our industries and manufactures have survived the last four years to find that their home market is flooded by competitors able to use those years to improve and develop their business and to obtain a start which the native manufacturer, unaided, has little hope of catching up.  The position is so abnormal as to require remedies of an abnormal kind.</P>
    <P>It is when we come to devise remedies that such a Report as the one we are now considering is of unmistakable value.  The possible remedies are not many; the Report warns us as to some of the objections and difficulties involved in the most obvious of them. It has not been sufficiently recognised that all manufacturers seeking protection for their industries had full and ample opportunity to argue their proposals before the Committee, and that the Committee's conclusions are very largely coloured by the kind of case that those most directly concerned made to it.  Taking economic considerations only into account, I fear that Irish industries did not make too convincing a case to the Committee and nothing I have heard in the course of this debate has altered my view that there is much in the way of efficiency to achieve before a system of protection, or any conceivable fiscal device could bring about the ideal conditions which the imagination of Deputy Sears painted so attractively.  I feel that we should not approach this question as involving primarily the discovery of means for preserving existing industries, but rather base our policy on such conceptions as we may form of the kind of social and economic life we think best fitted to the resources of the country and the capacities of its people.  The Government does not accept the mere fact that an industry exists and is in difficulties as a reason for protecting it.</P>
    <P>We must be satisfied that an industry seeking protection is an industry adapted to the country, that it is one which with reasonable application and intelligence we can develop economically and that there is a real prospect <Col N="542" /> of the initial cost which the rest of the community would have to bear being returned to it in full measure in the future.  Modern industry and modern business are matters very much more complex and technical now than they were ten years ago.  We here have had little opportunity of learning or understanding the rapid technical, scientific and financial developments of recent years.  We are out of the main stream. We must, therefore, have as one object in adjusting our fiscal system the encouragement of those from whom we can learn to come to this country and set us an example.  We cannot ask the agricultural or any other section of the community to pay the cost of protecting industries for which the country may have no natural fitness or of maintaining an industry which takes no pains to or is incapable of meeting the requirements of efficiency.  I recognise fully that we cannot reasonably complain of our manufacturers or business men not possessing the knowledge or experience of &ldquo;captains of industry&rdquo; in Europe or America.  They deserve all credit for having kept things going under circumstances of great difficulty. But if the community is to accept obligations with a view to assisting the industrial side of our activities the industrial side, on its part, must satisfy us that every other means of making industry efficient has been conscientiously applied.</P>
    <P>Opinions may differ, and differ widely, as to how to determine what activities of a manufacturing kind are best suited to the Saorstát.  It must be largely a matter of opinion, and I doubt whether many of us forming a judgment can claim the qualifications of an expert.  I am not certain that in the future it may not be found that this country can develop prosperous manufactures of commodities to which at present we give little or no attention, and if we encourage industrial and manufacturing enterprises to regard An Saorstát as a country with possibilities where energy and efficiency will have reasonable protection, I think we shall find more than a few people ready to make discoveries for us.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, a rough guide as to the direction in which manufactures in this country might develop will be <Col N="543" /> found in the list of its principal imports. If the inhabitants of the country regularly consume particular commodities in large quantities, manufacturers of such commodities at home would have at least one essential element of efficient production under modern conditions&mdash;a large and stable home demand. If, moreover, it appears that included in such commodities are a number for which this country itself produces the raw materials, I think we could feel some confidence in selecting such commodities for a fiscal experiment.</P>
    <P>It would have to be admitted that in the beginning the cost of these commodities to the consumer would rise. The increase in price might in some cases be small, while in other cases it would inevitably be large.  The cost of living in the limited sense of the cost of the particular commodities on which the official cost of living figure is based, might not be directly affected. Nevertheless, what I might call the general cost of existence, must rise to some extent on the hypothesis that we started by protecting commodities of which the home consumption was large. This prospect might not, however, cause undue apprehension.  We are agreed, I think, that the cost of living in this country under present conditions is capable of considerable reduction, though we may not be agreed as to how best that result is to be obtained.  It is undeniably true that in many cases the present level of retail prices offers scope for reduction without any serious hardship to retailers and distributors.  Moreover, I think it is recognised that it may be possible to devise a limited system of protective duties which will not injuriously affect the overhead charges of our main industry, agriculture, and which can be modified, and perhaps extended, according as measures for the relief and development of that industry begin to show substantial results.  We have resources which, if the brains and energy of the country are seriously devoted to this economic question, provide us with ample reserves to meet contingencies.  But the brains and energy must be applied to their work <Col N="544" /> by all sections in the country if we are find a true economic balance.</P>
    <P>I have said that some rise in price is unavoidable at the outset of a protective system.  Deputies have endeavoured to prove that prices and the cost of living in protected countries are generally lower than in the free trade countries.  They have not wholly convinced me.  But there is no inherent reason why with careful discrimination any rise in prices for this cause should be unduly prolonged.  If we adopted a system of tariffs on commodities of which there was a large home consumption, it should follow that such tariffs would open a wide field at home for competitive manufacture. The larger the demand for the commodity protected, the greater the initial effect on prices; but, also, the larger the competitive field.  It would, however, be a field in which growths such as trusts or monopolies would have to be strictly supervised.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I can add much more to this debate.  This is a matter in which we need to proceed with great caution and deliberation, but I think it was due to the Dáil that I should express, first, the opinion of the Government that our industrial limb needs development, and, secondly, that special measures are necessary for that purpose.  A fiscal revolution, however, we do not contemplate, nor do we believe that it is the true destiny of this country to become a concentrated industrial region.  Between now and the time the Budget is presented, we will examine with all possible care the various directions in which changes would be made without undue prejudice to any section of the community. Whether the changes we have to propose will be few or many, I am not in a position to prophesy; but I believe that on examination we shall find that we must proceed slowly in the matter, that what we do must be largely of an experimental nature, and if it is shewn to us that any of our proposals involve dangers greater than their probable advantages we will be willing to modify or withdraw them.</P>
    <P>An important matter which has been mentioned more than once is the possibility of shifting duties from one set of <Col N="545" /> commodities to another, with a view to avoiding disturbances in the cost of living.  This we will carefully examine; but I am bound to say that the Minister for Finance, who has the responsibility of providing on a reasonably certain basis for the revenue of the country, cannot be expected to gamble too rashly on changes which offer him a less certain prospect, and which, if they have a genuinely protective effect, will to that extent deprive him of revenue. Nor must it be forgotten that an important element in this question is the possibility of collecting with reasonable economy and without undue inconvenience, whatever duties it were decided to adopt.  The Minister for Finance must pay close attention, closer attention than, I fear, is paid by many Industrialists and manufacturers, to his &ldquo;Costs of Production.&rdquo;  The external trade of this country, and particularly the import trade, is carried on through so many channels and often in such small quantities as to make the collection of duties a difficult and an expensive task.  The criticisms we have heard during the debate as to the absence of any adequate trade statistics can be attributed wholly to this cause.  Such statistics will soon be available; but it has proved an immense undertaking when our trade had first been thoroughly analysed, to provide the staff, machinery and organisation necessary for the detailed preparation of statistics, and, while the adoption of new duties would not necessarily involve additional expense for this purpose, it must involve a large expense in staff for customs work.  The Government is prepared to accept Deputy Milroy's motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I desired to call attention to the notice which appeared in this morning's papers over the signature of the Minister for Home Affairs respecting an announcement that a public meeting was to be held to-day at the railings, Kildare Street, and prohibiting the holding of that meeting under certain terms.  The sequel, perhaps, explains the advertisement.  It is known, I suppose, to Deputies generally that the public services of the police, military, naval or fire brigade forces are available for surprise demonstrations to show what can be done with such forces.  It now appears that the purpose of this notice was to show on short notice that the new Dublin Metropolitan Police can be gathered together to prove the quality of the men recruited in the last few months, and the ability of the new Commissioner of Police.  That may have been very satisfactory to the Minister.  It was very amusing to the Deputies who were coming here.  I had not the pleasure of participating in the exhibition, but I was told that there was a remarkable <Col N="547" /> show of physical capacity and valiant bearing in the streets adjacent to this building.  If that were the reason of the insertion of this notice I have no doubt that the Minister is well pleased with his experience.  To me it appeared earlier in the day that it was a remarkable thing that the Minister for Home Affairs should issue a notice of this kind over his name to deal with what to an ordinary person, with eyes or ears, was a mere exhibition of an eccentric. An announcement was made that a meeting was to be held in Kildare St. at 3 o'clock, an announcement at which everybody smiled, and which everybody knew was the mere exhibition of one who desired to show himself as an enthusiast in a particular cause.  The Minister took it seriously and apparently he thought it was necessary to have a demonstration in force to prevent any gathering of people in the neighbourhood of this house on the pretence or assumption that there was a danger to the public peace.  It was no doubt very desirable to prevent a public meeting at the entrance to the legislative chambers.  I quite agree, but a remedy was in the hands of the Commissioner of Police without the Minister for Home Affairs coming to his rescue, and if he was not capable of dealing with a matter of that kind, he is not fit for his job.  It should have been a small matter to disperse a few people, and move them on and let them hold their meeting out of the line of traffic, but what did the Minister do? This is the most serious part of what I have to say, and is my real reason for raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Citizens are guaranteed under the Constitution the right of public meeting and lawful assembly.  That presupposes some reasonable regard for public convenience, but that right of public meeting could have been granted and reasonable regard to public convenience still safeguarded, by mere police action without any display of force or the assumption that there was going to be a riot or an attack on Parliament House by an armed body of Protectionists, with Deputy Milroy at their head.  The notice which the Minister for Home Affairs signed, not <Col N="548" /> only ordered that the public meeting shall not be held in Kildare Street opposite Leinster House, but shall not be held anywhere within 500 yards radius of Kildare Street.  It prohibits any assembly for the purpose of holding any meeting, procession, or demonstration&mdash;not even in a house or building, nowhere for fear of a breach of the public peace.  If there was any fear of a breach of the public peace, surely the same fear would be occasioned by a meeting 501 yards away. It was apparently the intention to safeguard the convenience of members of the Dáil, and to do that, to crack that little nut, the Minister deemed it necessary to introduce the steam hammer. It is really preposterous that such an exhibition should be made for such a trifling threat.  My desire is to utter a warning that the rights of public meeting within decency, within reasonable convenience of the other members of the public must be safeguarded, and should not be interfered with by an order from the Minister for Home Affairs.  A slight police operation of this kind should be left to the discretion of the police in the locality, and the Minister ought not feel it necessary to give ponderous directions to police officers to bring all the forces into operation to prevent any possible gathering.  I thought it was necessary to raise this matter in this way.  I do not want to pretend that the safety of the nation is at stake or even that the Minister has designs on the right of public meeting; but I want to say that this is another straw which shows the necessity for very strict vigilance upon the rights of citizens under the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire briefly to add my word to what Deputy Johnson has said.  I came down Molesworth Street towards 2 o'clock to-day, and saw a most wonderful display. Policemen were drawn up across the whole street, shoulder to shoulder, while certain citizens, consisting mostly of small boys, were gazing in wonder and awe at this extraordinary display. I did not realise, until I recalled to my memory, the striking notice which the Minister for Home Affairs put in the papers this morning, the cause of this <Col N="549" /> display, and then I wondered whether I should feel more sorry for Deputies and Senators coming to their work in this place, or for the poor constables. I think that the result of the Minister's action is to make both the National Assembly and the D.M.P. utterly ridiculous in the eyes of citizens.  That is the first result which he has achieved, and I hardly think it was the result which he desired to achieve.  I met two Senators who had just come down Kildare Street, and we exchanged notes as to what had occurred at the Stephen's Green end, and they told me that they had seen an equal display there.  Apparently the whole place was in prison, and the police were prepared to hold the streets valiantly against all comers.  There is, however, a more important matter, to which Deputy Johnson has referred, namely, the constitutional right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will read Article 9, which embodies that right because it is quite clear and explicit.  It says:&mdash;&ldquo;The right of free expression of opinion as well as the right to assemble peaceably and without arms, and to form associations or unions is guaranteed for purposes not opposed to public morality.  Laws regulating the manner in which the right of forming association and the right of free assembly may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class distinction.&rdquo;  The Attorney-General will remember certain discussions with regard to that particular Article.  It says quite clearly that if there be any law regulating this matter, the right to hold public assembly shall be freely exercisable by citizens of the Irish Free State.  I think it desirable that some laws of the nature foreseen, in this Article should be introduced, but until there are such laws citizens have the right which should be exercised freely.  If it be undesirable that there should be public meetings held in Kildare Street, I, as one of those who reside in that street, will be very glad, but it should be embodied in the law, and I suggest there are other streets that might be brought within the cognizance of the Minister. There is a place called College Green where I remember a large meeting was held during an afternoon, and evening, <Col N="550" /> by a political party that entirely held up the traffic of the city of Dublin in those parts, because a political party was anxious to secure votes in an election.</P>
    <P>Now, if it was right to hold a meeting in College Green, and to hold up all traffic in College Green for the convenience of one Party, then it is equally right for another Party to hold a public meeting in another street for its own convenience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCARTHY Mr. McCARTHY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCARTHY</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DarrellFiggis" hpid="Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hold one.  Let the matter be regulated; let there be law; let there be places laid down where public meetings may be held, and apart from which places public meetings may not be held. When we have that, then let the regulations be exercised within them, but until such laws are made the fact remains that the Constitution has bestowed certain rights which are freely exercisable by citizens.  There is this constitutional matter, and there is also the other matter.  The constitutional matter is the more important, but the other has its importance, too, because I do not believe that, in spite of the brave display that they made, and the magnificent physique that each of them had, that the members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police to-day were altogether very proud of the show in which they were compelled to take a part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>As to whether the proposal to hold this meeting at the Kildare Street railings was or was not the exhibition of an eccentric, I leave Deputy Johnson to argue with citizen Oliver J. O'Connor.  The notice summoning the meeting called for attendance from North, South, East and West, and promised special facilities. Now, clearly had the meeting been held it would have established a precedent. I consider it highly undesirable that such a precedent should be created. Deputy Johnson suggests that there was no need for a notice, there was no need to tell the citizens that there was any objection to the holding of this meeting; that the police should deal with them when and if they assembled. <Col N="551" /> I want to put a case.  Had no notice been issued, had people really assembled in large numbers, had the police then come along and suggested a move, had that suggestion not been unanimously accepted by the crowd, had the police to use any degree of force whatsoever, I would have no more eloquent or emphatic critic in the Dáil than Deputy Johnson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I owe, perhaps, an apology to Deputy Figgis for having subjected him to the wondering gaze of small boys, and having so far encroached on his well-known shrinking modesty, but Deputy Figgis's patriotism will, I am sure, stand the strain; it was in the interests of the State.  He speaks of the guarantees in the Constitution. Does Deputy Figgis or Deputy Johnson, or any other Deputy, suggest that the Constitution guarantees the absolute right of meeting anywhere at any time?  Does he suggest, for instance, that under that Article of the Constitution meetings could be held <Col N="552" /> daily or hourly in Grafton Street, or any other place?  There is no absolute right of public meeting.  Perhaps the matter is best summed up in this statement by a judge in the hearing of a case:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is, no doubt, that the people of this country have a perfect right to meet for the purpose of stating what are, or even what they consider to be, their grievances. That right they have always had, and I trust always will have, but in order to transmit that right unimpaired to posterity it is necessary that it should be regulated by law and restrained by reason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A Bill is in course of preparation dealing with this whole matter of public meetings.  In the meantime, I can only hope that the exercise of whatever right exists will be restrained by reason, pending its being regulated by law.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.30 p.m. to 3 o'clock on Thursday, 24th January.</P>
