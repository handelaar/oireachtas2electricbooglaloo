      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the full duty of three and three-fifth pence per lb. is being charged on tinned fruits, and that the Revenue Commissioners state that they have no instructions as to any concession in the duty on this article, and whether, in view of the pledge which he gave the Dáil, and to prevent the hardship on the trading community caused by the unnecessary locking up of capital, he will issue instructions as to the concession forthwith.</P>

      <P>I am aware that duty is being charged at the rate of 3 3/5d. per lb. on imported fruits containing sugar or other sweetening matter.  As I announced on the Report Stage of the Finance Resolutions, the precise form which the promised concession in regard to certain classes of preserved fruit was to take had not then been decided.  In the Finance Bill which will be introduced at an early date I propose to provide for the admsision at a reduced rate of duty of 1 1/5d. per lb. of all fruit (not liable to duty as fruit) in syrup containing not more than 33 1/3 per cent. of sweetening matter.  Instructions will be issued to the Revenue Commissioners to give immediate effect to this provision, and cases in which duty has been paid at the higher rate since 26th April last <Col N="1050" /> will be adjusted and any moneys overpaid refunded.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether, having regard to the urgent necessity for houses, and the difficulty in securing the necessary sites in towns, steps will be taken to place portion of the military lands, taken over from the British Military Authorities, at the disposal of the local authorities, who would then have power to make free grants of sites under the Housing Act, 1924.</P>

      <P>The disposal of military lands for any purpose would involve important questions of principle which have not yet been determined.  The Deputy's suggestion will, however, receive consideration if he puts up particular instances where the lands could be put to useful purposes.  It can be understood that these lands are not in such a position that it is within the province of the Government to give them to any local authority.  They are the possession of the State and no local authority is entitled to get them simply because they are in their area.</P>

      <P>I understand the question to be the extent of the lands now in the hands of the Minister for Defence and the areas in which they are situate.  That is a question which is a little different from the other one. I would rather a question were put down on the subject.  I should say that I would not be in a position to answer it immediately.  If the Deputy would give me a week's notice.  I would endeavour to supply the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult <Col N="1051" /> to answer questions so general as that.  The lands are held under different tenures.  Some of them are held under the Land Commission.  Some of them are held under leases, and so on. It would be impossible to give a satisfactory answer to a general question of that kind.  There have been to my own knowledge two cases in which definite propositions were put up to us, and those are receiving at the present moment very careful consideration.</P>

      <P>In the absence of Deputy Pádraig Mac Ualghraig in whose name the amendment stands, I move to add to Section 6 the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1055" /> So far as may be, the officers and men stationed in a district which includes an area where the Irish language is in general use shall possess such knowledge of the Irish language as will enable them to use it with facility as a medium of communication in the performance of their duties.</P>
    <P>I should like to put the substance of the amendment before the Dáil and ask for its consideration and endorsement. So far we have accepted the Irish language as the official language of the nation, and where we are putting public officials into a place where Irish is the general language it is only right that we should ask that these officials would have a knowledge of the language that would make them intelligible to the people with whom they have to deal in the district.  Unfortunately, it is too true that this question of the language has not got the close attention which it should get from Government departments.  Men have been put into positions in districts where Irish is the language generally used, and yet these men are not capable of making themselves intelligible to the people with whom they have to deal. The knowledge of the language that extends to &ldquo;Connus tá tú&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dia 's Muire duit&rdquo; is not a knowledge of Irish.  They should have a knowledge of the language that would enable them to perform the duties that fall to them and that would bring the people in contact with them in the discharge of their duty.  The Gárda Síochána come in close contact with the people in the discharge of their duties, and in districts where the people are native speakers of the language the least that might be expected of them is that they should have a useful knowledge of the language that would make them intelligible to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeWolfe" hpid="Mr. WOLFE Mr. WOLFE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WOLFE</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to second this amendment.  I think it would be most inconsistent if, having adopted Gaelic as the official language of the country, we did not do everything in our power to advance it, particularly in districts where it is still going strong.  We have taken a great deal of care that Gaelic is taught in the schools <Col N="1056" /> to young people who will be soon leaving school and probably will be shortly speaking Gaelic in this Dáil.  I think, as I said before, it is very inconsistent if we do not give these people, who at present do not understand English, officials who do understand the language. In the Courts of Justice Bill which has passed into law that principle is recognised.  Districts in which Irish is spoken are to have justices or judges who understand the language. In view of that I think it would be altogether improper if we did not give every assistance to these people, and we should not confine it to the Irish-speaking districts alone.  We should extend the borders.  By-and-by we will all be able to speak Gaelic.  Even now, if the Dáil should so will it, we could have our debates in Irish.  If that should happen there would be no necessity to enforce the twenty-minutes rule for speeches.  I have great pleasure in seconding this amendment, and I hope the Dáil will see fit to approve of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to support the amendment standing in the name of Deputy McGoldrick.  I think if it errs at all it errs on the moderate side, because it would be better still if the words &ldquo;so far as may be&rdquo; were omitted, and that all officers and men stationed in a district which includes an area where the Irish language is in general use should have a spoken knowledge of the Irish language.  Under the old régime we know how the interests of the Irish language were neglected and officials sent to the Irish-speaking districts who did not understand the language of the people.  I, for one, freely admit that <Col N="1057" /> the present Commissioner of the Civic Guard, General Eoin O'Dufty, has done magnificent work for the language.  He has instituted classes for the teaching of Irish in the Depot, and, as far as possible, he is sending officers and men who know Irish to Irish-speaking districts. But, notwithstanding the great efforts that General Eoin O'Duffy has made there are frequent complaints that Civic Guards are stationed in Irish-speaking districts who do not know the Irish language.  We must fare the position as it may be in some years hence when a Commissioner might be at the head of the Guards who would not have the same sympathy for the Irish language as General Eoin O'Duffy.  It ought to be definitely stated in the law of the land that officers and men serving in these Irish-speaking districts should know the language. If it is not definitely stated, no matter what professions would be made the interests of the language will suffer.  I, therefore, support the amendment, and I hope the Minister for Justice will be able to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinChristopher" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Maille has referred to the Civic Guard.  There is no such force.  I am surprised at the Deputy.  Our feeling about this amendment is that it rather lays down a canon of conduct for administration, and that is scarcely a matter to be embodied in legislation.  The Deputies who spoke, particularly the last Deputy, have acknowledged that in the distribution, of the Gárda Siochána every care has been taken to allocate to Irish-speaking districts members possessed of a good working knowledge of the language.  They might have added that in recruiting preferential consideration is given to Irish-speaking candidates, and that a study of the language has been encouraged by the formation of classes at the Depot. Further, in the regulations recently made governing promotion in the Gárda.  Irish has been included as a compulsory subject for the educational examination which the members are required to pass in order to qualify for promotion.  Now, when that has been recognised, it seems to me a futile thing to write into your legislation a <Col N="1058" /> mere pious canon that &ldquo;in so far as may be&rdquo; you will do such a thing. The fact is, that &ldquo;so far as may be&rdquo; these things are being done.  The regulations that have been drafted and that have been approved insure that they will continue to be done.  There is no foundation for the suggestion that either the Gárda Síochána or the District Justices are Anglicising influences in any area.  More than one-third of the justices are Irish speakers and there is no English-speaking District Justice in an Irish-speaking area.  The difficulty about insuring that that will absolutely be the case with the Gárda Síochána is simply that it is not so easy to get a sufficiency of Irish-speaking candidates and Irish-speaking applicants for the Gárda Síochána who are otherwise suitable. When the Ministry of Education are able to create a supply for the demand that problem will be got over.  My only objection to the amendment, and I wish to stress it, is that I think that the principle of writing pious aspirations into what is essentially statutory legislation is undesirable.  If there is a departure from that canon of conduct the attention of the Deputies can be always drawn to that in the Dáil.  I think I have satisfied, or should have satisfied Deputies that there has been no departure; that, in fact, the who tenor is to insure that we will has a sufficiency of Irish-speaking Gárda to cater for Irish-speaking districts. But I do not think that it is wise or desirable to write in mere window-dressing aspirations into an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is arguing against this amendment because. so far as the Gárda Síochána is <Col N="1059" /> at present administered and governed, it is carrying out what this amendment desires to import into the Bill.  But let him think for a moment that it is possible that some person may be placed in his present position, who will not have the same desire that he has regarding the use of Irish in Irish-speaking districts.  At least that is a possibility, and if there is no provision in the Bill, no matter how often Deputies may raise the matter in the Dáil, the Minister can hide behind the statement that the Act does not provide for any such thing.  Now, the Minister under his new title will be responsible for certain duties in respect of the Courts of Justice Bill, and the Minister with his colleagues was responsible for the passing of this Bill through the Oireachtas.  In at least two places in the Courts of Justice Act, provision has been made for a knowledge of the Irish language being requisite for justices. Surely if it was requisite in the case of justices it is equally requisite and more so in the case of the police who are acting in the area.  Perhaps the Minister was not in favour of this provision m the Courts of Justice Bill.  But he did not express his disapproval of it when it was brought up first in the Seanad, and secondly in the Dáil; he did not ask the Deputies to divide against the insertion of the amendment which the Seanad put into the Bill.  I take it that he agreed that in the case of the District Justices it was desirable that a provision of this kind should be inserted in the Act.  My reasoning leads me to the conclusion that if it was desirable in the case of the District Justices it is still more desirable in the case of Gárda Síochána, who are constantly and perpetually in touch with the people concerned.  I do not think the Minister has met the arguments in favour of the amendment when he is asking us to leave it to the discretion of the administrative officers.</P>

      <P>The point that the Deputy ignored is that the Minister politically responsible for the Gárda Síochána will be at all times subject to the criticism of the Dáil, and responsible to the Dáil.  If there is any departure <Col N="1060" /> from, what is admitted to have been the practice hitherto, attention to that can be called here.  I suggest that that is the important matter rather than writing down your aspirations in a Bill.  I attach absolutely no importance either to the presence of the amendment in the Bill or the absence of it.  What does matter, and what will matter in the future is, what the actual practice is.  If any future Minister or Commissioner of the Gárda wants to do so, he can sail away under cloak of that, &ldquo;As far as may be.&rdquo;  The amendment is neither worth the time nor the discussion that is given to it.</P>

      <P>When he tells us it is a pious aspiration, I wonder does he think we should not carry it through in legislation?  If he intends to carry the principle through, what is the difference of embodying it in legislation? If it is the intention of the Government to observe this principle, what objection can they have to introducing it into legislation?  The Minister says that the Gárda and the District. Justices will not Anglicise any district. To anybody who knows Irish-speaking districts, it is evident that it is such men as these who will have great influence in Anglicising or otherwise the districts where Irish is spoken.  It may be safely argued that in the Irish Colleges <Col N="1061" /> there are many English-speaking people residing in order that they may become Irishised, but the very opposite effect is brought about, and the English speakers actually Anglicise those speaking Irish instead of the contrary. If you introduce numbers of the Gárda who will be doing business in the country in English, you will be Anglicising the districts entirely.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the Government will continue the policy of encouraging the native language amongst the Gárda.  Will he tell us how many of the Gárda speak Irish at the present time?  We are told that a system has been introduced by which they can learn Irish.  Why cannot Irish speakers from the western and southern seaboards, men of fine physique who would be capable of carrying out police duties, be recruited for the Gárda and when they are well equipped and trained, sent to the Irish-speaking districts? To many of us this question of encouraging the Irish language is not a pious aspiration; it is a dreadful reality.  If we are to save the Irish language we must be in earnest about it.  Unless we are in earnest and put officials who are Irish speakers into Irish speaking districts, I do not think that anybody will believe that the Government are in earnest in trying to save the mother tongue.</P>

      <P>This Bill is necessary by reason of the intention to expend a considerable sum of money&mdash;between one and a half and two millions&mdash;in this financial year on the improvement of the roads in the Saorstát.  The Road Fund, out of its existing resources, could not meet the expenditure.  The current normal income of the Road Fund would be about £350,000 from motor duties, and about £285,000 in respect of the sixpenny rate.  That will <Col N="1062" /> continue in addition to this year for three more years, although a great proportion of the reconstruction of bridges and so forth, for which that sixpenny rate will be liable, will be done before the end of that period.  In addition to the £635,000 which will come into the Road Fund this year, there will be a carry over from last year, including a considerable proportion of the sixpenny rate which was not paid, and other sums which we hope to get. Nevertheless there will be a deficit of at least half a million in the amount required to carry out the road scheme. It is proposed to advance money from the Exchequer to the Road Fund, and it will be repayable in subsequent years out of the Road Fund's ordinary income and out of the sixpenny rate. As a matter of fact, a considerable proportion of it will be payable out of the sixpenny rate, and there ought not to be a very considerable deduction from the ordinary income of the Road Fund in future years&mdash;at least, not so much as seriously to cripple the operations of the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with, I think this sum of £750,000 suggests that the Ministry is again proposing to tinker with this problem of making new roads on the one hand, and by means of making new roads, absorbing large numbers of unemployed men. The question arises as to whether, under the present administration of the Local Government Department, value is being received from the expenditure on these roads&mdash;value in any particular&mdash;whether value is being obtained in general satisfaction as to the administration, and also whether value is being obtained in the relief of distress and in the direction of road-making. It is quite clear from what one has learned in the course of discussions, public and private, in regard to the administration of this Road Fund, that there is no very clear principle actuating the minds of the Ministry. As has already been explained in discussions last year, the Department concerned, with the Executive Council at the time, seemed to have clearly made up their minds that it was bad politics to administer a Road Fund as a Distress Fund, and <Col N="1063" /> use this work of reconstructing roads as distress work.  That will be generally agreed to&mdash;that money advanced for public works and treated as distress and relief work, is badly administered as a rule.  One learned that the Ministry at that time had arrived at the conclusion that relief work, in the generally accepted sense, was uneconomic and was not likely to give value. I would like to know what is the mind of the Minister in that respect, and, more important still, whether the Dáil desires that this Fund should be administered for relief work.  Deputy McGarry, last night, raised a question which, I think, is important and ought to be stressed in the discussion of this Bill.  It was that by the present method of administration, where the payment out of this Fund is being determined according to certain standards which are very difficult to understand, but which are set down by the Ministry, who will be responsible for this work, you are mixing up relief work with ordinary work, and in the working out it is the relief side of the work which prevails without reckoning the value obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you put 20 men upon a job, 10 of them taken in because they are fit in no way for the work, and say that the other 10 will have to show them how to do it, in the circumstances in which this money is being administered at the present time it is the ten that are being told that this is relief work and who are to be preferred even to anybody else, and in fact it does not matter how they work themselves, whose pace will set the pace for the whole.  I think anyone who has experience of the country will agree that a great part of this work, which is being carried out under the Minister for Local Government under the conditions prescribed, is being badly done, and value is not being got for the grant, and that it is not practicable in the circumstances for the people supervising the work to get the value out of the men that should be demanded.  You began the administration of this fund by telling the men they must work at a lower rate than the standard, because they are not as good as the standard; that they are men not to be treated as efficient men, <Col N="1064" /> men not used to working on the roads, not as good as men used to working on the roads, and not expected to give the same value for their pay as the ordinary road workers would give.  And, of course, that standard having been set by the Minister, it is followed by the supervisors and surveyors, and eventually by the men themselves, and the work is being badly done.  It is going to cost very much more than it would otherwise, and the satisfaction that might be looked for if the fund had been administered on understandable lines with a clear principle operating, will not be obtained by any section of the community.</P>
    <P>I think the House should demand that the conditions which have hitherto been set down by the Minister, in the administration of this fund, shall be withdrawn, that people who are used to the work on the roads ought to be employed on the roads as far as possible, that as others are brought in they should be brought in clearly on the understanding that they are to be paid the standard rate, and that they will be tuned up as quickly as possible to give the standard output which, it may be interesting for Deputy Good to know, is much higher than the output of the special road grantees.  If the administration of this fund is to be quite clearly for the purposes of relief, then we shall know where we are.  If it was intended that the administration of this fund was to give employment to a large number of men, I agree you could multiply this sum by five or six and still get value and a good return for the money spent, but if you are going to treat the men engaged in this work as part of a big scheme to absorb unemployed men, then you have to take these men and deal with them as you would have if they were engineers in the army and give them the opportunity of getting used to the work, and you should not cut their pay simply because they are new.  It does not happen as a matter of fact when you take men to do engineering work in the army that you pay them something short because they are recruits.  But this system that the Ministry is adopting, first of fixing the rate to be paid which is lower than the standard rate, and second, of insisting that a certain <Col N="1065" /> proportion of people who are not fit for the work shall be employed in each group of men, having the effect of generally lowering the standard of the whole team, is a bad principle and is not going to bring credit to the Ministry or to any of the local authorities who are indirectly responsible for the administration of this Bill.  I would suggest to the House that in considering this Bill we should demand that a change shall take place in the conditions under which the money is being administered and in the conditions that have been laid down by the Minister for Local Government, and if we do that in regard to this sum it will have the effect of getting very much better value than the monies already sanctioned to be spent on the reconstruction of the roads in the Saorstát.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterHughes" hpid="Mr. HUGHES Mr. HUGHES">
      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite agree with all the arguments that Deputy Johnson has put forward. From my experience of handling this grant, it is not a fact that every man. no matter what his capabilities are, whether he was a clerk, or whatever he might have been in the past, should be taken on and get work under this grant.  The instructions, as well as I remember, that were sent out by the Department were to the effect that suitable men of the National Army, where they were to be found, were to be employed.  Suitable men meant men suited to the work, and that being so, and from my experience in the place I come from, there are plenty of men who are suited for the work, but who cannot be employed owing to the smallness of the grant going to the district. The men are willing to work for the wages that are being offered.  The pity is that they have to be turned away, as there is not enough of money to go around.  These are not men of the class that Deputy Johnson speaks of who would need to be trained in another gang and absorbed, as they are found to be suited, in the work.  They are men who are capable for the work and who have had experience of that class of work, even though they may not have been road-makers.  In the past they have been employed at work that makes them skilled men for road-making. There is no use in trying to bring this matter into two sections&mdash;<Col N="1066" /> first, by calling it relief work, and then saying it should be done in some other way.  I say that what is wanted in the country at the present time&mdash;I do not mind under what name it goes&mdash;is to get work and to get men employed.  It is all very well to say that it is relief work.  Any work that the Government gives, and for the doing of which it hands out money to ease unemployment, must get the name of relief work.</P>

      <P>It does not follow from that that the men taken on to do that work are to do as little as they can or to work when they like.  I say that the men employed under this grant should be in the same position as men in ordinary employment, and if they do not give satisfaction they should go just the same as men in ordinary employment.  I believe, and I am convinced, that there are plenty of men who are suitable in the country, and who are able and willing to do this work.  I do not care what name it gets, but my idea is that we should get on with the work and stop all the talk about this.</P>

      <P>It is not easy to find out what is the intention of this Bill. Is it to legalise the amount of money which the Road Fund has been supplemented by under the recent grant? If it is, to my mind this Bill should not be given a second reading, because as we are living in abnormal times, I do not think it could be expected that the Road Board Fund would fully serve the purpose for which it is intended. It is all very well to talk about relief work, arid it is all very well for Deputy Hughes to criticise the remarks of Deputy Johnson, and to insinuate that Deputy Johnson was in some way encouraging slackness.</P>

      <P>What I was saying was that the inference could be drawn from the Deputy's remarks.  The Deputy says that what the country wants is work.  He is a member of the Government Party, and I suggest that he ought to use his influence in the direction of trying to provide work for the people, as he must know that the demand of the people is for work. The cry all over the country to-day is for work, and I am very sorry to see that some people are developing such a callous mind.  It is apparent that there must be callous minds amongst the ranks of the Government Party, as they are not taking any notice of that cry.  The situation is becoming worse every day, and I fear we shall reach a state of affairs before long when something must of necessity be done to provide work for the people.</P>
      <P>It is to my mind a rather unfortunate thing that this Bill is introduced at this stage, because we read in the newspapers this morning that it is included in the draft of the Local Government Bill that certain roads in the country should be taken over as a national charge.  I think it would have been advisable to have the draft of that Bill before the Dáil so that we could see what are its terms and application, so far as the National charge is concerned, before we are asked to deal with this Bill.  To my mind what we are asked to do now is to legalise what has already been done.  It is not a question of providing more money for unemployment, but of enabling the Minister for Finance to take back from the Road Fund the amount of money which he gave the Road Fund when making the recent grant, and of putting this back into the Exchequer.  As far as I can see it is only tinkering with the question or rather robbing Peter to pay Paul.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. SHAW</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that Deputies on these benches have not been as interested with regard to unemployment as they should have been. That is not so, because a Committee of <Col N="1068" /> five members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party were appointed to prepare and submit schemes to the Government so that they might be approved of.  These five members are well-known Deputies of the Dáil, and they have spent a considerable time in drawing up a scheme.  That scheme has been submitted to the Government, and I expect we will be getting a reply soon.  I hope and trust the reply will be favourable, because it is perfectly apparent to everyone that work must be started.  It is a very important matter, because&mdash;regardless of the cost, and if the cost has to be borne by future generations it makes no difference&mdash;there are a great many people in the country starving, and I say it is up to every Deputy in the Dáil to do all he can to endeavour to provide work for the people who are looking for it.  We have had a great deal of trouble and difficulty lately in connection with the wages question.  This money is given away voluntarily and it cannot be expected that the rate of wages on the roads is going to be the same as for men in ordinary regular employment.  If the wages are lower it is right that they should be, because the money was coming out of Government funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I call them rate-payers. The sixpence in the pound which comes from that Central Fund is collected from the local rates.  We are not very much concerned whether you call the people who pay that money taxpayers or ratepayers, but what we are very much concerned with is the question of getting value for the money spent.  We believe that the amount of money available is not sufficient to meet the needs of unemployment, but at the same time I think it comes badly from the Labour side to be making objection to the taking of that money from the Central Fund until some better method of finding money presents <Col N="1069" /> itself.  Deputy Corish's idea is that we should not give this Bill a Second Reading. If we were to do that it would prevent the flow of this £750,000 from the Central Fund to supplement the Road Fund.  I think that is a very curious proposal to come from the Labour side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. CORISH Mr. CORISH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. CORISH</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I wish to say that I was under the impression that this £750,000 was money that had been overdrawn from the Central Fund when the grants were being given to the local Councils, and now this is to legalise that&mdash;to take it back and put it into the Central Fund.  I think the Minister for Finance will agree with that.  I think it is only right to say that the sixpenny rate referred to by Deputy Wilson has been collected from all classes of people as well as the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Corish I desire to say that this is to enable the money to be advanced from the Exchequer to the Road Fund.  The money has not yet been advanced from the Exchequer to the Road Fund, but if it was not advanced soon the Road Fund would be empty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. WILSON Mr. WILSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and therefore the conclusion I wish to draw is that Deputy Corish in the attitude he has taken up is not acting in the best interests of the people whom he represents. We are the payers, to a great extent, of this money, and we are naturally anxious that we should get value for it.  We have to pay our labourers at the price that is being offered to these men, and we do not see that there is any great reason for complaint about it at all on the part of the workers.  There are as good and efficient men working for the farmers at the same rate of wages, and I do not see what great hardship there is in asking men who have got no work to work at this rate.  I think it is a reasonable proposition, and I am glad the Ministry had the forethought to make it.  When the 6d. subsidy has expired&mdash;it has three years to run&mdash;we hope that the farmers will not be asked to continue it, because those main roads will be put on the Central Fund.  I will not say any further on that until we see the <Col N="1070" /> Local Government Bill.  I do not suppose I would be in order in referring to the incidence of taxation in connection with this Road Board, although a considerable portion of the funds are derived from it.  As I understand it, the remuneration offered by the Local Government Department is equal to that paid to the agricultural workers in the different areas for which the grants are given, with a slight percentage of increase in some cases.  From that point of view we are satisfied that the wage offered is sufficient, and if we get value for the money we are not quarrelling at all with the fact that we have to pay the piper.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes, I think, answered Deputy Johnson's questions fairly effectively.  I wish very strongly to dissent from the point of view of Deputy Johnson that this money is being given exclusively as a grant in relief of distress.  It was not with such an object in view at all that this grant was given.  Undoubtedly, the fact that there was a great deal of unemployment in the country was taken into consideration in connection with the administering of the grant. We took into consideration the fact that in some districts there was a great deal of unemployment, and in other districts there was practically none. In that way we allowed work to be done on certain roads which we otherwise would not have allowed to be included in our trunk road scheme. In no other respect can it be regarded as relief work, except in so far as any work done in the country at the present time.  when the country is not in a too healthy economic condition, may be regarded as relief work. Naturally we have given preference to suitable demobilised soldiers, and I make no apology to Deputy Johnson or anybody else for that.  Deputy Johnson has said that we are not getting as efficient work as if we had employed the ordinary skilled road workers.  It is well to bear in mind the fact that en this occasion we are making available a larger amount of money for road work than was ever made available in any one year in this <Col N="1071" /> country before.  Even if we desired to confine this grant to the ordinary road workers we would not be able to do so, because there would not be sufficient of them to carry out the work. The County Councils in their estimates are supposed to provide for the same amount of road work as in a normal year.  In the ordinary course of events that should give work to the ordinary men employed on road work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnson has referred to the fact that we are not employing these men at the standard rate.  I do not know exactly what Deputy Johnson means by the standard rate.  We did our best to find out the standard rate. We got the experts of our Department together.  It was they drew up the scale of wages for workers in the different counties, and that scale was fixed in relation to the agricultural wage.  Except in very rare cases the wage was fixed at a standard of about 3s. above the agricultural wage in the agricultural districts, and a much higher wage was fixed for the different towns.  So I do not think that the members on the opposite benches have anything to complain about with regard to the wages.</P>

In what other direction can we tackle the unemployment problem?  You are not going to tackle the Barrow Drainage or any other large public scheme. Therefore we are thrown back upon the roads, and I think the least the Government might do is to provide £2,000,000.  If they do so it will be an earnest to the people that they are trying to do what is right.</P>

      <P>With reference to this amendment, before the discussion proceeds any further, I would like to make the Government position clear, in so far as that position is affected by Section 29. and a section which must be read with it&mdash;Section 58.  The original intention was that Section 29 should deal merely with the protection of ports, and that it should have relation only to statutory enactments or any agreements coming within the limits of and depending upon statutory enactments.  Section 58 was, then, to deal with agreements.  As a result of the debate last night, it has become clear that Section 29 may be construed. as drafted, in rather wide fashion, and it has been determined that such words as &ldquo;agreement in force and binding&rdquo; had better be left out, and that the clause should have relation only to &ldquo;all the terms, conditions and provisions of any statutory enactment which at the date of this Act...&rdquo; I do not pretend here to be defining exactly the clause as it will afterwards appear. It is to have relation only to statutory enactments and such agreements as depend upon and are within the limits of such statutory enactments.  Section 58 will have relation to agreements.  If <Col N="1073" /> that proposal be acceptable to the Dáil, and putting that as the Government's proposition with regard to these two clauses, I want to deal briefly with certain agreements or certain enactments referred to in the discussion on amendment 15 (a).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has made the position about as clear as mud.  The controversy that has exercised the attention of the Dáil in connection with clause 29 is very clear. As far as the Great Western and Great Southern Railways operations are provided for in statute, I think equally an arrangement as between the L.M.S. and the Dublin South Eastern Railway Company is statutory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HEWAT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where we come to the difference.  That is exactly the point we want to arrive at.  I maintain, as representing the Dublin Port and Docks Board, that the agreement, if carried out, whether it is embodied in the statute or otherwise, is nationally and locally and every other way wrong.  If this House is going to take up the position that they have no power in a case of the kind or have no authority to consider a question of that kind, then I think they are taking up a position representing inferiority in this House.  In my judgment, we are here as elected representatives with power to legislate.  In the legislature for all time one Act of Parliament cancels provisions in another Act of Parliament. In this particular case, the President says he is not going to stand for the scrapping of agreements.  Parliament has always stood for the scrapping of agreements, and Parliament is the only body which ever had the power to do that as between individuals.  The law says that two particular individuals or two particular companies are bound by the agreements entered into.  That is exactly where Parliament comes in. Parliament over and over again says that it is against the public interest that that agreement should continue and Parliament abrogates it in certain terms.  That is the position I take up to-day as regards this particular agreement between the railways operating from Rosslare.  The President says a bargain is a bargain.  Of course, a <Col N="1075" /> bargain is a bargain.  But the amalgamated company, when it is operating an agreement of the sort that is now in force, must inevitably influence one port and one district as compared with another.  When the Minister brings this Bill before us he has got to face all those questions, and the Bill has got to settle these things before it can become a satisfactory Act of Parliament.  Does the Minister propose to continue this agreement, whereby traffic can be taken by Dublin <i>via</i> Rosslare?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to continue.  Let me leave this question of the wording of Section 29 until I have explained my position in regard to the several Acts and agreements mentioned yesterday.  The first in date of these agreeemnts is really not a matter for this Bill at all.  It was raised by Deputy Redmond, who referred to Section 70 of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbour Act of 1898.</P>
      <P>Section 70 provides for the continuance of a daily service by steamer with Waterford.  As far as that Act is concerned, this Bill does not touch it.  It has been taken over with the general legislation.  It is law in this country, and it is operative.  If there is any breach of it, there is a remedy.  This Bill has nothing whatever to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister does he judge that the Government and the Parliament here have authority over the Great Western Railway who own those steamboats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said anything of the sort.  I said that the Act still remains, and that there is a remedy if anybody is aggrieved.  The next Act mentioned is the 1899 Act, Section 19 of the 7th Schedule, and it is the particular point relied upon to argue against this section. Deputy Redmond, in reading out the terms of that, did what any of us would do in the circumstances.  He stressed the points material to his argument, and rather glossed over matters favourable to, say, my particular side <Col N="1076" /> of the case.  I want to give the section as it stands: &ldquo;The two companies agree to forward <i>via</i> the Rosslare route traffic of all descriptions that they can control between such portions of these districts served by their respective systems in the South and West of Ireland and the South and West of England, including London, as may be hereafter agreed between them, and that can inthe interest of the public be most conveniently forwarded by the Rosslare route.&rdquo;  Now, that is the main agreement. The important points in it are&mdash; such traffic as they can control and as can in the interests of the public be most conveniently forwarded by the Rosslare route.  Now, it is proposed to continue that and to keep that, and have it in full and binding force under the terms of this Bill.  It agrees with the principle at the back of the Bill, that the public interest is to be the paramount consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister then contend that privately-owned railway companies are anxious to serve the public interest before they will serve their own and suit their own convenience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with their anxiety.  I am only concerned with what we can compel them to do.  &ldquo;That can in the interest of the public be most conveniently forwarded&rdquo;&mdash;that is the quotation from the Act.  That traffic is restricted to such traffic as they can control&mdash;that is the unconsigned traffic. That is the whole gist of the agreement and that is the whole enactment we propose to take over.  The public interest is the big consideration at the back of it, and if there is any question of any undue diversion of traffic, that is attended to.  As far as this enactment is concerned, and in so far as it is taken over, the ruling consideration before the tribunal will be&mdash;&ldquo;Is it in the interest of the public the most convenient route?&rdquo;  That comes in after you have decided that it is traffic they can control, a traffic amounting to 10 per cent. of the Great Southern and Western Railway traffic.  Now, that is the main Act.  It is an honest proposition to take that over.  It is in full agreement with the ideas at the back of the Railway Bill, and besides that, it is an agreement <Col N="1077" /> founded on very good considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Clauses 34 and 35 deal with the ordinary type of exceptional rate.  This rate was well known for particular types of traffic. It has nothing to do with exceptional rates granted in order to prejudice one port as against another.  Section 29 is the Protection of Ports section, and it has to deal with that only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the statutory agreements,&rdquo; and that is a very definite point.  Sub-section (2) is subject to the 1899 agreement.  What is in the 1899 agreement that can be criticised here, as I have read it, taking all these points and giving them their due consideration?  Is that an honest Act, and is it an Act such as we would pass ourselves with regard to Rosslare? Is there anything in the public interest that can be said against the 1899 Act? If there is not, why criticise its being taken over and included under the terms of this Bill?  Why criticise sub-section (2) as being limited by that 1899 Act, and the section of that Act, which, in my opinion, is a very honest section?  There is the other point raised that we have this subsidiary agreement of 1905, and we are told that traffic has been, and must be diverted from Dublin even to Rosslare.  Now, this agreement is subsidiary to the 1899 Act.  The preamble states so much, and it really relates back to that section of the Seventh Schedule which I read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I emphasise one point about the Seventh Schedule?  &ldquo;The companies agree to forward <i>via</i> Rosslare. traffic of all descriptions they can control between such portions of the districts served by their respective systems in the south and west of Ireland <Col N="1078" /> and the south and west of England, including London, as may be hereafter agreed.&rdquo;  To implement that section, the 1905 agreement is brought forward. Now, the 1905 agreement was known.  Deputy Johnson, I think, raised the question whether this agreement had been adverted to.  It was known.  It is definitely subsidiary to Section 19 of the Seventh Schedule of the 1899 Act and is governed by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard Deputy Hewat say it is.  It is operating in a way that is not necessary, if what Deputy Hewat says is an actual description of the facts.  &ldquo;Such districts in the south and west of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;that applies to Dublin, according to Deputy Hewat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 purports to have it.  Section 3 is governed by Section 19 of the Seventh Schedule to the 1899 Act, and is overridden by it.  Now, it is arguable if Dublin can be construed as being in the south and west of Ireland.  But, leaving that point alone, this Act is still governed by the other phrase in the 1899 Act. That is to say, is it in the interest of the public and can it be most conveniently forwarded?  If traffic from Dublin can in the interest of the public be most conveniently forwarded via Rosslare, then it is going to go by Rosslare.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the tribunal to decide afterwards; it is not for the Dáil to decide.  If traffic cannot conveniently be forwarded by Rosslare, then that agreement is worth nothing.  That agreement depends on the other Act, and the other Act safeguards the public interest, and it has to have decided that it is the most convenient route before that route can be availed of.  I wonder is there going to be anything further said about the 1905 agreement, because, if there is, I would like to answer it immediately.</P>

      <P>Personally I agree with the Minister, and I am going to oppose the amendment and vote against it if a division on Deputy Redmond's amendment is taken.  I think the clause protects the ports, leaving them free to do the same amount of business as they did before.  I believe that the smaller ports in An Saorstát should get equal treatment with the larger ports. Anybody who has any experience in the years gone by, of the working of the port of Dublin, will agree that those responsible for it have brought upon themselves a lot of the trouble that at present exists. Traders were badly treated, to my own knowledge, for a number of years by the port of Dublin, the Port and Docks Board, who are opposing a good many clauses of this Bill.  They took no action to cater for the traffic that is coming here to the port of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that I would like to ask the Minister, and it is this: will the unified companies have power to run their own boats to cross-Channel ports, and will any of the agreements under this Bill prevent them doing so?  You have two railway systems in England at present through which the traffic goes, and they have their own boats.  And if in the course of time we here wanted to start our own boats in connection with this unified system, will we have the power, or is there any clause in the agreement arrived at in 1905 which, would prevent that being done?  Is there anything in that agreement which will prevent the unified system from starting boats of their own?  That is the point I would like to have cleared up, because the question might arise, and some of the companies on the other side might refuse through boats.  Then it would be up to the unified system here to take whatever measures they could adopt to protect Irish interests and Irish trade.  I know that so far as the port of Waterford is concerned, they have not in the past lost much traffic.  Waterford was nearly the second port in Ireland, and it was oftentimes <Col N="1080" /> to my own knowledge as difficult to get live stock through it as it was to get a camel through the eye of a needle.  I do not think it will interfere much by having those agreements remain.  Because, after all, it is a very small percentage, the unconsigned traffic that is within the power of the company to divert.  The greater part of the traffic is consigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has rightly stated that any dispute arising out of a complaint in relation to the question of the diversion of traffic is a matter for the tribunal to decide.  I admit that, because it is provided for in Sub-section 4 of Section 29.  But when the tribunal is called upon to deal with any complaint arising out of the diversion of traffic, they must pay due regard to any existing agreements that have been carried over in the Bill.  That is the Bill that is now before the Dáil.  When you come to consider the question on the merits of any complaint dealing with the unfair diversion of traffic, you have got to recognise that this Bill does not seek any control over the internal administration of the amalgamated company, so that the amalgamated company will always have the power to regulate its own train service and to carry out its other administrative functions.  Now, if the amalgamated company is anxious to put up a case for the diversion of traffic from the Dublin port, where the Dublin Port will be the natural route, they can so regulate their train service that the train service would be better in the direction of Rosslare, than through Dublin, though Dublin would be the shorter distance from the point where the traffic is consigned.</P>

I am sorry the President is not here, because he made a statement yesterday evening which I think it would be advisable to deal with before we pass away from the section.  However, before we get away from this particular contentious section, we may have an opportunity of dealing with this.  I quoted a clause from the agreement of 1905 to prove that if that agreement is re-enacted in this Bill it will give all the powers which the amalgamating companies are anxious to secure in order to divert traffic out of its natural route.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that following the agreement of 1905 between the Great Southern and Western Railway and the Great Western Railway of England, the Great Southern and Western deliberately refused to agree to through facilities via the port of Dublin.  Is the Minister aware of that?  If he is not, he should look at the proceedings of the Railway and Canals Commission of May, 1907, where a complaint was made and brought before the Commission dealing with that very question.  I am making that point now to show that if the agreement of 1905 is carried over and powers are given to the amalgamated company to make use of this agreement, it can be used to the disadvantage of the Port of Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the coming into operation of the 1905 Act, the Great Southern and Western Railway Company refused to agree to through rate facilities from any point mentioned <Col N="1082" /> in the Act of 1899, or the Supplementary Agreement of 1905. via the Port of Dublin.  That was in keeping with their previous agreement with the Great Western Co., to use all the powers at their disposal to divert traffic via Rosslare and Waterford. That complaint was brought before the Railway and Canal Commission in 1907 by the Cork Harbour Commissioners. the Waterford Harbour Commissioners. the London and North Western Railway Co., and the findings of the court are something which the Minister should take very serious notice of in order that it may be proved to him how this agreement, if used by the amalgamated company, can be used in the direction I indicated.</P>
      <P>The finding of the Commission is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Now, therefore, this Court, having heard counsel and witnesses for the London and North Western Railway Company, the Great Southern and Western Railway Company, the Cork Harbour Commissioners and the Waterford Harbour Commissioners, doth declare that the Great Southern Company have not fulfilled their obligations under sub-sections 1 and 2 of section 34 of the Great Southern and Western and Waterford and Limerick and Western Railway Companies Amalgamation Act, 1900, and by means of their rates and fares have placed the Port of Dublin at an undue disadvantage as compared with the ports of Rosslare and Waterford, and failed to give all reasonable facilities to induce traffic to pass to, from and <i>via</i> Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And this court doth adjudge: &ldquo;That the Great Southern Company forthwith take all reasonable and necessary steps for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations under the said section of the said Act of 1900 and put into operation a reasonable system of through booking with through rates and fares via Dublin to and from all ports in England, Scotland and Wales as from time to time they have regular direct steamship communication with Dublin. between stations on the railway of the Great Southern Company on the one hand and stations on the English, Scottish and Welsh railways on the <Col N="1083" /> other hand, and so far as they can control or influence the same such through bookings to stations beyond their system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will secure, if it is not at his disposal already, a copy of that complaint made before the Railway and Canal Commission and get the decision arrived at as a result of that complaint.  I take it that any findings of the Railway and Canal Commission in regard to a complaint of that kind, do not stand good under the terms of this Bill.  Any complaint that may. now arise as a result of the extension of these powers under the 1905 agreement to the new amalgamated company will have to be a new subject of complaint to the tribunal, and the matter will take a long time to decide.  The Minister said if there was anything in the 1899 Act or that agreement that was against the public interest or likely to unduly prejudice any port inside of the Free State area that the tribunal will have to take that into consideration. Now, if the existing agreements are carried over, as statutory enactments particularly, I think the tribunal will not be free to decide these questions on their merits so long as these things are re-enacted in the Bill now before the House.  I would like the Minister to give the opinion of the Government as to how the tribunal can deal with cases such as I have referred to, or whether or not it is understood that even in spite of existing agreements they will still have the power to cancel any such arrangement as that made under the 1905 Act if it is prejudicial to any particular port inside the Free State or to the trading community as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like to say a few words on the points raised in regard to my own statement concerning this agreement.  The Minister says this Bill has got nothing whatever to say to the Fish guard and Rosslare Harbours Act of 1898.  Section 70 provides that there shall be a daily service of steamers from Waterford, and this section goes on to say that the Railway and Canal Commissioners shall have the same powers for enforcing this provision as they have for enforcing other <Col N="1084" /> provisions of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1854.  I would like the Minister to inform the House what effect this Bill will have upon the Railway and Canal Commission, and if it has any effect upon it, it surely therefore must have some effect upon this-section of this Act.  What I really want to know is what tribunal the aggrieved parties&mdash;say, the Waterford Harbour Commissioners&mdash;have a right of appeal to as they had under this Act of 1898.  For this Bill affects not only the specific agreement between the various companies, but it must affect all previous enactments in regard to the management of Irish ports, especially this Section 29.  It deals, as the Minister has said, exclusively with ports, and the reason why I quoted this enactment dealing with the daily services from Waterford was in answer to the President's arguments that a bargain was a bargain, and that contracts should not be broken, and my attitude was, and is, that such enactments should all stand together and be enforced together, or that they should all be repealed.  The Minister has proposed certain alterations in this section, the gist of which, and consequences of which, I must confess, I am at a loss to understand; but as far as I can gather the effect of this proposed amendment would be to confine the whole of Section 29 to the statutory agreements.  Now, when referring to the agreement between the London and North Western Railway and the Dublin and South Eastern Railway in regard to the appointment of a director upon the latter company last evening I was asked a question by the President and I was not then in a position to reply to it.  The President asked me whether that agreement was a statutory one or not.  I said as far as I understood it was not, but I could not positively say.  Since then I have gone to the trouble of looking up the debates in this House, and I find that on the 9th May, 1924, Deputy Alfred Byrne, in moving amendment 24, made a very concise statement in regard to this particular agreement, in which he said&mdash;and it was not denied&mdash; that it was an enactment, and that it was subsequently confirmed by Acts of the British Parliament.  I have also got with me the Acts he referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> The Act of 1870, the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Act, specifically states, Section 29, that the London, North Western Railway shall have power to appoint one of the directors to the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Company, provided that certain conditions were fulfilled, and that enactment was subsequently embodied in the Schedule to the London, North Western Railway Act of 1905; so, therefore, that agreement is a statutory agreement, and I am glad to be in a position to inform the Dáil of that fact again. But the Minister, in reply to Deputy Byrne on that occasion, used these words: &ldquo;It is a fact that the London, Midland and Scottish representative as, by Act of Parliament, to be a director on the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company.  Under the amalgamation scheme the Dublin and South Eastern Company disappears as a separate unit, and there is no justification, therefore, for the statutory provision regarding the Dublin and South Eastern Railway to continue to apply to the new amalgamated company.&rdquo;  I agree with the President, but I also say that under the amalgamation scheme the Great Southern and Western Railway disappears as a unit, and if the statutory enactment is not to apply to the Dublin and South Eastern Railway because it disappears as a unit under this Bill, then, on the same ground, another statutory enactment should not apply to the Great Southern and Western Railway, which also disappears as a unit under the same proposal.</P>
    <P>My whole contention amounts to this: that these agreements were not made in the public interests.  Everyone knows that these agreements were the outcome of a fierce struggle, a competitive struggle it is true, between the great railway systems across the water.  After fierce Parliamentary struggles at Westminster they succeeded in passing these various Acts, and all these agreements are mostly the result of compromise, and to say, as the Minister does, because he finds the words, as a kind of afterthought to-day, in the provisions of the 7th Schedule to the Act of 1899, &ldquo;in <Col N="1086" /> the public interests&rdquo; that, in the first place, they have ever acted in the public interest, or, in the second place, that it is only in the public interest that they shall be allowed to act, I think, shows that the Minister has very little knowledge, indeed, of what is going on.  Who is to determine what is in the public interest? Who has to determine up to this what has been in the public interest? The Minister says that in future it shall be the tribunal that shall determine that fact, but is it suggested that these companies came together, and after serious financial expenditure as well as prolonged Parliamentary discussion, arrived at decisions that they shall simply be allowed to consign articles by certain routes provided it is in the public interest?  There was no reason whatever, I submit, for such agreement.  If it was in the public interest they could have done it all along.  Surely there was something else at the back of the minds of the directors of the Great Western Railway Company of England and also the directors of the Great Southern and Western Company of Ireland when they came to this agreement and had it recognised by statute, other than that they should act merely in the public interest.  I know that up to this these agreements have not been carried out in the public interest.  I am personally acquainted with districts in the south of Ireland where there have been two means of transit from fairs, and where the public interest has not been consulted, but rather where cattle trucks and means of conveyance have been placed in such a locality, and such a position, as to compel the consignors to send their goods by the way that suited the companies and not the way that suited their own convenience.  If this agreement only means that it is to be done in the public interest, what is the object of perpetuating the agreement? Is not the whole Bill in the public interest? Is it not supposed to work for the public benefit?  And if so, is in necessary to continue this agreement that it shall be worked for the benefit of the public?</P>
    <P>As far as I understand, the chief argument of the President yesterday <Col N="1087" /> evening, in opposition to this amendment of mine was this: In the first place he said this was more or less of an international agreement and could not be scrapped for that reason; and in the second place he said it was a statutory agreement.  Well, the contention that it is an international agreement cannot I think hold water.  We were not in a position at the time these agreements were made of bringing about an international agreement between any individual or company in this country and in Great Britain.  The question may be very rightly asked, and I think it is well for us to face it: Has this Dáil and this Government got the power to rescind this agreement?  I would like to know the Government's reply to that question.  If I may be permitted to do so I would give my interpretation of their position in the matter, I would say they have power and complete power to alter, vary, amend or rescind any of these agreements in so far as they affect the Saorstát.  It is perfectly true we could have no power over the Great Western Railway Company of England, but we can and should and must have by our Constitution power over agreements as far as the Great Southern and Western Railway is concerned, and therefore if we were to amend or modify or repeal this agreement, the amendment, repeal or modification would take effect as far as the Great Southern and Western Railway is concerned, and that being so I fail to see, at any rate, how the Great Western Railway of England could succeed in enforcing it.  Therefore, I think that the President's contention of this agreement being an international one falls to the ground.  It really comes to this, that what we are proposing to do now by this section is to retain all existing statutory enactments, and according to Section 58, I think, prohibit all future statutory enactments without the sanction of the Minister, and there is no reason given for the retention of these statutory enactments except the one now put forward by the Minister that the real effect of this particular agreement and statutory enactment is that the work must be done and the goods carried in the interest of the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> My conclusion is this, that there is no reason why this Bill should single out one port more than another for favourable treatment.  There is no doubt that favourable treatment has been meted out under this agreement to certain ports.  There is no question of doubt about that, and I fail to see what provision is made by this Bill, if these agreements are carried, to prevent such preferential treatment being meted out in the future.</P>
    <P>The Great Southern and Western Railway agreements are statutory agreements.  The Dublin South Eastern Railway agreement is a statutory agreement.  Repeal the lot, or retain the lot.  But how can the Government in one breath say: &ldquo;We will scrap the Dublin and South Eastern agreement and we will retain the Great Southern and Western agreement&rdquo;?  That is the position that they are adopting to-day, and I say that that position is a disingenuous one.  I say it is an inconsistent one, and that it is an impossible one for any Government which is endeavouring, as they purport by this Bill, to bring about a new railway system dealing on equal terms with all railways, and, indeed, by this section with all ports in the Saorstát.  Therefore, I cannot see my way to withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>The points raised by Deputy Hewat are very much in line with those raised by Deputy Redmond, and I propose to answer them together.  Before going on to them, however, I wish to refer to two points raised by Deputy McKenna.  He asked whether there is power in this Bill for a certain amount of shipping work to be carried on.  The Bill is a Railway Bill; it is not a shipping Bill. It makes no provision for shipping ventures, but there is this to be said, that the powers or rights with regard to shipping any of the separate undertakings had prior to amalgamation will be retained by the amalgamated company after amalgamation.</P>

      <P>If further powers are required with regard to shipping they will be got through a separate Bill, and when that separate Bill comes to be introduced it will be found there is nothing to repeal in this Bill.  There is no clause in this Bill which prevents anything that Deputy McKenna may have in view as a project of his own later on.  Deputy Davin referred to a decision of the Railway and Canal Commission on a case taken before it.  I put it to Deputy Davin that the fact of bringing that case and the decision given is a proof of what I have been saying, that if the terms of that agreement had been enforced by complainants appearing before the Railway and Canal Commission, we would have very much less trouble to-day, and very much less talk with regard to undue diversion of traffic and the placing of one port at a disadvantage as compared with another.  Power was given under the 1899 Act and under the 1905 Act, which was subsidiary to it.  They could have made a case before the Railway and Canal Commission.  If they did not make a case because the cost was prohibitive <Col N="1090" /> or because of any other reason, they are going to have an Irish tribunal now sitting in Dublin, and the costs of appearing before it will not be prohibitive.  They can quote the terms of the 1899 Act; they can quote the phrases &ldquo;in the interests of the public,&rdquo; and &ldquo;most convenient route,&rdquo; and they may be sure they will get justice.  I want to have the satisfaction of the House on this.  I want people to get it clear that that 1899 Act does not do anything irregular; it does not do anything contrary to the public interest.  If it was not there it is the sort of Act that we should ourselves bring forward as far as that particular clause is concerned.  The public interest is protected, and as far as the 1905 Act runs counter to that, the 1905 Act being a subsidiary Act, is not operative.  In answer to Deputy Johnson's question we are not, therefore, going to cancel the 1905 Act.  It may occur afterwards that the Railway Tribunal, by decision, will do away with some of the things that the 1905 Act purports to do.  The 1905 Act has to be construed strictly in the terms of the overriding Act of 1899.</P>
      <P>As regards the decisions of the Railway and Canal Commission, I think Deputy Redmond raised the same point.  Section 22 is, I think, as wide and as clear as a section could possibly be&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every function, jurisdiction, power and duty which was on the 6th day of December, 1921, exercised by or imposed on the Railway and Canal Commission by statute or otherwise, shall (with the exceptions hereinafter mentioned) from and after the passing of this Act, be exercised and performed in Saorstát Eireann by the Railway Tribunal.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently I must add two and two together and say they are four every time.  I have said there was a decision.  The effect of that decision was to instruct the Great Southern and Western Railway Company to apply the through rates operating via Rosslare, with a particular proviso, to Dublin port.  I have also said that the decisions of the Railway and Canal Commission are not upset. I presume the addition in this case is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to Deputy Redmond.  The first question raised is the question of port management.  The Bill has no more to do with port management than it has to do with shipping.  It has nothing whatever to do with the management of ports.  It does not pretend to deal with port management. We definitely deal with the protection of ports, but not with their management.  I am making a distinction between the two.  It was a question of port management Deputy Redmond raised.  He referred to the agreement between the London North Western and the Dublin South Eastern <Col N="1093" /> Railway Companies, and he again stresses certain things to his own advantage. He says that that agreement is now an enactment.  I do not agree with that.  It is partly an enactment. That agreement has been partly confirmed by statute.  From Clause 12 of the agreement on, was confirmed by statute.  Clauses 1 to 11 were not.  Later in the agreement than Clause 11 comes the provision with regard to the director of the London North Western and Dublin South Eastern Companies. That is statutory.  I agree that it is. I want to make it quite clear that the previous sections&mdash;1 to 11&mdash;which include the agreement between the London North Western and the Dublin South Eastern Company for forwarding cross-Channel traffic <i>via</i> Dublin, are not confirmed by statute.  That does not come under the head of what I referred to at the beginning of this discussion as &ldquo;an agreement confirmed by statute,&rdquo; and it would not be taken over by Section 29.  It will come in under &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; in Section 58.</P>
    <P>Let me get back to the director.  In so far as Section 12 provides for the appointment of a director, that is statutory, and it is taken over.  There was an amendment proposed here under which certain sums of money were paid, and the Board of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company were entitled to nominate one director of the amalgamated company. That amendment was not rejected. That amendment is to be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">
      <NameTxt>Captain REDMOND</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider my amendment in the same way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I am only answering Deputy Redmond's argument as to why we should carry over one statutory enactment and not carry over all.  I say we have not yet refused any statute.  We do not accept this amendment because it goes further than Section 12.  Section 12, as far as I remember, does provide for the appointment of a director, but that is in consideration of a certain sum of money which was advanced.  This amendment of Deputy Byrne included not merely that sum of money, but two other sums. The amounts were £100,000, £87,000 and £26,000 odd.  The amendment has not <Col N="1094" /> been accepted as it stands, for the reason that it goes further than the agreement between the Dublin SouthEastern and the London North Western Companies.  It is being considered, and the question of the director is still in abeyance.  It certainly has not been rejected, and no statutory enactment so far brought forward, has been rejected. I make that point in answer to Deputy Redmond, who spoke so vehemently about rejecting one enactment while taking in another.</P>
      <P>Deputy Redmond referred to the 1898 Act, and pointed out a fact that must be patent to everybody, that none of these agreements were made in the public interest.  I never asserted that any of the agreements were made in the public interest.  But I take my stand on this, that any agreement, no matter how arrived at, or whether due to the most selfish or the most philanthropic motives, which includes in its terms &ldquo;convenient route&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the interest of the public&rdquo; must have regard to these main considerations before permitting the routing of traffic in a certain way.  Deputy Redmond further asked: &ldquo;Have these agreements been carried out in the public interest&rdquo;?  I do not know, or rather I am not concerned to know, whether they were or were not carried out in the public interest. But I can assure the House that there is going to be a tribunal to insist that for the future the terms of that '99 Act be rigidly adhered to.  If the routing of traffic is going to depend on the terms laid down there&mdash;&ldquo;the public interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;convenient route&rdquo;&mdash;these are all matters for decision by the tribunal.  It does not matter what were the motives prompting this agreement or whether the agreement was previously carried out.  We are dealing with the future under the terms of this Bill, and we take over that enactment because we believe it is exactly the type of enactment that fits in with the principle underlying this Bill.  The public interest is paramount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond then ended with this: &ldquo;What is the object of perpetuating this agreement,&rdquo; and he got to that from a discussion on whether or not the Dáil has power to vary and rescind all agreements.  He has answered his own question, and I agree <Col N="1095" /> with his answer.  The Dáil is supreme and sovereign; the Dáil can vary and rescind and adjust in so far as it deals with matters inside its own territory, and affecting its own nationals.  But other things have to be attended to to meet my argument that the 1899 Act is not one contrary to the public interest. I put it further, that you have to survey all the equities of the situation before deciding whether or not to accept or reject that.  Look at the consideration that was given, and take it that the consideration on the Irish side is such a small thing as ten per cent.; it gets a very definite consideration in return from this company.</P>
    <P>After surveying the equity of the situation, keep in mind that if the Dáil so likes, it can exert its supreme power and wipe out this Act.  But take, as I say, the equity of the situation, and take it that the 1899 Act has nothing contrary to the principles of this Bill, evaluate the consideration previously given for that agreement, and see if there is anything abhorrent to any Deputy, either about that agreement or the 1905 Act, remembering that the 1905 Act is subsidiary to the main Act. I think I have dealt sufficiently with the 1899 and the 1905 Acts.  Is there anything further to be said about these?</P>

      <P>If you make this exception and provide that amendment 18 is accepted, then there will be nothing more to be said.  But the Minister has fallen into a very bad habit rather too soon.  He has followed the example of older Ministers, which we have tried to call attention to here fifty or one hundred times, and that is the habit of assuming that because he desires to do a certain thing, and because it is the intention of the Ministry that such and such a thing should happen under the Bill, there is no need to put it in the Bill.  That is the position taken up by the Minister's colleagues, and I am sorry to say it seems to be the position he himself has taken up If one wanted to be very nasty, one would say that he has rather taken the view that has so often been alleged against lawyers in legislatures, that they hoped and trusted they would leave so many loopholes in an enactment as to give plenty of opportunity for lawyers to plead before tribunals.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said, with regard to the protection of the public, that the public interest is preserved in this Act and in this agreement, and if anybody has a complaint to make, all he has to do is to go before the tribunal and run the risk of the tribunal turning him down.  You spend all the money necessary in costs, but still you have always the right to go to the tribunal.  That is true; but if we can prevent the necessity of going to a tribunal by putting it into the Bill, so much public money will be saved, and so many lawyers will not have to be paid, and so many lawyers will have to turn to more useful work.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not met the case at all for insuring that the new company shall have the privileges or rights of the old companies, or the privileges which one part of the new company will have over another part of the new company.  I would suggest it would be more sensible to say that we have a new company being established to embrace most <Col N="1097" /> of the companies serving the Saorstát, and any agreement which the new company considered it desirable to enter into, let it be a new agreement, subject to the approval of the tribunal or the Minister.  If any of these agreements are obviously necessary&mdash;if the agreement between the G. S. and W. Railway and the G. W. Railway of England. was so obviously serving the public interest&mdash;then one day, or a few days, would suffice to make a new agreement between the amalgamated company and the G. W. R. of England, or a similar agreement might be entered into between the amalgamated company and the L. M. S.</P>
      <P>If they are going to serve the public interest there will be no objection from the tribunal or the Ministry.  A case has not yet been made why we should enact that all statutory agreements that have been hitherto enforced should be carried over.  Presumably these agreements were entered into as a result of the conflict of interests between railway companies in Ireland and railway companies in Ireland against railway companies in England and railway companies in England. There were two or three interests competing, and rival agreements were entered into, and the new company is to take over all the rival agreements because they are statutory.  Surely it would be simpler and more in accord with commonsense to say that a new company being established, these agreements vanish.  If any of them are in the interests of the Irish people, we can make a new agreement between the new company and either of the British companies.  The amendment we are dealing with does not go as far as I am advocating, but, if adopted, it will obviate difficulties which may arise through the carrying over of these rival agreements, or any of these agreements, and by adopting it we may save the necessity of many traders and farmers having to go before the tribunal to plead their case that these agreements, in their carrying out, have worked against the public interest.</P>

    <P>Now, I have tried, to say several times in the course of this discussion on this Bill, and the other Bill that was defeated that the railway company is as <Col N="1098" /> an army against the civilian in pleading a case before the Railway Tribunal, especially when we provide that on that Railway Tribunal there shall be one person who is an expert on railway matters.  From that condition there is a fair chance that you get one man on your tribunal ready charged in favour of the railway company, and you have got all the powers, all the knowledge and all the money which the company has at its disposal to plead complete its case and defend itself against the individual trader, or group of traders who only know their side of the railway controversy.  The railway company has all the expert knowledge, and can bring to bear upon the tribunal facts and figures which are not at the disposal of the pleading trader.  I say that it would be far better to protect the trader in the Bill rather than to trust what the Minister desires&mdash;that the tribunal will protect them&mdash;rather than trust to that tribunal, bearing in mind that before that tribunal you are to have all the powers&mdash;legal, professional and expert&mdash;of the railway company opposing the merchant, trader or manufacturer or group of traders, merchants or manufacturers who were trying to put their side of the case in the public interest.  It is far better not to trust to the tribunal to do that, but to have the protection provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We have listened to the very able exposition of the case by the Minister, who has not succeeded in convincing Deputy Johnson that the need for the amendment proposed by Deputy Redmond was done away with. He lays very particular emphasis on the personnel and operations of the tribunal. Deputy Johnson, I think, challenges the perfect one-sidedness of that tribunal.  But, at all events, the whole Bill is based on that operation, and the Minister emphasises that this tribunal is going to settle all the ills that are attached to the traffic of this country. Now, I would like to say at this stage, that as far as the ports are concerned here&mdash;at least the Port of Dublin&mdash;as far as my own convictions are concerned, I would rather depend for the development of our traffic and trade and have much more satisfaction in <Col N="1099" /> dealing with the companies separately, as they are at present, or at all events, with the companies as they would be re-grouped, rather than deal with this almighty Pooh-Bah that is going to do everything at the instance of the tribunal. The three little schoolmasters are going to whip them in to doing things right.  I do not accept it at all. I think what you are aiming at in this Bill, and what I would like to emphasise is, that you are going to get into a groove or rut and that will deteriorate in efficiency in the future.  The people who are now in control of the railways will have very little control in the future.  The whole thing will lie with the tribunal.  You are going to eliminate your competition entirely.  I maintain that you cannot.  In my judgment the state of affairs that will exist in the near future will be no better than in the past.  That is more or less by the way.  We are dealing with the protection of the ports.  The Minister smiles, but the facts of the case are that Clause 29 is supposed to protect the ports.  I would like the Minister to take the whole thing into consideration and defer this Clause 29 until he has fully considered the question, and see if he could bring in an alternative to the clause so as to avoid any question arising, whether before the tribunal or otherwise, that under this agreement with the Great Western Railway, traffic can be diverted that ought not be diverted.  If he says he is going to stand by the enactment and rely on the tribunal, which will be overshadowed by an expert member from the railway company&mdash;if he does that, then so far as I am concerned, I will support any of these amendments which will put the matter on a more satisfactory footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. DAVIN Mr. DAVIN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has refused, or has failed at any rate to answer two very important points.  I think they are points that should be answered, if he can answer them, and answer before the debate closes; that is, whether the tribunal, acting on their powers under sub-Section 2 of clause 29, are understood to have power to compel the amalgamated company to quote through rates by alternative routes and <Col N="1100" /> provide for other facilities which will not prejudice in any way any particular port inside the Free State area. These are two important points which, I think, the Minister should run over in his mind and study definitely his position in the matter, in order that the tribunal when it comes to any question of dispute may know what is in the minds of the Government to guide them I suggest that a suitable form of words as an amendment should be put into Sub-section 2, so that it should be quite clear and should be understood I will be glad to know if he will be prepared to accept that suggestion.  At any rate, I think he should answer that question.  The function of a railway company, whether faced with competition from other railway companies or not, is to provide reasonable facilities for the carrying out of its contract in the most expeditious way&mdash;that is, that the trader who gets goods through a railway company should have the goods forwarded and delivered in the shortest possible time at the cheapest rate, and under the best conditions.  I suggest that object, if it is the object in the minds of the Government, is nullified by the operations of the 1899 Act.  which is prejudicial to the public interest. I can produce without going into the actual details, if the Minister is anxious to see it, documentary evidence, that acting under the decision of the Railway and Canal Tribunal, 1907, the Great Southern and Western Company was compelled to provide through rates and fares through the port of Dublin</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was compelled to do that.  Having charged to the passenger or trader a certain figure which it was compelled to quote for the carrying of passengers or the carrying of a quantity of goods, it failed, and has failed in many cases, to provide the facilities necessary for the carrying out of that contract.  I have in mind at the present time an instance of where through fares have been charged to passengers from a point on the Great Southern and Western Railway to a point in England via Dublin, and from a point in England to a point on the Great Southern and Western system, say Cork or somewhere else, in which the company got a division out of the through route fare, but did not provide the facilities for <Col N="1101" /> carring the public in the way it should have done.  I can give a case in point. Take the case of a passenger charged a through fare from any point in England via Dublin and travelling on the day boat.  When he arrives at Dun Laoghaire he finds that there is no connection from Dun Laoghaire to the Kingsbridge to enable him to catch the train for Cork.  I would ask you to remember that he is charged the through fare rate for carrying him from Dun Laoghaire to the Kingsbridge, but the company, instead of providing a service to carry the passenger from Amiens Street Station to the Great Southern terminus at Kingsbridge, fails to do so, and they accordingly have failed to carry out the contract they entered into when they accepted their portion of the through fare.  If necessary, I can produce documentary evidence in support of that statement.  Take another case of a passenger travelling from any point on the Great Southern system on a Sunday to any point in England. They charge that passenger the through fare rate, but when the passenger arrives at the Kingsbridge he finds that there is no through connection between that station and the steamer at Dun Laoghaire, although he has paid a through route fare at the station from which he started.  The company provides no connection between the Kingsbridge and Dun Laoghaire, and the result is that the passenger has to make his own arrangements to travel from the Kingsbridge to Amiens Street or Westland Row to reach the boat at Dun Laoghaire.  I maintain that the Great Southern and Western Railway in charging a through fare rate, and in not carrying out their portion of the contract in the cases I have indicated, are not providing the facilities which they should provide according to their agreement and their acceptance of their portion of the through fare rate.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that it is the agreement which we are dealing with the company has in its mind when it refuses to provide the facilities I have referred to.  Their idea, apparently, is that the travelling public would become so disgusted with the arrangements made for reaching the port of Dublin that they would prefer to travel by other routes which are more <Col N="1102" /> favourable to the Great Southern Company. If such a condition of things is to be continued by the carrying on of this agreement of 1899, then I say that the Minister is not doing his duty in the interests of the travelling public if he enables the company to do these things.  I wonder if it is contended that the tribunal will have power under sub-section (2) of Section 29 to remedy the state of affairs that I am dealing with.  In my opinion, the powers in the section as worded now should be more clearly defined if the tribunal is to remedy the state of affairs that I complain of.  I would be glad to have an answer from the Minister to the two points that I make.  The first is with regard to the question of through fares via the port of Dublin, and the second with regard to the provision of facilities for the travelling public.  I contend that the success or the failure of this Bill will depend to a very large extent on how these two points are dealt with by the tribunal.  I hope that very clear and definite instructions will be given to the tribunal so that they may put in force the powers given them to deal with these two questions.  If, for instance, the Bill fails as a result of lack of powers in the tribunal to deal in a proper way with an unfair diversion of traffic, what, I ask, is the alternative? Nationalisation, I suppose.  I am going to welcome its failure if it is to mean nationalisation.  We on these benches have put it up to the Minister that we are prepared to see that the Bill should get a fair chance.  If the Bill is to get a fair chance I think that these two matters that I have been dealing with must be taken into serious consideration, and if the Minister is not prepared to give way on these points I think every Deputy in the House must be called upon to shoulder his responsibility in regard to the reading of this section, and particularly in regard to the effect it will have upon his own constituents and upon the general community.  If it fails because these things are not made clear and definite, I think a division will have to be called, so that the people who vote for the section as it stands will have to explain later to their constituents why they did so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisJosephDalton" hpid="Mr. D'ALTON Mr. D'ALTON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'ALTON</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with some of the points raised by Deputy Davin.  The last point he made is, I think, of very great importance.  He was speaking of the power which the tribunal should be invested with.  I would strongly urge on the Minister to consider that point, because to my mind the real success of this Bill, so far as it is a success, will depend on the powers of the tribunal.  The objections raised by Deputy Hewat and by Deputy Johnson with regard to the tribunal appear to be very much at variance. Deputy Johnson appears to think that the position of the railways is so entrenched and that their knowledge is so great&mdash;the natural position they occupy, the knowledge of railway work they possess, and the legal advice they will have&mdash;that all these things will place them in a very strong position against the public, and that the public will not avail themselves of the opportunity of going before the tribunal to see that in every case where their interests are menaced they will be looked into and carefully considered.  We are all aware that when the Railway and Canal Commission was appointed, the public did not avail themselves of it at the time, though the Commission was set up so that the public might avail themselves of it.  At that time some of the smaller railways were purchased by the larger ones.  When the larger railway companies were empowered to absorb the smaller companies, certain powers remained with the public under the Railway and Canal Commission which the public could have availed of, but they unfortunately did not do so.  As to the tribunal which it is proposed to establish under this Bill, I trust that the people of this country, farmers, merchants and others sending traffic over the railways, as well of course as the travelling public, will avail of the powers invested in it, and that they will take steps to see, where their interests are adversely affected, that the matter is placed before the tribunal.  If the tribunal fails, it will not be because of any lack of powers inherent in itself, but rather because these powers are not availed of by the public as happened under the Railway and Canal Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond referred to the question of competition.  I personally <Col N="1104" /> would oppose this Bill if competition remained in Ireland.  Deputy Hewat said there is competition in Ireland.  I wish that we could find where the competition is.  There was competition in the south at the time the Waterford and Limerick Railway Company was in existence, and before the Great Southern bought it over.  We had competition between the ports of Limerick and Waterford as well as a through rate system.  That competition passed away under the amalgamation scheme. I might say that under this amalgamation scheme the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company were given running powers over the Great Southern system as far as Limerick. These were a mighty advantage to the farmers and traders of a very big area in the south.  We know what the result was.  The canvassers found that there was only limited traffic for the Dublin and South Eastern Company, and that limited traffic did not mean for them enhanced profits, with the result that the companies made an arrangement between themselves to pool the traffic, and finally the Dublin and South Eastern Company no longer availed themselves of the running powers which were theirs.  What we want in Ireland is competition.  We want to get as near to that competition as we can, but we feel that, as far as the railways are concerned, that competition is a thing of the past.  This Bill is a step in advance.  There may be other sources of competition later on.  I think the point raised in this amendment does not possibly give us very much at present, but if the port at Rosslare is put in competition with Waterford it will be a very good thing. That would certainly be to the advantage of those sending traffic from all parts of this country to England.  I am firmly convinced that this Bill, if availed of, will be one of the few remaining steps to retain the existing competition that we have, and if not availed of it will be for the Dáil to take steps later on, and for the people of this country to see that their goods and produce are placed on the markets in England as well as of other countries on the most advantageous terms, and in the quickest possible time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Johnson refers to the bad Ministerial habit which, he says, I have also fallen into. I would like to ask him in return what desire of mine is there expressed by me to-day that is not given effect to in this section of the Bill.  I say that behind the Bill is the principle of no undue preference for ports; that the question in getting rail traffic through any particular port should be the interest of the public, and generally the most convenient route.  We take over statutory enactments which contain as one of their provisions these two identical things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain REDMOND Captain REDMOND">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGILLIGAN Mr. McGILLIGAN">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGILLIGAN</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether they have been acted on or not is a thing that does not concern us immediately. The point is, are they going to be acted upon, and can they be enforced under the tribunal that is to be set up.  It is going to be a judicial body, and it will not be overwhelmed by experts, and this is a matter for interpretation.  The plain phrase in the schedule is: unconsigned traffic by the most convenient route, and in the public interest.  It will not require any great expert to put these three things together and to base a decision upon them.  This section, as I explained, proposes only to deal with statutes and agreements confirmed by statutes.  We take these as we find them in the 1899 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1899 Act was brought forward as the worst possible example of preferential port treatment.  It is, perhaps, the best example that could be taken from the point of view of Deputy Redmond, especially having regard to the fact that it was a consideration affecting his constituency. It is given as a specimen of an Act that purports to give certain preferential treatment to ports.  We take it as the worst possible one, and it undoubtedly is from that point of view. I have analysed it and gone through it, and repeated and reiterated that there is this consideration determining the whole thing, namely&mdash;the most convenient route and the interests of the public.  If there is any desire I have given expression to regarding the principle <Col N="1106" /> at the back of the Bill, that is not given effect to in Clause 29, I would be glad to have it made clear to me, and I would make it clearer still in Clause 29.  There is one point so far not touched on, and that is with regard to the agreement in the schedule in the 1899 Act.  That is a valuable agreement from the Irish point of view.</P>
    <P>I have here a report from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of May 12th of a meeting of the Irish Cattle Trade Association, in which the President of the Association said: &ldquo;I would earnestly ask the members of our association, in view of what has happened to them during the last five years, to come together wherever possible and give their best support to the alternative route of shipping cattle via Rosslare.&rdquo;  I wonder would the farmer community in the South of Ireland be pleased if the facilities offered at Rosslare were suddenly withdrawn? I wonder would that meet with their approval?  We propose to take over an agreement which gives the agricultural community in the South of Ireland a very valuable alternative route, and the consideration by which we have obtained that route is that Act which has as part of its most operative clause the phrase I have already quoted.  It gives a preference to Rosslare, where traffic can, in the interests of the public, be most conveniently sent forward.  I do not think that the mere repetition of phrases can stand against these terms included under an Act which we intend to take over and pass to a judicial body for interpretation.</P>
    <P>There is this further point to be borne in mind.  Supposing this agreement or statutory enactment to be scrapped and that the Rosslare route closed down, what is going to be one very definite result of that?  It is a very heavy one.  The Great Southern and Western Railway Company has agreed to pay the interest on the capital expended and the loss in working, and if there is a loss in working the Rosslare route that loss falls to be borne by the amalgamated undertaking, so you are going to have the loss put upon the shoulders of the amalgamated undertaking. You are going to have a valuable alternative route taken away from <Col N="1107" /> the agricultural community of the south, who have a preference for Rosslare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that if this section does not pass, the Rosslare route has to be closed?  Is that the proposition?

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I would question it very seriously.  A new company is formed, of which the Great Southern and Western is one part.  It enters into a compact with the Midland Great Western of Ireland and the Dublin South Eastern.  The Great Western of England entered into an agreement with a component part of this company. Do you mean to suggest that the Great Western of England would be bound by an agreement with the Great Southern and Western, in so far as the new company claimed it was bound?</P>

      <P>This section only deals with statutes, and statutes can be, and have been, examined, and from the point of view of the opponents of this section there is no worse Act than the 1899 Act, with the addition of that of 1905.  That has been analysed, and I do not propose going into it further. Agreements come under Section 58, and there is power there to rescind, vary, or modify agreements.  Deputy Hewat put it that he was surprised that I was urging this tribunal as a remedy for all the ills of the railway world.  I may put that later, but I am not doing so at the moment.  I have emphasised the tribunal as an interpreting body over what I previously described as a very plain operation of a very plain Act, and it is only in that connection that I am dealing with it at the moment. <Col N="1109" /> Deputy Davin raised two questions, though I think they are really one&mdash;the question of through rates.  He is dealing with through rates on a clause concerned with the protection of ports.  If he is dealing with through rates on any other ground, it is outside the limit of this section.  In so far as it is a question of through rates giving preference to one port as against another, there are proposals in Sub-section (2), and if they are not considered strong enough, I will be pleased to consider any stronger terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That this Dáil, cognisant of a return to peaceful and more stable conditions in the country, and aware of the approach of the Tailteann Games, with their historic associations of peace and goodwill amongst Irishmen of all sections, is of opinion that the time has arrived when all untried or sentenced political prisoners should be released, and &ldquo;men who are on the run&rdquo; for political offences be free to return to their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this motion in the name of the Farmers' Party.  It is down in the name of that Party because we feel that the acceptance of it by the Dáil will tend towards bringing greater stability to the country, and that it will be a good sound, national policy.  The last report we had of the number of political prisoners imprisoned or interned was on April 2nd.  The total number of prisoners imprisoned or interned at that time amounted to 941, of which 314 had been sentenced; two had been sentenced to penal servitude for life; 262 to varying terms of penal servitude; 36 to imprisonment with hard labour, and 14 to a period of two years' imprisonment.  I am aware that since that was supplied to the Dáil a number of prisoners have been released.  I do not know how many, nor do I know the number still detained.  At this point I want to make it perfectly clear that in this motion we are not asking for the <Col N="1112" /> release of prisoners who are in reality criminals.  We are not standing out and saying that individuals who have gone out, whether under the guise of political motives or under a political flag, should because of that be styled political prisoners and be treated as such.  We are not asking for the release of such prisoners as these.  I do not know how many of those detained could in reality be styled criminals, but on that point we want to make our position clear.</P>
    <P>When more than 12 months ago the &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; was given by the Republican leaders, it was looked on, I must admit, rather dubiously by the Government and by many people in the country. The history of the past 12 months, I think, has fairly demonstrated that that &ldquo;cease fire&rdquo; order has been lived up to and was meant. It is fairly evident also, and generally accepted to-day, that the statement that accompanied the issuing of that order, namely, that the Republican Party were going to put the issue that they stood for before the people, and that they could achieve their ends by constitutional means, was also seriously meant.  It is a real live question in County Limerick to-day.  It seems to us at this juncture that that statement of the authoritative Republican leaders ought to be taken at its face value. When leaders of any Party make a declaration, I think that the proper tactics and the best policy for the Government of the time is to put those statements to the test; to put the responsibility on those people of carrying through the declaration they have made.  Certainly, the time has now arrived when the statements made by the Republican leaders more than 12 months ago ought to be put to the test. The President, or whoever replies, may argue that it is dangerous even now to release all the prisoners.  The point of view held may be, that because, as the Minister for Home Affairs chooses to say at times, arms are sown from one end of the country to the other, therein lies danger; that because of the fact that statements have been made at times, that could not be accepted, the statement as to the intentions of the Republican leaders to achieve their end by constitutional means can hardly be accepted <Col N="1113" /> at its face value, and that there is risk.</P>
    <P>As to the question of the arms and the difficulty that that raises, I think the Ministry appreciate, just as well as anyone in the Dáil or outside it can, that in every Irishman there is a certain amount of pride.  There is a pride that prompts him at times, as the saying is, not to yield up his gun.  I hold, and I put it to the Dáil, that it is the feeling that it is not a manly thing to give up one's gun, more than the question of what may be done with the guns if they are kept, that has weighed with these people.  I commend that point of view to the Minister.  There is the other point of view, that the danger is too great to face.  There may be a certain element of danger.  But I would remind the Minister that it is hardly two months ago since the Dáil and the country were faced with a danger in another direction.  A very difficult and serious situation confronted Deputies and the country generally.  I am not going to discuss the causes of that danger.  But when men took action, that in the words of the Minister for Home Affairs, amounted to mutiny. plus treason, how did the Minister deal with the situation?  He came to the Dáil, I believe after giving the situation careful consideration, and he asked the Dáil to agree that the best way to deal with these people was to agree with him in saying to them, &ldquo;Go in peace, friends, as civilians.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a brave step to take.  There were many in the country who felt that there was danger in the step that was taken by the Minister then.  What have events proved?  In the time that has passed since, we see clearly that that attitude, and that action on the part of the Minister, was the correct attitude.  It was the best step he could have taken in the interests of the State, and in the interests of the present and the future Irish nation.  It was a dangerous action, perhaps.  It looked dangerous at the time.  It was grave, but it was statesmanlike, and proved to be the most successful way that the situation could have been dealt with.  I think very few in the country to-day will quarrel with that, no matter how they may have felt at the time.  The situation that confronts <Col N="1114" /> the Ministry to-day is none more serious than that one was.  The Ministry are dealing with Irishmen to-day in these prisoners just as they were dealing with Irishmen a few weeks ago, and realised it.  They appreciate the fact that the Irishman's outlook, mentality and temperament are peculiar, and must be subject to peculiar treatment.  Treatment that might, perhaps, be very successful with people of another State would not just be the treatment to apply to Irishmen.  If the Ministry are prepared to take their courage in their hands, and are prepared to act towards these men, as they acted towards the other men a short time ago, I suggest that their efforts will meet with just as much success.  Later on such efforts will meet with the same approval as their previous action has met with.</P>
    <P>I admit that the Minister may put it to me that there is a difference, that the men I speak of agreed to hand in their guns, but that the other people have not done so.  I appreciate the difficulty that that, perhaps, does create for the Ministry.  That may, to a certain extent, have been the determining factor.  If it has been the determining factor in the past, I submit to the Dáil that we have had sufficient evidence that these people have no intention of using these guns in future; that they meant it, when the order was given to &ldquo;cease fire,&rdquo; and that they have since lived up to that order.  It is suggested that here and there we have incidents and drilling.  That has been told me.  I must say, for my own part, that I have seen no evidence of these.  I do not know if drilling is being carried on in very many places, or at all.  I feel inclined to say, and I honestly believe, that if such actions are taking place in one, two, or three districts, it is not the considered Republican policy.  It may be the policy of a certain individual here and there, in a certain district, but isolated cases should not be taken as the basis on which a considered judgment should be formed when dealing with a great number of prisoners or with the party these prisoners represent.</P>
    <P>There is another point of view that, <Col N="1115" /> I think, it is very well, at this moment to stress in the Dáil.  August next will see the re-institution in this country of the Tailteann Games.  After the occurrences of the past few years there are times, perhaps, when we feel that we should cease talking or thinking of the glories of the past, or of anything glorious at all about our country.  I do not subscribe to that point of view. I recognise that while our people have their failings, they also have very many good points.  It would be well that we should see our good points as well as our bad ones.  Even in the last ten years men in this country have dared to do, and have achieved, glorious things.  Perhaps, in a way, they have accomplished things that few small nations would be brave enough to undertake.  The glory of this country is not a thing of yesterday.  The Tailteann Games were in the days of Ireland's greatness one of her greatest events.  Seven hundred years before the Christian era these games were carried out upon the plains of Tara.  Up to the 12th or the 13th century these games were to the Irish race the greatest event in the lives of the people.  The first Dáil, under the Presidency of de Valera, decided that these games should be re-instituted.  I should say that the first Dáil must be to every Irishman with Irish ideals, something sacred, because those days, at least, saw us all standing together. These games were at that time in course of being held; our present Postmaster-General was nominated by the then President de Valera as director of the games, and I believe that many of the members of the Council who are going on with the work to-day were also nominated then.  In former days peace was proclaimed months previous to the holding of the games.  The Gaelic race in those days had its differences, as we have to-day; but in order that the people might come together in peace and in harmony the High King declared that from the rising of the sun on a certain day peace should run through the land.  That was in anticipation of and in preparation for the Tailteann Games.  I think that the Tailteann Games to-day ought to be one of the biggest things before <Col N="1116" /> all Ireland.  They are certainly one of the biggest things that have been handed down to us, not as a tradition, but as a fact&mdash;something that lived in ancient Ireland, and the fact that they are to be held in the coming August ought to be an incentive to every Irishman, no matter what his political views may be, to make them what they were in the Ireland of old.</P>
    <P>If that is to be done, the first essential is that there must be peace; people who have differences of opinion, politically or otherwise, ought not to be kept apart; the games ought to be given a fair chance; they ought to be supported by all the different political parties.  At times we think with such a dislike of one another that we sometimes fear for the future of the country. I do not think that a policy of hate, either by word or act, is the platform, or the foundation, on which any State can be successfully built up.</P>
    <P>The Government of any country can at all times give a lead.  They are in a better and a stronger position than any political party to give a lead in establishing political peace and harmony amongst the people who claim to have common ideals.  I think the Government of to-day could give an earnest of their sincerity, could demonstrate to us that bitter feelings about things that have taken place in the past do not and will not count with; them, that these things will not stand in the nation's way, that if there is a possibility of bringing peace by giving every individual who is prepared to obey the common law, every individual who is prepared to take his stand in obedience to the common law, liberty to obey that law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. BAXTER Mr. BAXTER">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BAXTER</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I should like at this point to make reference to the-men on the run.  These, too, cannot be left out from my point of view in this motion, because, after all, it is really demoralising that men are not at liberty to go to their homes.  It certainly does not tend to make these men have greater respect for the law, and I cannot see that any useful purpose can be served by taking action against these men that will prevent them returning to their homes and <Col N="1117" /> living as peaceable citizens.  I agree that, perhaps, there are people who are prepared to take their stand on the statement that it is not wise to release some of the prisoners even yet.  But I say to these people, that the greater number of the prisoners have been released, and nothing very extraordinary has taken place.  The 8,000 who have been released could certainly have done any of the things that the 800 would do who are still detained, either politically or militarily.  No good purpose can be served by keeping in leaders of a political party after that political party has declared its intention to pursue its policy by constitutional means, and while it may, from the point of view of some people, be asking much of the Government, there is generally a feeling through the country that the time is ripe for the release of the political prisoners; that if the Government were brave enough to take these people at their word, release them and give them an opportunity to prove that they mean what they say, the Government would be taking a brave, statesmanlike step that will inevitably be beneficial to the nation as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKENNA</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second the motion.  It was contrary to my original intention to express any opinion on the motion, further than to give a silent vote in favour of it, but as it is a question of such national importance I consider it my duty briefly to state my reasons for supporting it.  Months ago, when the Anti-Treaty Party ceased active armed opposition against the State, I advocated in this Assembly the release of the prisoners, and, to their credit be it said, the Government released thousands of men, who since then have acted honourably and straightforwardly according to the undertaking they gave at that time.  I think now that a generous gesture on the part of the Government would add a great deal to the further peace and tranquility of the country.  But fearing that it might be said that we on these benches who are voting solidly for this motion have not the courage of our convictions, and that we are only giving way to popular clamour, I wish to emphasise the fact that if any <Col N="1118" /> sentiment I express here to-day would aggravate the difficulties of the Government, my lips would be closed, and I believe in saying so that I am expressing the unanimous opinion of the party that I have the honour to sit amongst.  Let us not be misunderstood. We do not want to withdraw from the Government any strength that they possess for dealing with any party which rises up in arms against the lawfully constituted authority of this State.  We have supported, and will continue to support, the Government in any steps that they may consider necessary to maintain law and order, but we are not so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are not so inconsistent, because we cannot see eye to eye with another party, as to keep them in jail indefinitely.  We consider that the time is ripe for the release of these men.  The Deputy who moved the motion has stated the various reasons that brought our party to frame this motion.  For my own part, it is my firm conviction that these men will never again resort to armed warfare against the State, and if they did I would consider it a crime of the direst magnitude.  I have no desire to disparage the talents or the character of any of my fellow-countrymen.  On the contrary, I should like to be one of a party who would try to fuse at the present time the discordant elements of our country into an harmonious and united mass, and if we have learned anything from the past history of the country, I think that this should be the aim and the object of every man, both inside and outside this House.  These are my views; I have expressed them in the sincerity of my heart, and I hope that the House will pass the motion so ably proposed by my colleague, Deputy Baxter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion cites <Col N="1119" /> three particular things.  First, it refers to the fact that there is a return to peaceful conditions.  I was rather amused in listening to that statement, having regard to what we heard last night.  We recommended a return to peaceful conditions in September, 1922.  We agreed at that time to wipe the slate clean, because that is, I think, the only really satisfactory way to bring about peace and to bring about peaceful and stable conditions.  Deputy Baxter mentioned that he was informed, I think, on the 1st April, 1924, that we had 941 prisoners.  At the moment, from a return I have received to-day, we have 616 prisoners; of these 302 are sentenced prisoners, and 314 prisoners who were not sentenced&mdash;internees. Of that 314 I signed yesterday, or to-day, the releases of 24, which will bring the actual number of prisoners now to 592.  It takes a couple of days to effect releases.  We would then have a lesser number of interned than sentenced prisoners.  Deputy Baxter quoted many times in his statement the call that was made by the Irregular leaders for the cessation of hostilities twelve months ago, and the return to what they term constitutional methods. There are many interpretations of constitutional methods.  I do not know whether Miss MacSwiney is a leader, but her acceptance or interpretation of constitutional methods differs, I think, very much from Deputy Baxter's, or Deputy McKenna's. Everything, according to her, no matter what it is, is constitutional, and, according to the same authority, we have had a war, and that term &ldquo;war&rdquo; covers everything, political offences, criminal offences, and all these very peculiar experiments and experiences we have had for the last couple of years.  Deputy Baxter stated that he does not plead for the release of criminals, and I take it he is honest in that statement, but I put it to him and to the Dáil that there is some difficulty in discriminating between what is known as a political prisoner, and what is described as a political prisoner who is guilty of a criminal offence. I remember on one occasion discussing with a man who had been in Belfast Jail for a political offence the various <Col N="1120" /> types of people he had come across there, and he told me that one little man who came in one morning was asked what he was there for, and he said &ldquo;Shooting and forgery.&rdquo;  He put the shooting first, and, of course, that covered the forgery, and he was a political prisoner according to his interpretation of it.</P>
      <P>Ten or twelve months ago we passed an act called the Indemnity Act, and under that particular instrument there was power taken to review sentences that had been passed by courtsmartial, military tribunals, or some such competent bodies.  Under the regulations made in connection with that Act it was laid down that on application by prisoners cases would be reviewed. Without the application by prisoners it is not possible under the law to review those cases, and reduce the sentences. In that connection I will read some correspondence that has been transmitted to me dealing with that particular thing.  This is a letter from a lady in Dublin to a member of the Dáil:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Chara,&mdash;Knowing your sympathy with the now universal movement for the release of the prisoners, I venture to ask your kind support of the motion to be made to-morrow by Mr. Baxter in the Dáil.  My special excuse for troubling you is a mother's anxiety for the plight of her son, now a prisoner in Hare Park, and nearing the completion of two years without charge or trial.  Enclosed extract from a letter of one of them will give you an idea of the treatment they are now being subjected to.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The following is the extract:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have just received notification that we are to be put back to winter lock-up time (6 p.m.) as punishment for our men refusing medical examination specially for sentenced men only, as discriminated from us people, which they insisted on.  So it looks as though they are trying to make an issue of the distinction and force trouble on us once more.  They stopped parcels on Saturday until to-day, but replaced that punishment by this much more cruel imposition.  It is hard enough to keep in good form here, and depression is fairly general&mdash;everyone is simply fighting against it.  Certainly, keeping <Col N="1121" /> us in from 6 p.m. locked up in a hut, when it is daylight until 10 p.m. will not improve matters.  The vicious circle will probably commence now.  Yesterday considerable excitement was caused by one of our lads, sentenced to ten years, attempting to commit suicide, cutting his throat seriously before being caught in the act.  Add to this six lunacy cases since we came here, and you perceive a very serious state of affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I sent that on for report, and I have received the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The prisoners, on Monday, 28th April, disobeyed a Camp Standing Order which requires them to wash out and scrub the floors of their huts twice weekly&mdash;i.e. on Monday and Friday.  The prisoners' leaders on that day were informed that letters and parcels would me stopped for four days on account of non-compliance with the order in question. The prisoners' leaders were notified on 28th April that they would be locked up at 6 p.m. for six evenings as punishment for the destruction by the prisoners of latrines which had recently been replaced by the engineers. The prisoner referred to is &mdash;&mdash;.  This prisoner had applied for review of his sentence, and his depression was due, not to the treatment accorded to him by the Camp officers, but to the treatment meted out to him by his companions on account of his having applied for review of his sentence.  The Military Governor states that one of the prisoners stood by and watched Flynn attempting to cut his throat without making any attempt to prevent him, but called on a military policeman to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This man's case has been heard, and his release ordered.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Military Governor states that there was only one case of lunacy in the Camp within the past twelve months, and that the prisoner in question was committed to an asylum.  The same treatment is given to every prisoner in Hare Park whether he is sentenced or not.  The prisoners have every facility for games, etc., and the Camp officials <Col N="1122" /> are always very willing to remedy legitimate complaints.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose it is showing their form, not agreeing to go before this tribunal, just the same as it is showing their form not to surrender arms.  A greater man than any one of them ever was, ordered the surrender of arms here eight years ago to foreigners, and it was obeyed, and they will not surrender to their own countrymen.  We are faced with this position that under the law a number of these men are sentenced, and there is objection to medical examination.  I myself ordered medical examination.  I believe it was also ordered by a Department of the State, but I ordered it, having discovered that there was one sentenced prisoner in a serious state of health, and in order to secure that no other prisoner would be allowed to get into a serious state of health.  Some Member of the Dáil or of the Seanad asked me to have a man released.  I discovered that he was in a serious state of health, and I ordered a medical examination.  It was also ordered about the same time by a Department of the State.</P>
    <P>Now we are faced with this position. This correspondence discloses exactly the mentality we are dealing with in those prisoners.  Everything which makes for disturbance, which makes for what we consider to be non-constitutional methods is taken to be great form.  I expect that this sort of propaganda was sent to America to disgrace this country.  Finding those things to be what they are during the last two or three months, since I became Minister for Defence, I have had numerous conferences night and day with officers, servants and officials of the State.  Within the last forty-eight hours I got the consent of the Minister for Finance to pay two substitutes for judges so as to allow two judges to review the cases of the sentenced prisoners, and to make recommendations to us.  We, in turn, will recommend His Excellency, the Governor-General, to exercise the prerogative of mercy in those cases.  That, I suppose, will not hurt the very high sensitiveness of the political opinions of the gentlemen affected.  That is the only alternative.  If Deputy Baxter were in <Col N="1123" /> my place, he could not release those men except in the way I mention.  If Deputy Baxter were here himself he would have to go through the same form that we are going through, to see whether or not he was going to release a criminal or a political.  We have just the same anxiety.  The Return shows what has been the number of releases during twelve months.  Eleven thousand and sixty-eight prisoners have been released between the 1st of June, 1923, and the 18th May, 1924.  I do not know whether it will be taken to indicate great rashness, great bravery, or great perspicacity on the part of the Government, to have released practically a thousand prisoners a month, but it has been done.  I certainly re-echo the statements that have been made by Deputy Baxter and Deputy McKenna with regard to seeing more peaceful and more ordered conditions existing in the country.  But I put it to them: Is it likely that we will have those peaceful conditions, dealing with the class of people we are dealing with, if those men are released?  They say they have returned to constitutional methods.  If I appear on a public platform, will they allow the people to hear me?  I do not know whether that attitude in regard to public meetings is regarded as constitutional or not, but it was never advocated by the old Sinn Fein Party that I belonged to, or by any member of the First or Second Dáil, that any man seeking to put his views before the public should be shouted down at a public meeting.</P>
    <P>Very many less than a hundred applications for review came before the judges under that Act of Indemnity, and very considerable reductions were made in sentences that were imposed In a great number of cases almost immediate release was ordered by the judges.  They had that right.  They have that right under the Act, too, but they cannot review or order releases or reductions unless an application comes up.  In the circumstances we have set up this tribunal. It will commence work very shortly and it will deal with those cases.  But their recommendations in those cases are only recommendations. If they recommend that release should <Col N="1124" /> take place in any case, it will be the duty of the Executive Council to advise His Excellency to order the release of that prisoner.  For a great many months past investigations amongst the prisoners have been taking place.  We have to see against how many of them prosecutions for criminal offences would lie.  As might be expected, those investigations occupy a very considerable amount of time Some prisoners who have been interned have been transferred with a view to prosecution.  In June of last year four prisoners were transferred to civil custody.  In January four more were transferred.  In February, 24, March, 32; April, 9; and from May the 1st to May the 18th, 9.  They were transferred to civil custody, &ldquo;awaiting execution.&rdquo;  That is perhaps imperfectly expressed.  It does not mean exactly &ldquo;retiring a man out of life,&rdquo; as the Latin says.  It means simply bringing men for trial, so that the number is not affected by it.  As far as the internees or military prisoners are concerned, the number is 590.  I have secured very active and cordial assistance from the various other departments of State in expediting returns to show in how many cases prosecutions would lie against these prisoners. I received this evening a list of over one hundred prisoners against whom no prosecutions will be entered.  That will enable us, I believe, to release between now and this day week one hundred others.  That will bring the number under 500.  Apart from these cases, Deputies occasionally approach either the Minister for Defence or some other Minister, mentioning particular cases of prisoners, and I think there are very few Deputies who have reason to be dissatisfied with the response that they got.  In one case a member of the Dáil and a member of the Seanad approached us with regard to something like thirty-six men who were on the run in a certain district.  Thirty-six is a large number, even if the cases were in one county, and it took some time to investigate them.  I communicated with them, I think within a month, saying that, as far as I could ascertain, no prosecution would lie against those thirty-six men, and that they might return home.  I asked at that time these <Col N="1125" /> two men to sign a bond for the good behaviour of those men, and they agreed.  I do not know whether the men who were on the run are aware of that or not, but it shows how much a man may do individually.  In asking that those men who are on the run should be free to return home, one must bear in mind also that there is a distinction between persons who are sought for politically and persons against whom a criminal prosecution would lie.  I am sure Deputy Baxter will appreciate the difficulty in making up returns showing on the one side persons whom one would wish to intern from the point of view of Irregular activity, and on the other hand men against whom a prosecution might lie for criminal offences.  As I said, the resolution might be divided into three parts.  In the first part there is a declaration that we have returned to normal conditions.  As I have already stated, Deputy Lyons' statement last night scarcely coincides with that particular picture.  I am not exactly accepting Deputy Lyons' statement as to the insecurity there is abroad.  However, it is there.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I did not last night make a statement to the effect that it was the released prisoners who were responsible for getting ex-members of the National Army dismissed from their employment. I did not say it was ex-internees who did that.  It is up to the Government to find out who are the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of the resolution referred to the approach of the Tailteann Games.  I put this to the Dáil deliberately and solemnly: Pass a vote of want of confidence in the Government, by all means.  Do that, and out of your generosity, if you like, and if you are prepared to take the risk, release every one of the prisoners, but do not release them on account of the near approach of the Tailteann Games, because, if you do that, you are rearing up for yourselves in the future, or for other Governments, the menace of hostility to any public festivity, public event, great occasion, or anything else of the sort; and it is too dangerous.  I have no objection, <Col N="1126" /> and I would willingly walk out from my position as head of this State, but I would feel humiliated and I would feel dejected if a resolution lending colour to the case that was put up by these men and their hostility to these games was the reason for our releasing the prisoners.  I submit, on all the facts of the case, that I have made a fair case for fair treatment of those prisoners. I say it is scarcely fair to my mind to release all those internees who were not prosecuted before courtsmartial, and to keep in the unfortunate dupes who were so prosecuted.  I say that the man who took out his gun and fought like a man, or obeyed orders to burn a house, as much as I condemn it, is not a bit more guilty than Mr. de Valera, even though, at the eleventh hour, he stated that be never stood for destruction.  He had the right to say that when destruction began, or when it was at its height.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel for a man who was sentenced for fighting, even though he should not have done it, even though it was morally wrong, as much sympathy and consideration as I have for Mr. Stack, who was found with an insurance policy in his pocket.  That is the reason I say that until there is a review of the cases of the men who were sentenced, it is scarcely fair to them that they should suffer while the others should go scot free.  That is a matter of opinion.  I may be wrong in my interpretation as to what is guilt.  But I do say that it is at least due to the rank and file that they should not be discriminated against.  And they are discriminated against owing to the accidents and the circumstances of the time.  The men on the run cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand. Their cases must be reviewed to see whether or not a prosecution would lie against them.  There is no use in telling a man he can go home&mdash;&ldquo;We forgive you for what you have done during the last twelve months or two years.&rdquo;  You are not entitled to do that.  You have no authority to do it. You are not empowered by the people to do it.  Their cases, just as the cases of the internees, require investigation and report to see whether or not it is our duty to prosecute them.  Doing all those things and considering so generously <Col N="1127" /> the cases of those men who have inflicted such wrongs upon the country one must remember the dupes who followed their example and who have been prosecuted in the civil courts and sentenced.  It is all in that one period.  It was a vicious cycle.  Take the case of the man who fought for us during, say, 19 or 20 months and then fell&mdash;and fell only once.  We arrested him for it and sentenced him.  There is no plea made in respect of him.  The plea is only for those who started it, and but for whom that man would not be in jail to-day.</P>
    <P>The other case the Deputy mentioned was, I think, a most unfortunate parallel.  That is the case which has been before the public here for the past couple of months&mdash;the case of what some people call the mutineers.  Are the facts the same?  Here were men who believed that they suffered a severe grievance, a real grievance. Within three days or a week of having addressed a letter which was mutinous in tone and treason-like in its appearance, they wrote a letter saying they accepted the authority of the Government elected by the people of the country.  Although I know very well that they did not agree with perhaps the majority of that Government, still their very acceptance of their authority places them on an entirely different plane.  Even if they had rendered us no service during the past two years, that very acceptance placed them in a position in which they could not be compared with the other people who spread the torch.</P>

      <P>I am taking the statement as it was made.  I think it was most unfortunate to draw a parallel between the two cases, and I submit, with great respect even to Deputy Gorey, that we have shown great courage in releasing about 12,000 prisoners in practically twelve months.</P>

      <P>Deputy Baxter says he does not want criminals out. Are we entitled to examine to see whether we have any of them or not. If Deputy Gorey were in my position, or in the position of the Minister for Home Affairs, or the Minister for Defence, would he examine into 12,000 records in twelve months, and not have a small residue left?  When he says, &ldquo;What good is the balance,&rdquo; I tell him the law of the land, the law he went out to support, the law which his colleagues paid tribute to to-night, is that they are prisoners and sentenced, and that, as a matter of fact, under the law, they should be in a convict prison.  We have not sent them there.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a peculiar mentality whose only policy is a negative policy.  Everything is negative&mdash;preventing public meetings, interrupting public meetings, and winding up with, perhaps, the most colossal and gigantic blunder that ever was made&mdash;that was the great big hunger strike of last year.  Two lives were lost in that hunger strike.  For what?  Everybody knew we were releasing them. We had given evidence of it in the number already released, and still they should have, as it were, a little flutter before the end.  There is no use in telling us here now that this would not be accepted by them as a surrender by us to their threat of hostility to the Tailteann games.  It would, and it would be hailed as a victory by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may possibly have been some sort of excuse previous to the election last year, which they contested, so far as I know, in every constituency in the country, and they put their case to the people, the highest court in the land That answer was against them.  They were definitely defeated there, and at that time they should have surrendered those arms.  It is not too much to ask.  Some of their best men realised that, and they were released, and to-morrow Mr. de Valera can walk out of jail if he orders the surrender of arms, and if they come in.  We do not want to keep them.  We are much more anxious than they are to end this thing.  It takes up a lot of our time, and it gives us no pleasure to know <Col N="1129" /> that any man is in pain.  Last year they tried the same game at the cinema and theatre performances, and it all failed.  This thing will fail also.  I put it to the House, and let this be my last word&mdash;pass a vote of want of confidence in the Government, and then release the prisoners, but do not pass the Resolution in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the President has dealt with this question in the manner in which he has dealt with it.  He seems to forget that this is May, 1924, and that the arguments that he used a year and eighteen months ago ought not to be valid and are not valid.  I deny that they were valid then, and I deny it now.  The Minister referred to the last election. After the last election I said that so far as I was concerned I took it as a direction from the people that they preferred that we of the Labour Party should not interfere and take the initiative in pressing for the release of prisoners, that the friends of the prisoners and those who claimed a peculiar interest in the prisoners&mdash;that it was not our business&mdash;would look after the prisoners' case.  I said that we of this party would support any person or any movement in favour of the release of the prisoners, and the carrying out of what we believed to be the right national policy in regard to political offences, and in regard to the intentions of the Constitution, that we will leave it to others to take the initiative and that we would support them and we did so.  I am supporting Deputy Baxter in this motion, and I do not think it has been improved by the reference to the Tailteann Games, but I am not going to assent to the proposition of the President because one or two, ten or fifteen, Deputies believe that the coming of the Tailteann Games is an added reason for the release of the prisoners, that because they rely on that added reason all the other reasons should be forgotten.  The President has referred to three classes of persons affected by this Resolution &mdash;those who have been tried by courts and convicted, those who are interned hut not yet tried, and those who are, in the phrase, &ldquo;on the run.&rdquo;  Those who have been tried and convicted, the President says, are free under the <Col N="1130" /> law to make an application and an appeal for a review of their cases, and he has assured the House that&mdash;I do not know what proportion&mdash;a very large proportion of those who had their cases reviewed after sentence by court-martial found their sentences greatly reduced and in many cases releases. have been ordered.  Is not that the most eloquent condemnation of these courts that you could imagine?  Does it not prove to any person that these courts ought to be scrapped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I must intervene. There was an express direction given to the judges that we wanted them&mdash; unless there were extraordinary reasons to the contrary&mdash;to release the men.  I, myself, gave instructions to the Minister for Defence and he directed the judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>In the words of an eloquent counsel in another place, &ldquo;This is really more and more sad.&rdquo; The courts, which were established under the law which the President relies on, sentenced prisoners to long terms of imprisonment.  Another court or tribunal is established under the law to review those cases, and the President admitted and affirmed that those cases had been reviewed in such a way as to mean release or a great reduction. That proves that the sentence of the court was not just.  He also claimed that the reviewing of these cases and the action of the judge in the case was under the direction of the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="PRESIDENT PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only right that I should intervene.  This is a very serious matter.  The men constituting those courts have their honour impugned here in the absence of any information, and I submit it is not fair to the officers of the court who undertook that duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following the President's statement for the purpose of showing that it is at least unwise to be pressing, as a justification for his action, the existing law.  He is, at the same time, making that a defence.  He explains how the law, according to the administration, has been followed and how judgments have been given and sentences imposed which appeared to <Col N="1131" /> have been entirely unjustified on the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case, and you know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The President cannot have it every way.  If it is not the ease that those sentences were just, according to the facts, how can he say that those persons charged with reviewing the cases on appeal were justified in releasing the prisoners?  The end which was accomplished, the release of those prisoners, was probably the right end to be accomplished, but I ask him to do what he would like to do, what his better judgment prompts him to do, and to do in a generous way, what be has secured in a niggardly, slow, half-hearted way.  Then we have the case of the internees who have not been tried.  Now, I will assume that there are a dozen or twenty or fifty. The President seems to think that because there are only now 600 that the position is not so serious, but 600 persons imprisoned in this country is a very serious fact.  Round about three hundred of them have not been tried even by those courts.  Three hundred persons interned in a country which is not at war and which is not suffering under armed rebellion is a very serious fact, and, I am afraid that the President and the Ministry as a whole do not realise the seriousness of it, because they have been through a period actively engaged in what was called a rebellion and insurrection, and latterly putting down a counter-rebellion and a counter-insurrection.  It is only comparatively that the President and the Ministry can think of those three hundred people interned without trial, as something not serious.  My proposition is that you cannot justify the detention of 50 persons let alone 300. You cannot alone justify the detention of one person in a time of peace in this country which purports to be living under a Constitution which was deliberately designed to protect the citizen.  You cannot justify that and at the same time claim that we are at peace and that the state of armed rebellion has been put down and has ceased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> Again, the Minister has referred to the conduct of people outside, to the peculiar mentality of those persons, those persons being 600 inside and how many thousand outside?  Those persons with peculiar mentalities include the person who was quoted specially, Miss MacSwiney, who is outside. Those 11,000 persons who have been released contain within their number a large proportion who are politically more influential than those who have been detained.  How can you justify the continued detention?  It is not very satisfactory when we are dealing with the question of the release of those who are at present in prison to refer to the action of those outside prison who attempted to interfere with public meetings.  Those who interfere with public meetings have not been interned. They were outside.  However, very probably if those who are interned are influential enough to be leaders, their leadership would prevent interference with public meetings.  I say it is worth a trial.  It is worth the risk, if there is any risk.  If you want to prove that the Free State is established, and has got control and authority in the country, do not keep your political opponents in prison.  It is a good many years ago since I read about the method of treating active political opponents on the Continent of Europe for offences against the stability of the State. People were sentenced for long periods of internment in fortresses, and were banished to distant parts of their country.  I have learned since how these people who were banished have come into power in their respective countries, and the policy of banishment and internment in fortresses proved an utter failure, as it will prove in this country.  The position that the Government has taken up is not one that is going to bring satisfaction.  It is a tribute, as I said earlier, to the desire, that I believe to be the sincere desire of the President, to release the prisoners.  He does not desire to keep them, but he is afraid of the political consequence of release.  He is credited with courage.  Can he not be courageous enough in this matter to be willing to open the jail gates to all those who have been convicted or interned for political offences or for offences which <Col N="1133" /> would not be criminal in any other circumstances?</P>
    <P>Unless they are actual criminals under the ordinary law, then I plead with him that there should be a general release.  I would suggest the importance of considering this matter, having regard to the attitude of the courts. We read some time ago of a case in the courts where constitutional points were raised.  It is quite evident from the expressed opinions of the judges, that we have either to admit that many of these prisoners are detained unconstitutionally or against the Constitution, or that the Constitution is not worth anything, that it is being amended, or may be amended, by any and every Act of the Oireachtas.  Now, that is a dilemma, as it seems to me, that might lead the Government into a position where the continued detention of these prisoners will bring a nemesis very undesirable.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an Order of the Courts that these persons have been detained unconstitutionally; or, alternately, if it is to turn out that the Constitution which we have passed, and under which we are acting, is worth nothing as a constitutional document, that it is subject to continuous change, then I say, that the Dáil will be brought into contempt, and the whole position of the Ministry and of the Government and of the Oireachtas will be made farcical.  But I would not like to close on that note.  I believe that it is good policy to release all political prisoners.  I believe we have much to gain by recognising the danger there is to the constitutional stability of this country or of any country by treating the question of imprisonment without trial lightly.  I believe it is dangerous to the future of the country to rely upon the Acts of the Oireachtas which were passed in times of emergency and under pressure, without real consideration by that Oireachtas, and to rely upon Acts for the continued imprisonment of men without trial.  I say that it is bad policy from the point of view of the stability of the State, to keep these prisoners interned, and it would be advantageous in every respect as showing confidence in the powers of the State.  It would be more to the <Col N="1134" /> credit of the State to be able to say, &ldquo;Yes, we are in a position to maintain the law.  We are in a position to put down crime.  We are in a position to subdue rebellion, and, therefore, we can afford to release those persons whom, a year ago, we thought it necessary to intern.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As one who believes and has believed for some time back that the prisoners, the men who took part in the recent war against the Government of the country should not be detained any longer, I rise to support Deputy Baxter's Motion.  Now, I do not speak in any spirit of carping criticism, of the Government.  My sole intention is to give them every help in making the government of the country easier for them, if possible, and to achieve that end I think no act would have a more salutary effect on the country at the moment than the releasing of the prisoners at present detained. I will make an exception, however, that these people who were guilty of criminal acts that the laws of the country would not justify, should be kept in prison until such time as their crimes are brought home to them. But in the interests of peace and good-will in the country, and speaking in the hope of a spirit of good understanding and the bringing about of a position of goodwill, I believe the best course the Government could take would be to release these prisoners, the prisoners that went into this war and fought for purely political motives. We know it is very hard to distinguish, but I know that the great majority of the men in at present were men who went into the war from purely political motives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCABE</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I hold that that anyway.  I believe it.  My second reason for supporting Deputy Baxter's motion is that the great majority of the men, the real fighting men in the recent war on the Irregular or so-called Republican side, have been already released. That is my experience in my part of the country at any rate, and the fact that 12,000 of these prisoners have been already released and that the great majority of these never gave any <Col N="1135" /> guarantee to respect the State, or to hand over their arms, is about the best argument I know for the release of the remainder.  The President mentioned this case.  To my mind every argument the President adduced against the release of the prisoners is an argument for their release.  For instance, that argument about the 12,000 released is in my opinion a very good argument as to why the remainder should be released. The second argument was as to propaganda which has no bearing whatever upon this case.  Why give these people in this Irregular movement food for this propaganda campaign?</P>

      <P>Now, I must say that I consider it unfortunate that the subject of the Tailteann Games was dragged into this matter.  But in another way I do not know whether it is unfortunate or not.  War itself is, I suppose, a great game although it is a brutal and savage one, but it is a game, I think, in which, when the final whistle blows; people should not try to play at any longer.  It is not sportsmanlike. It is now twelve months since this long whistle sounded.  I did not believe then that it was the final whistle, but since then, and from experience, I believe it was the long whistle, and I am convinced now that the war indeed at that time ended, and that there will be no resumption of it. From a sporting point of view, I think it is playing the game badly to continue the war any longer on those people opposed to us when they cried <Col N="1136" /> quits.  Now, there is another side to it. Deputy Johnson has touched on the matter already, and it is this, that if the Government have confidence enough in themselves, and confidence enough in the stability of the State, and confidence enough in the people be hind them, and in the intelligence of the people behind them, they will rise above this little threat made by the wild women and the effeminate men and release the prisoners, and rise above this threat which is a small thing after all, and act as they should be, the courageous defenders and protagonists of the State.  I do not see why this is not as good an opportunity as could be afforded them.  As to the little threat made against the Tailteann Games, I do not see why the Government should not ignore that completely, and have courage in themselves and in the State, and in the future of Ireland, and throw these people out of the prisons and ignore these small threats.  There is another point that I would like to touch on, and it has not been touched upon by any other Deputy.  It is the question of the prisoners in Northern Ireland, in Scotland, and probably in England.</P>

      <P>Well, I do not know. I will go ahead anyway.  If we want to have these prisoners released, I do not see why we should be detaining prisoners in the Saorstát.  If we ask Sir James Craig or some English Minister to release prisoners belonging to the <Col N="1137" /> Nationalists in the North of Ireland, or prisoners in England or Scotland, those people would have a very good argument to use against us.  They would say: &ldquo;What are you keeping your untried prisoners in Southern Ireland for?  Why ask us to do what you are not prepared to do yourselves?&rdquo; That would be a very good argument for them to throw back at us if we ask them to release the prisoners that they have interned.  I do not speak in any spirit of carping criticism of the Government.  I want to help them in every way I can.  I want to help the country and to create a good fellowship, and to promote a good understanding and encourage progress in the country.  With these ends solely in view I do appeal to the Government to reconsider this whole policy of the prisoners and act in a manner that will restore what is very urgently needed in Ireland at the moment, a national spirit of good-will and understanding, if not all over Ireland, at least amongst the people who are responsible for the creation of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that I desire to associate myself in the main with the statement of Deputy Baxter, except in this one respect, that it would have been better had no reference whatever been made in his resolution to the Tailteann Games.  These games, as they now stand, are the property of the entire athletic associations of this country, and, as everybody will recognise, these associations have had nothing, and will have nothing, to say to politics.  It was sought to introduce this subject at the General Council of the Games, and by unanimous consent, and speaking for all those big sections of the social life of the nation, the matter was excluded.  It must continue to be excluded regardless of the result of this plea to the Government for the release of the prisoners; nor can it have any bearing whatever on the outcome of the games themselves as far as the Council is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, satisfied from contact with a great number of supporters of the Free State, not only in this country but in neighbouring countries, that the time has come when, in their <Col N="1138" /> opinion, the nation would benefit substantially by cutting definitely and finally with the past.  It is their view that the particular past of the last two years could be very well forgotten in the interests of the nation, and that there is no point whatever in resurrecting old sores, sores created through abnormal conditions and under abnormal circumstances.  It is their view that any harshness between political opponents in this country, whether in the Free State or in the 32 counties, or any particular harshness in the treatment of the respective peoples of these parts of Ireland, is undesirable in the general interests of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is felt that these bickerings and quarrels are being unnecessarily prolonged and that they hang, so to speak, like a wet blanket over the peace and development of our nation.  I do not know whether other members of the Dáil have experienced a similar feeling in any part of the country, but I am satisfied that what I say here represents the feeling of a very considerable section of those who support the Free State.  It has been represented to me that in some negotiations that took place about the end of last year or the beginning of this year&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;a Minister of our Government committed himself to a promise that all these prisoners would be released about Easter time.  I cannot say whether it is true or not, but the name of Deputy Professor MacNeill has been mentioned in this connection, and, I think, generally quoted in certain papers in the country.</P>

      <P>Now, this seems to constitute the particular grievance, and it would be well that the matter should be cleared up here and now. Sooner or later the prisoners will have to be released, and sooner or later we must come to the conclusion that there is no further justification for their retention. There is much in what Deputy Johnson states when he refers to the fact that these prisoners are being retained for political purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That view is increasing in the minds of many people.  I do not believe it. <Col N="1139" /> I believe that the Government is genuinely anxious to release the prisoners at the earliest opportunity, consistent with safety.  At the same time it would be particularly unfortunate for the future of this country that it should be generally believed that we were in any way associated with an effort to imprison political opponents because they were political opponents.  As I say, I do not believe that there is anything in that theory, but it has been advanced.  I have a certain sympathy with many of the men still in prison. I know many of them for a very long number of years.  I have worked with them in many movements, and I refuse to believe that a great many of these men are not sincere and honest.  I believe that they acted in what they considered the best interests of their country.  I disagree profoundly with their view.  I backed the Government by any little assistance I could give them, in asserting the opposite view point, but still I believe that they were genuine, and that their feelings should be so respected.  I also cannot forget that whilst many of these genuine men are in prison, a great many others who, during the period of the Anglo-Irish war, were deadly opponents of this country and opposed it in a variety of ways and who when the Treaty became an accomplished fact swung over to these opponents, have become extreme in the other direction.  I know many of these men are now free.  I also know some of them personally.  At any rate I have information regarding a number of these men to the effect that their records during the last two years were not very clean and now they are free. Other men who fought against the Free State on the same occasion are in prison.  These men fought because they felt they were fighting for what they considered principle and what they considered right.  It is unfortunate that one type should be free and the other in prison.</P>
    <P>The thing is inconsistent, and it is full of inconsistency, and I hold that the only sensible and the only sound national course to take at this moment is to open the prison gates and to finish with this unfortunate period of our history.  I do not see much point in <Col N="1140" /> some of the heat introduced into the arguments to-night, but I would appeal to the Government to wind up this phase of Irish life.  We have been told, with some authority, that the resort to arms is finished with, that henceforth it is the intention of the Republican party to pursue constitutional methods.  I am prepared to accept that view, and I am prepared to throw the onus of that word on the party responsible. I am pretty well convinced from what I know of a great many people concerned that we are done with arms in this country for a mighty long time. There is no desire on the part of the Irish people, either supporters of the Free State or supporters of their Republican opponents, or supporters of another party in another part of Ireland, to resurrect another row under arms.  The Irish people are fed up with arms.  They are finished with them, and the sooner that, in our minds and in our time, we finish definitely with any reference to them the better.</P>

      <P>I expect, however, when I see it I will be able to identify it as one of those things that we are familiar with, that we experience every day&mdash;attempts to gull the people in various ways, to gull them with regard to the whole political situation, and to gull them with regard to particulars.  I will anticipate the Postmaster-General's bit of writing by saying plainly that the thing is false.  I have never suggested, <Col N="1141" /> never in the faintest way to anyone, under any circumstances or at any time, that it was the intention of the Government, or that it was in prospect, or that it was a probability, that the prisoners would be released at Easter or at any other definable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to be courageous, and we are asked to be generous; in short, we are asked to be what. those who have no responsibility can afford to be&mdash; sentimental.  We are asked to be courageous.  In what way are we to be courageous?  It is not a question of facing any personal danger.  We are asked to be courageous with the interests of the country, and we are asked to be generous.  It is easy for Deputies, and easy, also, for people outside to be generous with what they are not responsible for.  In this matter we are going to act according to our judgment, and not according to sentimentality. We do not require any certificate to prove that the object the Government had in view in placing certain persons in detention was not vindictive.  I do not think it would be possible to convince the public that the object the Government had in view was to get back upon political opponents. But just as we have not been sentimental in the matter of being vindictive or in the matter of acting with resentment towards political opponents, so we do not intend to be sentimental in the other direction.  We act, at least we endeavour to act, according to our lights.  We endeavour to act; it is our aim to act.  We have a sense of duty towards this nation and towards this country and to no other principle whatsoever, and so far as we can&mdash;we do not claim to be archangels&mdash;so far as we can to banish other motives.  It is all very well for the Postmaster-General and others to say that they know that some of these people are honest and sincere.  It is not a case of thought-reading. It is not a case of trying to enter into people's minds, and find whether a course of action which they planned and led up to and stood for, and took part in and carried out, was sincere or honest.  The question before us, and that we have to consider, is not whether it was sincere or honest, but whether it was a danger to this <Col N="1142" /> country and a danger to this nation. Deputy Johnson is quite logical.  He opposed all the special measures under which these men are detained, and why, therefore, should he not oppose their detention?  But we placed before this Dáil the reasons for which we thought we should be empowered to use special and exceptional measures, and these powers were granted and given.</P>

      <b>LEAS-CHEANN COMHAIRLE</b> took the Chair at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfEoinMacNeill" hpid="Professor MacNEILL Professor MacNEILL">
      <NameTxt>Professor MacNEILL</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Johnson suggests that in some way or other &mdash;he has gone back to the old debates that we had here&mdash;that in some way or other the granting of these measures was hostile to the Constitution.  The plain fact is, and everyone knows it, that these measures were granted and also the action that followed them and that was taken in accordance with them, was followed and was taken to maintain and to make good the Constitution. I do not know that anyone will be convinced, or that anyone will think, that there is any depth in the argument that a particular set of men bearing executive responsibility at present are desirous of nullifying the Constitution, or of setting themselves up as a despotic body above the law, tyrannically anxious to do away with the rights of the public and the rights of others.  These things may be suggested here for the purpose of debate. They will carry no weight outside.  We are as anxious&mdash;I am not saying more anxious&mdash;we are at least as anxious that the Constitution should prevail, as anxious that the public right should prevail, as anxious that real public liberty should prevail, as any Deputy or any body of Deputies in this assembly. You may impeach, if you like, our judgment in these matters, but I would ask Deputies who speak in opposition to us, if they wish to be believed, not to impeach our motives.  The responsibility is on us.  It is an easy thing&mdash;I have seen it done&mdash;to walk into the premises of a business man and present him with a document or an argument somewhat different from the arguments that were presented to business men up to twelve months ago, persuading him to give his name to some <Col N="1143" /> memorial or to take part in promoting some local resolution or some other thing of that kind in favour of the release of prisoners.  The people who do that know perfectly well exactly the sort of difficulty that they are placing the man in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other cases there is a certain amount of sentimental wheedling carried on and various other motives are appealed to.  When the public are taken one by one like that, they, like the proverbial sticks belonging to the bundle, are individually weak and are easily broken.  The individual man has no very deep sense of responsibility, and he easily consents to a thing put up to him which perhaps he would not consent to if he had the responsibility that we have to bear.  A certain volume of what is called public opinion is created item by item in that manner.  The Government that would be guided by that so-called form of public opinion will never govern in any country, would not do any good for any country.  We had years ago these snow-ball resolutions and other things of that kind and we find that when the honest citizen is away from these little pressures and temptations, when he has a chance of using the real responsibility which is his, the real part which he can take in the affairs of Government, by registering his vote, by putting his paper into the ballot box, he does not always act in the same way as when he is approached by people and appeals are made to his sentimentality, and he is asked to give assent to a thing for which at the moment he feels no responsibility.  What we were up against was not politics at all in any ordinary sense, not war in any ordinary sense, not opposition to a Government in any ordinary sense.  The way in which the Treaty was to be destroyed and the Constitution was to be destroyed was by the economic destruction of the country, by reducing this country to paralysis.  The way in which government was to be made impossible was by destroying credit in the country and making its economic position impossible. To that end actual distress and suffering, unemployment and all those things were to be made to serve. According to this new creed&mdash;it is a new-fangled creed and does not belong <Col N="1144" /> to the tradition of Irish nationality at all&mdash;distress, unemployment and all those economic evils were to be made to serve the cause of the Republic.  I have said before that I know of no instance in history in which a campaign of that kind was undertaken.  That is not politics to my mind.  It is not war to my mind.  I do not know what term to use for it.</P>

      <P>These things have not been abandoned.  I do not know whether these people are a political party or not.  They themselves say they are a Republic.  In their graciousness and descending from their majesty, they gave the Irish people not peace at all, but, according to their doctrine, an armistice.  If it is true, as Deputy McCabe says, and as the Postmaster-General says, that there is security in this country against any further outbreak, we know to whom that security is due.  Let us not forget it.  It is not due to the long whistle.  I would ask Deputies not to allow their votes in this matter to be guided by sentiment, not to be guided by what has been called by one or two Deputies, courage and generosity, but to be guided purely by a sense of duty and responsibility to the country.  They, as well as we, are a part of the Government of this country, and I think that they ought to make it plain to all concerned that sentimentality is not going to be their guide, as it certainly is not going to be our guide, in the decision that we have to take in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. GOREY Mr. GOREY">
      <NameTxt>Mr. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>In approaching this question I wish to assure the Minister for Education that neither from these Benches nor in our minds have we ever questioned the motives of Ministers. He talks about responsibility and those who have responsibility.  We have no illusions at all about those carrying the responsibility.  Even though the members of the Executive Council must carry great responsibility on this and other State matters, some of us feel equal responsibility in supporting this motion.  Perhaps it is assuming too much on our part, but we feel great responsibility in this matter.  We make certain recommendations to the heads of the State, and in making those recommendations <Col N="1145" /> we are alive to our responsibility.  A lot has been said about those people that are retained in gaol.  I ask the Dáil and the people outside, are they worth all this?  Some Deputies may set a great value on them.  Some may put them on a pedestal. I think they are very ordinary individuals.  Deputy McCabe refers to the principle that some people fought for.  When he mentioned that I questioned him, and I question him still. lie said the people fought for principles and ideals, and nothing else.  I do not believe one word of that.  I do not believe that five per cent. of the men who went out fought for principles or ideals.  I believe they fought for personalities, and perhaps for something less than personalities.  That is what I think, and I am honest enough to say it.  I do not care who it pleases or who it does not please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tailteann Games have been referred to, and we have been blamed for mentioning them in this motion.  Some Deputies seem to assume that it is because of a threat made against the Tailteann Games that we have raised this question.  It is not.  As far as I know, the Executive of the Tailteann Games have met hostility from these people, and as far as I know, have defied that hostility, and are determined to go on whether the prisoners are released or not.  Therefore, putting forward that argument is no good.  It is not on the question of interference with the Games that we put down this motion, but because of the historic associations of the Tailteann Games.  Some of us do not, perhaps, know very much about the history of our country, but we know enough to realise that during the Tailteann Games, the season was one of good-will and peace, in which every citizen of the State, except the criminal, was allowed liberty.  I think that would be a fairly correct description of what obtained during the Tailteann Games. The point we have gone on particularly is that of the old associations and what those associations mean.  It is not because of these people's interference. To me and, perhaps, to some of those in charge of the Games, that matters nothing.  Before we lost our nationhood the Tailteann Games were the greatest national festival we had. <Col N="1146" /> We have recovered that nationhood. Although some people assert we have not, I, for one, maintain that we have. The Tailteann Games are being revived in connection with our restored nationhood. That nationhood and the old associations connected with it are dear to us.  In my opinion, this great National Festival was the conception of a big man with a big mind.  Whoever was responsible&mdash;Deputy Wilson tells me it was a woman&mdash;well, I take off my hat to that person.  I believe that the Games help to take away little minds and little men from the narrow and personal ruts they were, probably, running in.  I think if we could do the same now we would have done a good thing for the nation, when too many of our little men, with little minds, are running in narrow ruts.  With all respect, I suggest that the time is opportune when big men should follow in the footsteps of the big men of the past. There is ho one more convinced than I am that we have in the Dáil big men, who have faced big things, and who have big minds.  I believe that they think only in the terms of the nation, and not in personal terms.  I know that this is an appeal for an experiment, perhaps a risky experiment.  I have a little confidence in the material we are going to experiment on, perhaps not all the material, but in a very high percentage of it.  This is not a question, perhaps, of courage or generosity. To my mind it is a question of statesmanship.</P>
