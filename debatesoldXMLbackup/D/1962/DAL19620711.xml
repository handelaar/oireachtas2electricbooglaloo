      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, and in No. 16 Vote 43 and the Supplementary Estimate.  It is proposed to interrupt business at 1.30 p.m. to take No. 15 and, when completed, to resume the Order of Business.  Questions will be taken at 3 p.m.  It is not proposed to interrupt Public Business to take Private Members' Business. I also have an announcement to make regarding the business of the session. Following discussions between the Whips, the programme of business for the session has been revised as follows &mdash; Bills: all Stages of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, Local Government (Sanitary Services) Bill, Housing (Loans and Grants) Bill, Restriction of Imports Bill&mdash;these four Bills have been ordered for Second Reading today &mdash; the Social Welfare Bill, which is being introduced today, and the Army Pensions Bill, which will be introduced tomorrow; and the Committee and Remaining Stages of the State Guarantees (Transport) Bill and the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, and the Report and Final Stages of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill; the Estimate and Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, the Supplementary Estimate for Agricultural Grants &mdash; I presume that can be taken in conjunction with the Bill &mdash; a Supplementary Estimate for Increases in Pensions and possibly another Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the main Estimates are <Col N="1956" /> concerned, it has been agreed that, apart from the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, discussion on the remaining Estimates will be adjourned to the next Dáil session.  This will be achieved by the passing of these Estimates now without debate, the Government undertaking to submit token Estimates for all the Departments concerned and to provide time for their discussion during the next session.  A motion designed to give effect to this arrangement will be submitted to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That suggestion has been made on many occasions during the past 30 or 40 years.  I think it would be possible to devise a system by which the financial business of the Dáil can be done at a time and in a manner more convenient to Deputies. The Government would be quite prepared to discuss that with other Parties but we have no proposals ourselves to put forward because anything which might appear to involve curtailment of the scope of debate would be primarily a matter for the Opposition Parties to suggest rather than the Government.</P>

If we are showered with Bills between Easter and the Summer Recess we will always get into this kind of mess at the end of the legislative session.

      <P>Yesterday this House dealt with two very important Bills in a very short space of time.  Over £2,000,000 was voted to CIE and a vast sum, running into several millions, to the ESB.

There was time available over the past six months for the discussion and the carrying out of Government business but now huge sums are voted in the space of 20 minutes without any discussion at all.  I feel that this House should remain in session until such <Col N="1959" /> important Estimates as that of the Department of Justice are dealt with. These discussions should not be left over until next Christmas when all the harm will have been done.  I object as strongly as I possibly can to any decision of the House to adjourn until the business is completed.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1962. &mdash; Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the Government's proposals, as already announced by the Minister for Finance, to grant increased rate reliefs to farmers. The Bill will apply to the three financial years ending on the 31st March, 1965, and provides for the amendment of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Acts in four respects.  It will increase from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. the primary allowance on land valuations up to £20 and on the first £20 of higher valuations.  It will provide a supplementary allowance of 25 per cent. of the general rate on land valuations over £20.  It will reduce the minimum qualifying age for the employment allowance from 17 to 16 years.  Finally, it will enable the total Grant to be paid from voted moneys, instead of partly from the Central Fund and partly from voted moneys as at present.</P>
      <P>Under these proposals the Agricultural Grant will amount to approximately £8.6 millions in the current year, an increase of £2¾ millions on the total amount paid last year.</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Grant was first given under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.  The basis of its distribution and the total amount of the Grant has been altered on a number of occasions.  Between 1898 and 1946, however, the amount of the Grant was always a fixed amount, stipulated by each successive Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, made a radical departure in the method of calculation of the Grant and set the pattern for all subsequent legislation in the matter. Since that measure was enacted, the amount of the Grant has been related <Col N="1961" /> to the actual rates struck by county councils in each financial year.</P>
    <P>The 1946 Act provided that the Grant would be the sum needed to give relief on the following basis:</P>
    <P>(1)  a primary allowance at the rate of three-fifths of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation up to £20;</P>
    <P>(2)  a supplementary allowance of one-fifth of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation over £20; and</P>
    <P>(3)  an employment allowance, calculated at the rate of 10/-in the £ on the land valuation over £20, subject to the limitation that the allowance should not exceed £6 10s. for each adult workman at work on the holding during the whole of the preceding calendar year.</P>
    <P>An amending Act in 1953 abolished the supplementary allowance, increased the employment allowance to £17 per workman, but left the primary allowance unchanged.  This method of distribution was continued up to and including the last financial year.  The total of the Grant grew from £599,011 in 1898 to £2.91 million in 1946/47, and to £5.84 million last year.</P>
    <P>Sections 1, 3 and 4 of the Bill now before the House provide for the payment of the increased primary allowance of seven-tenths of the general rate, and the supplementary allowance of a quarter of the general rate on land valuations over £20.</P>
    <P>Under the old legislation, the primary allowance would have increased to an estimated £5.085 million in the current year.  The amendments now being made will result in a further increase to an estimated £5.935 million.  Thus, the primary allowance alone in the current year will exceed by a considerable amount the total of the Grant paid last year.</P>
    <P>The total Supplementary Allowance will amount to an estimated £1.7 million in the current year.  When the Supplementary allowance was given previously &mdash; between the years 1946 and 1953 &mdash; it amounted to one-fifth of the general rate as against the <Col N="1962" /> allowance of one-quarter under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The £17 employment allowance first introduced under the 1953 Act is being continued.  Up to the present a workman in respect of whom this allowance could be granted had to be at least 17 years of age at the commencement of the qualifying period.  Section 2 of the Bill provides for the reduction of the minimum qualifying age to 16 years which is the age at which a person becomes insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  It is difficult to make an accurate estimate of the cost of implementing this proposal, but it will probably be around £90,000 in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The provision in Section 5 is to ensure that the total of the employment allowances and the supplementary allowances in any case will not exceed the total rates on the land valuation over £20.</P>
    <P>Under Section 48 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, the basic Agricultural Grant, introduced by that Act and amounting to £599,011 yearly, is paid from the Central Fund, while the balance of the Grant is defrayed from a special Vote accounted for by the Minister for Finance.  Section 6 proposes, in effect, that the full amount of the grant shall be met in future from voted moneys.</P>
    <P>As I have stated earlier, the total allowances provided under the Bill will amount to an estimated £8.6 million in the current year and will afford farmers relief to the extent of 57 per cent. of the gross rates leviable on agricultural land.  As a result the net rates payable by farmers on agricultural land in the current year will be below the amounts paid by them in 1956/57.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, people welcome anything that means a reduction in the amount of the outgoings they may have to meet, but that does not at all imply that the manner in which a Government have allocated that reduction is accepted on all sides as being the wisest method of allocation. Quite apart from that, as I understand from the Minister's speech the <Col N="1963" /> Bill now before the House will involve during the current year &mdash; I should like the Minister's confirmation on this &mdash; a sum of £2,750,000 which will be payable out of the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget statement provided a sum of £2,500,000 and, accordingly, this means, as I understand the speech the Minister for Local Government has now made, that we have another Supplementary Estimate already, three months after the Budget, for £250,000. If I have clearly understood the Minister, it seems extraordinary that the Government were not in a position at Budget time accurately and properly to make their calculations.  This is yet another instance of the manner in which the Government do not appear properly to work out their business in advance as a responsible Government would do.</P>
      <P>Everyone accepts without question that the burden of rates on ratepayers is not merely a rising one but one which has almost become stifling in recent years.  The tables in the Statistical Abstract for 1960, which I think provide the latest figures available &mdash; certainly they are the latest available to me, looking for them in a hurry &mdash; show that in 1939 the total amount collected in rates throughout the entire country was £6,271,000 and that in the year ending 31st March, 1960, this sum had risen to £21,420,000.  The amount in the two years since then, and particularly in the year to the 31st March, 1962, had, of course, risen very substantially more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those members of the House who want to remember such a fact will know, and the public will know from the publicised document at the time, that we in this Party in the General Election of last year published in a specific manner in our programme a proposal to assist in the reduction of rates by a different method of paying for certain health charges.  Of course, we would all like to have a situation in which we could get our benefits without paying for them but that is not possible.  It, therefore, becomes a question of deciding in what manner the health services should be paid for. <Col N="1964" /> The services, are, as the Government themselves admitted quite readily this year, not satisfactory.  Apart from their not being satisfactory in themselves, the method of payment has not been regarded as satisfactory either. For that reason among others, we in the Fine Gael Party submitted in our policy, and we retain as part of the policy of this Party still, a proposal that certain health services should be dealt with on an insurance principle which would have the effect of relieving to some extent the burden on ratepayers.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Government did not in that respect, as they have done in many others, accept automatically after the General Election certain points of our policy because then we would not have in this year one of the difficulties which will be imposed by this Bill.  The Bill does provide some relief for the farmers, for those who are engaged in agriculture, our primary industry.  To that extent and to the extent that it helps to reduce overheads, it is welcome, but it has one fundamental fault &mdash; that it provides no better relief for the efficient farmer than for the inefficient farmer; that it provides no better relief for the man who is doing his utmost to ensure his holding is producing as much as it possibly can for the nation than it does for the man who is letting his holding for grazing or in conacre.</P>
    <P>It surely would be a better solution of the problem in relation to agriculture that whatever moneys were to be spent for reducing the overheads of those engaged in agriculture would be spent on the efficient farmers rather than that some of it should be siphoned off the efficient farmer and paid to his neighbour and colleague who is not making the effort he is. Under this Bill the person who lets his land completely will get exactly the same benefit as the person who is working not a 40-hour week but one very nearly double that, as many farmers, particularly small holders engaged in milk production and dairying, have to do.</P>
    <P>I agree at once that this is an easier <Col N="1965" /> method of distributing the reduction of overheads but the fact that it is an easier method does not say it is a better one.  On the contrary, in my view it is a worse one and does not provide an incentive towards better production.  As well as that, we all know that in rural Ireland to-day there are people who are hit as badly as the farmers have been by rising costs.  They are the small shopkeepers in the smaller towns and villages who have been finding their costs rising all around them, and at the same time as their overheads have been increasing substantially they find no relief whatever in this Bill in respect of the rates they have to pay.  That, too, is another way in which the Minister is wrong in not providing in his Bill adequate assistance for those people.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to find there is not in this Bill some statutory recognition of the difficulties that regularly arise throughout the country in relation to the employment allowance.  I accept that the purpose of an employment allowance should be to provide permanent employment on a holding and that any variation in the conditions of that allowance which would assist or provide an incentive for irregular employment would not be a good thing.  At the same time, we all know there are very often considerable difficulties where a man leaves his employment in replacing him immediately, particularly if a person should happen to leave his employment in Kildare, for example, at the height of the turf-cutting season.  It may be very difficult at that moment to get another employee to replace the man who has gone, whether it be through death, illness or his getting other employment.</P>
    <P>A Minister said on a previous occasion that a period of a month was regarded in certain circumstances as being reasonable for qualification for the allowance, even though there was a month's interruption during the year. That is not long enough.  At certain times during the year, it would be very difficult to replace within that period a man doing a particular job. That should be lengthened to two months, or, alternatively, where there has been a break in the year's employment <Col N="1966" /> up to a period of three months, the employment of an additional man at another period of the year should be allowed to be taken into account. Very often a person who has failed to get someone during the turf season will take on two men immediately the turf season ends for the purpose of catching up on arrears of work.  Account should be taken of that and it should be allowed to cover the permanent period for the year.</P>
    <P>In general, no one ever likes criticising a Bill which proposes to reduce individual expenditure, but it is an undoubted fact that this Bill, although providing a reduction in expenditure, does not distinguish, as good legislation should distinguish, between the efficient producer and the person who does not wish to produce at all.  It does not provide any solution to the problem of the small shopkeeper and small ratepayer in the towns and villages in rural Ireland and it does not provide any amelioration of the difficulty that arises from the interruption of permanent employment during any year.  For that reason, I would suggest the Minister would be well advised to consider between now and the Committee Stage how he could meet these points.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party do not oppose this Bill.  We appreciate the agricultural community are entitled to some concessions at present.  At the same time, we believe the Bill is not the best Bill that could be brought in in the circumstances. Everybody knows the origin of the Bill.  The Minister was forced to accede to the demands of the agricultural community to give them some increase in their standard of living just the same as other sections have got.  The Minister thought the best way of doing this was by absolving them from some of the demands on them by way of relief of rates.</P>

    <P>We have had a good deal of talk at local authority meetings about the advantages that accrue from this measure, but the Minister has given us the actual figures involved.  The small farmers, particularly those with an average valuation of £30 or less, <Col N="1967" /> are the most hard working type of farmer we have.  In the constituency I represent, we have a large number of farmers with valuations of less than £30, and that position obtains all along the western seaboard.  They have to work hard in order to eke out an existence from the land, much of which is of an indifferent nature.</P>
    <P>Take the farmer of £20 valuation in County Cork, where the rate is 44/- in the £.  What benefits will he get from this Bill?  He will get £4 8s. annually, or less than 2/- a week.  As a result of this Bill, his income is increased by about 1/8d. or 1/9d. a week.  That is what he gets from the Fianna Fáil Government as a result of this Bill.  Take the farmer of £10 valuation, of whom there are a large number in the country.  We find that such farmers in Cork will get about £2 4s. a year or about 9d. or 10d. a week.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the farmers, particularly the small farmers, feel they are getting much greater advantages from this measure than they are getting. It is not the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government to deal with agricultural development, and we will be speaking on it later on the Agriculture Estimate.  But I think the dice has been loaded very much against the small farmer in this Bill.  In my county, he is benefiting to the extent of 2s. a week.  Deputy Sweetman told us about the inefficient farmer benefiting just as much as the efficient farmer. That is so.  We have a big number of farmers in the midlands who do not work their land at all but let it to others.  They will get the full benefit.  I think it is 25 per cent. on valuations exceeding £20.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister might have given greater consideration to the small farmer.  You, Sir, appreciate what 2s. a week means to anyone at present.  It means little or nothing.  I want to make it quite clear again that for the small farmer in Cork of £20 valuation, it means about 1s. 9d. per week, and for the farmer with £10 valuation, less than 1s. a week; but in Kildare, Westmeath and Meath, it could mean a couple of pounds weekly to the big farmers.  I am disappointed that <Col N="1968" /> greater help has not been given and that indeed there is not absolute relief from rates for the small farmer.  We have heard from various public men, indeed from members of the Government, that the small farmer is the backbone of the country.  Now we are giving him this great increase in his income &mdash; 2s. a week in the case of the farmer of £20 valuation and about 9½d. per week in the case of the farmer of £10 valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this matter of the agricultural rate is very interesting.  For the past 12 months, we have had farmers all over Ireland organising themselves into protest groups.  In every county I have read about, they have marched to the headquarters of the county council, protested strongly against the high rates and called upon the local authority and the Government to do something about them.  The Government's answer to a genuine problem was to throw this bone as if to a crowd of dogs&mdash; the that-should-keep-them-quiet idea. This is the greatest waste of money that could be thought up by any allegedly responsible Government.  The Government are showing utter contempt for the small farmer in the manner in which this money is being allocated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy mentioned the small farmer with £20 valuation and said that he benefits to a certain degree only.  It is only right that we should have the exact statistics so that the public will know how this money is being spent.  Over 70 per cent. of the holdings in Ireland are under £20 valuation.  That 70 per cent. are getting on an average a rebate of less than £2 per year as a result of this measure which is allegedly increasing the rebate.  The remaining 30 per cent. of the farmers are getting an average of over £13 per year so we can see which way the dice is loaded.  The majority of 70 per cent., the small men, are getting less than £2 extra of a rebate in a year while the man with a valuation of over £20 gets an average extra rebate of over £13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the first point only.  That is the start of the loading of the dice in <Col N="1969" /> favour of the big holder, but that is only part of the story.  Last year in the 26 Counties, over 825,000 acres of land were let on the 11 months system. Members on both sides of the House have been condemning for years the letting of the best land in the country on the 11 months system.  The people responsible for letting those 825,000 acres for mining purposes or to exploit the land are the people who are benefiting most under this agricultural rebate.</P>
    <P>Is this measure not an incentive to the further sub-letting of land?  Is it not an incentive to the lazy and inefficient farmer to keep on in the same old routine as he has adopted for the past 20 or 30 years?  Is it not an incentive to the gentleman farmer to spend his time in Dublin, knowing perfectly well that the Government are prepared to give him an agricultural rebate when he sets his land, and knowing that the richness and fertility of the land that is being set is gradually being mined away?</P>
    <P>Especially when we are faced with a serious issue like the Common Market, I think the Government have taken a very backward step indeed.  If we were in association with the Common Market countries, I think this step would be disapproved of by that group because it condones inefficiency and actually encourages it.  There is nothing whatever in this measure to induce, persuade or encourage the small farmer, the good farmer, to produce more.  Instead, there is an incentive to set their land and go to live perhaps in Dublin or in the large towns, and forget about the most important possession of this nation, namely, the soil.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Government are telling us that they are helping the agricultural community, that the farmers are getting a sum of over £8,000,000 to ease the burden of the rates on their holdings.  The townsman and the worker have a feeling that the farmer is being spoonfed, with the result that a feeling of animosity or antagonism is created within the different sections of the community. They believe that the small farmer is being mollycoddled but that is far <Col N="1970" /> from the truth.  If there is any mollycoddling, it is mollycoddling of the inefficient farmer, the lazy farmer, the conacre farmer and the telephone farmer.</P>
    <P>The small holder is put to the pin of his collar to rear his family.  No real help or encouragement in any form is given to him by the State.  The result of that lack of encouragement is that the small holders with their families are packing their bags and selling their holdings or turning the key in the door and moving out of the country.  The Government set up a commission recently to investigate what steps could be taken to improve the conditions of the small farmers, in the light of the proposal to join the Common Market.  That inter-Departmental committee recommended that certain steps should be taken to buttress the small holders and give them a chance of remaining in their own country, but not a single one of those proposals has been implemented. Instead, the Government have deliberately given an incentive to those who do not use their land, who have no time for it, and who are so lazy that they do not feel like carrying out their responsibilities to the State by a proper utilisation of their land.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may say that this measure should not be opposed but I want to make it quite clear that a stand must be taken at some stage.  It is vital that it should be taken now before it is too late.  Each year this rebate goes on in its present form will make the situation worse in rural Ireland.  It is not sufficient for Fine Gael or any Opposition Party to criticise the Government by saying this measure helps the inefficient farmer only.  This has been going on down through the years and so far no Government have had the courage to tackle it because, it would appear, they were afraid of the political consequences involved, or that the lazy and inefficient farmer has so much influence that he might harm the political fortunes of the Parties in the State.</P>
    <P>I represent a rural area, an area where there is very little industrial employment.  I am satisfied that the <Col N="1971" /> people I represent would prefer an alternative system to help them with their rates.  They would prefer to see credit loans made available, money made available at low rates of interest for the purchase of machinery and fertilisers, or money spent on providing marketing arrangements for their produce.  They hate the idea of being treated as if they are practically paupers, and being told that they are getting something for nothing, that with a valuation of under £20 they are getting this £1.13. or £1.18., and that they should be thankful to the Government for being so good to them.</P>
    <P>The Government are not pulling the wool over the eyes of the hardworking small farmers with this kind of measure.  Apart from that, the Government are doing damage to the national interest by prolonging this type of legislation which is an incentive to laziness on the part of the large farmers.  Instead of giving an agricultural rebate to the man with 200 acres and upwards who is not utilising his land, the Government should be bringing in a measure to double the rate of taxation on the particular individual who is not utilising his land properly. For every acre he sets he should be penalised by way of an increase in his rates rather than have his rates reduced.  If that action were taken by the Government responsible people in our community &mdash; the small farmer, the business man, the worker, the industrialist and everybody else &mdash; would be behind the Government.  If the Government were to take that action they would increase efficiency and give the people confidence in them because the people would see that there was fair-play. In addition, the inefficient and lazy farmer, the rancher and the exploiter, would have to improve his agricultural production or else get out. By getting out he would create a large pool of land which would enable the Land Commission to solve many congestion problems.  I am not in a position to force the Parties in this House to throw this measure out, but I want to be taken as protesting as strongly as I possibly can against the introduction of this measure, which will promote <Col N="1972" /> inefficiency and laziness, when, simultaneously, the Government are applying with such confidence for admission into the European Economic Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in this Bill reducing the qualifying age for the employment allowance from 17 years to 16 years is to my mind the most attractive provision in it. For a number of years I have repeatedly asked that this should be done.  I welcome the provision now. We have to cope with the problem of the flight from the land and the difficulty of holding our people in agricultural employment.  It is precisely at this age that young people decide whether they will remain on the land or seek employment elsewhere.  One of the factors aggravating the employment position on the land was the fact that this allowance was not available to the farmer who employed a youth of 16.  I welcome the reduction in the age now.  This has always been a pet subject of mine.</P>
      <P>I regret that no easement has been effected in the condition relating to the debarring of employment from recognition in the case of a poor law valuation of £5 or over.  I regard that ceiling as entirely too low.  It precludes a person with a miserable holding of £6, £7, or £8 valuation from securing employment with his neighbour because the neighbour cannot avail of the employment allowance.  It should be clear by now to all members of this House that it is impossible for a man to derive a livelihood from such a miserable holding.  I know many instances in my constituency where people have been compelled to abandon agricultural employment because the farmer felt he would have to reduce the wages he could pay by the amount of the allowance he could not obtain for giving employment to these individuals.  I ask the Minister to avail of the first opportunity that presents itself to examine into that aspect of the employment allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret, too, that greater recognition was not given to the part female labour plays in agricultural production. Particularly in the dairying areas female assistants play a dominant <Col N="1973" /> part in the contribution towards increased agricultural production.  I should like to see some incentives given and some additional recognition of the part that section of our community is playing in our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rate relief afforded, I am at one with those who have already spoken in welcoming the decision to relieve the burdensome situation in relation to the increase in rates upon the ratepayer in recent years.  We would have preferred if the Government had adopted the device of giving this relief by a transference of Health Act charges because that would mean the town dweller, who has considerable difficulties today, could be afforded some relief in rates.  But there is no provision in this Bill to assist him.</P>
    <P>In relation to the relief for farmers, as Deputy Murphy has said, that is a direct consequence of the vigorous protests made in recent months by those affected by the rising spiral of rates and the difficulties they were encountering at a time when the cost of living was increasing and they were getting no commensurate increase in their incomes. While the value of money had fallen many of them suffered a diminution in their incomes and they were, at the same time, faced with an ever-increasing burden of rates.  It is in response to vigorous protests that the Government decided to take action.</P>
    <P>This action is welcome in so far as it relieves the situation for some people.  No doubt it gives greater relief to some than it does to others.  That has been clearly indicated.  In so far as relief has been given to the larger farmer, the relief is a worthy relief in the circumstances in which that farmer works his land to the best of his ability. I am satisfied that such large farmers, who give good employment and who work hard and industriously, will plough back into their land by way of increased investment and greater fertilisation the amounts of which they will be relieved.</P>
    <P>We know, however, that there are people in our community who are not using their land to the best advantage from the point of view of the community as a whole.  We know there are people who let their land in conacre. <Col N="1974" /> It would be a good thing if it were indicated to these people that they will be expected to give some relief to the industrious farmers' sons, and others, who take this land in conacre since they are the people who are really making the contribution for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is not a fact that there will be any increase in income to anybody in consequence of this relief.  This is a measure which abates the impact of higher production costs and rates on those who operate our premier industry. It is for these reasons we approve of this measure but, as indicated by Deputy Sweetman, we would have preferred if the money it is proposed to invest in this particular way had been invested after a different fashion. This is the simplest administrative way of carrying out the operations the Government propose but it does not make any differentiation between the hardworking, industrious farmer and the individual who will gain considerably in many instances.  At the same time, there will be no incentive or response from them with regard to increased production or the giving of greater employment.  In relation to the smaller farmers the relief will be very minute indeed.  We welcome the measure in so far as it extends to the hardworking and the industrious who give good employment, but the Government have taken the easy way out.  No doubt it would have been possible for them to devise some other system making it clear that every £ in relief given would be reflected in better benefits to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by again emphasising that aspect of the employment allowance which I regard as very unjust.  I refer to the limitation of £5 poor law valuation restricting the opportunities for improved secure employment.  This operates to divert from agricultural employment many men with miserably small holdings.  It would at least be desirable to raise that ceiling to the £10 PLV level.</P>

Of course I am delighted they are accepting this, even though they tried to give matters a coat of paint of their own by stating that it was the marching farmers who forced the Government to do this.  They know as well as I know that is not the case.  Their memories should be as good as mine and they should remember seeing in the public Press even last year statements from Government quarters to the effect that this question of rates had become a big problem and that an attempt should be made to grapple with it.  It was in pursuance of that policy that provision was made in the Budget for bringing relief to the farming community. In order to gain certain Party points, the Opposition have resorted to an old device, to divide and conquer. They have tried to divide the farmers on this issue by saying that certain sections are not benefiting as much as they should benefit under this Bill. Whether a farmer has a big holding or a small one, he will benefit proportionately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of my county.  If the previous speaker who is from my constituency goes into the figures relating to payment of rates on <Col N="1976" /> agricultural land for the present year, he will find that although there was an increase of something like 3/- in the £ to carry out public services throughout the county, with the relief now being afforded, the farmers will have to pay a net sum of somewhere near 2s. 6d. in the £ less than they paid last year.  There is noise enough when the rates go up a few pence in the £ but when they come down 2s. or 2s. 6d., there is no credit for that.  Some people want to blow hot and cold.</P>

      <P>At times.  That is only human nature.  I agree with the appeal made by Deputy O'Sullivan that the standard of £5 for relief of rates for employment on agricultural land should be raised.  It is definitely militating against employment in several parts of my county.  While personally I always employ my staff for the full 12 months of the year, farmers in certain districts, through no fault of their own, cannot very well employ men for the full 12 months but may employ them for 10 or 11 months.  A <i>pro rata</i> rate of relief in respect of those employees should be given to the farmers concerned for anything over a nine months' period every year but certainly over a ten months' period.  In certain parts of the country, farm workers will take from one to two months' holidays every year.  They will not work on the land.  That is the system prevailing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>While we do not oppose this measure, my objection to it is that it follows the same pattern of assistance to the agricultural industry as the pattern we have had over the years.  That pattern means that <Col N="1977" /> the more you have, the more assistance you can get from the Government or from the Department of Agriculture and various other Departments.  It seems the greater the need, the less help farmers get.</P>
      <P>Deputy Meaney took some of us to task because we voted against the Budget proposals in this connection. We had no hesitation in doing so because the extra money raised was to be applied by a method with which we did not agree.  The Budget proposals gave something like £2,000,000 or more for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  That means some farmers will be saved some hundreds of pounds this year but that other farmers will be saved shillings per week.  If one wants to relate this proposal to the Budget, it also means that the old age pensioner gets his 2/6d. on 1st August next.  We in the Labour Party had no hesitation in voting against such proposals</P>
      <P>The criticism I would make of that, whilst not opposing the idea of giving the assistance to the agricultural industry, is that the odd £2,000,000, if it is to be relief for farmers, is distributed in the wrong way.  I know at least one farmer in my constituency who will benefit to the extent of £400.  He is not that badly off that the Government should assist him to the extent of £400.</P>

      <P>How do the rate collectors fare under this proposal?  My information is that rate collectors will suffer a decrease in the poundage payable to them this year.  Does this measure include any compensation for the rate collectors or is it the responsibility of the county council to make up to them for any loss in poundage they may suffer due to the fact that they will have fewer rates to collect?  The Minister should let us know something about that.  Whilst many farmers need the assistance given under this measure, I do not think it is right that in assisting one section of the community&mdash;admittedly, a very big section&mdash;another section, however small, should suffer any loss.</P>

If this relief will be some advantage to the farmers then, if the rate collectors have a small amount of money to <Col N="1979" /> collect, I suppose they will be paid the usual poundage, regardless of what it is.</P>
      <P>For over 20 years in this House I have made an appeal to successive Governments&mdash;a voice, I suppose, crying in the wilderness&mdash;in respect of rates on farmers up to £20 valuation who at the present time are unable to pay any rates.  The relief that is given may be very suitable to some people.  I know this was a rushed job. I know it was the marching farmers who were successful.  While I know it was a rushed job, the relief that was given is all wrong.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to give this matter very serious consideration when it comes up again next year or at some other period.  Does he not realise that the man who needs relief is the small farmer with a valuation up to £20? Does the Minister not realise that that is the man who is leaving this country? He should be completely derated. There should be a sliding scale.  For 20 years, I have been asking for this. While I am in this House&mdash;and I suppose that that will be for the rest of my life&mdash;I shall keep at it.</P>

This Government or some other Government may not do it but it is <Col N="1980" /> something which must be done or else this class of people cannot stay here.</P>

      <P>As one might expect, the opposition to this measure is very slight.  While there may not be full agreement with its terms, and various suggestions have been made, nobody has really followed up these suggestions to any great degree.  Just for the record, I shall comment on some of the statements which have been made, not all of which are borne out by the facts.</P>
      <P>The first thing to which I should like to refer is that a discrepancy or an apparent discrepancy was mentioned in the estimate as announced in the Budget Statement as against the amount mentioned by me to-day relative to the additional money required to put the new reliefs into operation as proposed in this Bill and which were mentioned in the Budget. A sum of £2¾ million more will be needed in the coming year than was needed last year.  Were there no such Bill as this and no additional reliefs, then the position, on the basis applying up to the moment, would be that, as a result of increased rates in the £, on average throughout the country, an additional £250,000 would be needed.  Therefore, that £250,000 had already been taken into account plus the £2½ million mentioned by the Minister for Finance making, in all, £2¾ million which is the figure I have mentioned in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On all known figures <Col N="1981" /> and facts, on estimates, we do not think there will be but, of course, we cannot be too sure of that because some of these figures are only estimates until payments have been made or claimed.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested here&mdash;a number of speakers followed the same line &mdash;that the more a farmer has, the more he can get.  It might also be suggested, although not always agreed, that the more a farmer has, the more he needs. That is the case that has been made very strenuously in the recent past by those representing the farmers.  Let us look at this suggestion that the small farmer is not getting anything and let us consider the suggestion made here to bring it down to shillings in the week, as was done by Deputy Murphy. I was waiting to hear the coins being clinked on the desk in front of him to demonstrate, lest we might not understand him otherwise, the amount of shillings and pence in the week being given in the form of rate relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The under £20 valuation farmers are almost 80 per cent. of the total number of farmers in the entire country.  So far as these 80 per cent. of our farmers are concerned the average net payment of rates is £3 17s. per annum.  Furthermore, there are other tables of interest which are well worth recording here in regard to these groups of valuation.  One such item of interest is that eight out of ten farmers, for instance, will pay not more than £13 in rates this year; six out of every ten will pay not more than £8 2s.; five out of every ten will pay not more than £5 5s.  When we come to talk about their reliefs, it comes out that this group of £20 valuation people pay on average £3 17s. in rates&mdash;now, on average&mdash;and I want that to be well noted.  An average £3 17s. is what is paid by the £20 and under valuations and those same people, if they have no other means of livelihood are, for instance, under their county councils, entitled to medical services.  The medical services for that group alone, under £20 valuation farmers, amount in all to over £4 million a year and, on average figures again, the cost per head is £3 17s.  So that the amount paid in rates, on average, by the under £20 valuation <Col N="1982" /> farmers does not equal the amount that is required for health services alone which these people are entitled to during any year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers under £20 valuation form one-fifth of the total number entitled to those free medical services and as one-fifth of that amount, the cost in their respect is not less than £4 million per year, and on average figures again, that works out at about £3 17s. per head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of what they get in free services regardless of whether it is lower income group service or middle income group service. The under £20 valuation group of farmers, in health services, get the equivalent of over £4 million paid on their behalf which, brought down to an average figure&mdash;which can be misleading but which, nevertheless, is an average figure&mdash;amounts to £3 17s. per head compared with their liability for all of their holdings under £20 valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy consider that this report and its implications have not been so long available and will the Deputy and other Deputies who talked about the application of rate relief as being an incentive to laziness on the part of the large farmers take it to heart that this is not the only help and the only assistance being given to the farmers; that there are, side by side with rate reliefs, the other incentives to production which have been introduced by this Party and this Government by way of artificial manures, subsidies on potash and superphosphates, and that, in fact, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, it was back in 1934 that Fianna Fáil first introduced reliefs of rates <Col N="1984" /> for the small farmers, at that time the under £10 valuation group?  There was nobody before that to do so, nor has there been anybody who has advanced it any degree since, other than Fianna Fáil, on behalf of the small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the result is that the small farmers are leaving the country today.  That is a result of that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The result is that there is a terrible lot of nonsense talked by people like the Deputy about what is being done on the land and what should be done on the land.  The question might be asked, just what do these people know as to what should or could be done on any of our land?  It is all very well to make a song and dance about what our small farmers do or do not do.  It is all very well to make the case here for further reliefs for these small farmers but when we consider the facts in regard to rate reliefs and realise that the small farmers, out of the total of £8.6 million, will this year get almost £6 million, surely the charge that we are doing nothing for the small farmers in this measure is completely unfounded?  Surely, it will be appreciated that £6 million of this £8.6 million is a fair slice going to the small farmers of the amount of relief and that by and large their rates are a fairly small proportion of their overheads and their outlay of today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputies who talked here today being mentioned as being in the forefront of some of the protest marches that were held down the country.  Those same people would now say that the larger farmers should not get any relief.  Is it not a fact that to a large degree it is the large farmers who have been seeking the relief; that it is the large farmers who have something to be relieved of; and that there is so little of our average rate left to be paid by the under £20 valuation group at the moment that the amount of relief that could be given, even if they were totally and completely derated, might not amount, bringing it down to a matter of so <Col N="1985" /> much per week, as Deputy Murphy did, to more than a matter of shillings per week per head?</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways.  You cannot argue that the relief given to the £5 valuation man amounts to only a shilling a week and at the same time suggest that we are giving too much to the larger farmers and then make the further argument that the total relief being given to all farmers is not enough.  The figures are there and the House should be pretty well satisfied that the amount of rate relief now being given is substantial and undoubtedly must be of very great importance to the agricultural industry as a whole. It must be of sizeable importance to their overall economy, their overheads and their costs.  Coming to the case quoted by Deputy Corish of £400 relief coming to a farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate on the corrected figure given by Deputy Corish, lest it might mislead and these isolated cases do, that would be approximately £200 for the year of an increased relief.  If we take that as probably applying to the new relief of 25 per cent. on the over £20 valuation, the probability is that the total gross demand would be somewhere in the region of £400 in respect of that particular farmer.  If we take the average rate as being something over £2 in the £, it would give a valuation of £200 to that farmer.  The number of such farmers in the country is very small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned while I like to see rate reliefs as much as anybody else and indeed, as Minister for Local Government, more so, I feel it is a grand thing to have land on which rates are leviable. That is my personal opinion.  That does not diminish as the amount of land decreases, in fact the less land one has the more one thinks of it.  The suggestion is that other ways and means could be found to spread over this relief and give greater relief where it is needed.  As I said supporting the rates protests were some members of this House and leading the parades were some of the large farmers.  The very same people would now say the large farmer is getting too much and the small farmer getting too little.  I do not see how we can have it both ways.  If we are to reduce the overheads, which is the primary purpose of this measure, reduce the costs of production, surely it follows that that assistance and aid should be given to all farmers and not just to any one particular section and that is what we are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are doing.  What we should remember is all rate demands on land the valuation of which is £20 or under is for 30 per cent. of the rates levied.  Instead of talking about an increase only of 10 per cent. in relief, we should take into account what they are being asked for is 30 per cent. of the rates normally falling to be paid.  If we look at it in that way, we surely will agree that a 70 per cent. relief against 30 per cent. payment is a very substantial <Col N="1987" /> part of this cost of paying rates on these lands of under £20.</P>
    </Speaker>

The fact is that a month is allowed, but again it is at the discretion of the local authority in question and it is allowed by quite a number of them.  There may be some who do not allow it.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can allow the two months because basically the idea is to try to close the gap in the slack period of the winter or spring.  It differs in different parts of the country, but if there is work for 10 or 11 months, there should be work provided for the 11 months and this employment incentive has been set.  If we widened the gap, we would discourage the continuous employment and therefore defeat the idea behind this relief.  The obvious thing to do then would be to wipe it out and have no relief, or possibly give it to Deputy Tully to distribute.  That is the position and there is not much we can do about it.</P>

      <P>Many of our rate collectors are no longer on the poundage payment system.  When the rates are abated and the total amount payable by the farmers goes down, that means that there is so much less work for the rate collectors and it is so much less difficult to get in the rates.  That is a considerable advantage to the rate collector. He is surely in a better position if he can get the money in more easily than if he has a large amount on his warrant and is not able to get it in.</P>

      <P>The number is considerable and is rising.  This is a rates relief measure on a somewhat similar pattern to that which we have come to accept for a number of years.  There may be faults or flaws in it.  I do not disagree with that, but I totally disagree with the statement that the present application of these grants is wrong.  I totally disagree with the assertion that the small farmer is getting nothing from this and that the large farmer does not need it.  This is a sum of £8.6 millions going to the farming community and the industry as a whole.  It will abate their costs of production to that extent and, far from its being the wrong thing to do with <Col N="1990" /> our possible advent to the Common Market, I think it is a step in the right direction that the costs of production of our agricultural industry should be reduced in every possible way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary aim of this Bill is to facilitate and encourage the extension of piped water and sewerage services by both local authorities and private persons and groups.  I do not need to remind the House of the extent, difficulty and indeed urgency of the job to be done in bringing our rural areas up to a satisfactory standard in matters of piped water and waste disposal.  To mention one point out of many: the rapid development of the bovine tuberculosis eradication campaign throws increasing emphasis on the need for abundant supplies of wholesome water for stock purposes.  In spite of an accelerating tempo of activity in recent years, in both the public and private sectors, almost a quarter of a million homes have yet to be serviced. In organising and implementing programmes to perform this task we rely on three separate but complementary types of effort&mdash;local authority <Col N="1991" /> schemes, private co-operative group schemes and individual installations. If the overall development is properly planned, there can be a fruitful integration of these efforts into a single front.  My principal concern since the inception of the rural water supplies programme in 1959 has been to foster co-operation between the various interests involved.  In particular, I have been at pains to see that local authorities will co-operate with private initiative towards the solution of their problems.  The Bill now before the House will help substantially to further that co-operation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 and 3 of the Bill are intended to replace earlier provisions in the Housing Acts dealing with grants for private water supplies and sewerage facilities.  The new sections are drawn in wide terms.  The details of the grants schemes will be worked out and embodied in regulations, which will be designed to frame a scheme of grants which will stimulate private enterprise, facilitate co-operative group development, and open the way for a much closer tie-up between local authority schemes and private initiative.</P>
    <P>The private grants schemes now being operated by my Department and the Department of Agriculture can be availed of in certain circumstances for taking connections from public schemes.  I have recommended to local authorities a development of this idea so as to secure that extensions to public schemes would be taken by the potential consumers on a group basis, with aid of State and local grants.</P>
    <P>An application of this concept on a large scale is now being worked out in the case of a scheme in preparation by Kerry County Council, and on a preliminary view it offers striking advantages, such as a substantial saving in capital outlay by the county council, and the maximum number of connections with the completed scheme. I would urge local authorities to bear in mind, in the later stages of their planning, the possible advantages to be derived from co-operation with private groups in the laying of the distribution system.  Such an approach <Col N="1992" /> offers a good prospect of combining the advantages of public and private undertakings for the common welfare.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are equipped for the development of large sources, the construction of reservoirs, and laying down trunk mains.  Private groups with the assistance of State and local grants and technical advice, can in many cases speedily and economically fill in the distribution network.  By this means, the benefits of private initiative may in such cases be brought to bear on the larger type of scheme, and the resources of enthusiasm, voluntary labour and leadership in local groups and rural organisations may be tapped to the best advantage.  The beneficial results of this kind of co-operation would more than justify sanitary authorities in adopting a positive approach to the group scheme movement by fostering the formation of groups in areas which are capable of being served by local authority schemes.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to two existing schemes of grants for private water supplies.  In fact, three Departments of State offer grants for the installation of piped water in dwelling-houses, and local authorities provide a fourth source of grants.  The scheme of grants operated by my Department and Roinn na Gaeltachta, and by county councils, include assistance for sewerage disposal facilities as well. The private water supplies scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture does not extend to sewerage facilities, but it provides in certain circumstances for grants towards the cost of piped water in farm out-buildings and fields.  It would make for economy if some degree of rationalisation were introduced into the administration of private water supply and sewerage grants, and Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill will provide the necessary machinery for such a step.</P>
    <P>I announced some time ago that the Government had decided that the private grants schemes operated by my Department and the Department of Agriculture should be unified under a single administration in so far as they relate to dwelling-houses.  Arrangements to that end will be made when <Col N="1993" /> this Bill becomes law.  The Bill provides, on lines similar to those of the Housing Acts, for a stay of seven years on any valuation increase attributable to the installation of water or sewerage with the aid of grants.  Not that it has ever been the practice of local authorities, so far as I am aware, to regard the installation of piped water or sewerage facilities as a reason for revising valuations, and the Bill is not intended to alter that position. Its intention is to encourage people to instal these services in their homes.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill will empower sanitary authorities to make or guarantee loans to persons installing piped water or sewerage in private dwellings.  In including these sections I have had in mind the need for credit facilities for co-operative groups and I am confident that these provisions will, in combination with the direct grants to be made available under the earlier sections of the Bill, act as a strong incentive to private persons and groups to engage in the installation of water and sewerage services.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will empower sanitary authorities to acquire water or sewerage undertakings by agreement, or, if necessary, by compulsory purchase procedure.  It will be readily apparent that cases will arise, frequently, perhaps, where the owners of a small group scheme may wish to dispose of their undertaking to the sanitary authority.  Such cases will present no problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the initiative to be taken by a majority or by all of the owners in requiring the sanitary authority to exercise their powers of acquisition.  Sanitary authorities will be expected to use these powers in the light of their general responsibilities for environmental sanitation and to take over, for integration into their own services, where they exist, such water supply and sewerage undertakings as may be offered to them.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if a private water supply or sewerage scheme serving a number of dwellings should deteriorate or become dangerous to health, acquisition by the sanitary <Col N="1994" /> authority might be the only effective remedy, and if the owners of the undertaking were unwilling to transfer it, it would be necessary for the sanitary authority in discharge of their responsibilities, to acquire the undertaking compulsorily.</P>
    <P>The procedure envisaged is that applicable to the acquisition of land for housing purposes, as embodied in the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960, but certain additional safeguards are proposed.  The Minister must be satisfied that acquisition is necessary for the purpose of safeguarding public health or for the improvement of water and sewerage services.  In the case of a water supply, provision is being made for the abatement of the normal water charges over a period up to twenty years, so as to take account of the owners' initiative in providing their own supply.</P>
    <P>Section 7 proposes to substitute a new type of water charge for the water rates and water rents which can now be levied on consumers under Section 66 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  The existing law on this subject is both difficult and obscure, and a number of recent Court decisions have underlined its inadequacies as a working basis for making and recovering charges for water.  The new procedure will be more straightforward and will have no connection, as had the old, with rating procedure.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 are intended to assist sanitary authorities in securing the maximum number of connections with water supply and sewerage schemes.  As I indicated earlier, grants are now available in certain circumstances to persons wishing to connect their premises with public services.  I hope to emphasise this aspect in the new scheme of grants to be made under Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill, so as to make it financially easier to take connections.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will authorise local authorities to make connections themselves if necessary, or to contribute towards the cost.  Between grants and local authority assistance, there should in future be no case of inability to take a connection on grounds of expense. <Col N="1995" /> There may, however, be cases where an owner refuses to make a connection for other reasons.  In such cases sanitary authorities will be empowered to serve a notice on the owner requiring him to lay a connection not exceeding 100 feet in length.</P>
    <P>Provision is included enabling the owner to appeal to the District Court against such a notice.  If his appeal is not upheld by the Court, the notice will become effective and he must, subject to penalties, carry out the work.  This is merely a continuance of the power to compel connections which has been exercisable by sanitary authorities since 1878.  What the Bill proposes is to substitute a new procedure for one introduced by the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, which proved cumbersome and slow in practice.</P>
    <P>The second main object of the Bill is the control of atmospheric pollution. There has in recent years been a growing awareness of the need for a clean air policy.  The existing law is inadequate and out of date and the time has arrived for more comprehensive and flexible provisions.  It is, therefore, proposed to take a power to make regulations controlling sources of air pollution such as smoke, dust, grit or gas; regulating the establishment and operation of trades, chemical and other works and processes which are potential sources of air pollution; and specifying maximum concentrations of specified pollutants in the atmosphere. Regulations may also be made to cover such matters as investigation and measurement of air pollution, and the licensing of persons and premises with a view to controlling the discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere from works or processes.</P>
    <P>In this country the air pollution conditions which these regulations are intended to control are at present very localised.  I have already initiated the measurement of air pollution in a number of centres.  The results indicate the existence of pollution in varying degrees.  Measurement will be continued until we obtain a reliable picture of the extent and nature of the <Col N="1996" /> problem.  While it may not prove to be serious at present we must take account of pending industrial development which may in future alter the position as we know it now.  A flexible procedure enabling controls to be instituted where and when required is, in these circumstances, the best approach and the Bill provides this by enabling regulations to be made to meet a wide variety of special air pollution problems according as they may arise.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a routine character.  The only point calling for comment is the proposed inclusion in the Schedule of the repeal of a small portion of the Open Spaces Act, 1906.  This is being done at the request of the Society of King's Inns and with the consent of the Commissioners of Public Works, in order to permit of a part of the Society's property at present used as a public park to be maintained by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The Bill as a whole is designed to bring those parts of sanitary services law which most urgently need modernisation into line with present-day conditions and needs.  Work on the consolidation of a far larger body of statute law dealing with the powers and duties of sanitary authorities is at present in progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could give us some indication as to when we may expect the more permanent amending and consolidating legislation to which he referred at the conclusion of his speech?  Anybody who has any knowledge of or contact with the law in relation to sanitary services will agree whole-heartedly with the Minister when he says it is a complicated field and one that very definitely requires modernisation and simplification.  The task of consolidating and amending the whole field of such legislation is not a simple one, but it is one very urgently necessary if it is to be possible for local authorities as well as private individuals to know exactly where they stand in this regard.  I hope the Minister will be able, when concluding, to assure the <Col N="1997" /> House that such a consolidation Bill will be introduced at an early date.</P>
      <P>While this Bill is in the circumstances a temporary Bill, an interim measure, it is at the same time a complex enough measure to have warranted the circulation of an explanatory memorandum.  The Minister must be criticised for failing to circulate with the Bill an explanatory White Paper that would enable the ordinary person, such as one Deputy I see over there taking thought unto himself, to understand the measure. Even for those of us who have some experience of reading legal documents, such as Deputy Seán Flanagan and myself, it is far from easy to construe and understand this Bill in its statutory form.  It would have very greatly facilitated the consideration of the Bill by the House had there been an explanatory memorandum circulated. It would have very greatly expedited the passage of the Bill on the Committee Stage if we had had such a memorandum.  As matters stand, it is inevitably going to mean that on the Committee Stage there will have to be some elucidation of certain points that do not appear clear beyond question.</P>
      <P>All of us on every side of the House will agree that it is highly desirable that development be carried out in rural areas, particularly in relation to the provision of water services.  We have got to face the situation that, if we do not make the ordinary amenities of life available in rural parts, people will not stay in rural Ireland. Unless we are prepared to ensure that the housewifes in rural Ireland have the ordinary facilities of water in their homes, they will not be content to stay there.  It was in the acceptance of that principle that Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, first introduced the scheme whereby for the first time grants were made available for the provision of a piped water supply to the farmer's kitchen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the Minister indicated in his speech that the scheme under the Department of Local Government and the scheme under the Department of Agriculture are to be amalgamated in <Col N="1998" /> the future.  I should like the Minister to give us some greater indication of the manner in which such an amalgamated scheme will be administered in the future.  Is is to be solely under the administration of Local Government or will there still be an element of agricultural development in it?  Apart from the scheme for the supply of piped water to the farmer's kitchen, there is also available the scheme under Agriculture for the provision of water to out-offices.  That, I presume, will remain with Agriculture?  Very often the supply to the out-offices comes from the same private water supply or pump as the piped connection to the kitchen.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister divided the provision of water supplies into three different sectors: local authority schemes; private co-operative group schemes and individual installations. As far as individual installations are concerned, we are all at one that it is desirable to facilitate and provide the incentive for those in so far as we possibly can.  In relation to the second class, the group schemes, many of us have seen cases where a group scheme has been provided which brought amenities into an area in a manner that had not been previously contemplated.</P>
    <P>When we come to the provision of schemes by local authorities, however, we are on a different class of ground. As regards the built-up areas, it is clear beyond doubt that a local authority scheme for the provision of water is the desideratum for that. Looking at the returns for taxation, one will find that, in relation to its size, Kildare has, with the exception of County Dublin, invested more money in that type of water scheme than any other county council.  While I accept without question that regional schemes of that sort are desirable for built-up areas, I do not accept at all the view indicated by the Minister some time ago, in respect of which he was rather silent when introducing this legislation, that regional schemes are the most economical way of providing water for rural Ireland.  I do not think they are.  There are many cases where it <Col N="1999" /> would be far more economical and far better to give wider grants to half a dozen individual people to provide water supplies of their own, rather than that we should have a very expensive local authority scheme running along an area where ample water can be obtained by sinking wells and where the population is not sufficiently dense to justify the cost of these regional piped lines.</P>
    <P>The development of electricity and the distribution of electricity throughout the country are now such that virtually in every area where there is an adequate water table, small pressure pumps can provide the water required at a very economic cost.  It would be more advantageous to the State as a whole that the grants for such installations should be increased rather than that we should have long miles of pipes laid by the local authorities where there will be few connections because of the small distribution of the population in the areas along which such supplies are delivered.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, certain areas in the country where it is virtually impossible by sinking a well to get a proper water supply, or a pure water supply.  Of course, in relation to such areas a different mode of approach must be adopted compared with the other areas where the supply is ample and only awaits tapping.  I think I sense in the Minister's speech more of an approach to the method of solving this problem which we advocated than the one he advocated some 12 months or so ago, and which shocked everyone by the staggering cost that would be involved.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when concluding, to give us some indication of the group schemes so far provided throughout the country.  Some have been provided here and there.  I am not quite clear under what statutory recognition they have been provided without the powers contained in this Bill, but, perhaps, it was in anticipation of legislative sanction that they were provided.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend that the <Col N="2000" /> powers given to a sanitary authority by Section 6 will apply to group schemes that at some future time may be taken over by a sanitary authority, or to a scheme which may be built now under a co-operative process and then later taken over by a sanitary authority, or does he intend that section in relation to sewerage undertakings and waterworks to apply to existing schemes?  If he does, perhaps, he would give the House some indication as to whether they are private waterworks bodies, or private waterworks schemes operated by companies or friendly societies in the same way as county councils and other local authorities operate as a sanitary authority?  I am not aware of any such.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear&mdash;and I would be grateful to the Minister if he would also indicate when replying&mdash;what is intended by the difference between Section 2 and Section 3 of the Bill. I appreciate that Section 2 is the section which enables the Minister to pay grants while, on the other hand, Section 3 enables the sanitary authority to pay grants.  Is it intended that the existence of these two separate sections will provide a means by which the sanitary authority can pay a supplementary grant in addition to the Minister's grant, or is it intended in certain cases that grants paid by the sanitary authority should be in substitution for Departmental grants?  That, for example, is one of the queries that probably would not have arisen if an explanatory memorandum had been furnished with the Bill.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why there are the two sections, when one takes into account that under subsection (3) of Section 3 the Minister apparently will repay to the sanitary authority the grant which the sanitary authority has paid.  If the Minister will repay that grant by a free grant to the sanitary authority, surely it would have been better that the total grant should have been paid in the first instance by one or the other body and that there should not be duplication?</P>
    <P>I had at first believed that Section 3 was to cover the provision of loans by the Minister to the sanitary authority <Col N="2001" /> to enable the sanitary authority to make grants charging the repayment of the loans to its ordinary funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I believed that the purpose of Section 3 was to enable the Minister to provide the funds to the sanitary authority out of which supplemental free grants could be paid, and that the sanitary authority would repay the amount so provided by the Minister by means of charging it on its ordinary revenue.  In other words, I believed that Section 3 was the authorising section but it would appear, having regard to the provisions of Section 4, that that understanding of mine was mistaken.</P>
      <P>Section 4 also enables the sanitary authority to make advances to persons who are providing the necessary supplies or facilities.  I should like to know whether it is clear beyond question that the powers of the sanitary authority in Section 4 include the making of advances to a person owning a vested cottage.  The reason I mention that is that when we come to the wording of a similar section in the Housing Bill it will be found that the provision in that Bill is such as to specifically mention a vested cottage which is not specifically mentioned in this Bill.  I cannot at the moment put my finger on the section where I noticed it, but there is in one section a phrase &ldquo;including a vested cottage&rdquo; and I notice that phrase is not included in Section 4 of this Bill.  I should like the Minister, therefore, to give a specific assurance that the powers contained in Section 4 do enable the sanitary authority to make these advances to the owner of a vested cottage who is installing water and sewerage.</P>

      <P>The Minister is, no doubt, aware of the exact section to which I am referring and there will be ample opportunity between now and the Committee Stage to verify the reference.  The same argument also applies to the guarantees provided by Section 5, particularly in the case of the small works required to be done by a vested tenant.  In Kildare, there will be a number of cases where the farmers for whom such vested tenants work will be only too glad to assist their employees by advancing moneys to enable houses to be made more comfortable by the provision of a proper water and sewerage system, provided the local authority is empowered to guarantee the payments in such cases.  That would be an inexpensive way of doing things because, in 99 cases out of 100, no question of interest would arise at all. It seems to me also that the provisions of Section 5 rather follow the provisions of the 1956 Housing Act, provisions which were often derided by the present Government.  I am glad to see that by the provisions of Section 5 they have now, by implication at any rate, agreed that the principle of guarantees is a wise one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Power is being taken in Section 7 of this Bill to provide for disconnection of the water supply where accounts have not been discharged.  We can understand, of course, the necessity for that power, but it is a power that will have to be used with the greatest care. If we are not careful, we shall find exactly the same problem arising as arises in relation to the disconnection of electricity.  We have had on many occasions protests in this House, and difficulties arising elsewhere, because of the manner in which the E.S.B. were accustomed to disconnect electricity without an adequate warning system.  That provided unnecessary expense on occasions on the consumer. It also gave rise to considerable inconvenience and some hardship.  But, in <Col N="2003" /> relation to the disconnection of water supplies, the position would be far more serious.  It could very easily give rise to the danger of an outbreak of disease or epidemic if there were no water for the flushing of the water closet.  For that reason the very greatest care must be taken to ensure that every possible step will be taken before the water supply is cut off.</P>
    <P>There should be in Section 7, and particularly in subsection (9), clear-cut provisions outlining the steps the sanitary authority must take before disconnecting the water supply to ensure that there will be no disconnection where payment is humanly possible and, secondly, the steps that must be taken after disconnection to safeguard against disease or epidemic. Such an outbreak might affect not merely the premises disconnected but nearby premises as well.  People going on holiday might overlook the first demand.  The second demand might arrive while they were on holiday and might not be forwarded to them.  They might find themselves, on their return, without having time to discharge their liability, suddenly disconnected.  Such disconnection would be attended by all the inconvenience normally experienced by people who are accustomed to running water and a proper sewerage system, particularly where there are no alternative facilities of a temporary nature.  We must be very certain, therefore, in enacting this legislation that the powers laid down in subsection (9) of Section 7 are hedged with adequate restrictions on the sanitary authority to guard against any possibility of the outbreak of disease or epidemic following disconnection of supply.</P>
    <P>I think people will be rather shocked to learn that under subsection (11) of Section 7 it will in future be illegal for them to water their gardens with the local authority water supply.  It will also be illegal for them to wash motor cars.  While it is undesirable that local authority water supplies should be used for industrial purposes, nevertheless, that surely does not extend to the ordinary amenities of domestic life?  Everybody is anxious that the <Col N="2004" /> amenities in housing schemes should be preserved.  An important amenity is the addition of a garden.  Facilities to water a small garden, such as that normally attached to local authority housing, should not, I suggest, unduly tax the capacity of the local authority water supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The first reaction to this Bill may be that there is a certain contradiction between its terms and the present day trends towards liberalisation of trade but the Government consider that there is an urgent necessity for us to equip ourselves to deal with Iron Curtain countries.  In these countries, trade is conducted by State agencies whereas in Ireland private traders in general are free to import at will from any source.  In this respect, our country is practically alone among western countries and our non-discriminatory trade regime means that we have no special import concessions to offer State trading countries and there is, therefore, no inducement for them to purchase goods from us.  The import policy of these State agencies is dictated by the need to secure corresponding facilities for exports.  It is clear from our external trade statistics that there is an increasing imbalance in favour of the Iron Curtain countries. The Government feel, therefore, that it is desirable for them to have power to restrict imports from State trading countries in order to bring pressure to bear on their buying agencies.  The purpose of the Restriction of Imports Bill, 1962 is to give the Government this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, existing legislation which affords some control over imports.  I have in mind the Control of Imports Acts 1934-1937 and the legislation relating to imports of agricultural products.  The Government consider, however, that the procedure which these Acts require is not sufficiently flexible for the present <Col N="2005" /> purpose.  It is important to have as much flexibility as possible in dealing with any situation which may arise in our international trade.  The Bill is, therefore, drafted so as to give the Government power in general terms to restrict imports.  The Government would make orders restricting imports from specified countries only where trade relations justify such action and it is not the intention to take any discriminatory action, under the Bill, against imports from countries with which our trade is regulated by trade agreements or international arrangements. The Government recognise that there would be disadvantages in the use of these powers and they would use them only where other methods fail.</P>
    <P>It might be felt that any measures to improve our balance of trade will result in an undesirable increase in contacts, at commercial level, between this country and Communist countries. I think Deputies will agree, however, that this course would be preferable to the present situation in which they are allowed to benefit from our liberal trade policies without any compensating benefit to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary because of the heavy imbalance between the imports from Iron Curtain countries and our exports to these countries.  As the Minister remarked, there does appear to be a contradiction at present between the terms of this measure and the general tendency towards freer trade.  Although I know it is not the intention to use this Bill or the powers under it to restrict imports from countries other than what are known as Iron Curtain countries, nevertheless, it does seem that the terms of the Bill would conflict with the terms of the Rome Treaty in so far as if this country became a member of the E.E.C. any action taken against imports from any Member country other than that which was laid down under the general agreement would conflict with the terms of the Treaty. However, that difficulty is unlikely to arise because the purpose of this Bill is to correct the present heavy adverse balance between this country and the Iron Curtain countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> I would be interested to know from the Minister whether it is proposed to make orders under the Bill when enacted and if it is proposed to restrict imports from these countries.  As the Bill is drafted the Minister, when an order is made, lays it before each House of the Oireachtas and, in the absence of a motion annulling it within the usual period after the House sits, it becomes law.  In a case of this sort where there is no great urgency, the alternative procedure might be adopted under which positive affirmation by the House would be necessary before the order takes effect.  It is hardly likely that there will be any urgency in making orders because the circumstances in which goods are imported are generally known in advance either to the Minister's Department or to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter.  As far as I can see there is no penalty provision except that contained in Section 3.  I take it that the contravention of any other provisions of the Bill are covered by the ordinary customs and excise laws and that, consequently, it is not necessary to have a special provision in the Bill to cover any case where a person or a company does something which amounts to a breach of the terms of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Thise whole question of the extent of the adverse trade balance between this country and other European countries is one which has been referred to on many occasions.  I know from the Minister's speech that it is not proposed to interfere with imports from any countries whose trading relations are governed by trade agreements or other international obligations. While that is probably reasonable enough, there is a very good case for reviewing these trade agreements. Many of them have now been in operation for a great number of years. Most of them were negotiated shortly after the war and while, in general, they are renewed either annually or at other periods, in the main, the trend of trade between this country and other European countries is very much more in favour of those countries than of this country.</P>
    <P>It does seem to me that we should <Col N="2007" /> endeavour to correct that by whatever means are available to us in the negotiation of new agreements in the future and by ensuring that no discriminatory administrative action is taken in other countries to prevent exports from this country.  In the past, we have had experience where, under the terms of a trade agreement, certain facilities and opportunities were provided for exports from this country which, in practice, were, if not nullified, certainly rendered extremely difficult by administrative action on the part of certain countries and in specific cases.</P>
    <P>So far as trade with the Iron Curtain countries is concerned, there is very little justification for this country trading with these countries at all.  The balance is very heavily adverse.  Although the amount of trade between this country and Iron Curtain countries is, compared with our trade in general, not considerable, nevertheless one wonders why it is necessary for importers in certain cases to seek goods and commodities in these countries rather than elsewhere. I hope the Minister, in so far as it is open to him, will discourage imports from these countries in the future.</P>
    <P>Generally, the proposals in the Bill will be welcomed.  I believe they will provide some means whereby a check can be kept on imports in the future and afford an opportunity for effective action wherever it is considered necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>While completely agreeing with the Minister in what he said&mdash;and it is quite unnecessary to go over what he said&mdash;I should like to look at the terms of the Bill as a Bill that may conceivably in the future be invoked for purposes perhaps other than have been mentioned.  I am thinking specifically of the possibility in cases of near-economic emergency which can arise unforeseen from time to time.  Such a Bill, being on the stocks, can be invoked for purposes that could not possibly be envisaged at this stage.  The way it could be invoked could be for some reason or other to prohibit importations from a specified country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2008" /> I do not think anybody will question that if for any reason a Bill of this nature were invoked for such a purpose there would be a very good and sound reason for it.  There might, for instance, be something in the nature of a near-emergency. But there is always a danger of a Bill of this nature being called into play to control adverse trends, say, in regard to the balance of payments.  I am thinking, for instance, of the possibility of the use of a Bill like this in a situation such as existed in 1956.  I am reassured, however, on that particular point, by the fact that the general trend, from the passing of the Rome Treaty onwards, is in another direction.  I think we can therefore rest easy that the Bill is not likely to be used in this way.  Nevertheless, it is likely to be used and if it is used, there is one specific point I would ask the Minister to consider, that is, the effects that sometimes arise when a section such as Section 2 (a) is put into force.</P>
    <P>The simple thing to do, especially if there is a matter of urgency, would be to prohibit all imports under paragraph (a) of Section 2 from a specified country and that could be desirable and necessary.  But if that is done, for instance, there may be in some unforeseen place some industry dependent on imports that are not directly the target of the Order made.  Although the provisions of Section 3 provide for licences, there may be a time-lag in the procuring of the necessary licence which might have a very disrupting effect.  I make that remark, therefore, merely to bring it to the Minister's attention and to point to the necessity for a machinery, if Section 2 is invoked, particularly Section 2 (a), for issuing, one might say, instantaneously, licences where licences are necessary.  That is the first point.</P>
    <P>The second point that arises is what is the position under existing contracts, if such exist.  I do not think, for the immediate purpose of the Bill, that the Minister will have any difficulty there.  However, if, for some reason, Orders are made under Section 2 prohibiting the importation of goods from a particular country&mdash;any goods manufactured or produced in or consigned from a specified country; for <Col N="2009" /> the moment, supposing we say that that is interpreted as all goods&mdash;if some urgency makes it necessary for the Minister, whoever he may be, to do the omnibus thing, then, if there are existing contracts, what is the position in regard to payment?  It can happen and there was a period after the War when it almost invariably happened&mdash;in certain categories, anyway&mdash;where there were irrevocable letters of credit that were documents to be cashed on the consignment of the goods.  If the goods are consigned from the country of origin but have not reached here and an Order is made prohibiting the import&mdash;this Bill is ample to cover that contingency&mdash; and the importation of the goods is refused on the quay, what is the position of the importer or the contractor, because in that case he is in the position of having paid for the goods?</P>
    <P>These are just, if you like, administrative points that can arise on the face of a Bill just like this.  I am reassured by the fact that I suppose problems of that nature can arise under many Bills or regulations and that the Department of Industry and Commerce is alive to the commercial necessities of the case.  I do not think I am wrong when I interpret Section 2 (a) as possibly involving a simple blanket importation prohibition on all goods from a specified country.  If that is so and if there is any danger of that contingency, particularly having regard to the fact that this Bill might at a future date be invoked for purposes and in circumstances quite other than those that we are considering at the present moment, it is merely a point which I should like to raise.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister two things. One is to consider his exceptions, from the point of view of speed in issuing the licences, that there may be serious dislocation for somebody somewhere. The other is&mdash;perhaps I am stretching my imagination rather far when I make the point&mdash;that there is also the possibility of loss.  I would recommend that both of these should be considered at this stage.  I do not know what can be done to amend the Bill in order to do it but the matter could be considered at this stage, so that if a question <Col N="2010" /> arose in the future it could be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I welcome this Bill.  The Minister mentioned that on the face of it it seems contrary to the general trend of tariff policy at present obtaining in the European scene and so it would appear to be, but it appears to be aimed entirely at one or two countries. That is a desirable thing because we have an imbalance of trade with some of these countries.  Last year, with Russia, we had imports of over £1,000,000 and our exports were only £100 or £200.  From Poland, we had imports of over a couple of million pounds and our exports there were, likewise, extremely small.  These are not the only countries where that is happening, of course.  It is desirable if we are to do trade that we should try as long as we can to do it on a £ for £ basis.</P>
      <P>The regrettable feature of our trade with Russia is that the imports we got from Russia were largely pollard, barley and such products and it transpired that from some of our ports, we were exporting what was called unmillable wheat, while at the same time, on the same day, we were importing red Russian pollard.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill particularly as I hope by its implementation the Minister for Industry and Commerce will correct that aspect of things in the interest of the Irish farmers and, in a measure, not alone control imports but also control his more wayward colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to remember&mdash;and I do not think anybody challenged it &mdash; that we have a very liberal import regime, in fact, one of the most liberal in the world, and in taking this step we are not stepping out of line with the import-export activities of other what I may call like-minded countries.  This liberal regime that we have enjoyed has been to our advantage in many cases because it gave our importers, whether they be importers of raw materials, of semi-manufactured goods or of consumer goods, the opportunity of getting their requirements in any part of the world <Col N="2011" /> at the cheapest possible prices.  That was important and it still is important from the point of view of manufacturers or producers generally who import raw materials or semi-manufactured goods because it makes them in turn more competitive when they can get their raw materials or other materials of industry at a favourable rate.</P>
      <P>However, as has been observed, we have been importing a great imbalance of goods as far as our trading arrangements are concerned from Iron Curtain countries and I want to assure the House that the purpose of this Bill is limited absolutely to Iron Curtain countries.  It would, perhaps, have been possible to set out in a schedule the countries which we intend to have covered by the Bill but I wanted, first of all, to have the greatest possible degree of flexibility and, secondly, I do not think it is necessary for us at this stage to take on ourselves to designate who or what are the Iron Curtain countries.  We do not know if the Iron Curtain will recede or if it will expand. We hope it will not expand but we do not know.  It is not for us to say and especially not on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there will be no question whatever of employing the provisions of this Bill against what we call like-minded countries and, particularly, as I said, countries with whom we have trade agreements or other international trading arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said just now that we had one of the most liberal regimes in the world and in introducing this measure we were not doing anything other countries had not done.  I may say in particular that Great Britain has machinery which is more effective, if you like, than what we propose to do here to restrict imports.  So have the other countries with whom we normally trade.  I think I can assure Deputy Cosgrave that in introducing this measure we are doing nothing that will in any way prejudice our application for entry to the Common Market, or, being in the Common Market, that will embarrass us in any way.  In fact, it is quite possible that legislation such as this might be necessary for us if we do become members of the Common <Col N="2012" /> Market in order to achieve the same effect as far as the Common Market countries as a whole are concerned as we want to achieve now in respect of ourselves.</P>
    <P>With regard to the trade agreements with other countries to which Deputy Cosgrave referred, these agreements are reviewed periodically.  The two major agreements we have are with France and with West Germany, and these agreements are reviewed at two-yearly or three-yearly periods&mdash;I forget exactly which.  However, the whole ambit of the agreements may be reviewed at any one of these two-yearly or three-yearly periods.</P>
    <P>As far as our trading agreements with smaller countries are concerned, there is no set period in which these agreements are renewed or reviewed. Therefore, they can be reviewed at any time at short notice.  As Deputy Cosgrave perhaps knows as well as I do, the driving of bargains with some of these countries has not been an easy exercise for our representatives.  It has been their practice to drive as hard a bargain as possible in all these cases. However, that is beside the point in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I now come to another question raised by Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;his suggestion that the type of activity we sought to control was not of such great urgency as would require measures of this type to be taken but rather that some <i>post factum</i> remedy might be applied.  It is possible&mdash;in fact it is more than likely, I think, in many cases&mdash;that quick action should be available to us if we knew of a trader who was buying bulk quantities from one of these Iron Curtain countries and if we had goods that one of these Iron Curtain countries might well take from us&mdash;from a private exporter, of course.  We should have a power to act quickly to ensure that our currency would not be used to buy vast quantities of particular goods, while another trader in this country would have big quantities of goods he could not dispose of in any country and which could easily be disposed of in the Iron Curtain country which is selling us these goods.  As well as that, the type of goods we normally get from these <Col N="2013" /> countries are goods that can be imported in fairly large bulk.  I need only refer to some of the commodities over the past few years&mdash; oil seedcake and meal, corn offals, unrefined sugar, steam coal and timber.  These are goods that can be exported readily in very large bulk consignments and one consignment might easily create a very wide imbalance in our trade with these countries.  Therefore, we should have the power to ensure that transactions we know might be contemplated can be stopped at the source, unless there is some corresponding advantage for exporters in this country.  I suggest there is a good reason for this normal procedure whereby we act and let the action be justified in the House afterwards, if necessary, or nullified, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The only penalty provided for in the Bill is in relation to the non-disclosure or giving of false information in the case of applications for licences but the ordinary customs and excise penalties would apply in the event of evasion of the provisions of any order made under the Bill.  I can assure Deputy Cosgrave that is very well covered already.  Deputy de Valera raised the question of existing contracts, and what would happen in the event of goods being consigned under contract and being landed at a point of entry in this country.  I can assure Deputy de Valera that my Department have very long experience of these activities.  They are used to examining the <i>bona fides</i> of these contracts and, by and large, <i>bona fide</i> transactions that have taken place before a particular tariff or other import restriction is imposed will not suffer.  If these transactions are <i>bona fide</i>, they will be honoured by my Department as a general rule.  Again, as far as the issuing of licences is concerned, it is an exercise which is very common in my Department and I do not think there need be any fears that there will be delays in issuing licences in proper cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Hogan referred to the figures from Russia and Poland within <Col N="2014" /> the past year or so.  He is quite correct &mdash;there was over £1,000,000 worth of goods imported from Russia as against £154 worth of exports to Russia, and there was something short of £2,000,000 from Poland as against a very small export value of goods to Poland.  Therefore, it is clear that the necessity for this Bill is there and I am glad the House has received it in the manner it has been received.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>During the adjournment, I had the opportunity of verifying the section I was trying earlier to trace.  Under this Bill, power is given in Section 4 to a sanitary authority to make advances to a person who provides a private water supply and private sewerage facilities.  There is no provision in that section stating that the sanitary authority can make such an advance to the owner of a vested cottage, a cottage which has been bought under the Labourers Act.  I ask the Minister for an assurance that notwithstanding the omission of such reference, the owner of a vested cottage can obtain such an advance.</P>
      <P>My anxiety in that respect was emphasised by the provisions of Section 10, subsection (2), clause (b) of the Housing (Loans and Grants) Bill which we are to discuss shortly. The clause in that Bill states:</P>
      <P>Repayment of a loan under this section in respect of a cottage that has been purchased under the Labourers Acts may be secured at any time in the manner specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection.</P>
      <P>But, as I say, in this Bill there is no such saving provision and in the circumstances, it would appear that there is at least the possibility that the overriding provisions of the Labourers Act, 1936, that a tenant purchaser of a vested cottage cannot charge his holding while the annuity remains, would prevent such a person obtaining an advance under Section 4 of this Bill.  Unless there is something in some other part of the Bill which I am unable to trace at the moment, it would appear that there is this omission, an omission which I suggest very strongly should be rectified on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> In addition to that, at the time of the adjournment of the debate, I was mentioning the fact, as it is a fact, that subsection (11) of Section 7 appears to go too far.  Under it, it is an offence, as I understand it, for a person to water his garden with an ordinary hose pipe as is done in every city and town in the country.  To water the roses, or the lawn in front of a terrace of houses in any part of Dublin or elsewhere will, as I read subsection (11), be prohibited in future.  That, surely, is taking things far too far.</P>
    <P>The offending clause is clause (c). A motor car cannot be washed by means of connecting an ordinary piece of plastic hose pipe to a tap.  You have to get a bucket, fill it in the house, take the bucket of water out and throw it over the car.  As often as you walk back and forth to the house for the bucket of water, you are in order, but as long as you use a bit of plastic hose, you will be acting contrary to the regulations and in breach of the provisions of this Bill. If that is what the Bill means, it appears to me to be bureaucracy gone mad.  It appears to me to be ludicrous that the ordinary amenities which have been available to any person owning a small town or city garden or owning a motor car should no longer be available under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I said in the beginning that in relation to the whole of this Bill, I am speaking entirely subject to correction because the Minister has neglected to furnish an explanatory memorandum. It is a technical Bill and even for those of us who are accustomed to reading Bills, it is one that requires considerable study before one can understand all its implications.  We have not had an opportunity really to study the Bill because it was not furnished to Deputies as early as it should have been.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be nonsense to provide that a person living in Dublin who has a small, trifling garden, whether it is the garden in front of one of the houses in Crumlin through which I drive up and down each day, or a garden in Ballsbridge, should not be able to deal with the matter in a common sense way and that it should <Col N="2017" /> be necessary for him to cart buckets of water to and from the kitchen in the manner suggested.  Obviously, that is a section that will have to be considered carefully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill purports to deal with the problem which admittedly causes great anxiety and difficulty to local authorities.  I know of cases in my own area of Kildare where the county council has, at considerable expense, put in a water and sewerage scheme for a village and where the people in that area have refused to connect.  I can understand, therefore, the Minister feeling it necessary to bring in compulsory powers to enforce connection such as are provided in Section 8.  But, at the same time, while such compulsory powers are necessary, I think the other side of the picture must also be considered.</P>
    <P>A person who has a small house in a village such as Leixlip, Celbridge or Maynooth may not have the money to enable him to instal a water and sewerage scheme and to connect to the local authority supply.  On that aspect of the question, am I correct in thinking that the old distinction between an area where a public supply is likely to be provided and where there is not such a likelihood is now being abandoned, or is it still continued?  Is there still the consideration that there used to be in the regulation that 30 feet, as I think it was, is the requisite distance?  There is, under existing regulations, a distinction that if the individual has to pipe his water more than that distance, he qualifies as a person who is entitled to get the grant.  I am not sure whether that distance is 30 feet and I should like some clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>Though it is desirable and, perhaps, essential, not merely in the interests of the individual himself but in the interest of public health in a village or town, that he must take adequate advantage of the facilities provided, the fact does unfortunately remain that owners of some property may not have the money to carry out the work involved.  There should, therefore, be attached to Section 8 a provision whereby, on consideration of the appeal to the district court, to which reference is made in subsection (4) of <Col N="2018" /> the section, the court would have authority to say to the sanitary authority: &ldquo;We will give you the authority to enforce this connection but we will only give it to you conditionally upon the sanitary authority making available by way of grants the amount necessary to carry out the work.&rdquo;  If a person on such an appeal can satisfy the district court that he has not the money to do the work, the district court can give the order but it must be accompanied by an advance or loan to the person concerned of the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>Without that provision, Section 8 will create hardship in certain cases, particularly having regard to the limitations of the Rent Restrictions Act.  There are many landlords of premises which are controlled by the Rent Restrictions Act who are in far worse circumstances financially than the tenants for whose protection the Act was introduced. I can visualise owners of such property not having the money to carry out what is required under Section 8 and therefore it should be provided that where there is the necessity for such financing, the financing must be done by the local authority as the continuation of the local authority's power to force connection.</P>
    <P>I will admit frankly that though I have read Section 9 many times, I have failed to understand what it means.  I cannot appreciate what the pipes are required for, for instance.  It is a section which in its wording is clear enough but in its purpose is obscure to a very great degree.  Again, I suggest that is another instance in which the shortcomings of the Minister in neglecting to provide a White Paper are so clearly shown up.</P>
    <P>Most of us will agree it is desirable, stating it as a general principle, to do something to prevent undue pollution of the atmosphere.  All of us have had experience of it in one way or another &mdash;sometimes driving behind a very dirty lorry when one's view is so obstructed by smoke and fumes that one cannot see clearly.  On warm days when we have to keep our car windows down, we become almost choked by the fumes coming through the windows from such vehicles.  How <Col N="2019" /> much worse then must it be for those who have to live in areas which are polluted in that way?</P>
    <P>At the same time, while accepting the principle that pollution must be avoided as far as it possibly can, we must realise that the powers being taken by the Minister in Section 10 of this Bill are very wide and sweeping. I might say they are perhaps something of an experiment because as far as I know, this has never been tried before.  These sweeping powers the Minister is taking to himself in Section 10 may very well close a factory, render it quite impossible for people to carry on their ordinary industrial work and certainly, in the beginning of this experimental field, the Minister should reverse the procedure he has suggested in this section and provide that the regulations to be introduced shall be brought to this House for positive approval rather than that there should be the mere negative power of annulment provided in the following section.</P>
    <P>I can visualise the importance of the dissemination of public knowledge through a discussion in this House of an individual regulation.  That publicity would probably do more than anything else to assist in the prevention of pollution; it would do a lot more than the bringing out of the big stick, in which case any discussion in the House would be only of an <i>ex post facto</i> nature as far as the effects of a regulation already made would be felt by an individual factory.  The effects of these regulations could well mean that a particular industry would have to cease, that the employment it had been giving would be subject to interruption, that the industry might have to move to another area, and where the powers are as sweeping and as wide, it is surely desirable there should be something more than a mere administrative Order, subject to annulment. I suggest we should first have the positive approval of the House.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, all of us agree with the desirability of improving conditions of living in rural Ireland by the provision of proper water and sanitary arrangements.  All <Col N="2020" /> of us agree it is desirable to avoid unnecessary pollution of the atmosphere. This Bill is, however, a somewhat complex way in certain respects of dealing with these problems.  As far as the Bill itself is concerned, I think many people will be disappointed there does not appear to be in it any indication, as there is not in the following Housing Bill, of increased grants to meet the increased costs which it will involve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Bill offers people in rural Ireland certain benefits, we in the Labour Party naturally welcome it.  It is true to say, as Deputy Sweetman said, that the lack of an explanatory memorandum makes the Bill somewhat difficult to understand.  What I have to say on it will be far removed from destructive criticism.  Many of the sections are not as clear as I would wish them to be.  For instance, I have read Section 9 without being able to understand it, so I will therefore be unable to discuss it now.  I hope accordingly that the Minister will clarify this section when he is replying to this debate.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of Section 9 says that a sanitary authority may, if they think proper, provide or contribute to the cost of providing, certain things.  That is all right, but it pinpoints certain difficulties which are facing us in Cork at this very moment.  I should like to say here that the Minister went out of his way to help us as much as possible in this problem.  A very large sewerage scheme was provided for the western suburbs of the city.  When the scheme was prepared, the late consultant engineer provided for all the necessary connections.  However, when it was presented to the local authority, the then county engineer thought it necessary to reduce or save on an £80,000 scheme to the extent of a mere £400 by not providing what we term wide junctions and saddle junctions on the main sewer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a case in which the local authority were taking advantage of the power &ldquo;may or may not&rdquo;.  Were it not for the co-operation of the Minister, the cost of providing subsequent connections <Col N="2021" /> to that main would have been prohibitive on the individuals concerned. The public main is at a depth of 18 feet and it would mean that people taking individual connections from it would be put to the cost of employing labour, getting permission to open the public roadway, opening it, lighting the excavation at night, taking the risk of breaking the main.  In areas where houses are already erected and the local authority have provided a public main, it should be the duty of the local authority to provide a connection at the source of the main itself.  That may sound like asking for too much, but I do not think so.  The cost of the scheme I mentioned in Cork would have amounted to £400 but now, unfortunately, it would cost the local authority and the Government, by way of grant, a lot more.  It is essential in all such cases, even where the local authority is prepared to co-operate, that their duty should be to provide for the connection to the public main itself.  I should like the Minister, therefore, to eludicate subsection (2) of Section 9 for us.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 8, I appreciate the remarks of Deputy Sweetman, who says he is afraid the powers being provided in the Bill may put local authorities in the position of abusing their rights in regard to making people connect to public sewers.  I do not think that will happen.  I speak as a member of a local authority.  In all cases where the members or officials of a local authority are satisfied that the owners or occupants of small houses in towns or villages where public sewers are provided are not able financially to provide for making the connection, I do not believe they would use the big stick and compel them to do so.  It is well therefore to consider the possibility of the local authority coming to the aid of people unable to do the job, perhaps an old man and woman, doing the job for them and making some charge by way of annuity. I do not know if that is possible, but it may be a way out.</P>
    <P>Nobody can suggest, however, that local authorities should close their eyes in cases where property owners who can very well afford to do so have for years failed to connect their <Col N="2022" /> property to the public sewer.  Such sewers have been provided for the benefit of the community as a whole. In many areas in County Cork, a lot of money has been spent on providing public sewers; yet many houses have not been connected to them.  Grants are being made available, and it is essential that we see to it that such connections be made.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to another point in regard to Section 8, subsection (7).  I may be wrong in this and I should like to have it clarified.  The subsection states that no appeal shall lie from a decision of the district court on an appeal under this section.  If a person appeals to the district court and wins the case but if the officials and members of the local authority believe in all fairness that the decision was unjust, does it mean that the matter must stop there?  If they believe the decision was unfair, not to themselves but to other people, for health reasons and so on, can they not appeal?  I shall not say that all decisions by Ministers have been satisfactory but, strange to say, in this case I would prefer if the appeal were to the Minister rather than to the district court.  Public representatives will be conversant with local circumstances and could put the case to the Minister as they saw it.  Perhaps they might be helping an appellant or else doing the reverse and helping a local authority against an appellant. In any event, they would be doing what they believed was just and honourable. That may be a wrong approach, but I would like the Minister to give us his views as to whether it may not be better than the proposal before us.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to subsection (11) of Section 7 and mention again the case of a man washing a car or a bicycle.  It is all very well to say we believe such cases will not arise again. We may be placing a lot of responsibility on local officials if we pass legislation here which we believe cannot ultimately work in practice in our towns and villages.  Deputy Sweetman drew attention to the effect of this on people living in the suburbs of Dublin and in Kildare.  I can visualise the same thing happening in the small towns and villages where there is a water supply.  It is rather ridiculous to <Col N="2023" /> suggest that if I or any other Deputy return home after a long journey and think it no harm to wash the car, I can draw bucket after bucket of water but, according to this subsection, under no circumstances can I attach a hose to a tap in the house or, worse still, in the yard and spray the car. Yet I might use much more water with a bucket than with a hose.  It reminds me of that popular song &ldquo;Dear Liza&rdquo;: there may be a hole in the bucket and there may be no water in it by the time it gets out to the car.  I do not wish to belittle the measure in any way, but these are a few points on which I should like to have clarification.  No Bill is so good that it cannot be made better by a little constructive criticism.</P>
    <P>The one other point on which I should like information is the question of the vested cottage.  I am not going to tie this up with the Bill that may be before us later this evening.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that the Minister should clarify the position as to whether or not it is the tenant of the vested cottage who will gain the advantages under this Bill and, if so, when will he be able to avail of them? Is it during the period in which he is paying for the vesting of the cottage or will it be when vesting is complete and the last penny has been paid?  If we have that information clearly between now and the Committee Stage, it may perhaps avoid a good deal of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share the views of Deputy Sweetman in his criticism of the section dealing with the problem of air pollution.  It may seem somewhat elaborate but it is, I think, about time we did something in relation to this problem.  As Deputy Sweetman said, we all know the appalling experience of travelling behind some of these huge lorries with smoke pouring from the exhaust.  What the pollution must be like in heavily populated areas is just something one cannot really imagine.  The people living in these <Col N="2024" /> areas are in danger from the point of view of health.  Unlike the people to whom Deputy Sweetman referred in relation to the disconnection of water supplies, many of these people never have a holiday.  Credit is due to the Minister if, by the inclusion of this particular section dealing with air pollution, we can in some measure improve conditions for these people.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment believe the section might have the dire effect of closing factories.  Public health is of such importance that we must be prepared not alone to debate it but to do our utmost to ensure that every endeavour available to us is used to improve conditions.  I sincerely hope that the insertion of such a section in this Bill will at least mark a start in the improvement of conditions which badly need remedying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Sweetman, I regret that the Minister did not furnish an explanatory memorandum. Such a memorandum would have made it easier for Deputies to understand exactly what the intention is.  Even in his opening speech, the Minister did not succeed in clearing up certain matters fully.  Under subsection (11) of Section 7, water cannot be used for certain purposes.  I am interested only in clause (a) which prohibits the use of water for agriculture or horticulture.</P>
      <P>The Minister has asked local authorities to embark on fantastic schemes of regional water supplies&mdash; fantastic as to cost.  Where a local authority agrees to provide a regional water supply, under this Bill, none of that water can be used for agriculture or horticulture.  In his opening statement, the Minister referred to the importance of water for stock purposes and its benefit in the rapid eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Perhaps the Minister has a perfectly sound explanation, but, in his opening statement he tells us water is most desirable for stock purposes, and then, under a section of this Bill, he prohibits the use of water.  That is just one of the vaguenesses in the Bill and in the Minister's speech that I cannot quite reconcile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> With regard to the amalgamation of schemes under one Department, that is a step in the right direction.  It is much better that these schemes should be administered by one Minister and one local authority.  The regional water supply scheme mentioned some time ago here by the Minister is an excellent scheme but quite unattainable because of the cost.  In County Mayo, a survey was carried out of a particular area, roughly elliptical in shape with the town of Castlebar at one end of the ellipse and the town of Westport at the other.  That covered only a seventh, an eighth, or a ninth of the whole County Mayo.  The cost of the scheme was £1,200,000, not to mention subsequent maintenance.  That immediately ruled the scheme out.  We would all like to see regional water supply schemes but the cost just prohibits such schemes.</P>
    <P>A scheme that has never been properly availed of is the group scheme.  There are two reasons for that.  First, the grant is not sufficiently attractive to induce people to avail of it; secondly, there is need for technical advice, either free or at a reasonable charge.  Such group schemes would not be a recurring cost on rates because those concerned would have to maintain them or do without them.  I appeal to the Minister to push the group scheme because I fear regional water supply schemes will not be adopted except in very few areas.  The cost is prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I know areas in Mayo which are very prone to flooding and where the land is waterlogged.  There are other areas where water is very scarce. Because of the dry spring and summer, people in these areas have had to bring water for stock two and three miles. Yet there are lakes in the areas which could supply water, but the people do not know about the group scheme or, if they do know, the grant is not sufficient and they have not the capital to undertake a scheme for themselves.</P>
    <P>I know one area where there are 50 or 60 houses and where there is a short distance from them a spring that would be ample to supply a small town.  There is another area with 22 houses.  Not one of them has water.  A <Col N="2026" /> further area with five houses quite near myself, an area roughly two miles long and about a mile and a half wide has not a single drop of water whereas a few small lakes near at hand could supply them.  I know there are group schemes but these people are afraid of the cost and there is no one to advise them.  I hope the Minister will do something for such people.</P>
    <P>There is one point I want to clear up.  We shall have a Housing Bill perhaps this evening or at least before the Dáil rises for the summer recess.  The scheme of grants is the same as usual, and the same conditions attach.  For a five-roomed house not more than 1,400 square fleet floor area and where a sewerage and piped water supply are provided in an area where a pipe supply is not available, the grant is the same at £300.  Does the Minister or the local authority pay a grant to a person building a new house over and above the grant in the Housing Bill? I have tried to find out exactly what the position is and have not succeeded. Would the Minister clear up the point as to what grants are available or does the Bill before the House propose to pay grants only to those who are installing water and sanitation in their houses?</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make on this Bill is this: It seems daft to me that in the case where water supplies are brought along the main roads into a town, houses along that road cannot be supplied with water and have to get a supply from two, three, or ten miles away.  I have asked on several occasions that these people should get a supply from the main but the only answer I got is that it will not be done. Perhaps there is some technical difficulty of which I am not aware but it should not be beyond the power of the engineers to overcome that.  I cannot help asking myself what these people must think of the proposed regional scheme when a proposal to give them a supply from along the road cannot be entertained.</P>
    <P>Taking the Bill in general, I am very glad the movement is towards bringing ordinary civilised amenities into rural homes.  For too long the badge of slavery of drawing water has been <Col N="2027" /> attached to rural homes.  If we are to induce people to stay in rural areas, we must give them the amenities their sisters and brothers have in the cities and towns.  In taking any step in that direction, the Minister certainly has my support and my commendation.  I hope the Minister will clear up these points I have mentioned when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> In general, the intentions behind this Bill must commend themselves to everybody in the House.  I would take issue with the Minister on one small point, that is, if I have interpreted him correctly.  In the first page of his statement, he says:</P>
      <P>My principal concern since the inception of the rural water supplies programme in 1959 has been to foster co-operation between the various interests involved.</P>
      <P>I do not know exactly what he means by &ldquo;the inception of the rural water supplies programme&rdquo; because the attempt to introduce rural water supplies and to propagate the idea is not of recent vintage.  In fact, the late William O'Donnell, a former member of this House from South Tipperary, 20 years ago was speaking extensively in favour of establishing the principle of rural water supplies up and down the country.  A good number of years ago, I was the county councillor at the time who proposed the establishment of one of our area regional schemes, namely, the Galtee regional water scheme in South Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Sweetman remarked, a measure of this kind presented to us in the technical jargon of the Parliamentary draftsman is sometimes confusing to a layman like myself.  It is a pity that an explanatory memorandum was not issued with this Bill. Furthermore the Minister could have left out the section in relation to pollution of the atmosphere to be dealt with as a separate measure.  This is largely a service problem, a public health measure.  As such, it is a restrictive measure and it would have been <Col N="2028" /> simpler if he had left air pollution out of it, to be dealt with at some later stage in a smaller and single measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the Minister received a resolution from the county council proposed by a member of his own Party and passed unanimously that the deputation was left under the impression by the Minister that the financial arrangements would be the same for the Lung and Feorish rivers as for the Crannagh Cross River?  In view of the fact that the resolution sent forward by the county council was worded in such a diplomatic manner for the purpose of providing further information to the Minister, will he now give the necessary financial requirements?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware that, when I received the deputation, I promised them that I would do my best about these rivers.  He will know also that special facilities were given for the drainage of one of these rivers and he will know, too, that those special facilities could not be provided in the case of the others.  The Deputy will also be aware that when the deputation was received by me the proposals for expenditure were reckoned in the region of £15,000.  He will know, too, that the total amount will be in excess of £95,000.  From that it will be easily deduced that the works proposed for the remaining rivers in Roscommon are not in the nature of minor works and that, at the instance of the county council itself, they have been passed from my Department to the Board of Works.  It has been put to me by the county council that the works were of such a magnitude that the technical and engineering staff of the county council would not be able to carry them out.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> As regards the question of regional or group schemes, in my constituency, there has been an element of agitation and often difference of opinion on this matter.  We have been pursuing the policy of regional schemes but strong representation has been made to us that we and the Department have not given sufficient consideration to the question of group schemes.  Indeed, we had deputations before our county council to that effect.  The regional schemes suit certain areas.  They seem to suit South Tipperary by virtue of the terrain. Group schemes seem to suit other areas.  I believe they have been particularly successful in Wicklow, where you have mountain ranges and valleys to give a group scheme of the gravitational type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2056" /> Without in any way disparaging our local engineering services, or indeed the engineering services of any local authority, I feel we have pursued this matter of regional water supply schemes rather incautiously.  I tabled a question here to the Minister asking him to set up a small survey team, consisting of a water engineer, an economist, a geologist&mdash;something on those lines&mdash;to act as a survey and advisory group for local bodies.  I felt we did not have locally the type of personnel that would be able to investigate this vexed question of regional <i>versus</i> group schemes.  The Minister replied that he felt the advice he had available to him in his Department was adequate to deal with the situation and they were there to help the local authority.  I know as regards my own constituency that only one scheme as far as I remember, was actually tabled before the county council and passed as such.  After that the manager was given a kind of broad permission to go forward and develop further schemes on a similar basis.  At the moment we have ten or 12 regional schemes in the process of being put into operation.</P>
    <P>I would again put to the Minister, before this rural water supply scheme is carried further on a national front and in view of the large amount of money involved, that it might be prudent for him to reconsider my suggestion to set up some kind of specialist survey group to advise local authorities, particularly those in the initial stages of development of rural water systems, as regards regional and group schemes.  Probably the answer is that both systems could be put into operation in varying degrees in different counties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's provision for some simplification as regards grants.  He mentioned four authorities at present dealing with grants for water supply and sewerage.  I knew only about three, but these three caused me sufficient confusion.  I would welcome any clarification or any kind of order the Minister can introduce in that respect so that, when public representatives are approached by Mr. So-and-So, we will be able to pin-point more <Col N="2057" /> exactly what grants and services are available to him.</P>
    <P>I gather from the Bill the Minister proposes to make some regulations as regards water charges.  That is a vexed question with us.  It is a question of expenses, particularly as it affects the rates.  It is in that regard most of the agitation has arisen.  Years ago, we were in the same position as every other county in that only a small part of the rural area, mostly the non-urban parts, the small villages, had any kind of piped water supply.  That was a county-at-large charge and supplied only about 10 or 15 per cent.  The figure varied from county to county. There was no agitation at that stage because the cost of supply had been got over a long number of years and it supplied only a small number of people.  But when we embarked on more extensive rural water supply schemes, naturally the cost on the rates mounted immediately and precipitately and the agitation started.</P>
    <P>It is probable that with the schemes we have in operation at present, there will be eventually an 80 per cent. or 85 per cent, coverage.  At present, we are in a transitional phase.  That is the most difficult period to be in.  As every day passes, the costs are becoming larger and a decreasing number of people are expected to continue paying for a county-at-large charge and get nothing.  There are certain sections of the population who appear to have a genuine grievance on this question of the county-at-large charge.  They feel they should be personally exempted in whole or in part.  First, there are those who in the past, with or without grant, installed their own water supply. Whether it is a small gravitational system or a pump, they are satisfied with it.  They feel now it is unfair to ask them to contribute to a county-at-large charge for water which they personally do not need and which they may not elect to take.</P>
    <P>These people present yet another difficulty.  If they happen to have a pump which will last for another 15 years, they may decide, at the end of the 15 years, to take the gravitational county scheme.  If they are exempted <Col N="2058" /> now and come in under the scheme at the end of 15 years, when it is half paid for, they may secure a certain benefit.  That could possibly be got over by making them pay some subvention for the number of years during which they refused to avail of the local authority scheme.</P>
    <P>Another large section who must be considered are those who will eventually be supplied, but not for, perhaps, 10 or 15 years.  They argue: &ldquo;We hope eventually to get a regional scheme in this area but, in the meantime, why should we, over the next ten years, be asked to pay for a scheme that is daily becoming more expensive on the rates?&rdquo; The third section are those who are so geographically placed that they will never get a water supply scheme.  They may be living on the side of a mountain. They may get a pump or a well.  They will certainly have a genuine grievance, and quite correctly so, because their geographical position makes it impossible for them ever to have a water supply.  These three sections have a legitimate grievance with regard to payment for a system which will fall eventually on the rates on a par with health from the point of view of expense.</P>
    <P>At the moment our charges for water in South Tipperary are extremely low.  The revenue we get in would just about barely cover maintenance. In fact, that policy has been pursued because it is regarded more or less as a social service.  I am not quite sure what the Minister means when he mentions charges.  If we charge on a commercial basis no one will take the water.  In fact, even though the charges are so ridiculously low, we have been disappointed at the poor response in some areas.  The position is improving a little but I thought originally, judging by the demand from certain areas, that there would be a tremendous appreciation of the service.  The demand has been disappointing. In some areas people, whom one would expect to know better, just did not bother their heads to avail of an excellent gravitational scheme giving excellent water in 24 hours out of the 24.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> The difficulty is that if one increases the charges to anything approaching a commercial figure one runs the risk of people refusing temporarily or permanently, to take water passing by their own doors.  That would be very undesirable.  I think everybody is anxious from the point of view of the general public, from the point of view of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, from the point of view of agricultural production, and public health generally, that everyone should avail of what is a wonderful service, a service of which this country can be very proud.  I doubt if even the United States of America could compare favourably with the effort we are making to give a water supply to our people in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Much of the difficulty that arises as between regional and group schemes is due to the figures which have been produced by private and semi-private bodies which have initiated group schemes, particularly group schemes on a gravitational basis.  I might also point out that the E.S.B. see a great future in this.  They, too, are producing figures which compare to our disadvantage.  Their figures are based upon sinking pumps and supplying water through electrical power.  When we started our regional schemes there was, of course, no such thing as rural electrification and we did not have to contend with this competition.  Their figures really make it a little embarrassing for us with our regional schemes.  The Department lays down a figure of £300 or £350 per installation as the limit they will sanction.  In one of our regional schemes in Dundrum the cost per installation worked out at something like £500.  That was sanctioned by the Department.  Perhaps, that £500 represents an exaggerated picture because that scheme will have to be filled in later on.  That figure represents only the initial skeleton outline.  When the various subsidiaries are taken over the overall charge will be lower than £500, substantially lower I hope, and, perhaps, down to the £350 mark.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he has <Col N="2060" /> given the matter of charging consideration. Does he mean to fix some figure between what one might describe as the social service charge to cover maintenance and the purely commercial charge, which would be prohibitive and would prevent anyone taking the water?  Has he worked out any system of charging intermediate between the two figures, a system which would give some kind of relief to the three sections I have already mentioned?  I want a figure that will be fair to them and, at the same time, not so prohibitive as to discourage those who can avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to air pollution, the section in the Bill is altogether too sweeping and too generalised.  It could be dangerous.  It is almost as nebulous as the subject with which it deals.  It is a pity the Minister did not see fit to deal with air pollution in a separate measure.  Many aspects are involved. Industry and public health generally enter into the picture.  Such things as diesel fumes, waste from ships, radioactive fall out, the industrial risks of asbestosis, pneumonconiosis, silicosis, and all these, enter into the picture. What the Minister is asking for here is a kind of blank cheque under which regulations can be made.  The regulations could be very sweeping, so sweeping that one feels it would be better if the Minister framed the provisions in more specific and less general terms in order to give the House an opportunity of discussing the matter item by item so that we may know exactly how far he is going and that he does not perchance again ask for a blank cheque and then proceed to draft regulations thereunder which may be unduly restrictive and may not be in general what the House desires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is calculated to carry us a substantial step forward in the provision of essential internal water supplies for the rural areas and, indeed, for many small towns and villages which today are not as well supplied as they ought to be in the year 1962.  I hope this Bill and the facilities which it provides will enable local authorities and individual <Col N="2061" /> citizens to take advantage of its provisions and thereby provide themselves with the amenities of the second half of the 20th Century.</P>
      <P>My references are more of an interrogatory nature and I hope the Minister will be able to clear up these points when replying.  As I understand the Bill, Section 2 provides for grants by the Minister for Local Government. Section 3 provides for similar grants by the local authorities.  These grants are not indicated in the Bill but will be announced by means of regulations at a later stage, and local authorities, on the one hand, and the Department, on the other hand, will say: &ldquo;These are the facilities available.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister whether it is intended that both grants, that is, the grant from the local authority and the grant from the Department, will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of making a connection from a pipe which passes a dwelling house or whether it is intended that the tenant of the house, or the owner of the house, as the case may be, will be required to pay a contribution himself towards the provision of the water supply.  In other words, will there be a minimum requirement from the tenant or the owner of the house that he must pay a certain sum of money in order to ensure that the connection will be provided.</P>
      <P>I wish to know also what is intended by Section 4.  Sections 2 and 3 provide for grants by the Minister, on the one hand, and the local authorities, on the other hand.  Section 4 provides for the advances by the sanitary authority to persons providing and installing in dwelling-houses private water supplies or private sewerage facilities.  In what way does the advance come into the provision of a water supply in a private dwelling house if the State has made a grant and the local authority has made a grant?  Would the Minister be good enough to indicate in what circumstances it is thought the advance will be necessary in such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could we also have from the Minister an indication as to the kind of advance he has in mind?  Will this also be prescribed by regulation and <Col N="2062" /> over what period will the advance be payable?  I want to take for the purpose of clarification the case of two types of rural dweller.  First I want to take the case of the tenant of the non-vested cottage.  I take it that under this Bill when it becomes an Act it will be possible for the tenant in such circumstances to avail of a grant from the Minister and a grant from the local authority and with both grants to get a connection from a main which will be provided by the local authority as part of its general scheme of providing water supplies.  Could the Minister tell us, after his Department's examination of the problem, how much more it will be necessary for the non-vested tenant to put to the grants he will get from the local authority and the State in order that he can provide himself with an internal water supply? Could the Minister give that type of tenant, even at this stage, some indication as to what it will cost him, on the assumption that there is a main running near his dwelling house, to provide himself with an internal water supply?</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain as well whether, if there is any supplement to be paid by the tenant, it is possible for the local authority to install a water supply for the tenant and to deduct the cost to the tenant of doing so from the rent, that is, that the tenant will get the benefit of the State grant and the local authority grant and that if these are not sufficient the local authority can make the connection for him, the tenant to repay by an addition to his rent over a period of time in the case of non-vested tenants?</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the case of the vested tenant.  I understand that at present the difficulty of the local authority is that it is not possible to undertake water and sewerage connections if doing so is related to the tenant's liability to repay the local authority.  I think that is due to the belief that it is not possible for the tenant of a vested cottage to alienate the property for repayment of a loan for another purpose.  Do I understand from the Bill and the way it is constructed that in the case of the vested tenant, he will get the State grant and the local authority grant and that he <Col N="2063" /> will pay the rest himself, or that he may get an advance to supply the third segment, as it were, of the cost, if there be a third segment of the cost, from the local authority which he can repay to the local authority as a separate transaction?</P>
    <P>With over 60,000 labourers' cottages throughout the country occupied by persons who are keenly interested in the provision of internal water supplies, the Minister could render a useful service if he could give some indication as to the manner in which he thinks this scheme will operate in respect of tenants of labourers' cottages throughout the country, whether they be vested or non-vested tenants.</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether any consideration has been given by the Department to the question of the disposal of sewage.  At present the effluent finds its way in many cases into rivers.  It is quite clear from this Bill and from the general improvements in the standard of living that more and more houses, more and more factories, will be provided with sanitation facilities, a very large number of which will depend on the rivers as a means of taking the effluent.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in this respect rivers will be asked to take burdens which will be much heavier than in the past and it may very well be necessary, if we are not to destroy the fish content of the rivers and the amenities the rivers provide for swimming and boating, that some attention should be given to the provision of efficient sewage disposal arrangements.  In our desire to provide sanitation services&mdash;and it is an extremely laudable desire in which I heartily concur&mdash;we could very easily develop a blind spot so far as the disposal of sewage effluent is concerned.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is essential that the Department and the local authorities generally should keep their eye on the necessity for ensuring that with wide extension of sanitary arrangements, the pollution of rivers will be avoided in face of the possibility and almost the certainty that in future they will <Col N="2064" /> have to take a very much larger quantity of effluent than they have been required to take with our present inadequately developed sanitation services throughout rural areas.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered also that a great many rivers in rural areas which are used to take effluent are not fast-flowing rivers and that they travel a good distance before they can get rid of the effluent.  I hope that aspect of the matter will be watched very carefully so as to ensure that the value of our rivers, particularly slow-flowing inland rivers, will not be seriously impaired by being required to take effluents to which they are not capable of taking, unless very substantial changes are made in the method of curbing possible harmful effects of such effluents.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, there is provision for dealing with pollution of the air.  The phrase is used here &ldquo;pollution of the atmosphere&rdquo;.  The enemy in this section appears to be the pollutants and it is necessary to measure the emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere and to take every necessary step to control pollutants.  I should like to know from the Minister what is covered by &ldquo;pollutant&rdquo;.  Is this something that clearly, bacteriologically, destroys or harms the atmosphere, or does it cover also offensive smells which would probably not harm the atmosphere but could certainly make living in that atmosphere very uncomfortable.  Cases have come to my notice where persons living in certain districts found that certain types of factories became neighbours of theirs and in due course the factory processed commodities which gave off a most offensive odour.  The factory is doing a very good job, a very worth while job, and should be encouraged in every possible way, but that is looking at the matter from a national point of view.  On the other hand, if your house happens to be situated next door to the factory, it is a bit tough that you should have to bear all the inconvenience of a regular and sickening odour, merely for the national advantage which is shared by everybody, of having a factory to process goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2065" /> I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether this section gives power to deal with offensive odours emanating from factories which may not in themselves be harmful to the atmosphere but which may certainly be very inconvenient and very objectionable from the point of view of local residents who have to live in that atmosphere for 24 hours a day. If not, I hope the Minister will take power to deal with such a situation. I do not know whether the phrase used in the section is sufficiently wide to catch the case of an offensive odour which may not in itself have the effect that could be described as pollution of the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>These are the few observations I desire to make on the Bill.  As I said at the outset, I welcome the Bill and any steps which will be taken under it to provide water and sanitation services for our people, especially in the rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill also.  I am very delighted by the enlightened view the Minister has taken of the urgent necessity for sanitation generally but especially in rural Ireland where there are groups of houses. I hope our people will avail of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am very happy also that the Minister has specifically provided in this Bill for grants for people who avail of a group scheme.  The groups scheme is the only way in which a number of areas in rural Ireland can ever get modern sanitary services brought into their homes.</P>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity of appealing to our people to avail of such schemes, where possible.  If people wait for the central authority or the local authority to do all this work, I am afraid it will be a long time before water and sanitation are brought to the homes of our people as it is desired they should be by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to grants to sanitary authorities, I hope the Minister will let us know the amount of grants he will give under Section 3.  The advances from the Central Fund will contribute <Col N="2066" /> a great deal to the extension of water and sewerage to the homes of our people in areas where the people cannot otherwise avail of these services.</P>
    <P>There are certain guarantees to the local authority also.  That is a very good thing.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on that matter when replying.  I just intervened in this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in another class of dweller, the temporary dweller.  Some years ago, the 1952 Act was passed that gave power to local authorities to refuse a licence to persons who let sites to temporary dwellers.  The Acts specified that there must be proper sanitation on the site.  That was understandable.  However, in most cases, owners of sites were poor people and could not afford to provide sanitation on the sites.  The old practice was to dig a hole, as is still being done in a great many parts of Ireland.  Thousands of poor people who possessed temporary dwellings in the seaside resorts around the city, in Portmarnock and such places, were compelled to take down their bungalows, <Col N="2067" /> to break them up.  They were valuable summer resorts and represented heaven to these people and their children for the summer months. They had to leave them there and in many cases break them down with hatchets because they could not take them down otherwise.</P>
      <P>In thousands of cases, little homes, heaven to the people who owned them, were broken down because the owner of the site could not afford the cost of sanitation.  But the local authorities did not object to caravans in spite of the fact that there was no sanitation for them.  There are thousands of sites where caravans are parked and where there is no sanitation but the caravan people are people with a little money behind them.  It takes £200 or £300 to buy a caravan and then you must have a motor car to pull it.  They were allowed to camp for the summer without sanitation while the other people had to remove their bungalows and huts.</P>
      <P>What I am getting at is that we should encourage not only the caravan people to avail of the fresh air but also encourage the younger people to camp out.  A number of bungalows were not touched in the wreckage of 10 years ago because the sites were privately owned.  It was only where the owners of the sites could not afford the sanitation that they had to order the owners of the hut to break them up.  There are thousands of cases where the bit of ground where the hut stands is owned by the temporary tenants and they have not the money to provide the sanitation.  I ask the Minister to make the grants available to these people who have temporary dwellings.  In the interests of health these people should get those grants and it should be remembered that while they may only occupy these temporary dwellings for a few months of the year they have to pay rates for the whole year as if they were permanent residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to provide the grants for these people who own their own camping sites and who own bungalows and have not the money <Col N="2068" /> to put in the sanitation.  Whether we like it or not, there are thousands of them and the Minister should consider applying the grants to these temporary dwellings.  I am speaking on behalf of those people because I was chairman of the Temporary Dwellers' Association at the time.  I fought their case in court and lost it and it cost me £40.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Burke may have been the only Deputy to congratulate the Minister on the Bill, I think it has received the support it deserves.  All the Deputies who have spoken have shown a desire to bring about an improvement in the amenities in rural Ireland.  The Minister has given the figure of a quarter of a million homes without water or sewerage. That gives us an idea of the task that confronts the Minister and the local authorities if they are to expedite the provision of water supplies for the people of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>In 1959, the Minister made a great effort to help on this project when he announced the scheme whereby water and sewerage facilities would be made more readily available.  The circular that came to my county council, and I am sure it went to all the other county councils, informed us that we could now plan to provide water for the people in the rural areas either by way of a county council or regional scheme, by group schemes or by individuals themselves.  As a further incentive he was increasing the subsidy paid before that and he was also extending the repayment period from 35 to 50 years.  That was a great incentive and I think every local authority in the country accepted his statement and set out to try and fulfil his wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They proceeded to carry out surveys in each local authority area.  I know that survey is now complete in many areas and I know that as far as County Wicklow is concerned, when the survey was completed, we were informed that it would cost from £800,000 to £1,000,000 if the local authority was to provide water for every house.  I must say that there was no great objection from any side of the council chamber when that announcement was made. <Col N="2069" /> It is going to take a great number of years to achieve the objective and what we decided to do was to improve our present town and village schemes and extend them as far as they would go.</P>
    <P>I think that is a good line to take. We are going to improve the existing supplies and extend the pipe lines as far as they will go.  There is no question of spending £800,000 or £1,000,000 in the space of three or four years. This is a long-term scheme.  The Minister hopes to have it completed in ten years.  It is unlikely that he will achieve his target in that time but a job will be done and I have no doubt that the ratepaying community will be able to stand up to the demands on them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the agricultural grant and the Local Government grant will now be administered as one by the same Department.  That is desirable because people were held up under the old system where the two grants were administered by separate Departments.  There may still be difficulty in administering the Local Government grant and I should be obliged if the Minister would devise some scheme to simplify the system of approving applications for this grant. At the moment an applicant has to send his application form to the county council for a certificate, then to the Department who eventually send down an inspector to examine the scheme.  That should be short-circuited in some way so that the county councils would themselves take up the schemes with the Department.</P>
    <P>My county was one of the first to organise group water schemes.  They were begun in the north-west of the county by a very energetic Catholic curate, the Reverend Father Collins. He was with us for three or four years and due to his enthusiasm and to his promotion of co-operation among the people, he was responsible in no small way for having water supplied to 200 or 300 houses in that locality.  He even went to other areas and advised the people on ways and means of getting these schemes going.  He gave a great lead in Wicklow and many other curates have now taken up the task so <Col N="2070" /> that quite a number of group schemes are being provided.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that there is no liaison between the Department and the group scheme committees.  In my experience, everybody has been leaning over backwards to help one another get on with the job.  If we are to achieve anything in this group scheme effort, we must have that type of co-operation.  I have done my best to encourage people to participate in them and I do not think they will regret doing so.  When one considers that the average cost to each applicant is in the region of only £17 or £18 per house, including the cost of putting in sinks and taps, one realises the advantage of participationin these group schemes.  The Minister and his officials would do well to push ahead with them.  There are, of course, still areas that can be better served by regional schemes but I think the members of local authorities are the best judges in that matter; they are quite capable of dealing with the problem of whether an area would best be served by a regional scheme or a series of group schemes.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer at this point to public sewerage schemes.  Deputy Desmond made the point that there should be some provision in public sewerage schemes whereby people could be connected in a more simple manner.  I suggest that branch lines from the main sewer should be taken to each individual's entrance gate and that a junction should be placed there so that the person who wants to connect will only have to come through his yard.  That would obviate the necessity to tear up perhaps the public roadway and the pavement as well. The cost of providing these branch lines could be paid for by a county at large charge.</P>
    <P>Commenting on the Bill on the whole, I think the Minister deserves the congratulations of not only the House but of the people outside as well.  It was he who initiated the present drive to bring piped water supplies to the people of rural Ireland. I have no doubt he will achieve his object and that he will have the co-operation <Col N="2071" /> of local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Every member of a local authority will, of course, welcome any Bill which helps to provide water for people in need of it.  Looking at the Minister's speech, I find he suggests that the inception of rural water supply scheme dates from 1959.  In Kilkenny we did not wait until 1959 to start regional water schemes.  They had been there for many years before that.  One of the first things the Minister should have done in a Bill of this sort was to increase the grants for regional schemes and group schemes.  The Bill as it is is but a tightening up of the system, and an amalgamation of the grant schemes.  I should have thought the Minister would be concerned to provide some tangible benefits&mdash;that he would do something to encourage people in the matter of water supplies.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government must realise by now that the impact of rates on householders throughout the country is almost intolerable.  It follows therefore that the Minister should not do anything to increase that burden. But that is what the Bill will do.  The Government got so frightened of the consequences of high rates that they had to bring in a Bill to relieve rates. They did so because they felt the weight of protests from all over the country.  Although I agree that every rural dweller should have a piped water supply, they do not want such amenities at the cost of even higher rates.  Therefore, it would have seemed important in this Bill to have increased grants towards water supply schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might also have told us how we could shorten the delay between the initiation and completion of regional water schemes.  I have in mind the Mooncoin regional water scheme.  It was initiated many years ago but it has been subjected to insufferable delays because of the gauging work which had to be carried out to determine the best source of supply &mdash;because of the inspections to find suitable sites for a reservoir.  It has taken years and years.  That was quite all right many years ago but nowadays people can provide their private supplies <Col N="2072" /> through the installation of electric pumps so that in schemes where initially there would be between 400 and 500 applicants for water supplies, by the time the schemes are completed, many of those applicants will have got their own private supplies.  I would ask the Minister to look into that.</P>
    <P>We have a consultant on that scheme in Kilkenny and he is now regarded as practically an official of the county council.  I would ask the Minister, first, to increase the grants so that the impact will not fall so heavily on the rates.  Every member of a council is anxious that every person will get facilities.  Secondly, the Minister should see to it that there are not the delays we have had in the past.</P>

      <P>I am very glad indeed that the House has generally welcomed this measure.  While there have been criticisms, I feel that generally they have been well intentioned, though possibly not very well put in all cases. Deputy Sweetman suggested that Deputies were at a distinct disadvantage in dealing with the Bill because an explanatory memorandum had not been circulated.  Not disagreeing with that view, and since it has come from a member of the legal profession, we will have circulated between now and the next Stage, which we expect may be next week, something on those lines in order to clarify the various terms and legal phraseology in the Bill which may not be clearly understandable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman also made reference to the question of law reform in regard to sanitary services legislation and asked when such reform legislation may come before the House. Although I would not like to be tied to it, from the progress we have made, I hope to be able to come to the House in 12 months' time with certain major law reforms in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Sweetman also asked questions in regard to the <Col N="2073" /> grants administered by the Department of Agriculture and those administered by Local Government.  He asked how they were intended to work in the future.  By and large, so far as the servicing of a dwelling is concerned, that will be a function of the Department of Local Government taking over from the Department of Agriculture. So far as water supplies relating to farm buildings, farmyards and land are concerned, they will still remain under the Department of Agriculture.  In general, the distinction will be as follows: all grants in relation to water installations, with the exception of those dealt with by the Department of the Gaeltacht, will be the function of the Department of Local Government; and all water for farming purposes, out-offices, cow byres and the watering of land for cattle will fall to be dealt with by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers dealt with the question of whether or not regional water schemes are the best means of achieving the aim we all desire: a piped water supply for all dwellings in the country.  The sooner we get away from the idea that a regional scheme, a private supply or a group scheme is the answer, the better.  It is by a combination of all three of these methods that it will be possible over a number of years to achieve the end we all desire.  No single approach to this matter&mdash;I repeat, no single approach&mdash;can hope to succeed in attaining that end.  It is only by an amalgamation, with each complementary to the other, and by the utmost co-operation of all concerned, that we will make headway in supplying water to the greatest number of people in the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reiterate, and I do not do so contentiously, that it is not I, as has been asserted, as Minister for Local Government, who has propagated the idea that regional schemes are the only answer.  Rather has it been the commentators on what I have been alleged to have said who have brought about the impression happily disappearing, that I and my Department are interested only in regional schemes.  From the announcement in 1959 and on several occasions since, <Col N="2074" /> I have gone out of my way to make it clear we are interested in getting water for the greatest number of our people in the shortest possible time in the most economical way.  I did not say that regional schemes, private installations or group co-operative schemes are a necessity, but that all three should be worked together in order to achieve our aim in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>Many of the other questions asked will be answered by the circular I propose to issue.  Nevertheless, I intend to deal with some of them.  One question asked by more than one Deputy was what would be the effects of Sections 2 and 3.  Briefly, Section 2 provides for the payments of grants by the Department of Local Government and Section 3 provides for the payment of grants by the local authority. Questions were also asked about Section 4.  Section 4 gives the local sanitary authority the facility of making advances.  That provision is mainly directed towards facilitating local group schemes under way at present.  It may cater for some other functions over a wider field.  The intention is to provide for advances from the sanitary authority to facilitate the operation of group schemes and make available loans on a rather simple basis, designed and drawn up by the local authority, or advances which, subject to the approval of the Minister, will not necessarily be hedged by the provisions which, I think, Deputy Sweetman had in mind, and which he read into the section of this Bill but which are really in Section 10 (2) (b) of the Housing Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was at lunch, I mentioned that I had traced it.  It is Section 10 (2) (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall be discussing that particular section later.  The difference between it and Section 4 (2) is that loans under the Housing Bill will be secured on the houses, whereas the loans and advances proposed under this section need not necessarily be so tied up in any general legal formula, such as mortgages. Indeed, the amounts of the grants or the advances likely to be <Col N="2075" /> necessary in water and sewerage group scheme operations are likely to be quite low per head of the group. Cumbersome and costly loan procedures will more than likely be unjustified. The idea is to make the scheme more readily available and to encourage groups to avail of the provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  In the case of those applying for a grant under a group scheme, suppose half have already got a grant for water and sanitation, will they be debarred from qualifying under the group scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Without trying to sidestep the question, the Deputy will appreciate that any two of a group of five, or seven, or ten would have the same merit and, therefore, in the case the Deputy puts forward, it would be safer and wiser for me to say that such cases, as they arise, will be considered on an individual basis.  I could not give a general reply to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister finishes with the question of loans to vested tenants, what amount has he in mind will be available by way of loan?  The Minister said the amounts would be trifling, so trifling that it would not be worth having a mortgage provision.  What amounts has he in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Around £40, £50 or <Col N="2076" /> £60.  It is not so much that the amounts would be trifling, but, because of the very nature of the operation and the average cost of such operations up to date, the amount likely to be needed to supplement the two grants from the local authority and the Department would probably be roughly £50 per head of the group wishing to avail of the supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister visualise that the owner of a vested cottage would have £50 to hand ready to put down?  I certainly do not.  It does not seem sense to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of what I visualise or do not visualise. There are certain vested cottage occupiers from whom one could borrow £50.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  One cannot generalise in a matter like this. Some might merit these loans, but might not be able to afford these loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see that, but I cannot see what objection there is to putting an enabling section in the Bill to enable the tenant of a vested cottage to borrow on his cottage, if he so wishes, in the same way as he can borrow for reconstruction work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have misunderstood me.  I do not anticipate that the loan provisions, or the provision governing advances by the local sanitary authority, will be any more onerous in their repayment provisions than would be a loan under any of the Housing Acts or under the section in the proposed new Housing Bill.  It is not intended that that should be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I want the tenant of a vested cottage to be able to meet the difference between his grants and the total cost by means of a loan, and I cannot see where, under this Bill, he will be able to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I shall have to leave the Deputy at that point. <Col N="2077" /> We can have it out on Committee Stage.  Possibly the memorandum will clarify the position in the meantime, or perhaps further confuse it.  I do not know which.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>A few Deputies suggested that the grants should be increased.  I suppose that is a fair request, particularly from Opposition Deputies.  I suppose it is fair that they should quote increasing costs as an argument for increasing the grants. While bigger grants would have their benefits, higher grants would mean a higher charge on the rates.  Deputy Crotty said we should increase the grants and thereby reduce the inpact on the rates.  Deputy Crotty, if he examines into the matter, will see that if we increase the grants from the Department, unless we change the system, we will likewise increase the grants from the local authority.  These grants are paid out of rates and, therefore, they would be no saving to the rates, as the Deputy seems to suppose. I do not agree that we should increase the grants at the moment.  The organisation of group schemes and the activity in relation to private individual installations are running at a level which, while it can expand, as we hope it will, shows an increasing tempo. While that evidence is there, it would seem to refute the idea that the grants are niggardly or that they fall so far short of the actual cost of these <Col N="2078" /> operations that they are useless and should be increased.</P>
      <P>Where private individuals or groups of individuals participate, the over-all estimated costs in returns to our Department would not seem to bear out that a great deal of money is required to be found by these people throughout the country.  In fact, in very many cases in rural Ireland, particularly where the applicant or some member of his household can lend assistance in doing the work, no money contribution whatever is required in order to make a private installation or to participate in a group scheme installation.  That being the case, the need for increasing these Departmental grants, or indeed the supplementary grants, does not seem to be a pressing problem, nor does it seem justified at the present time.  We must have regard also to the pool from which this money is likely to come.  It comes from the public generally and over-use of it would not be to the public advantage.  While what we are offering seems to be doing a reasonably good job and not imposing too heavy a strain on the individual who is participating &mdash; and the evidence is that that is so at the moment &mdash; no real case exists for increased grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that regulations in regard to air pollution are rather a sweeping and possibly a dangerous way of dealing with this matter.  As the House generally will appreciate, the approach to air pollution is one which needs to be couched in fairly wide terms because we are dealing with matters that not only have recently arisen but whose development is completely unforeseen and which will arise probably in a very short year ahead.  Rather than try to legislate in detail to cater for what we know and that which we anticipate, plus what we cannot know and do not anticipate, it is felt we should deal with it by regulation which would give greater flexibility in meeting the situation as the circumstances demand.  It is for that reason and no other reason that the proposals in regard to the control of air <Col N="2079" /> pollution are in the form of regulations rather than detailed legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond made a rather strange but quite a sensible comment on Section 8 wherein the appeal against notice from the local authority does not lie to the Minister but to the district court.  The reasons he put forward to the House were fairly well based.  I agree generally with his view that the appeal to the Minister for Local Government under section 8 would, in the long run, be better in the public interest than the possibility of a lack of uniformity of view on the part of various learned district justices in different courts.  It may well be that that may be the right thing to do but we have a precedent for these appeals to the court in the Fire Brigade Acts and some other Acts as well. The view expressed by Deputy Desmond is a rather unusual one in this House.  It is one on which in these circumstances I feel in sympathy with Deputy Desmond and it is a matter we can discuss more fully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick contended that we in the Department of Local Government are pushing through regional schemes and having pushed the regional scheme and put pipes and water through the country we then prohibit the use of that water for certain purposes.  That is not what is intended nor what is in the Bill.  It is not a question of prohibiting other uses of the water but that those other uses may have to be paid for.  This is not a new departure or a new curb on the use of water in or around the home.  It is merely a continuance of what has been there, a prohibition on the use of water for these external purposes, as it were.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, is it not fair that there should be in the future law a continuation of the provision that exists in the present law that a charge may be made for that water but need not necessarily be made if the local authority does not think fit to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had better scrap the regional scheme, if that is the case.  The land will not be able to bear all the charges for these benefits, if things go on like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very elementary matter.  It is equitable that the more water one consumes, the more equitable it is that one pays more for it according to use.  If I drink a cup of water and another person wants one hundred gallons, there is no great equity about charging me the same amount for that small quantity as would be charged to the other person for the much larger quantity.  However, as I have said, there is no obligation on the local authority to make that charge but they are being given the continuing power, which they already enjoy, to make a charge.  If they do not want to make a charge, they need not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another unusual suggestion was made by Deputy Blowick and one about which I think there must be <Col N="2081" /> some misunderstanding: a water main passes through a farmer's land and the farmer has been refused a tap to water his cattle on land where there is no other supply.  I agree that that is possible and there may be good technical reasons for it but when the Deputy went on to say that pipes had come through the land even without his being asked for his consent, I refuse to believe that those things have taken place because wayleaves are sought and without them public schemes are not carried out, to our knowledge in the Department, in any county.  It could well be that the wayleave may have been granted and that after the main had gone through the land the request made by the farmer had been refused, possibly on good technical grounds.  I have seen it happen that the pressure, for instance, may be too high or too heavy.  On the other hand, it could be too low and any break in the existing main or further tappings of it could reduce the pressure to such an extent as to make the water supply to the town or village less than sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the other case that I mentioned about water mains on the main road and 25 houses wanted water badly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be due to the same type of technical difficulty. Again, it could be a question of the local authority not feeling for their own reasons financial or otherwise, that they should provide the water at that stage.  Without the actual details of these complaints it is rather unfair to comment because the circumstances might be entirely different from what one might have in mind when talking about them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the apparent difficulty, when there should be no difficulty, I would be quite happy if the Deputy would furnish to my Department the actual cases he has in mind and we can try to unravel the situation and see what can be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan had something to say about water supplies and the reference in my introductory statement to the <Col N="2082" /> commencement or inception of the scheme in 1959.  He went on to say how much had been done in regard to regional water schemes and other water supplies for as many years back as twenty.  It would be inferred from what he said that I as Minister for Local Government was taking credit to which I was not entitled.  All I can say to Deputy Hogan and to Deputy Crotty, who had the same sort of narrow little view of this matter, is that so far as I am concerned I do not care who gets credit so long as the water supplies are extended at an accelerated tempo throughout the country.</P>
    <P>One thing I do say is that when we started pushing this matter we did not do it in any empty sort of way.  What really made it possible to say that anything was conceived or started in 1959 as against any other year in the matter of water supplies was that the Government of the day made new and bigger and better subsidy facilities available to local authorities to encourage them to do these things and that we raised these subsidies by, broadly speaking, an average of almost 50 per cent.  That was really the inception of these programmes.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of when I started it or when somebody else said that it was started.  The real question is how quickly we can get on with it and what work we can do.  If there are people in the country who feel they started it I hope they will not at the same time criticise me because I started it.  I do not like to lose both ways.  The only reason for talking of this is that I am blamed for it on the one hand and, from much the same source, am said not to have had much to do with it in 1959.</P>
    <P>If we succeed in our aim to get water supplies more widely disseminated and more readily available to the great majority of our people all of us will be quite happy and will not care who started it or who brought it about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan also referred to the question of water charges.  I might explain in regard to this Bill that there is a simplification of what a local authority may do in regard to charging for water in future as distinct from the water rate and rent procedure of the <Col N="2083" /> past.  As Deputies are probably well aware, particularly those who have been members of local authorities for some years, doubts have been cast on the validity of charging certain water rates and rents in certain counties as a result of decisions of the courts and in some cases the higher courts have declared against the validity of these charges.  What we can say to have happened was that much the same procedure was operated in the striking of a water rate as in striking the general rate.  In some counties they have gone part of the way with that procedure; in other counties they have gone still further; and in still further counties they may have gone less of the way with that procedure.  It is this lack of uniformity of approach to the procedure to be applied in water rate levies that has brought about the adverse decisions of the courts.  Whether that be so or not, all will agree that this cumbersome procedure surrounding a charge for water should be removed and in its place there should be the simple provision, as is proposed in this Bill, that local authorities may be enabled to buy and sell water freely, without any procedural commitments whatsoever that could be said to deter them from making proper charges or leave them in the position that they would be unable to collect such charges as a result of some court decision.</P>
    <P>In so far as the rates of charge are concerned, it has been suggested here that I as Minister for Local Government should define what these charges should be.  It is far from that idea that we are working on this Bill.  Rather is it that we are giving wide scope to the local authority.  It is not my intention that the Minister for Local Government should lay down any uniform charge for water to be applied in all cases.  It will be for each local authority to decide, in their own circumstances, how and in what way and at what price it proposes to supply water to any user of water in their functional area.</P>
    <P>When this matter has been considered properly it will generally be agreed that it is better that this should be so rather than that there should be <Col N="2084" /> any attempt by the Minister for Local Government to lay down charges for all local authorities irrespective of the circumstances obtaining in the county in question.</P>
    <P>Then there has been the very old argument that people not benefiting from a water scheme or scheme of public origin should not have to pay rates in respect of that service.  It has been suggested that in addition to that group there is the group who will not benefit from a public scheme for probably five, seven, ten or twenty years and that they again should be relieved of any general rate application or implication until such time as they obtain benefit; and that there are finally a third group who by installing their own private schemes will never have to call on the local authority's public supply and that therefore they should be entirely relieved of any general rate charge forever and always thereafter.</P>
    <P>On the face of it this seems to be a rather logical sequence of thought but when we stop to examine the situation we find it is not quite so logical as it appears.  If people in the county health districts throughout the country in all cases were only to contribute to that from which they hope to benefit there would not be much sense in having any public services at all.  I would say there are many local government and local authority services to which people contribute as ratepayers and never hope to benefit from them but in fact hope they never will be in a position where they could benefit by one pennyworth from those services.</P>
    <P>There are such services where one would not wish to be in a position to benefit by them and where one still does pay and is compelled to pay. When one looks at it like that, it must be accepted that if we are to have these services, the only way in which they can be provided is by general charges, whether by rates or taxation. In regard to the water services, a considerable proportion of all the cost which will arise will fall on the general taxpayer.  We might draw the conclusion that a person who has his own water supply installed or who cannot avail of a scheme for some special <Col N="2085" /> reason should not pay his part of the charge but we might as well say that a person resident in Dublin or Cork should not pay tax on cigarettes, liquor or beer because he was contributing to the provision of a water scheme for the people of Donegal.  If everyone took that view, we would have no public services or amenity services or social services of any kind.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Deputy who put forward this idea, which is probably a reflection of certain arguments made to him by people in his constituency or elsewhere, that the freedom we are giving and the simplification of the code that we are making in regard to the charges for the actual water supply are matters that can be used to quite a degree to help to offset the application of the general rate charges to the people in the county who are not benefiting in any way by the scheme. It will be possible to make a fair charge on those who use the water and those who use the greatest amount of the water and the more that charge is, the less will fall by way of extra rate charges on those who are drawing no water from the common pool.</P>
    <P>The individual who put in a private supply or who participated in a group scheme has already got help from the taxpayer and the ratepayer of his county.  It is not always true to say that such individuals provided their own water supply by the sweat of their brows and that they should not now contribute to the rates of the county for the general supply.  They themselves in many cases have added to the general rates burden for water in so far as they got a grant from the local authority for their own supply, which grant was paid out of the rates. The case that could be made for non-application of the general rate is more apparent than real.  It is no harm that the matter should have been discussed here and if it can be clarified to any degree throughout the country, it is a good idea that it should have been discussed here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, among other things, asked whether offensive odours would be covered under the air pollution provision.  The existing law, which we <Col N="2086" /> are not touching for the present, covers these matters in its existing provisions. That is the answer to his query.  It is not proposed to cover offensive odours in this Bill.  They are already covered. The ordinary sanitary services law covers matters like this and therefore it is not included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned that the Local Government water grant procedure was somewhat cumbersome and that it seemed to be more difficult and long drawn out than the procedure of the Department of Agriculture.  I cannot see how that should arise, but I will look into it and if, in taking over the Department of Agriculture water schemes, we find something useful that they have been operating, we will be only too happy to adopt it.  My own experience in these matters would not bear out what the Deputy says.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned the question of connection to sewers and the tapping of these sewers and the tapping of pipes in local authority schemes presently under contract.  He asked would it not be possible to have the extensions to the sewers made by the contractor and possibly paid for by the local authority while the main contract was being done.  This is a matter which we have under study in the Department and we have already circularised all local authorities to the effect that it should be done where it is possible.  Section 9 of this Bill makes it legally feasible for county councils to do these things and have them done while the contract is in progress and to make arrangements with the people who intend to connect to pay their proportionate parts of the cost.</P>
    <P>We are making provision to have such work done while the main contract is in progress where it would be more economic than if the council did the work under contract, had the place closed up, and then had to come along again and open it to have the connection made.  We have been in touch with the local authorities about this matter and Section 9 of the Bill makes it more readily done under the law than it possibly was in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crotty mentioned delays in dealing with schemes and he particularly <Col N="2087" /> mentioned the Mooncoin regional water scheme.  He suggested something should be done to speed up the procedure and that the consultant engineer on that scheme had practically become recognised as a permanent member of the local authority's staff.  I am quite happy Deputy Crotty mentioned this because it gives me an opportunity to refer generally to the slow manner in which many of our schemes have been carried out over many years.</P>
    <P>If there is a slowness in procedure the local authorities in question should take strenuous action to ensure they are not held up further merely because a consultant is so busy on so many jobs at once that he has not got time to get round to particular ones.  In proposals that have come to me from local authorities I have taken steps to insist that where a firm or a company of consultants are in question some one person of responsibility in that company should be responsible for whatever scheme is concerned &mdash; that it is not merely a company's name and no more.</P>
    <P>I have told local authorities that in the various stages of these schemes time limits should be placed within which these people undertake to produce final or preliminary plans, as the case may be.  If they do not there is only one remedy &mdash; get rid of them, because it is too much to expect the Government, the Department, members of this House and local authorities to try to facilitate the speedy completion of such schemes by producing ways and means so that essential jobs concerned with water supplies and sanitation should not be held up because people with too many jobs on hand at once&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherwin mentioned the provision of sanitary and water services to caravans and temporary dwellings beside the sea.  There is quite a difficulty here.  These summer dwellings are normally placed on land for which a rent only is being paid and therefore the people using them are in the dilemma that, while the local authority insist they should have water and sewerage services, the dwellers are not in a position to provide them because they were not owners of the land.  All I can say is that it can be a complex and difficult problem, but if we in the Department can help any of these groups who live by the seaside in caravans, chalets or bungalows we shall try to work out some way of getting them out of their dilemma.  We shall try to unravel the situation for them if it is humanly possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill, as its long Title indicates, makes further and better provision in relation to grants <Col N="2090" /> and loans for private housing and it also consolidates the existing provisions of the Housing Acts on this subject.  It is a first step in the simplification and modernisation of the general housing code.</P>
      <P>Housing legislation at present comprises the separate codes of the Labourers Acts (1883-1958), the Housing of the Working Classes Acts (1890-1960), the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1960, and the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts (1899-1958).</P>
      <P>It is proposed in this Bill to consolidate and amend the various provisions in the latter two codes dealing with grants and loans for private housing.</P>
      <P>The statutory provisions relating to the general powers of housing authorities in the Labourers Acts (1883-1958) and the Housing of the Working Classes Acts (1890-1958) are also being reviewed for consolidation and amendment in new legislation which will be introduced as soon as possible.  Housing law will then be comprised in only two codes, the Loans and Grants Bill now before the House and the remainder of the law as proposed to be consolidated in relation to local housing authorities.</P>
      <P>The existing provisions relating to State grants for new and reconstructed houses expired on the 31st March, 1962.  The Bill (Section 2) provides for the continuance at existing levels of the grants available for the provision of new houses.  No terminal date for the completion of grant houses is specified and continuing and extending legislation will therefore be unnecessary in future so far as the payment of grants is concerned.  While the housing law is thus being made permanent, this is, of course, without prejudice to the introduction of any amending legislation which may be found necessary from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present rates of grants for new houses are being retained, subject to the qualification that a grant will in future be made for unserviced houses only in cases in which the provision of a piped water supply and sewerage facilities is not reasonably practicable. This amendment is in accord with the policy of securing the provision of <Col N="2091" /> sanitary services in dwellings wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with reconstruction grants and proposes to continue these grants at the existing rates.  Hitherto grants under separate sections and subject to different conditions were paid for (a) the reconstruction of houses in the occupation of farmers, the total rateable valuation of whose holdings did not exceed £50 and to agricultural labourers reconstructing houses for their own occupation in a rural area; and (b) the repair and improvement of houses by other persons.  Section 3 deals with both these classes of grants on uniform conditions, subject to retention of the basis on which the grants are at present determined, viz., two-thirds of the cost of the work in the case of category (a) and one-third for category (b), but subject also in both cases to the maximum limit as set out in the section.  The expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; is not being retained in this context: the classes for whom grants of two-thirds of the cost are to be made are referred to as persons who derive their livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture.  Thus, farmers and agricultural labourers are brought within the same qualification.  The proposed amalgamation of the two existing sections is designed to secure a desirable uniformity and simplification in administration.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the payment of second or subsequent grants in respect of a house which had previously received a new-house or reconstruction grant.  The 1932 Housing Act contained no positive provisions allowing second grants and this situation was, in the earlier years of the housing programme, regarded as justified for the purpose of securing that durable and good quality work would be carried out when the house was being built or being reconstructed for the first time.  The possibility of financial exploitation of a system of unrestricted successive grants had also to be guarded against.  With the passing of time, however, and the ageing of housing stock either built or reconstructed originally with these grants, some relaxations were considered <Col N="2092" /> necessary to keep houses in repair, and improve them, to prevent deterioration, to allow for family expansion and to enable the question of storm damage to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Various amendments made in 1950, 1952 and 1954 helped the objective of securing durable and good standard work initially, while allowing subsequent grants for necessary reconstruction after the passing of a reasonable time or the emergence of circumstances outside the applicant's control.  Under this section, the general bar to payment of further reconstruction grants, within a fifteen-year period of the first grant, is retained as is the reduced period of 10 years where re-roofing is necessary. However, as rigid application of a limiting period gave rise to hardship in certain cases where particular works became urgently necessary before the expiration of the period, it was decided in 1960, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to pay limited grants for some of the more urgent works likely to arise under Section 12 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1954, which did not include a prohibition on the payment of further grants. Specific statutory authority for the continuance of the payment of these special grants is now being taken.  The existing legislative power to make a grant for works necessitated by storm damage is being re-enacted with the reservation that a grant for works of this nature will not carry with it a disqualification on the subsequent payment at any time of a grant for normal reconstruction work.</P>
    <P>The maximum grants under the section will be as follows: (a) For extra rooms to relieve overcrowding, involving an addition to floor area, £50 per room; (b) For provision of a bathroom, involving an addition to floor area, £50; (c) For storm damage, two-thirds of the cost in the case of persons deriving their livelihood solely or mainly from agriculture, including farmers with holdings not exceeding £50 and one-third in other cases, subject to the maximum of £100, £120 or £140, as appropriate.  For works urgently necessary to conserve a house, one-third of cost subject to a maximum of £100, £120 or £140, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> The aggregate of grants made at any one time under the section must not exceed the appropriate statutory maximum of £100, £120 or £140, which obtain at present.  Payment of the grants will be made subject to regulations.</P>
    <P>Provisions governing the payment of grants for the installation of private water and sewerage facilities are not being retained in housing legislation but will be dealt with in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Bill, recently introduced.</P>
    <P>As supplementary grants are closely connected with State grants, I shall now deal with the new provisions in this respect in advance of the order shown in the text of the Bill.  Section 12 of the Bill discontinues the graded system of supplementary grants by local authorities for new houses, leaving housing authorities free to decide the type of supplementary grant scheme most suited to local circumstances within specified maximum limits of income and valuation for eligibility. The existing annual income limit is £624 for county boroughs and contiguous areas and £520 elsewhere but no limit applies to tenants of local authority dwellings or persons eligible for such tenancies.  A uniform limit of £832 per annum is now proposed.  An increase to £50 in the maximum valuation limit of £35 is proposed for farmers.  The proposals confer on local authorities a power to exclude categories of applicants to whom, although they come within the statutory income or valuation limits, the payment of a supplementary grant by the housing authority is not considered to be warranted.  Similarly, a housing authority will be free to limit their scheme to houses of particular types. As regards supplementary grants for reconstruction, repair and improvement, there are no existing statutory maxima for income and valuation. Section 8 of the Bill preserves this position.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill introduces a new type of grant to assist minimum essential preservation work in rural areas.  This proposal is part of a planned approach to deal with the remaining unfit housing problem in <Col N="2094" /> these areas.  The evidence available so far, from the survey of unfit housing, shows a manifest need for flexibility of treatment of this branch of the housing problem.  There are many persons living in unfit conditions who are not and are never likely to be in a position to rehouse themselves and whose needs cannot or are not being met by housing authorities.  Owing to such factors as the location of the houses and the age and circumstances of the occupants, local authorities cannot be expected to give a high priority to providing new houses for these classes.  Private grants and loans procedure has up to now been generally ineffective in these cases.  The purpose of the section is to enable the occupant to carry out only the minimum essential works such as roof repairs, repairs of doors or windows and wall plastering. The work will be carried out on an economic and temporary basis so that the house may be reasonably fit for a limited period and so that its subsequent abandonment or demolition will not involve any substantial abortive expenditure The proposal will not in any way relieve the rural housing authority of its obligation to secure the demolition or closure of unfit rented houses which, normally, are a feature of urban, rather than of rural areas.</P>
    <P>The State grant proposed under this section will not exceed £80, or two-thirds of the cost of the work, whichever is less.  The housing authority may, in addition, make a grant sufficient to defray the balance of the cost or may contribute within this limit building materials or labour or other assistance in kind.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities are also being authorised under this section to carry out the necessary works of repair with the consent of the occupiers and, in such circumstances, the State grants will be payable to the housing authority.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill introduces a new scheme of grants to philanthropic and charitable organisations for the provision of housing for elderly persons. It is hoped that the increased rate of grant (£300 per dwelling unit) will provide the necessary impetus to encourage the provision of this type <Col N="2095" /> of housing.  Aspects of a social character which are normally outside the scope of housing policy attend the problem of housing old people.  For that reason, it is desirable that philanthropic or charitable organisations should be encouraged as far as possible to provide the necessary dwelling accommodation.  Generous public financial aid is justified for this purpose since the funds likely to be available to such organisations are normally limited.</P>
    <P>The section provides for the payment of supplementary grants by housing authorities of amounts not exceeding the grants paid by the State, and provision is also made entitling housing authorities to prescribe such conditions in relation to the payment of supplementary grants as they think fit.</P>
    <P>Section 7 introduces a new type of grant designed to encourage experimentation by architects, builders, co-operative groups and local authorities in the production of low cost housing suitable for persons in low income groups.  The grant for the erection of the approved prototype will not exceed 50 per cent. of the approved estimated cost.  Subsequent reproductions of a successful prototype will be eligible for normal new house grants and supplementary grants in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>It has been represented by architects that, given more freedom of design, house costs could be reduced.  Local authorities also have occasionally sought sanction to experimentation in design and specification related to local needs and circumstances.  No adequate machinery exists at present which would encourage development of these suggestions.  Where departures from prescribed standards occur or are proposed in private grant cases, it is usual to reduce the amount of grant normally available in order to preserve the principle that fixed standards should be observed as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>If co-operative or self-help housing, to which I will refer later, can be developed into a formal movement in any area, the erection of a specially designed experimental or &ldquo;prototype&rdquo;<Col N="2096" /> house would provide useful experience to the co-operative group and encouragement to the spread of such activity.</P>
    <P>The section proposes that, if a house-type were evolved through the experimentation envisaged which necessitated such a departure from the present fixed standards as would normally warrant a reduction or loss of grant, the new house-type (perhaps with modification) will be brought especially within eligibility for normal rates of grant for the purpose of reproduction.  This will preserve the existing principle of fixed standards to be applied to grant-houses in general and will also enable local authorities to pay supplementary grants in the normal course.</P>
    <P>Section 9 and 12 of the Bill authorise housing authorities to pay supplementary grants for the reconstruction and provision of houses under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 10 re-enacts and extends Section 13 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958, so as to enable a housing authority to make loans for the repair of (a) vested cottages; and (b) houses which have been or will be sold by housing authorities to tenant purchasers in urban areas, where the fee simple or fine is or will be mortgaged as security.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the making of loans by housing authorities for the acquisition or construction of houses. The section is intended to replace the existing provisions of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts and will be brought into operation on an appointed day by Order made by the Minister.  The section authorises the making of regulations to deal <i>inter alia</i> with the details of procedure relating to the making of loans, the classes eligible for loans, repayments, transfers, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is a re-enactment and extension of Section 10 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1956, under which housing authorities are empowered to guarantee advances to private persons for the provision of houses.  This guarantee procedure has, however, been almost wholly ineffective.  The amended section enables guarantees to be given <Col N="2097" /> in respect of loans for reconstruction work as well as for new houses and extends the type of bodies to which guarantees may be given.  The new section may in this way be utilised to a greater extent than its predecessor.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a new provision which authorises the Minister to withhold or reduce a grant where the conditions subject to which the grant was paid have not been complied with.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill enables the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to vary from time to time the amounts of the maximum advances to be made to borrowers under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I propose, on the passing of this Bill, to fix a uniform maximum of £2,000 which will govern advances by all housing authorities and which will replace the existing statutory limits of £1,600 and £1,800.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 25 (subsection 2) make the necessary transitional provision for the payment of grants outstanding at 31st March, 1962, and authorised within the period 1st April, 1962, up to the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections are necessary re-enactments of existing provisions of the Housing Acts dealing with private housing grants.  I have now outlined the contents and the aims of this Bill, which is designed to encourage the elimination of unfit housing so far as positive legislation can deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>As the Dáil is aware, a survey of unfit houses has been in progress for some time, with special reference to the extent of the problem in rural areas.  In the last 30 years, the housing programme, particularly that portion of it undertaken by local authorities, has been more effective in urban than in rural areas, where the current survey figures up to the present indicate that some 30,000 houses need to be repaired and 20,000 more require to be replaced. The full completion of the survey will not materially alter the overall picture of the problem presented by these figures.  The problem is a big one and obviously more difficult to solve than that section of the housing programme <Col N="2098" /> that has already been successfully implemented.</P>
    <P>In rural areas, the unfit housing problem does not lend itself to the treatment possible in urban areas where blocks of unfit property, often in single ownership, can be dealt with by large-scale clearance operations. The outstanding feature of the rural problem is that of isolated and owner-occupied houses situated on holdings of varying economic categories.  These categories range from those willing and able to meet the cost of new houses of reconstruction of their old houses with the aid of grants down to those who, for financial or other reasons, are either unable or unwilling to face the implications of even a very modest degree of repair.  As Deputies familiar with rural conditions are aware, many elderly single persons or elderly couples with little or no resources or a short expectation of life without assured succession for occupation of their dwellings are the classes least inclined or able to do anything for themselves.  As I have already said, it is part of the problem that local authorities are not universally disposed to regard this problem as part of their housing functions or, where they do accept some responsibility, they can give only a low priority to the rehousing of these classes, as compared with others seeking new housing.</P>
    <P>So far as legislative proposals can go, this Bill contains provisions specially designed to deal with the needs of the rural position.  For rural as well as for urban areas, the removal of housing grants from the need for renewable legislation gives an assurance to all concerned that they may continue to plan and build without fear of the non-renewal of the legislation on which the grants depend.  The recurrence of unfitness in housing, even in the best circumstances, is a perennial problem and not one that can be assumed to be finally eradicable in the sense that even the best houses decay in time.  The proposed provisions in regard to loans and eligibility for supplementary grants made the way easier for the erection of new houses and the reconstruction of old ones.  The introduction of the minimum essential <Col N="2099" /> repair grants provided in Section 5 for county health areas represents an important new principle of housing policy which, I hope, will do much at reasonable cost to restore the habitability of some of the worst houses in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Housing activities in recent years have shown a marked trend in the direction of private enterprise.  This welcome trend, which appears likely to continue, deserves to be nurtured not only by improved legislation but also by positive encouragement of both individual effort and co-operative action.  The success which has attended the active help and advice given by my Department to persons desiring to organise private group water supply schemes convinces me that a planned approach on these lines to the rural housing problem may yield results which more official lines of action could not achieve.  The approach by way of self-help will, I am certain, be considerably assisted by the general provisions of the Bill and particularly by the provisions of Section 7 which will encourage experimentation towards the production of low-cost housing.</P>
    <P>The general pattern of this Bill fits therefore into the first part of the attack on the unfit housing problem which is of particular urgency in rural areas.  There is still a wide and important field in which local authorities can continue to make, by the direct provision of houses, further valuable contributions to meeting housing needs.  I propose to deal with this aspect of the matter in conjunction with my proposals for an up-to-date consolidated code for local housing authorities, which will, I hope, contain special provision in relation to the rural situation. As I have already intimated, I hope to bring this legislation before the House without any great delay. When these two measures are enacted, we shall have in up-to-date form all the powers required for the effective prosecution of the housing activities of private and public enterprise.</P>

      <P>The Minister in bringing this Bill to the House did do what we regretted he had not done in the earlier Bill, that is, to circulate a <Col N="2100" /> White Paper.  Therefore we can at least say we have this explanatory memorandum to assist us in understanding the Bill.  The Bill, however, is a pretty complex one, extending as it does over 26 sections and three Schedules.  When one remembers that and when one recollects also that everyone knew that a Housing Bill had to be enacted as soon as possible after 1st April, 1962, it is virtually impossible to understand why the Minister was so dilatory in bringing the Bill to the House.  We all knew such legislation was essential after the commencement of this financial year because the old housing enabling legislation terminated on 31st March last.  In those circumstances, I am completely unable to understand why the Minister left it until these last few dying days of the Dáil before the recess to introduce this legislation.</P>
      <P>Even with the assistance of the explanatory memorandum, for which I am grateful, the measure is one that it is not possible adequately and clearly to discuss here within a very short compass of time.  It is therefore self-evident that the Minister must accept blame, and serious blame, for not having been sufficiently far forward with his programme and his plans to introduce this Bill at a time when the other Act was expiring.  It is undoubted that various people have held back from starting new housing works waiting for the publication of this measure.  Even in my own constituency, I know many cases where people, believing that grants were to be increased, held back, in case, by having commenced work before such grants were announced, they would lose the benefit of new provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will suffer a shock on the double now.  First they will get a shock because there is no increase whatever in grants provided by this Bill to meet increased costs and, secondly, in many cases because of the neglect of the Minister to introduce the Bill at a reasonable time, they have lost &mdash; I was going to say a great part of the summer but I do not think anybody could describe the weather we have had so far as being summer &mdash; a substantial period of time.  Apart from that, I must confess that I was almost stunned by the <Col N="2101" /> audacity of the Minister in one phrase. It is audacity of which the Minister is perfectly entitled to be proud.  Towards the end of his speech, he said:</P>
    <P>Housing activities in recent years have shown a marked trend in the direction of private enterprise.  This welcome trend...</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  The facts are, of course, that there is a trend.  If one likes to compare the proportion of private housing to local authority housing, undoubtedly the proportion of private housing is increasing.  Why is it increasing?  It is increasing because local authority housing has virtually ceased in comparison with what it was in earlier years.  To suggest that there has been a marked trend in the direction of private enterprise is a distortion of the facts as they appear in the reply by the Minister to a question on 20th May last.  On 20th May, at Columns 1579 and 1580, Volume 195, No. 12. of the Official Report, the Minister told Deputy Jones and the House that this was the position in relation to housing:</P>

    <P>Lo and behold, in 1957 enter Fianna Fáil into the realm of Government: 1957-58, 3,467; 1958-59, 1,812; 1959-60, a little bit up &mdash; 2,414; 1960-61, 1,463; 1961-62, 1,238.  Let us put that in pattern: 1,238 in 1961-62 after Fianna Fáil had been in office for five years and they surely cannot say that in five years they were still suffering from any effects of anything that was done by their predecessors.  Yet, that figure of 1,238 contrasts with the figures of 5,267, 4,011 and 4,784 in the three years during which Deputy O'Donnell was responsible as Minister. I agree, if one counts as a virtue cessation of local authority building, that has been a swing in relation to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>One goes on to examine the figures <Col N="2102" /> in relation to private enterprise housing. By that, I presume the Minister means the number of houses built by private persons with the aid of grants under the Housing Acts and that when the Minister was referring to the welcome trend in relation to housing activities by private enterprise it was that particular type of house to which he was referring.  I agree that in 1961-62 there was a slight increase over the previous year in that type of housing but the fact remains that in no single year since Fianna Fáil came into office in 1957 have there been as many houses built by private persons with the aid of housing grants as there were in any of the three years for which Deputy O'Donnell was responsible, from 1954 to 1957.</P>
    <P>Here are the facts; here are the figures.  Let them go on the record of this House and let those members of Fianna Fáil who honestly believed &mdash; and there were some who honestly believed &mdash; the claptrap that was spoken and produced by Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Local Government before he became Minister for Agriculture&mdash;consider these facts and figures and let them come in their own minds, their own consciences and their own honesty to see whether Deputy Smith when Minister for Local Government and his successor were justified in the comments and the claims they made in respect of it.</P>

      <P>We will provide him with the figures on the Money Resolution, if he does not want to provide them to-day.  It was the Government which Deputy Leneghan supports which permitted Singer to get away with it, not this side of the House.  Coming to the years about which Deputy Dolan is going to enlighten us, the facts are that in not a single year since 1957 has there been as many houses erected with the aid of housing grants, according to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>The figures are: For 1957-58, 3,629; for 1958-59, 2,684; for 1959-60, 3,740; for 1960-61, 3,952 and for 1961-62, 4,049.  In other words, in every single year there were more than 1,000 less than the number to which I referred a while ago.  If anybody wants the amounts paid to Dublin Corporation from 1955 onwards, I have them here. In 1954-55, the amount was £4,622,195; in 1955-56, £4,041,587; in 1956-57, £3,625,694; in 1957-58, after Fianna Fáil were in office, £2,165,045; in 1958-59, and again with Fianna Fáil in office, £1,847,596. In 1959-60, the amount was £1,611,587, just less than half the amount in 1956-57 about which there has been a certain amount of talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one wants to go from one end of the country to the other, to Cork, we will find the same situation, that there was more money paid out for Cork Corporation housing expenditure, as <Col N="2106" /> Deputy Anthony Barry can also vouch for, in the years 1955, 1956 and 1957 than there was in any year since.  I know that the situation in respect of housing except in Dublin and Cork is that the demand for local authority housing is tapering off.  That is not the case in either Dublin or Cork and that excuse is not available in relation to the provision of grants for either Dublin or Cork.</P>

If the Deputy does not believe that I am quoting the correct figures, they are easily available to him, but I am quoting the correct figures.  They are unchallengeable by the Minister for Local Government.  I do not blame some Deputies opposite who swallowed <Col N="2107" /> hook, line and sinker statements made by their Front Bench in the honest belief that their leaders were telling them the true story.  The facts of those figures show that their leaders were not doing so.</P>

These are figures for money paid to honest people who made honest claims.</P>

In Cork, the comparative figures are £366,000 in 1961-62 and £741,360 in 1957.  No matter how the Deputy plays with the trend, when he looks at the full figures, he will find he was codded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Relate them to the facts, and I shall give the facts.  The Deputy was one of the people who was <Col N="2109" /> honestly and conscientiously misled.  A great many people to my knowledge have deferred operations under the Housing Acts because of failure by the Minister to announce new legislation. The fact is that not merely have a number of people held back in that respect but a great many people who are about to build now will be bitterly disappointed by the fact that the grants have not been increased.  Most people who are building expected that the grants being announced under new schemes would be better than those in existence, but of course, as the Minister indicated in his opening speech, all this Bill does in relation to grants is to continue them at the level at which they were previously paid.</P>
      <P>There will be considerable disappointment in that respect.  Not merely will there be disappointment but also some hesitation on the part of people to go ahead with what they had planned.  As far as I can understand, the procedure that will now be adopted under Section 3 will mean that instead of two types of form of application for housing grants, in future, only one will be used and it will be immaterial whether the house concerned is one in respect of which the person has a valuation of a certain size or not.  The same criterion will be operative to both classes.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputies in other areas have found as we have in Kildare that people frequently apply for grants, believing they were eligible under one section only to find that they had to apply under the other section. They then had to get a certificate from the local authority as to the suitability of the house for reconstruction grants under Section 3.  As I understand the amalgamation of the two sections into one in the new Bill, it would seem that one type of application only will be required in future and accordingly the administration should be eased in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is proposing here that grants for new houses will be paid by virtue of Section 2, only where a piped water supply and sewerage system cannot reasonably be provided.  I take it that what is meant there is that where a public or private supply cannot reasonably <Col N="2110" /> be provided, the reconstruction grant is intended to apply only to a public system.  It is almost certain that is so but I should like to have it confirmed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation also to reconstruction grants, I should like one other point clarified.  It refers to the supplementary grants that will now be available by virtue of the new procedure.  The expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;, in reference to a person working for hire in a rural area, has gone now under this new proposal and instead of that it refers to a person engaged solely or mainly in agricultural work.  It seems from that that the basis on which supplementary grants have hitherto been paid to persons working for hire in rural areas but not actually working on land is being changed.  It is desirable that that change should be explained to us in a more detailed fashion than appears in the memorandum and in the Minister's opening speech.</P>
    <P>In relation to construction, and indeed in relation also to the erection of new houses, I do not know whether members of other local authorities find that their local authorities have the greatest difficulty in getting contractors to do isolated cottages.  We have found in Kildare that it is virtually impossible to get contractors to do satisfactorily isolated cottages in rural areas.  There is little difficulty in obtaining a contractor to do a group scheme of half a dozen houses, but, because of the difficulty of supervision and because the small type of building contractor does not now seem to be there as he was, it is virtually impossible to get contractors in Kildare to build individual isolated cottages in the rural areas.  If other areas are finding the same difficulty, then a method of dealing with that problem must be found. It would seem that the only method is to increase the facilities available for people to build their own houses. Quite frankly, the provisions of Section 5 may, perhaps, ease that to some degree.</P>
    <P>I am sure that every Deputy has come across the case of a person living <Col N="2111" /> in a totally unsatisfactory house, who has not got any young family perhaps, and yet feels he would not have the slightest possibility of meeting even a minimum differential rent, if he were to be rehoused by the local authority.  The provisions of Section 5 will help, because in such cases where there are old people desiring some small repairs to their existing habitations, this section, while not providing them with the standard which they and we would like, at the same time would enable them to carry on for a period without having to meet the increased rent they would have to pay if the local authority had to rehouse them.</P>
    <P>In addition, that type of house is nearly always in a rather remote part of a rural area.  If it is in such a remote part, there will be the same difficulty for the local authority in getting a contractor to build a house in which to rehouse the people concerned. Therefore, the grants provided by Section 5 are one method of ensuring that this problem can be met to some degree.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable for the Minister, when concluding, to outline in more detail what he has in mind in that section, which is a new one.  Is it, for example, to be a complete condition that any part of the wall cannot be a mud wall?  One often comes across an old house where the thatched roof requires to be completely replaced and where a grant cannot be obtained for its replacement because one section, perhaps, of one wall is a mud wall, and without the removal of that wall a grant would not in the ordinary course be paid.  I hope that type of restriction will not be enforced, particularly in regard to the fringe areas around the bogs in Kildare, which I know and in respect of which I can at once think of two cases where this section would be of assistance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister also when concluding would indicate whether it is intended that Section 6 of the Bill will provide only for charitable societies and such like?  Is it intended that under no circumstances can this type of grant for elderly couples be provided <Col N="2112" /> for a small house on this scale, which would be sufficient for an old couple but not sufficient for a young married couple with a growing family?</P>
    <P>The Minister made considerable play with the provisions for experimentation in house design provided by Section 7. I am not quite sure that the way he has provided for it in this Bill will ensure what is undoubtedly a desirable thing.  I remember, for example, in relation to Kildare, one particular firm got the county council to erect a new type of house at a very reduced cost. The cost was trifling.  The only effect of that erection was that no one else anywhere else bought the house.  They were told that while they might be suitable in certain circumstances, they were not suitable for the general run of houses being built.  Whenever it was asked if any local authority had taken up the experiment, the answer was: &ldquo;Yes, Kildare has erected one.&rdquo;  The obvious implication was that, because only one had been erected, they were not of any value and the experiment was never proceeded with and improved on, as it should have been if it was to be a success.  I am a little afraid the same thing might easily occur in relation to the erection of the prototype provided for here in Section 7.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear what is the purpose of the change in nomenclature provided by Section 11 from the old small dwellings code.  Incidentally, in passing, I might add I was particularly intrigued to know why in the explanatory memorandum, Section 11 was explained before Section 10.  If Deputies look at the top of page 3 of the White Paper, they will find the first paragraph deals entirely with Section 11.  Then we go on to the second paragraph, which deals with Section 10.  It is unusual to change the order of explanation and I feel that there must have been some particular reason for the change, a reason which I failed to notice.</P>
    <P>Section 13 extends the guarantee system provided by the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1946.  The Bill itself does not refer to that Act but the explanatory memorandum is quite honest about it and explains that it is extending the guarantee system provided by the Housing (Amendment) <Col N="2113" /> Act, 1946.  Yet I seem to remember certain Deputies saying, when those on that side of the House were on this side, that that was an utterly useless provision and one that should and would be completely scrapped.  But I am glad to see and welcome their conversion, even at this late stage. Before I leave Section 11, might I inquire also whether I am correct in thinking that the regulations to be made under subsection (2) of Section 11 must be tabled under the general provision for tabling contained in Section 23, or whether that section is exclusive of it?  I believe the regulations must be so tabled.  Certainly it is essential that they would be.</P>
    <P>The Minister on several occasions referred in his introductory remarks to what he described as the principle of self-help.  Does he mean by that a private person erecting his own house with the aid of Government grants and Government facilities, as apart from the provision of that house by a local authority building the house for the particular person?  Or does he intend to imply by the use of the phrase &ldquo;self-help&rdquo;, particularly in his mention of it in connection with experimentation in house design, something in the nature of what one might term roughly &ldquo;Do-it-yourself&rdquo;?  Does he mean that the experimentation is to be towards a type of house which can be prefabricated on a factory basis and put into place without quite the same amount of skill or the same amount of labour on the site as would be involved in the more conventional type of building? Or does he mean by &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; that he is stressing a trend from public authority building towards private persons building with the help of grants and loans?  It is desirable that he should clarify that because his phrase could be taken either way, and it is desirable, at least, that we should know in which direction his mind is travelling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill introduced here which will be of assistance to those building their own houses, to local authorities providing houses in their respective areas, and which will be to the advantage of the country as <Col N="2114" /> a whole will naturally have the support of the Labour Party.  I have no intention of making comparisons between the number of houses being built now and the number of houses built in any particular year.  If one wishes to make such comparisons, they can more legitimately be made when we come to discuss the Estimate for the Department of Local Government. I wish to concentrate solely now on the provisions in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It must be admitted by all that this Bill has certain defects.  In Section 2, it is made quite clear that there will be no increase in the grants for building or for reconstruction.  That is a grave defect.  Building costs have soared over the past few years.  That is not due to any action by the Government. Costs have increased everywhere. The present method is that the grants are based on estimates made by the Department of Local Government. As has been said here before, these estimates are in 90 out of 100 cases, far below the actual cost of either building or reconstruction work.  It is a source of great disappointment to those hoping to build new homes, or spend some money on the reconstruction and improvement of their existing homes, to learn that they will not be allowed one penny extra under this Bill by way of grant because of the way in which the figures are estimated and because there is still no consideration being given to figures submitted by either the applicant, or the contractor on behalf of the applicant. Autocratic control is still held by the Minister for Local Government.  It is he who decides whether the more suitable estimate is the one computed by his Department or the more realistic estimate submitted by the applicant. Section 2 is not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Section 3 will need amendment.  It has been made quite clear here in the past that the present system of costs is outdated and outmoded and should be scrapped.  Something will have to be done by the Minister between now and the Committee Stage to improve this Bill.  It is a Bill which may in future be of some assistance to people building houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 is good.  I give the Mini- <Col N="2115" /> ster credit for the provision whereby money can now be allocated by way of grant for what may be called minimum repairs.  There are houses which are undoubtedly in bad repair.  The occupants are not in a position financially to do the work themselves, work which departmental inspectors insist should be done before the people will qualify for a grant.  This provision will help old people living in houses which are not in too serious disrepair and which, if repaired, will last these people for the remainder of their life-time.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify Section 6.  On the face of it, it is very good, dealing with the provision of housing for elderly people.  We would be tempted to say in fact that this should be considered one of the best sections in the Bill.  Perhaps it could be if operated properly.  However, it is not what we here wish it to be but how it is put into operation when it becomes law that is important.  This section says that the amount of grant shall not exceed £300.  I am anxious to know for what type of house this £300 may be provided, for which also a supplementary grant may be provided by the local authority.  We may get building speculators who will buy two or three houses in the city here or in Cork, convert these houses and claim that each single room is a separate dwelling in the building.  From my reading of the section, there is nothing to prevent anyone so doing.</P>
    <P>It would be deplorable if anyone could take advantage of Government grants in that way.  There should be protection for the people and for the State in relation to the money being paid out by insisting on certain minimum space requirements before such grants are paid.  I suggest these dwellings should contain at least a living room and one bedroom to make a self-contained unit.  Elderly people in Dublin or Cork city might wish to invite some friends in for the evening. They may be in a single room which must be used for the preparation of meals, for dining and everything else. That is not satisfactory.  I am not accusing the Minister but lest some <Col N="2116" /> people may take advantage of a loophole in the section, I would ask that this matter be re-examined by the Minister so that these grants will be properly utilised and properly availed of in order to provide for these elderly people the housing conditions to which undoubtedly they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with supplementary grants.  The position may vary from county to county.  Cork County Council or other county councils may find no difficulty in paying these supplementary grants because the intake of rates can stand up to it and eventually they will get it back in the increased rates collected on the improved property. However, I have in mind the position of urban district councils.  I have found from discussions in many places that while the members of these councils are anxious to provide a supplementary grant, they find it difficult financially to do so and therefore the people in these areas are at a disadvantage as against people in the areas under the jurisdiction of the county council.  I do not know what the answer may be but I do suggest that some financial provision might be offered to the urban district council which, coupled with their contribution, might bring the supplementary grant up to the level of that offered in the county of which they are a part.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a section in which I have a particular interest.  Let me make it clear that on speaking on Section 10, there is no idea in my mind of crowing or of saying: &ldquo;Did I not tell you so?&rdquo; All I will say at this late stage is that if the Minister had told us a few months ago that he was prepared to include provision for loans to people living in vested cottages, the Bill over which we fought so hard would have been withdrawn without our dividing the House on it.  I am pleased to see that the Minister has seen fit to make this provision.  I appreciate the position of members of the Government Party, for many of whom I have always had nothing but the highest respect.  I realise they were speaking sincerely when saying they believed there was a need for loans in such cases.  I am not blaming any individual member.  We all know the rules of the Parties here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> There are times when our views may vary but I suppose the majority rules. I am glad the Minister now realises it is vitally important to be able to offer to the tenants of vested cottages, through the co-operation of the local authority, the advantage that should have been offered to them long before now in relation to the improvement of these houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the figure of 30,000 houses in need of repairs.  If the survey carried out in County Cork, making comparisons between the conditions of the various cottages vested over the past 10, 12 and 20 years, is taken into account in the list of houses in need of repairs, the Minister will find there is a very high percentage which, I am very glad to say, will be able to avail of loans for repairs.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides:</P>
    <P>A housing authority may, in accordance with a scheme approved of by the Minister, guarantee an advance or part of an advance by a building society, an assurance company, a bank or other industrial or commercial organisation...</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to inform the House what is meant by the words &ldquo;other industrial or commercial organisation&rdquo;.  Where a guarantee is offered, I can understand the reference to building society, insurance company or bank.  Perhaps I am suspicious but it seems rather vague as to who may be brought in.  Therefore, the Minister should clarify what is meant by these words.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also to give us a little information on Section 19 which provides that the Minister may allow a grant for a house which complies with his regulations but does not comply with local bye-laws. Normally we would not dispute about that but I am anxious to know the position.  Supposing a case arises where the local authority maintains that a person building or reconstructing his home has broken some local bye-law and the Minister considers that he has not broken the departmental regulations. When that person receives the final instalment of grant from the <Col N="2118" /> bank, will the local authority pay the supplementary grant?  This matter is serious enough to warrant the Minister clarifying it for us.  Deputies who are members of the local authority might have to argue at a meeting of the local authority in Cork about this provision.  The manager might insist that the person was not entitled to a supplementary grant because he had broken a bye-law and the Deputies, as members of the Oireachtas and also members of the local authority, might have to insist that as the person had received a local government grant, he should get the supplementary grant. For the benefit of Deputies who are members of local authorities and for the benefit of the officials of the local authority, I am anxious that this matter should be clarified.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is on the same lines as Section 19, with a slight variation.  It provides for the making of grants by the Minister notwithstanding non-compliance with a statute or statutory instrument.  That is not a case of a breach of some local bye-law but a case in which a plea of ignorance of departmental rules and regulations may be made.  This could be a very serious provision.  I am not concerned as to who may be Minister for Local Government.  I have tried to steer clear of any question of politics.  We are dealing with housing legislation.  If members who are now on my right were on my left, I would not blame them if they were suspicious of a Minister.  That can happen.  A person may break a departmental regulation and may, through some means or other, be able to convince the Minister that it was through ignorance of the law.  It is a dangerous provision that such a person could succeed in getting a grant.  I should like the Minister to clarify that matter also.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party regard housing legislation as being of vital importance to the people.  I regret that this Bill was not before us earlier solely for the reason that we would have had more time to discuss it.  It is being rushed Circumstances create the necessity to get this legislation through as quickly as possible because the Act should have been re-enacted at the end of <Col N="2119" /> March last.  We find it difficult to discuss the Bill in its entirety for the purpose of clarification.  I would ask that the points I have raised be dealt with by the Minister so as to help us in our approach to the Bill, which may facilitate the Minister in getting the Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are satisfied with the progress being made in some directions but are very disappointed that the grants have not been increased and that there is as yet no indication from the Government of a more modern and more realistic assessment of the costs on which grants are based.</P>

I remember the year 1956, for instance, when a councillor could not come outside the door of his house because of the number of people who were looking for housing grants and who could not get a penny.  The people who were in office then tell us today about the tremendous amount of building that was carried on in that period.  It may have been carried on &mdash; I am not saying it was not&mdash;but I would like somebody to specify where the building was carried out.  It was not carried out in Mayo. There were no housing grants paid in County Mayo during the calendar year 1956.  There is no use in saying otherwise. I agree that grants were paid during the financial year 1956-57 because there was a change of Government and as soon as that change of Government took place, grants were paid, in March, 1957.  No grants were paid in 1956 or in 1955.  I challenge anybody to give the figures for County Mayo.  The gentlemen who have the audacity to get up here and quote figures are trying to hoodwink the <Col N="2120" /> public but they are not hoodwinking me.</P>
    <P>I did think the repair and reconstruction grants would be somewhat increased.  To be quite candid about it, I thought the Minister more or less indicated over the last few months that these grants would be increased.  I would ask now that he should reconsider the position.  He should relate the grants to the increase in the cost of wages, salaries and materials which has taken place over the past two years.  He would be doing a very wise thing if he were to do that.  Undoubtedly the Minister would have the complete backing of this House if he were to increase the grants.  He would have the backing of his own Party and from what I have listened to during this debate, unless they are hypocrites, he would have the backing of the Opposition also.  Therefore I ask the Minister to review the grants and see if he can increase them.</P>
    <P>A very funny thing has happened, according to what I see here.  There has been a statutory income limit in regard to the payment of supplementary grants by local authorities for the building of houses but I understand there has not been any statutory income limit with regard to the payment of supplementary grants by local authorities for the reconstruction and repair of houses.  If that is so, how is it that local authorities have been enforcing an income limit?  I do not see why they should have done that and I think they are wrong to do it. Local authorities who have made a regulation enforcing an income limit in respect of the payment of supplementary grants for the reconstruction of houses should now pay out those grants to the people from whom they withheld them.</P>
    <P>As I see it, there is no statutory authority for doing that.  There is a statutory authority for an income limit with regard to new houses, but in my county it has happened that the local authority has enforced a regulation which does not exist and have withheld grants from people.  I ask the Minister to explain that.</P>
    <P>The local authority also acts in regard to the payment of water rate. <Col N="2121" /> As far as I know, the introduction of water and sewerage schemes, whether it be for big towns or small towns, is carried out as the result of the placing of a contract to do the work on a payment basis where the whole county puts up the money.  I wonder if, in those circumstances, the local authority could by any stretch of imagination have the authority to collect the water rate.  I do not think they have any right to do so.</P>

      <P>I suppose I can put in the water.  I do not agree with a house being built 100 feet from the water main and the people not being able to get the water in.  I think the Minister should come down to earth. For a long number of years past, all Ministers, in their wisdom or stupidity, have carried on the policy of giving grants for houses with three rooms. It is amazing the number of people in this country who do not want three rooms and, apart from that, who cannot afford them.  It is past time that the Minister had enough sense to see through that one.</P>
      <P>Surely there are in many parts of Ireland men and their wives who will only be in it for the next ten or 15 years.  They may not have a lot of money and they only want a room and kitchen, as we say in the country, which means two rooms.  If those people want houses with only two rooms, there should be grants available for them to build that type of house.  Surely it would not take any great imagination for a Minister to bring in a Bill which would provide such benefits.  When a man wants to build a house, he does not think in terms of square feet or cubic feet or any such nonsense.  What he wants is a house that will be reasonable and decent to meet his requirements. I suggest that the Minister go down among the ordinary people in the towns and on the small farms.  If he did that, he might come back to the House and provide a more sensible Bill than the one we are now discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a case of a man and his wife with two unmarried sisters or <Col N="2123" /> brothers &mdash; I cannot say which just now &mdash; who wanted to build a small house. Under this Bill, they are restricted from the point of view of grants to a structure of 510 square feet with three rooms.  What in the name of common sense would such a family do with such a house?  I would accordingly ask the Minister to think this matter over.  If a man and woman want to build a house in order to provide themselves with reasonable, decent accommodation, they should be eligible for grants, whether the house is three-roomed or two-roomed.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of thatched houses.  The Minister should make provision here for the payment of grants for either the building or the reconstruction of thatched houses. I can see no reason why in this country a man should be forced by law to slate his house.  We are living in a democratic country; people fought for the rights which we now enjoy, and yet we find that if we try to avail of those rights, there is legislation there to penalise us.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking state of affairs that a man is to be deprived of a grant just because he wants to live in a house with a thatched roof.  If a man has a thatched house already and wants to repair it, surely he should get a grant to carry out that work.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to travel through the West of Ireland where he will see some of the finest houses in the country and they are thatched.  He should adopt a common sense policy in these matters and ignore the nonsense which has been perpetuated in this House for over 40 years.  I feel sure that even Deputies in the Opposition benches will agree with me in that.</P>

      <P>Ba bhaith liom cúpla focail a rá ar an mBille seo.  At the outset, I wish to congratulate the Minister on its introduction and on the many new features it contains through which many problems in connection with housing throughout the country will be overcome.  The Government have an outstanding record in housing and this measure is but a <Col N="2124" /> continuation of their efforts to go ahead with the housing drive until every person who needs a decent home is provided with it.  They have already cleared the slums in the cities and in the towns but unfortunately there are still housing conditions in many rural areas which cause concern.</P>
      <P>Some of the new features in this Bill are particularly applicable to such areas.  They will serve to overtake the serious backlog in the provision of better housing conditions.  A house has always been regarded as a man's castle and it has been the policy of the Government not only to ensure that the people of the country have decent homes but also to see that they will become owners of these homes even if they are only cottages. I am therefore glad to see in this Bill provisions which will help people in the long run to buy out their houses and cottages and become owners of them.</P>
      <P>Despite what may have been said by the Opposition there is no doubt that there were grave financial difficulties from the point of view of housing in 1957 and 1956.  In the latter year, it was impossible for anyone in my constituency to get a grant, with the result that right in the middle of winter, a housing scheme collapsed completely for lack of funds.  There were so many useless credit notes flying around that merchants, already overloaded with orders and getting no money, were unwilling to supply materials.  The Local Loans Fund had not got any money to give to the local authority and the whole housing effort was impeded.  Local housing grants were stopped completely and this immediately finished the housing effort because if people were not able to get a local authority grant, the State grant available was not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of that period is still to be seen.  There are 146 people in that area who have not yet got their grants and this in turn has to a large extent discouraged people from seeking the benefits available under the Housing Acts. The position has recently changed because of the efforts of the Government and people have begun to avail of these grants in considerable numbers. <Col N="2125" /> Where new houses are concerned, I would ask the Minister, if at all possible, to publish a few designs so that people intending to build new houses will not be forced to go to some engineer or other person and pay anything up to £30 for a design which might have been just copied from a magazine &mdash; a design which the Department might not ultimately approve.  I know that there are certain provisions in the regulations but very often the ordinary countryman reconstructing his house has not that document available to him, or, if he has, he is unable to interpret it.  Consequently, he may have a plan which will not be sanctioned or which will qualify for only a reduced grant.</P>
    <P>The vocational schools could do more as far as housing is concerned, particularly in regard to reconstruction. In many areas, there are woodwork teachers and others qualified to go among the people and advise them on such matters as cutting a roof or putting in windows.  That might solve the difficulty often experienced of getting contractors to do work in isolated places.  Some prizes should be awarded for the manner in which grant type houses are kept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with this Bill.  It was generally expected that the grants for private persons building their own houses would be increased even a little because of the very steep increases, up to 300 per cent in some cases, in the cost of materials and labour since the housing grants were last increased. The Minister must have his tongue in his cheek when he says he has the interest of housing the people at heart. If that were the case, he should have <Col N="2126" /> increased the grants.  He definitely will not in this way reduce the drop in housing now evident since we were last in office.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about a class for which the Minister has made no provision. He paid a good deal of lip service to them in his opening speech. He said earlier:</P>
      <P>There are many persons living in unfit conditions who are not and are never likely to be in a position to rehouse themselves and whose needs cannot or are not being met by housing authorities.  Owing to such factors as the location of the houses and the age and circumstances of the occupants, local authorities cannot be expected to give a high priority to providing new houses for these classes.</P>
      <P>Later on, he referred to the housing survey taking place and said:</P>
      <P>In the last 30 years, the housing programme, particularly that portion of it undertaken by local authorities, has been more effective in urban than in rural areas where the current survey figures up to the present indicate that some 30,000 houses need to be repaired and 20,000 more require to be replaced. The full completion of the survey will not materially alter the overall picture of the problem presented by these figures.  The problem is a big one and obviously more difficult to solve than that section of the housing programme that has already been successfully implemented.</P>
      <P>Further on, he said:</P>
      <P>As Deputies familiar with rural conditions are aware, many elderly single persons or elderly couples with little or no resources or a short expectation of life without assured succession for occupation of their dwellings are the classes least inclined or able to do anything for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, it is part of the problem that local authorities are not universally disposed to regard this problem as part of their housing functions or, where they do accept some responsibility, they can give only a low priority to the re-housing <Col N="2127" /> of these classes, as compared with others seeking new housing.</P>
    <P>So far as legislative proposals can go, this Bill contains provisions specially designed to deal with the needs of the rural position.</P>
    <P>According to the survey, there are 1,400 unfit houses in County Mayo alone.  I have not the figures for the other counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a lot worse than I thought.  I can assure the Minister that, out of these 5,000, there must be many who will never be able to rehouse themselves.  One of the most serious complaints that can be made against the Minister is that he is not doing anything for these people.  In every county, there are people living in small holdings who have absolutely no money.  They are living in houses which in some instances are actually dangerous to live in.  The Land Commission has passed them by in the course of rearrangement or allotment and they probably cannot expect any help or a new house from that source.  People have come to me who have nothing spared and who are in bad health, bad health possibly caused or at least aggravated by the very poor type of house in which they have lived all their lives.  I almost feel like challenging a division on this Bill because no provision is made for that type of person.</P>
      <P>There is a still more deserving type of case.  I am sure every Deputy knows of young married men with two or three young children not yet of school-going age or with five or six children, some of them going to school.  They are living in a cottage consisting of a small kitchen and one room and perhaps not in a healthy situation.  No provision is being made for these people, either. The Minister has fallen down completely on his job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant of £300, or £310 through a building society, is absolutely inadequate.  When that £300 was first given through an Act of this House, it was possible, with the then cost of materials and labour, to build a nice, <Col N="2128" /> five-roomed house in my constituency for £900 or £950.  The same house today would cost £1,450.  Offering them a grant of £300 is like telling them they cannot build or else inviting them to put a debt around their necks they will probably never discharge.  I would go so far as to ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill in its present form and accept an amendment to make provision for the two classes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I shall tell the Minister exactly what shape the amended Bill should take. The Minister is bound to provide a house for these people in some way or other.  If these people are not able to help themselves in the building of a house, he should provide a suitable house for them and recover all or portion of the cost by way of a further annuity on the holding, or else he should make available a sufficient grant to meet the cost of the house. The Minister is fully aware of the situation because he referred earlier to &ldquo;single persons or elderly couples with little or no resources or a short expectation of life without assured succession for occupation of these dwellings&rdquo; as &ldquo;the classes least inclined or able to do anything for themselves.&rdquo;  It is a reflection on us that we allow these people to live out their days in what are little better than the kind of hovels that we read existed in the days of landlordism, while the Minister stands idly by.  Not alone that, but if I read his opening speech correctly, he is inclined to make a joke about it more than anything else.  We have gone a long way towards improving the health of our people by a vast expenditure of money and with the skill and goodwill of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister that I know several young married couples, who are not financially equipped to provide a house for themselves, and whose children cannot possibly grow up without contracting some kind of disease or ailment; at the very least, they will certainly not be as healthy and robust as they would be if they had a decent house in which to be reared.  Vast sums of money are spent on the eradicating of tuberculosis and various other diseases, on the one hand, and at the same time, we allow <Col N="2129" /> children to be reared in houses in which, except for the intervention of Divine Providence, they cannot escape disease.  I am not interested in the man who has the finances and who can, with the help of the £300 grant and the local authority grant, where such are given, build a house for himself. I am not concerned with him because he can help himself.  I am concerned for the old people and for the young parents struggling to rear a young family.  I might say that the latter are doing remarkably well in many cases in keeping their children fed and clothed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is treating this problem in a shocking fashion.  I know he will say that it is a tall order to ask him to build houses for these people.  I do not think it is.  Housing conditions are among the matters which have contributed more than anything else to the flight from the land all down through the years.  The Minister comes in now with a Bill in exactly the same terms as the Bill that was passed two years ago. There is not one single improvement in it.  I challenge him to show me any improvement in it.  He paid lip service in his opening speech to those who cannot help themselves, and all the rest of it, throwing out a hint that local authorities might possibly come to their assistance.  I think that kind of lip service borders on blackguardism. That is the only way I can describe it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this Bill contains provisions specially designed to deal with the needs of the rural areas. Would the Minister tell us what these provisions are?  I have gone through the Bill and through the Minister's speech and I certainly cannot find out what they are.  Is it that the Minister is in a mood to make a joke of people who cannot help themselves?  As I said a moment ago, in most cases the ill-health suffered by these is due to the fact that they have been reared in unhealthy, insanitary hovels.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the previous Bill, I asked the Minister what the position was with regard to the payment of grants.  He did not reply. Would the Minister mind taking this opportunity now to tell us exactly what the system of grants is?  Is it the £300 <Col N="2130" /> grant in the Second Schedule to the Bill before the House?  Does that include the water and sanitation grant to be paid by another section of his Department?  I asked the Minister that question during the passage of the earlier Bill.  He did not reply to it. Possibly he overlooked it.</P>
    <P>I almost feel like challenging a vote on this Bill because of the omissions. We have been waiting since last April for this Bill.  Everybody thought it was high time that increased grants were made available because of the high costs of labour and materials so that we might see the end of the problem of those people who are able and willing to build for themselves.  The Minister has come in once more with the old grant of three years ago.  Does the Minister realise that building materials have increased in some cases by as much as 300 per cent.?  In view of the way in which the Government have killed the housing programme, and in view of the money they have saved in the process, it is only fair now to give a decent improvement in the grant that has been payable for the past two years.</P>
    <P>There has been a serious drop in the number of houses being built by local authorities.  In the year 1954-1955, 5,267 houses were built.  Last year, only 1,238 were built.  That is almost down to one-fifth of the building that took place in 1954-1955.  The number of private houses dropped from 5,000 to 4,000.  The number employed on local authority housing in 1954-1955 was 6,056.  To-day it is 1,156.  These figures deserve a little more than the flippant treatment which Deputy Leneghan gave them.  These are figures of national importance. The Minister should tell us what exactly has happened to have brought these conditions about.  What is going wrong?  The old story that the inter-Party Government were not paying housing grants did its work and got its votes in 1957.  That story has been exploded now and, except for a very odd, innocent&mdash;I will not say half-witted &mdash; Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches, who thumps his chest and still believes it, it has been successfully exploded.  The serious aspect remains.  The whole building programme <Col N="2131" /> has collapsed in a heap of ruins.  That is something we cannot afford to ignore, treat as a joke, or a matter for banter in this House.</P>

      <P>I have waited a long time for this Bill.  I have had constituents making inquiries about this Bill months ago.  Everybody knew that this Bill comes before the House periodically.  The term of the last Bill expired in March.  I was under the impression the Government had a Bill ready and that it would be introduced at the first opportunity as soon as March was out.  We are now in the month of July.  I put it to the Minister that was not good business.  It was not good administration.  Neither does it show that the Minister has any great concern for the people all over the country who are interested in building their own houses or in the local authorities who are interested in building houses for the working classes.</P>
      <P>The biggest disappointment about this Bill is the statement in the explanatory memorandum which says that State grants are being preserved at their existing levels.  Everybody expected the grants would be increased. That seemed the most obvious thing, remembering the enormous increase in the cost of building.  I have been told that a few years ago a house could be built for about £2 per square foot to the standards and specification demanded by the Department of Local Government.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We were building houses under the Small Dwellings Acts in Waterford.  The people paid £100, went into them and they are paying £80 a year and rates. There is a group of young people working in various factories who banded themselves together and approached the corporation for a site. They were waiting and hoping they would get an increased grant and then they would go on with the building of houses.  I do not know what they will say when they see this but the houses they would build and the cost for a skimped-down, in my opinion, specification, not as good as the specification of the houses that were built heretofore, would be around £3 a week. Everybody in the country knows that the over-all cost of building has gone up considerably.  That is not the Minister's fault.  That is just a fact and it is a fact that should be faced.

      <P>The Deputy should take care he does not have a strong deputation going from my constituency not alone to ask him how to do it but to give him a contract to do the job.  There is a great deal of talk about figures here.  I have often asked the Minister for figures and of course when we get figures in the House, we take it for granted they are correct.  I have got figures from the Minister for housing in Waterford city and I cannot <Col N="2133" /> make head or tail of them.  I have come to the conclusion that it would be hard for the Minister to make head or tail of what happens up and down the country, if the figures he has given for other parts of the country are similar to those for Waterford city.</P>
      <P>I had a Question down to the Minister on 22nd May, 1962, asking him to state the number of new houses completed in Waterford city in each of the years since 1948 to 1961 inclusive.  I stress &ldquo;the number of new houses completed&rdquo;.  The Minister told me the reply was in the form of a tabular statement which would be published in the Official Report.  The tabular statement was handed to me and it then appeared in the Official Report. It gave a series of extraordinary figures especially in respect of 1956 and 1957. It said that in 1955-56 the number completed was 130; in 1956-57, it was 271; in 1957-58, 220; in 1958-59, 208; in 1959-60, 503; and in 1960-61, 157. I would give a lot of money and burn a lot of incense if these figures were true but I had a letter on 30th May which said:</P>
      <P>I am directed by Mr. Neil T. Blaney, Minister for Local Government, to inform you that it has come to his notice that in the course of a reply which he gave to the Question asked by you in Dáil Éireann on 22nd May, 1962, regarding the number of houses completed in Waterford the figures given for the years 1957/58; 1958/59; 1959/60 and 1960/61 inadvertently included the numbers of reconstruction grants paid instead of those for new house grants.  This resulted in the figures shown for these years being much greater than the correct figures.  The correct figures in respect of the four years in question should have been as follows:</P>

    <P>I put down another Question for answer on 7th June and clearly asked for details in respect of the years 1948 to 1961 inclusive.  I asked in <Col N="2134" /> relation to Waterford city (1) the number of new houses (a) completed, (b) completed by the local authority, and (c) built by private builders, and (2) the number of houses for which the Department paid out reconstruction grants.  I was told that for the years 1956-57 the total number completed by the local authority and by private persons with the aid of State grants was 271, that the number completed by the local authority was 130 and that 141 were built by private persons.  In 1958-59, 111 were completed by the local authority and by private persons with the aid of State grants; 75 were completed by the local authority, 36 by private persons and 133 reconstruction grants.  In 1959, 367 were completed altogether, 348 by the local authority, 19 by private persons with the aid of State grants, and there were 155 reconstruction grants. In 1960-61, 42 was the total of new houses completed; 31 were completed by the local authority and 11 by private persons.  There were 126 reconstruction grants.</P>
    <P>The House may think I am being very tortuous about this but the extraordinary thing is that I have a letter from the housing officer in the Waterford Corporation.  I asked him the same question as I asked the Minister.  He replied to me on 13th June as follows:</P>
    <P>The figures of Grants for Private House building as quoted you by the Department approximate very closely to ours for the various years.</P>
    <P>The following is a break-down of the figures for houses &ldquo;provided by the Corporation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Department insist that houses owned by Corporation and reconstructed by us, and on which the Department pays subsidy should be returned as &ldquo;houses provided&rdquo; even though the houses were already occupied.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2135" /> For 1958-59, there were 75 houses newly built by the Corporation.  That is the correct figure, the figure the Minister gave me.  For 1959-60, there were 22 houses built by the Corporation and the figure for those completed by the local authority is 348.  I thought that perhaps the Department or the Minister were mixing up the reconstruction grants with the 348.  I find that he told me that 345 reconstruction grants were paid that year.  I discovered from an official of the Waterford Corporation that from 1952 to 1957 and included now as &ldquo;houses provided&rdquo;, the total was 326.  There is a total given here of 348 and that is given for one year.  These figures are haywire.  If the Minister is getting figures like these supplied to him, I wonder if he has a true picture of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I have often said in places where discussions took place on housing, before I came into the Dáil, and many people said the same thing, that the cost of site development is very high and is included in the all-in cost of the house.  We must bend our energies to securing a reduction in the overall cost.  The Minister is maintaining grants at the old level.  I am sure I am not alone in believing that he should increase the grant substantially. I also consider that the Minister should examine the idea of giving unemployment grants for the development of sites for houses.  The Minister, in my opinion, could give 100 per cent. grants in respect of roads that have to be made when new houses are built on virgin soil.  Such grants could be provided out of the Road Fund.  These roads are just as important to the people as main or county roads are. In connection with such roads in Waterford city, I submit that we should be entitled to get a special grant, in view of the fact that in ten years we paid over £500,000 in road tax and got back only £40,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister says on page 4 of his brief that payments of the grants will be made subject to regulations.  Regulations have surrounded housing development and reconstruction grants <Col N="2136" /> as a sort of bureaucratic quagmire which keeps spreading, making it more difficult for the ordinary person or the local authority to get through.</P>
    <P>Recently I was shown an interesting cartoon depicting an old man who had been put in charge of the Local Government Board.  It was a very old cartoon.  The caption said that the Local Government Board was a government board that had been set up to do away with local government. Eighty years ago, that was presented as a joke but that is what has happened local government.  It has happened in the matter of housing that local authorities and local officials are so fettered by regulations that production of houses is slowed down and the whole business of the purchase of sites and the drawing of plans is delayed. The plans and specifications when drawn are sent on the long, long trail to the Department and they pass up and down between the Department and the local authority.  I believe the Minister is a man who would like to cut his way through that quagmire.  I would suggest to him that a predecessor of his asked local authorities if they were satisfied with the managerial system and every one of them said they were.  I do not agree with them but they are entitled to their opinion. The managerial system is in operation and the manager is a chief executive officer.  He rates even higher.  He is appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners and has to be a man of great qualifications.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he hopes to have an up-to-date consolidated code for local authorities. That is on page 11.  I am not saying anything about the managers.  I am merely talking about the system.  There is the local authority with its manager and the officials.  The officials are all people appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  They are all well qualified.  All those groups come together to consider a housing scheme and everything they do must be sent up to the Department for <Col N="2137" /> sanction.  I put it to the Minister that in relation to the new code he is to introduce he could make the whole business airtight.  He should give the local authorities power &mdash; the elected representatives of the council, the managers and the officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say Deputy Breslin comes from Donegal.  If the officials and the manager prepare plans and specifications for a housing scheme, those plans and specifications are drawn according to the standards laid down by the Department in regard to the thickness of walls, roof, and so on.  I have no fault to find with those standards.  I suggest that the manager and the officials should submit the plans and specifications to the council and if the council, the manager and the officials are agreed that the housing scheme is O.K., there should be no more about it and tenders should be invited.  If a mistake were made by the local authority you can be assured that there would be no need for the Minister or the Department to come down and start screaming holy horror at them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, they should be allowed to advertise straight away and if there was a mistake and <Col N="2138" /> the housing scheme was not what it should be, there would be no necessity for the Department or the Minister to come down on them.  The sovereign people of Ireland would cry holy horror on them.</P>
      <P>I welcome that section of the Bill that offers encouragement to architects to produce a prototype house.  I compliment the Minister on that &mdash; it is a very good idea.  It will give young architects a chance to produce something that has not been done before. I should say that a lot of this town planning being done in the country is nonsense because much of it is being done from a distance, from Dublin.  A good deal of that work should be left to the local engineers, and also the planning and layout of the houses. The local engineers are vulnerable to the manager, to the council and to the people around them.</P>
      <P>If this matter were left to them, if they were told that there was the housing scheme and there was the field and to go ahead, I have no hesitation in saying that in every case the engineering officers are quite capable and competent of producing the plans without having to submit them to the Department all the time.  If the Minister would do that, he would cut a way through the jungle of green tape and through the quagmires in which local authorities find themselves when they start out on a housing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure there are many Deputies listening to me who have had the experience of attending a local authority meeting and hearing a lot of talk that a housing scheme is to be undertaken. Sometimes one would be optimistic enough to say that the houses would be built in a year or two but, in fact, 12 or 18 months pass and the draft plan is produced.  That disappears up to the Department of Local Government and it is a miracle if it comes back in two or three months and if it is all right.  You then advertise for tenders and you have to wait for another while.  I exhort the Minister to reduce the time it takes to promote, plan and build houses in any part of the country.  I am sure that all my colleagues listening to me agree with me because when <Col N="2139" /> they do not agree with me, they interrupt me.</P>
    <P>I hope it will not be very long before the Minister brings before the House the legislation to codify the Housing Acts.  I hope that when he is putting that legislation to the House, he will remember what I have told him regarding the giving of power to local authorities in this matter.  When I say local authorities, I mean the elected representatives of the people, with the managers and the officials. When they come together and put up a scheme that is passed by the council, there should be no further question of sending that to the Department.  It should be advertised right away for tenders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that I welcome this measure but I must go further and say that it has been somewhat of a disappointment to me, not for what it contains but for what it does not contain.  The Minister has promised us this legislation for quite a time now and personally I was led to believe that the delay was due to the fact that he intended to introduce some really worthwhile changes.  Let that not detract from my welcome of the Bill because it is an improvement and anything that makes for improved facilities for the building of more houses should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I do not think we should be too carried away in our enthusiasm for the Bill because there are people who believe that the encouragement of private building is of far greater value than it actually is.  While this Bill does improve the situation as far as private building and repair are concerned, the overall problem of providing houses for the working classes is still here with us to a very great degree.  There is still a great need for local authorities, with the assistance and cooperation of the Minister, to provide more and more houses for those who are deemed to be the working class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the surveys that have been and are being carried out by local authorities.  I <Col N="2140" /> must confess that it is difficult to know how some of the local authorities have arrived at the figures which they have submitted to the Minister. This housing survey has not been completed by all local authorities but some information has been sent to the Minister.  He was asked a Parliamentary Question the other day by Deputy Clinton about the surveys that had been carried out in certain counties and I was amazed at the reply he gave &mdash; at the figures contained in that reply.  In fact I wondered if there was not a printing error in the Official Report for 4th July last at column 1470 where we had information in respect of Mayo that the total number of unfit dwellings in the county council area, apart altogether from the urban areas, was 4,894.  I do not know whether the Minister remembers that figure or not.  I assume it is correct since I have not been corrected. It is a shocking performance and is a serious reflection on us all.</P>

In any case, we public representatives, particularly those of us who are members of local authorities, do not need to rely on figures because the evidence is there for us that there are many houses needed, both in rural and urban areas. Representatives are approached from time to time by people who are in need of accommodation and I venture to say that over the past seven, eight or nine years, we have the same number of people asking us to see what can be done to get them suitable accommodation. It would not be an unfair remark to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree the Minister is not alone to blame for bad housing conditions in Wexford, Donegal, Meath, Mayo and elsewhere.  There is a responsibility on the local authorities, on the county officials, but I also suggest there is a responsibility on the Minister.  I think a better example of encouragement in this respect by a Minister could not be found than that set by the late Deputy T.J. Murphy. There was a situation in this country in 1948 when something like 100,000 houses were needed, and by his personal efforts, activity and energy in going around to visit the worst areas, to encourage the local officials and the local authority members, he got a tremendous number of houses built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not giving sufficient encouragement and many of the local authorities feel annoyed and frustrated by the attitude of the Minister and of the Department.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer now to another problem.  I have already mentioned it to the Minister, but I do not know what powers, if any, he has in respect to it.  We can all see that over the years many of our people have had to go to Britain to seek employment. There are many examples of men and their wives going to England to look for work and from whom the local authorities are demanding possession of their houses.</P>
      <P>I think I could present the case better if I cited the example of a couple who had been in occupation of a cottage for over 30 years.  The man found he could not get constant employment in his own area.  He was forced to go to Britain and eventually was fortunate enough to be able to take his wife across.  Now the local authority have proceeded to look for the tenancy of the cottage.  I believe greater consideration should be given to such cases because the majority of those forced to go away in order to find employment always keep in their minds the intention of returning to Ireland as soon as the opportunity presents itself or as soon as they can get employment here.  We hope that many of them will come back.  If the local authorities now proceed to take the tenancies of these cottages from them, the local authorities and the Minister will have a further problem when they do in fact come back.  It is not good enough to be taking the cottages from these people who intend to return to their own localities as soon as they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention a few particular points in connection with this measure, which we welcome for the improvements it contains.  Most Deputies who have spoken have expressed their disappointment at the fact that no increase in the grants has been announced.  I wonder whether or <Col N="2144" /> not the Minister can by regulation increase the grants from time to time, if he and the Government so desired? That was one of the disappointments for the ordinary public.  Having said that, it ought to be said also that over the years Irish Governments have generally been pretty generous in the matter of providing State assistance for private building.  We are inclined to make comparisons with other countries in respect of other things in order to demonstrate how backward we are.  If the facts were known, however, I believe it could be proved that Ireland ranks pretty high in the matter of State assistance for private housing.  However, there is a case in present circumstances, in view of the pattern of assistance we have had, to increase the grants on this occasion, especially when it is recognised that the cost of materials and wages has gone up considerably in recent years.</P>
    <P>One might criticise the estimates made by the Minister's Department in respect of house building, repair and reconstruction.  To say the least, they seem to be very conservative indeed. Many people, even with the assistance of the grant, find it difficult, if not impossible, to complete the work within the figure laid down by the officials of the Department.  One is forced to ask: on what basis are these costs made?  Is there any periodic review of them?  If not, there should be.  The schedule of prices used seems to have been used for far too long.</P>
    <P>In Section 3, there is a stipulation that the reconstruction or repair work must put the house into perfect condition. The Minister should appreciate that there are people who want to do necessary repairs, say, on a roof or a gable end, and who want to do that work only.  But when the inspector comes along, on the instructions of the Minister, of course, he insists that a certain amount of extra work must be done before the grant can be given. The Minister should ask his inspectors to relax a little in that respect.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong in this, but my experience has been that in the rural areas it is possible for an applicant to obtain an instalment of a grant when approximately half the work is done. <Col N="2145" /> That is a tremendous help.  But my information is that in the urban areas, no such instalment is given.  The work must be completed before there is any question of any money being paid at all.  There may be a particular case for the payment of instalments in the rural areas.  If there is, I suggest that the working people in the towns and cities who avail of these grants should also be entitled to obtain an instalment of approximately half the grant when roughly half the work has been completed.</P>
    <P>Again, in this matter of putting the house into a fit condition, in many cases this means they require the house to be practically rebuilt.  I can understand perfectly the intention of the Minister and his officials in insisting that a certain amount of work be done. I would suggest, however, that in many cases they are so strict that the work cannot be carried out by people of very little means.</P>
    <P>Section 5 might be described as an excellent section.  Where the owner or tenant of a house cannot reconstruct, it allows the local authority to step in and do so, but it applies only to rural areas.  I take grave exception to this.  The Minister ought to extend the provisions of the section to the urban areas.  It would be a tremendous advantage to this extent.  In every town in the country, there is a portion regarded as the old part of the town for which the citizens have a great deal of regard.  Every Deputy from a town will have places in mind.  I have in mind a place in my own town.  The majority of the owners and tenants in these places are not in a position to put their houses into proper condition. The local authorities in urban areas should be allowed to repair these houses so as to preserve the character of the old localities of which the people are so proud.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that or else say why this provision applies to rural areas only?</P>
    <P>All of us will welcome the basic idea behind Section 6.  That is a proposal to enable an authority, not a local authority or a housing authority, to build houses for elderly persons such <Col N="2146" /> as pensioners.  The Minister will have to be a little more explicit when speaking about this section again. That facility should be extended to the local authorities.  Wexford town, in which I live, is one of the eight largest towns in Ireland.  Frankly, Wexford Corporation could not in present circumstances engage in such a proposal. I assume, therefore, that towns of from 3,000 to 8,000 population would not be able to avail of these facilities, either.  Therefore, I think the Minister should seriously consider affording this type of financial assistance to the housing authorities in order that they may engage in the building of housing for elderly persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider what seems to be a forgotten section, as far as housing is concerned.  I refer to young married couples.  All of us appreciate the tremendous difficulties there are in the matter of housing accommodation for married couples. In many of our towns, the greatest number of houses are owned by the local authority.  The situation seems to be &mdash; it is a situation with which the Minister is very conversant &mdash; that the son or daughter of a local authority tenant marries.  Because there is no accommodation available, the young couple go to live with the father of the bride or the father of the bridegroom. They have a very slim chance of being housed by the local authority because, if they are offered another local authority house, only a third of the subsidy is paid on it.  There may be some qualifications to that but, broadly speaking, that is the position generally.  It is a pathetic situation when a young family comes along and there are two families living in a relatively small house with only two or three bedrooms.  Very of ten, the father and mother and two or three children have to sleep in the one bed.</P>
    <P>Again, I appreciate there are difficulties but I think the Minister could, under this section, help not alone in relation to the pensioners, or elderly persons, but also in relation to the young married couples.  He should extend this section to provide that a housing authority will get financial assistance to build houses for young married couples.  Then, there could <Col N="2147" /> later be a sort of swop with elderly parents whose children have married and gone out into other houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, in any case, make an effort to see that married couples are provided for.  They do not seem to be anybody's responsibility at the moment.  In a town like Wexford, or a similar town, if a couple marry, they have not a chance of a house until they have three or four children.  I know the situation here in Dublin is even worse.  The fact that they have to live with their in-laws, and with their young family, in one or two rooms, does not do married life much good.  In some cases, the situation is so bad that the marriage is broken up.  I do not hold the Minister responsible for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should make an effort to see that something is done for young married couples. Would he also consider what can be done to assist small urban authorities in the matter of supplementary grants? Because the functional area of the county council is so big, and the county council is relatively wealthier than the small urban area, it can afford to give supplementary grants for the building and reconstruction of houses.  The urban councils and small corporations, because their finances are so limited, cannot avail of the legislation which permits them to pay supplementary grants.  I am sure the Minister has considered this problem. Perhaps he and his officials could try to devise some scheme whereby assistance would be given by the State to small urban councils and corporations to allow them to give supplementary grants similar to those given in the big cities and the county council areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in the Labour Party, welcome Section 10 because, despite the heated arguments that ensued here when the Labour Party introduced its Private Members Bill two or three weeks ago, we are glad to note now, even though it is belated, that the Minister has accepted the proposal and the principle <Col N="2148" /> enshrined in that measure.  We believe that is an advance.  Many cottages are now being vested in tenants in the rural areas and they will be enabled by this provision to improve their houses and keep them in proper repair, thereby preventing rural slums developing in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In Section 10, there is another provision that I personally welcome.  It is the provision in subsections (5) and (6) which provides that, when a local authority is forced to take over possession of a house which is still on loan, some payment may be made to the owner.  That is only fair.  In many cases, the owner who borrowed from the local authority has made an effort and repaid over many years a good deal of the money.  If he falls on bad times and the local authority is forced to take possession, it is just not good enough that they should take the house and leave the man with nothing.  This provision provides, if I read it correctly, that the local authority will be empowered in such cases to compensate the owner dispossessed by them.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the object of Section 22 is.  It is somewhat vague.  It seems to me the section allows the Minister to do almost anything.  I do not take exception to that, but I think he should place on the records of this House the reason that induced him to introduce this section because it does confer tremendous power, a power which he, perhaps, would not abuse but which some of his successors might possibly abuse.  It seems to provide that the Minister may, in cases neither described nor determined, allow a grant.  In all fairness, he should give some examples of the circumstances under which an applicant will be let through, so to speak.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to ask the Minister if there is any scheme, or if he contemplates any scheme, to compensate local authorities for the reduction in valuation on new and reconstructed houses.  The fact that there are such generous rebates means there is less revenue for the local authorities. Houses being demolished and rates being discontinued, new houses being built and rates not paid in full for a <Col N="2149" /> period of, I think, ten years is a second cause of loss to local authorities.  The Minister has, I believe, returns from the local authorities showing the losses that have been incurred over the years by reason of the reduction in valuation on new and reconstructed houses.  Perhaps he would say in his concluding speech whether or not it is possible or whether or not he intends to assist in the matter of rates lost by reason of legislative proposals in various Housing Bills.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonorMaryCrowley" hpid="Mrs. Crowley Mrs. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, I think this Housing Bill will be very useful in many ways to people who want to build their own houses.  For one thing, it is a good idea there is no longer a two-year limit on Housing Bills.  I find, and probably other Deputies find also, that anyone who wants to build a house will not do it just before the end of the two-year period because he thinks if he does, he may lose grants or that there may be something new in the new Housing Bill.  Therefore, people will go ahead now and build the houses knowing there is no end, as it were, to the existing housing legislation.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that under the Bill the Minister intends to be very strict about giving grants for a new house, if it is not serviced with water and sewerage.  Within the past few years, most people have realised that water and sewerage are a very essential part of a house &mdash; even as essential as the roof.  I hope that as far as possible the Minister will insist that where there is a new house built, it shall have both water and sewerage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another good provision in the Bill is that the supplementary grants have now an extended upper limit.  Recently owing to the fact that wages have increased, a number of people I know of could not avail of the council supplementary grant because their wage was too high.  These were people who would be entitled to a council cottage but who thought it would be quicker to build a house for themselves. They built a house and then could not get a grant.  I am glad that limit has been raised and also that the councils will be able to make supplementary <Col N="2150" /> grants under schemes of their own.  The £80 grant to make old houses habitable is a very good and very original idea and will save local authorities many headaches.</P>
    <P>I expect every member of a local authority has cases where there is perhaps a woman living alone; she does not want to go into another house and live with her relatives but wants to stay where she is.  However, she cannot afford to do up the house; the roof or the walls may be bad.  If a grant is given by the Department and if the local authority can also do up the house, that person will be in a really habitable house.  If she had to wait for a council cottage, being a single person, she could wait for a very long time and possibly never get a house.  That is a very good scheme and I hope the Minister will not be too strict about the amount of work which has to be done on this house in order to qualify for the grant.  If the house is made habitable without any trimmings, so to speak, if it is weatherproof, I hope he will allow the grant to be given.</P>
    <P>In regard to houses for elderly persons, that is also a very good new provision in this Bill.  I hope that benevolent societies will take up the idea and build these houses.  As in the case of the grant for the type of house I have referred to, these elderly people would have to wait years before they could get a council cottage because there are very few local authorities that would be willing to build a four-roomed council cottage for two people, perhaps a husband and wife.  If benevolent societies or other people would build these houses for elderly persons, they would be doing a really valuable thing for the country.  There are many people who are waiting for houses and who will have to wait a long time until something like this is done.</P>
    <P>In this regard, however, I think it would be much better if these houses were not built in groups just for elderly people on the outskirts of towns or villages but if they were built, as it were, in and out of a town or village so that the elderly people would be in touch with the younger people.  If elderly people are all together, it is not good for them.  It would be much <Col N="2151" /> more cheerful for them to see younger people around them.  I do not like the idea of just having a group of perhaps ten elderly people, all together just looking at each other, but that, I expect, will have to work itself out.</P>
    <P>The last item I want to mention is the experimental houses.  This also is a very original idea and I hope it will encourage people to build these experimental houses.  The house plans now brought out by the Department are much too elaborate for the ordinary person building in the rural areas. When they come to me saying they want to build a new house and ask me to get a plan from the Department, I get it for them; it costs only a shilling or two, but invariably when they take it to their builder, the builder says it is much too expensive.  They do not get the Department's plan therefore but pay something like £10 or £20 to an architect to design a plan for them which works out cheaper in the end. If these new experimental houses are a success, this part of the Bill will be well worth while.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have the accent not only on the cost of these houses, which I hope will be cheap, but also on the design.  Council cottages are well designed and we do not want to have houses for private people inferior to those.  So often when the thing is cheap, it looks cheap so when the Minister is giving grants for these houses, I hope he will insist that they will be pleasant to look at.  What I have always been hoping for &mdash; and I mentioned it some time ago &mdash; is that we would be able to have our own design for a house.  On the Continent and the rest of the world, every country has its own special house design.  Sometimes it concerns only the roof, like Japan.  Everybody knows what a Japanese house looks like because the roof is different; the French house has shutters and the German house has something else. We do not seem to have anything that distinguishes our houses as Irish.  If the designers of these experimental houses would concentrate on creating something that looks Irish and that will always be recognised as Irish, we <Col N="2152" /> can then be proud of the houses that are built by people for their own occupation and by county councils as well.</P>

      <P>This House could not be dealing with any matter of greater importance or greater urgency than the housing of our people.  I have been wondering whether before the Minister introduced this Bill his Department had gone to the trouble of conducting a national survey of the housing needs in each county.  The Housing Section of the Department have been doing a reasonably good job of work.  They have contributed very generously towards the erection of new houses and, particularly, in the administration of the existing scheme of grants for erection and reconstruction of houses.  I have felt, however, that the section might be better staffed.  There appears to have been in the past some degree of delay in the carrying out of inspections for the purpose of grants for new houses and reconstruction.  I have been wondering whether it has been penny wise and pound foolish for the Minister to restrict the staffing of this section of the Department.  I would recommend that, irrespective of cost, the section should be well staffed with officers and engineers so that the many housing problems affecting the people might be dealt with speedily.</P>
      <P>The volume of applications for reconstruction and new house grants has been steadily increasing.  Therefore, if there is a shortage of inspectors or engineers, steps should be taken to bring the staff up to sufficient strength to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>I was rather disappointed when this Bill was circulated.  I expected that there would have been provision in it for the establishment of statutory housing committees for each local authority. I was expecting that the elected representatives on the councils would have been given additional powers in relation to housing.  The work of county councils has increased considerably and we find that because of the problems in relation to roads, hospitals and health coming within the sphere of local authorities, the primary responsibility of local authorities in relation to housing seems to be placed in the background.  That is why I was expecting that the Minister would have done something in this regard.  The Minister should provide for the setting up of such committees who should be appointed by the county council for each county.  Such housing committees would be charged with the responsibility of housing and for placing before county councils, as a guide, proposals for housing schemes and whatever other proposals they might have in relation to loans under the Small Dwellings Act or any other scheme of grants in operation.</P>
      <P>The county managers, county engineers and county medical officers of health do not appear to be working with a degree of efficiency or speed and there appears to be considerable overlapping in many cases in the functions of these officers.  That is why I feel that in order to bring about a greater degree of efficiency and speed, statutory housing committees should have been appointed.  The Minister should consider this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the General Council of County Councils, with which, no doubt, the Minister is very familiar. An expression of opinion should have been obtained from that body, prior to the introduction of any new housing Bill.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether the officers of his Department or he at any time asked the local authorities for an expression <Col N="2154" /> of their views in relation to the question of housing.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are members of local authorities &mdash; and they are over three-fourths of the membership of this House &mdash; know that while there has been a great degree of progress in the housing of our people in recent years, there still appears to be a tremendous volume of work yet to be accomplished in that regard.  No doubt, many Deputies have expressed their views on the question of the housing of old people.  There are many cases in every county and every urban area of old age pensioners or old people who have no prospect of qualifying for a local authority house.  If the national housing survey I have suggested were carried out, it would reveal that there is an enormous number of elderly people who do not enjoy the independence of their own home.</P>
    <P>An enormous problem faces the country in relation to the housing of newlyweds.  The leader of the Labour Party certainly does not exaggerate the position when he says that in every part of the country there is a very serious problem in that regard.  Many newlyweds must either take a room in a council house or go to live with relatives or friends, or take a flat. They cannot hope to be relieved of the inconvenience of having to live in a flat or rooms until they have a family of two, three or four children. That situation has presented every local authority with a great deal of difficulty.  Now that we are moulding housing legislation for the future, special provision should be made for the housing of newlyweds.</P>
    <P>I am sure the problem is grave in the city of Dublin and in every other city but I am familiar with the very distressing problem in the towns of Birr and Tullamore where the local authorities have undertaken the housing of the people to a reasonably good extent.  We find that in practically every council house in Tullamore and Birr, there is living as a sub-tenant the married son or the married daughter and when that person applies to the local authority to be rehoused, he cannot be considered for accommodation by the local authority <Col N="2155" /> simply because he is living as a sub-tenant in a council house.  That is unfair to the council, unfair, certainly, to the applicant who finds himself in that position.  Where is such a person expected to live if there is a shortage of houses?  Is it not only to be expected that the first to come to the rescue of the married son or daughter will be the father or mother?  There are many cases throughout the country.</P>

      <P>With regard to the increase in the grant for the reconstruction of houses, I feel I am entitled to express my keen disappointment. Having regard to the fact that the cost of materials has considerably increased, that the cost of labour is now much higher, that the cost of all requirements for the building of additional rooms or for the removal of existing roofs and their replacement by new roofs has increased I feel that the grants are not nearly sufficient.  I had expected that the system of grants at present in operation would have been doubled under this Bill and I am very disappointed that there is no special provision in the Bill substantially increasing the amount paid by way of grant to private individuals for the reconstruction of their houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the small farmer may be described as a private individual but there is nothing in this Bill which will help him to provide his own house.  Most of the small farmers cannot find sufficient money to supplement the grants given by the Department and in parts of the country many of them are so poor that they are not accepted as sufficiently sound to qualify for a loan. Throughout the length and breadth of the country, an enormous number of hovels are still in existence.  We all know that there are many small farmers who would qualify to be housed by the local authority but, because of the increased pressure on local authorities from urban areas, it is impossible to promote schemes for the erection of houses for small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has now come when the State should erect a house for every small farmer and let them pay back the local authority, or the Department, or whoever else is responsible, the cost <Col N="2158" /> of the house in the form of an annuity payable yearly or half-yearly.  We are just tinkering with the problem of housing our people in rural Ireland and it will never be solved until the small farmers are taken out of the thatched, mud-walled cabins in which many of them still have to exist in many parts of this country.  They have not already provided themselves with houses because they have not got the financial backing.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not help those people. There is nothing in it which will help to provide them with new houses. Surely, in 1962, when the Government speak of all their great housing achievements and when we see so many rat-infested hovels in which people are forced to live under the most degrading conditions, under conditions which one would not see in any civilised country in the world, when every county medical officer of health can report that there are houses in which seven people sleep in one room, all over 14 years of age, of both sexes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Getting back to the Bill and to the housing of our people, this measure will not improve the position in any degree whatsoever and I should like to hear from the Minister why he has not proposed in this Bill to increase housing grants. They have not got the money.  Those are the people who, when the inter-Party Government were in office, talked about our having to scrape the bottom of the pot.  How has the position changed now?  Fianna Fáil Deputies were very vocal about housing conditions when we were in office. Why are they not proposing to spend all the money on housing they said they would?  There were to be generous grants for any person who wanted to build his own house.  There was to be an endless supply of money for the reconstruction and repair of houses.  It was part of their policy to provide houses for old age pensioners.  How are we to provide a house at £300?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the <Col N="2160" /> Deputy will tell us how to build a house for £600.  The Bill does not provide any definition of an elderly person.  Is an elderly person a person of 60 or of 80 or of 90 for the purposes of this section?  How are the local authorities and the Minister to determine what an elderly person is, seeing that no age limit has been suggested in this Bill?  There is nothing to stop any of us who have reached middle age from describing ourselves as elderly people.  I suppose this to be like many other Acts brought in by the Government. Paper never refuses ink and this paper is only for use by them on the platforms and at the church gates. Of course these people will never qualify for these grants.  There will be inspectors down from the Department to try to determine their age, to look at their marriage certificates, their birth certificates, their parents' birth certificates and marriage certificates. There will be inquiries, certificates to be filled by peace commissioners and Gardaí.  Parish priests and rectors will be pulled into it, and every other kind of certifying and verifying officer, to decide what an elderly person is.  Perhaps the Minister would explain now.</P>
      <P>I had expected that in this Bill there would have been a section to provide a scheme of grants so that persons with large families could provide themselves with special houses.  I had expected there would be in it a very generous scheme of reconstruction grants to assist people to reroof their houses.  The amount provided under this Bill will not give any measure of assistance to such people.  There is no man more highly qualified to speak on those problems than the Minister who must be aware that there are numerous applicants for reconstruction grants who never carry out the work after the estimate is obtained.  I should like to hear from him what these figures are because in my own constituency and outside it, I know of many instances where applicants have been unable to meet the high cost of reconstruction. If they could not meet it in the past, how can they meet it now?  This Bill does nothing for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also felt that where cases of overcrowding could be certified by the local <Col N="2161" /> authority, the office of the local authority could be used to obtain a report from the county medical officer of health for any private individual who wanted an inspection carried out for the purpose of making a case for special consideration to the Department. Overcrowding exists to a very great degree in rural Ireland, right down from Leitrim to Limerick, along the shores of the Shannon.  I was expecting there would be some generous scheme in this Bill, whereby sufficient funds would be made available to enable those people to house themselves. I am extremely disappointed at the terms of the Bill in that regard.  It is just another bit of patchwork, as far as housing legislation is concerned. The Minister has lost a golden opportunity of doing something towards solving our housing problem for all times.</P>
    <P>I was expecting there would have been some section in this Bill in regard to the rates of interest on loans for the erection or reconstruction of houses.  The present rates of interest are extraordinarily high.  In order to solve the housing problem, one would expect to see in this Bill measures of a revolutionary character in regard to interest rates.  The one way of encouraging and assisting people in the matter of housing is by making available loans at special low rates of interest.  If that were done, I would venture to say that the present demands on local authorities would be eased considerably.  Instead of expecting local authorities to provide houses for people who can provide them for themselves, the Minister should have availed of this golden opportunity of helping to solve the housing problem. Before this Bill becomes law, he should have provision made for special low rates of interest for housing. There is one section in this Bill which I consider very necessary and useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Deputy Lalor applauded me in the constituency, I would expect him to repeat the applause here.  It is Section 18. <Col N="2162" /> Many cases have been brought to the notice of Deputies in the past where an applicant who had applied for a reconstruction grant or a grant for the erection of a new house died before the work was completed.  In the past, this has led to a great deal of difficulty and expense for the next of kin. I am glad to see that steps have now been taken to rectify the matter and that the grant will be paid without undue delay and without the need of having to go through the present expensive and unnecessary legal formalities.</P>
      <P>That is all I have to say except to place on record my very keen disappointment with the Bill.  From a Party who were so vocal about housing when the inter-Party Government were in office, I would have expected more comprehensive housing legislation and more generosity towards the private individual.  This Bill is merely a sham and an excuse for the Government to appear in certain places and say: &ldquo; We have brought in a housing Bill&rdquo;.  This Bill contains no benefits for the people. Such a Bill must be considered impractical and a waste of the time of the House.  If any Deputy is approached by a private individual and asked: &ldquo;What do I get under this Bill?&rdquo;, he will have to say honestly: &ldquo;You will get nothing&rdquo;.  The present scheme of grants remains as it is.  This Bill does not help in any way to relieve the plight of people anxious either to build their own homes or reconstruct their existing mud-walled, thatched, rat-infested hovels.</P>
      <P>The Minister is displaying a great lack of knowledge of the housing requirements of private individuals.  He has been badly advised in that regard. Legislation of this kind must be approved by the Government before it is introduced.  The Government who approved this legislation are a Government who know very little about the disastrous plight of the people in rural Ireland in regard to housing.  This Bill lacks everything necessary to stimulate the development of housing and complete the drive to rehouse our people.  It can only be described as a standstill housing Bill, which gives nothing and which will do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2163" /> The Minister would be well advised to consult with his advisers.  The housing advisers at his disposal are men who know their job and who have practical experience of administration. But if the Housing Section had the lead, if they had the Minister and the Government prepared to spend money on housing, then we would get moving with the housing programme.  But where you have a Department anxious to drive forward, and for each step forward they take, the Minister pulls them back two, you cannot expect progress or efficiency and our people cannot expect to be housed.  That is why I feel that if we had a Minister for Local Government and a Government interested in housing, with the present Housing Section of the Department, all in step and all going forward, then we might get some place.  I am sure we would get some place.</P>
    <P>Our housing problems will not be solved by the present Government.  All the people who were promised housing legislation at the last election can say tomorrow morning that they have got it, but they are no nearer to being housed.  That is why I say the Fianna Fáil Party have not got a housing programme aimed at solving the housing difficulties of our people, the newlyweds, the aged, the couples with large families, those who experience overcrowding, and the sub-tenant. The latter is catered for in Donegal, but nowhere else.  If the people want to stimulate housing, if local authorities are anxious to get on with housing, if private individuals are anxious to be provided with loans and grants to enable them to erect their own houses, the first thing they must do is change the Government. That will not be a difficult job at the next general election.  It will not be a big job.</P>

      <P>Housing progress over the past 30 years has been magnificent. Tremendous advances have been made.  This Bill is yet another step forward to clear up some of the remaining evils where the housing of our people is concerned.  I did not expect the Bill would be welcomed by the Opposition.  I did not expect any praise for it.  But I did not think they would have wasted the time of the House making a foolish demand.  It is not so very many years since they were in power.  They had a Minister who brought in legislation and made promises.  They also had a Minister who did not provide the wherewithal to execute the contracts undertaken.</P>
      <P>This evening we heard repeated demands from Deputy O.J. Flanagan to spend more.  Spend, spend, spend, that is all I have listened to since I came in here last October, an everincreasing demand for money and no recommendation or suggestion as to how that money will be found.  It is pathetic.  It is a waste of the time of this House.  One expects a certain amount of political gibing, back and forth, but one expects from the Fine Gael front bench a little more responsibility than that shown by Deputy O.J. Flanagan this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that there are 30,000 homes in need of repair.  Of those 30,000, some 20,000 need replacement.  That in itself indicates the tremendous progress over the past 30 years.  There are something in the region of 600,000 homes in the country, and 30,000 would represent five per cent. of that number.  The end of the housing problem would appear to be well in sight.  Within the next decade, it should be completely solved. There will, of course, be annual wastage at the rate of some 1,000 houses per year.  That is a remarkable achievement for the nation and for <Col N="2165" /> successive Governments.  We have eradicated the truly horrible housing conditions that existed; we have reduced the number to some five per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves to be complimented on the provisions in this Bill. He is making provision here for sections who were never hitherto catered for.  He deserves the commendation of the House.</P>
    <P>Section 2 does not provide for any increase in the housing grants.  It is not necessary to increase these grants. The problem today is to find someone who will build houses.  There is a shortage of workers.  This is a far cry from 1956 and 1957 when workers were running out of the country.  It was the Opposition who caused the unholy mess and left the country without the craftsmen and workers to build homes for our people.  However, they are now making their way back to profitable employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister extend Section 2 to benefit people prepared to erect houses for letting.  I understand Section 12 of the existing Act is being repealed.  I should like some compensating factor if that section is repealed.  It is a social amenity to have houses for letting, so that those who may have to move temporarily to a town can find accommodation. We know that local authorities are not empowered to build houses for temporary letting.  But there are in every town in Ireland workers who, because of the nature of their work, may move in for one, two or ten years.  They are never likely to qualify for a house from the local authority but they are likely to be settled for long enough to consider buying a house.  It is that type of person for whom provision should be made and for whom people should be encouraged to build houses.  Section 12 has not been availed off to any great degree and I think the reason was that people did not consider it very useful. I hope the Minister will reconsider that point.</P>
    <P>In regard to reconstruction and improvement of houses, the Minister is making adequate grants available.  The <Col N="2166" /> only comment I want to make is that I get many complaints from farmers and those who have reconstructed their houses that the costs they have to pay the builders are sometimes much higher than those estimated by the Department's inspector.  I would welcome some method of narrowing this difference.</P>
    <P>In regard to the additions to the Bill, in every county in Ireland, particularly in the west of Ireland, there are homes on small farms which over the years have fallen into disrepair.  I was very pleased to note that these people who have not the wherewithal to build a house for themselves are being considered in this Bill and that the Minister is now providing a grant for necessary or minimum repairs.  It is also good to see that county councils are authorised to make up the difference and to come in and do those repairs if they so wish.  I wish this provision every success.  I shall now be able to tell a few badly-housed people I am aware of in my constituency about it.</P>
    <P>Another useful provision is that in relation to the housing of old people. I heard a lot of fun being made of what can be done with £600.  Anybody who reads the Bill carefully will see that there is a provision for a kitchen, a bedroom and some kind of sanitary arrangements.  With an area of 300 square feet in a small holding and with adequate planning, I am satisfied a reasonable home can be erected for £600.  The Minister has shown tremendous foresight in this provision and I hope that, in addition to the Minister's efforts, the local authorities and other bodies will take advantage of it.  However, I am not clear as to how the matter is to be dealt with and I would ask the Minister to be more specific.</P>
    <P>Another new step taken by the Minister to create competition, as it were, is that in relation to the prototype house, the accent being on economy of building.  I must compliment the Minister on this original idea.  It is a good thing to foster competition among architects, builders and others.  I am not too clear what the Minister has in mind but it is a desirable step.  A great effort has recently been made by many <Col N="2167" /> architects to bring in a variety of architectural features into homes.  This can be seen around Dublin and other parts of the country and deserves commendation. It is nice to see that the Minister is availing of this measure to encourage greater variety of design.  One has looked for years at the usual type of three-bedroom houses.  There has not been much variation, two windows at the top, one at the bottom, and the door, a long line of semi-detached houses strung along in a dreary fashion, the only change being one house has brick and another dashing, some are white and some grey, but the whole thing is rather dreary.  The Bill will give more liberty in that respect. It is highly desirable that the standard of housing design be raised, that new building materials be used, and if they can be bought at a cheaper price, it is all to the good.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule to the Bill provides:</P>
    <P>1.  The total area of all the floors of a house measured in the prescribed manner shall not be less than 500 square feet nor more than 1,400 square feet.</P>
    <P>2.  A house shall contain at least three rooms.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say whether it is his intention to adhere to the present formula of 155 square feet for a living room, 155 square feet for a bedroom, 120 square feet for a second bedroom and so on?  This, to my mind, was largely responsible for the reproduction of the same type of house.  There has been a tendency in the Department to give more liberty in regard to the lay-out of the rooms rather than confine them to these limits.</P>
    <P>In regard to urban areas, county council areas, there is a tendency sometimes, especially in our larger provincial towns, to look for a small density per acre.  It is evident to everybody in this House that land prices are soaring very high.  Under Dublin Corporation, there is an average of ten houses to the acre.  The county council has something like six houses to the acre.  If it is within the Minister's power &mdash; perhaps it is not &mdash; some liberty in this regard would be of benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> Deputy Flanagan made the comments I wanted to make on this Bill.  I welcome the Bill.  I consider it an excellent measure, a step in the right direction, which will go a long way towards solving finally the problem of housing the people.  When the Bill is in operation, the benefits deriving from it will manifest themselves in the eradication of a lot of bad housing and as a result, whatever Minister may be in office, whether the present Minister or some other Minister, in a few years' time we will be able to afford to review the problems then facing us.  I have no doubt that this Government would like to introduce legislation which would solve immediately all the problems in relation to housing but it would be impossible to satisfy the needs of everybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick became very excited about the question of housing.  Frankly, I was quite surprised.  In the years during which Deputy Blowick was a Minister of an inter-Party Government, why did he not take a greater interest in this matter?  Reading the paper the other day, I was particularly shocked to learn the degree of bad housing in Mayo.  I was shocked that Deputy Blowick was not aware of it.  He mentioned a figure of 1,400 houses.  He is a member of Mayo County Council and could have done a great deal more in Mayo.  I do not think county councils need any more authority than they have now.  If they use the powers they have, any bad housing in their areas could be eradicated.</P>
    <P>The question of housing newlyweds has been referred to.  Every member of the House is aware of the requirements in his county council area.  If a county council want to provide facilities for newlyweds and to make special provision for them, it is within their power to do so and they ought to take steps to do so if they feel there is a need for it.  I do not think it is the duty of the Department or of the Minister to direct the building of houses in any county.  The power is vested in the county councils.  The powers they have are sufficient for them to be able to solve the local problems in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> I should like to refer to the section in the Bill which provides for stamp duty on the sale of a house in respect of which a grant has been paid and which has not been occupied.  The stamp duty is one per cent.  I would ask the Minister to examine that position. One per cent. on the price of a house can range from £20 to £25.  It is difficult to understand why there should be a housing grant of £275 on the one hand and the imposition of stamp duty of, say, £25 on the other. A person buys a site, employs a builder and has a house built by way of contract.  This is not applicable.  It may not be a serious problem.  Nevertheless, I would appreciate something being done about it.</P>
    <P>I have not noticed anywhere in Ireland such conditions as have been described here this evening.  I have been around Leitrim, Sligo and parts of Mayo, and all the poorer districts in the West of Ireland.  I have never seen these conditions and I am surprised to hear that in Deputy Flanagan's constituency there are cases where seven people over 14 years of age, male and female, are sleeping and living in one room.  I am shocked to hear of this.  I have seen poverty in Ireland but I have never seen a case where people had stooped to such low moral standards.  If such conditions exist in Deputy Flanagan's constituency I wonder what he is doing?  It is a matter that should be brought to the attention of the clergy and everybody responsible.  I am shocked.  I have not seen such conditions anywhere.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to know on what leg the last speaker is going to stand.  He started off by stating it was not necessary to increase housing grants, that the greatest trouble at the moment was to get contractors or people to build houses.  Then he criticised Deputy Blowick for not being aware that there <Col N="2170" /> were so many houses in Mayo which were in a shocking condition.  Then he told us that he had travelled Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Dublin and had never seen the living conditions described by certain Deputies.  I do not know if the Deputy knows himself what he wished to say, except to praise the Minister for bringing in this paltry measure to solve a major problem.</P>
      <P>There is not the slightest doubt that this Bill will cause great disappointment throughout the country.  It is a case of the mountain labouring and bringing forth a mouse.  For the past six months, in my constituency, local authority members of the Minister's Party have told the public that new housing legislation was under way which would ease the situation for the small farmer.  This Bill was to ease the position that exists in rural Ireland and which the Minister knows perfectly well exists because of the recent investigation carried out by every local authority into housing conditions.  The prolonged delay in introducing this measure has led the public to expect great things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is notable for omissions from it than for the good it contains. I do not mean to say that there are not good provisions and good sections in the Bill.  I do not suggest there are not but there is nothing in this Bill to justify any member of the Fianna Fáil Party or any member of the Government blowing a trumpet.  The simple little improvements provided for could have been brought in three or four months ago.  There was no necessity for the long delay in dealing with the simple improvements included in the Bill.  We all welcome them but the major point of the Bill is the renewal of existing legislation.  It is a Bill to enable existing housing grants to be continued because the legislation covering housing grants is on a three year basis and the time had expired and the grants in operation would no longer be available.  It was necessary under the circumstances for the Government to bring in legislation to continue existing housing grants.  That is the only thing that has been achieved in this Bill, the continuation of the <Col N="2171" /> existing situation in relation to grants for private building.</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister and members of his Party might think I am prejudiced against the Government, let me say that grants for essential repairs to houses, experiments on houses and houses for elderly people are all good things and are welcome.  If I might select one of these matters for special reference, because other speakers have dealt sufficiently with the majority of them, I would like to ask the Minister to comment on the section that relates to the experiment in new types of houses.  My feeling is that the Minister is preparing to give consideration to the idea of giving grants for the erection of the prestressed concrete type of house, one that can be built within three days, one that is as sound and lasting as the normal house built with normal building materials and one that can be built at a little less cost.  I would like the Minister to say if he has that in mind, apart from any changes in design.</P>
    <P>The main point I want to deal with is the problem that affects the small farmer in respect of housing.  Surely when so much is talked in this House about the small farmer, it should be realised by the Government that there is a tremendous problem still to be solved.  The best thing I can do is to relate the position as I see it in my own county.  The Roscommon County Council is no better and no worse than any other county council in Ireland and so conditions there would be applicable to other counties.</P>
    <P>In Roscommon, at least 60 per cent. of the farmers have valuations of less than £14.  Those men, under £14 and down as far as £6, are described as farmers.  They are in the majority in the county and they are expected, under the existing law, to build their own houses.  They are expected, through the Government grant and the supplementary grant, through their own resources to supplement those grants in addition to the loan that is available and thereby provide themselves with houses.  It has been established in Roscommon that a large proportion of the small farmers under £12 <Col N="2172" /> valuation are not in a position to bridge the gap between the State grant and the supplementary county council grant and the cost of the house.  They have not that amount of money available and are not in a position to get it.</P>
    <P>The result is that Roscommon County Council have decided that all farmers under a valuation of £12 and up to a valuation of £15 who are in need of houses must be re-housed by the council.  If one could see the tortuous planning that has to be carried out in order to enable the council legally to implement its wishes in that regard, the Minister would feel that this Bill to which we were looking forward so much is very sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>If the county council finds an individual with a valuation of £12 unable to build his house, the council will then go through the legal procedure of acquiring a plot of land for that farmer. The whole question of title comes into it and causes delay and a considerable amount of irritation, both to the council and to the individual looking for the house but it does not cause too much trouble to the legal men concerned.  The council then proceeds to build a house and then the real trouble begins because there is a major difficulty in getting contractors to build these houses especially if they are in isolated places.  Contractors find it is not a paying proposition to take on one or two isolated houses at the contract prices.</P>
    <P>The council, having decided to build a house, becomes the official owner.  The farmer is allowed to move in and is there on the same basis as the worker or the county council employee for whom the council normally build houses.  Why could not all that procedure be eliminated?  Why is it not possible for the council to build a house and put the repayment charges on the rent for the farmer? We know how it works out as far as the Land Commission charges are concerned and we know the majority of the farmers pay up as regularly as could be.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy at the present time to find that the capital requirements for building a house which are not available to the small farmer prevent him <Col N="2173" /> from getting a house in County Roscommon and will prevent him from getting one for the next eight to ten years.  I believe that the number of houses in County Roscommon in need of development and reconstruction is 397 and from my own experience I think that is a conservative figure.  I am not blaming the Minister or the county council for that and I am not blaming them for the position that has obtained up to the present.  I am hoping that since this information has come to him about the condition of those houses, he will take steps to solve that problem and since he has figures for Roscommon, Mayo and every county in Ireland, I find it hard to credit that he could come in here and offer no solution or real help in getting rid of that backlog.</P>
    <P>Building houses in local authority areas at the rate of 30 or 40 a year means that it will take ten years to meet the housing requirements of the people, not to speak of the other people who will be coming along in the meantime in need of re-housing, old people for whom provision is made in the Bill and the group who will need grants for essential repairs.  There are so many other problems which have to be met by local authorities, in addition to the major one of re-housing small farmers, that councils will not be in a position to fulfil their duties in this regard.</P>
    <P>I said I did not blame the Minister and I want to clarify that.  Quite a large number of these smallholders to whom I refer are congests and, in my opinion, the duty of solving their housing problems should lie on the Land Commission.  Those people living on small holdings have for the past 30 years been awaiting with great patience and hope the attention of the Land Commission.  They have been expecting, and rightly so, to be taken out of the congested localities in which they live, to be given new holdings and have houses built for them.  No real effort has been made by the Land Commission to solve their problem and, therefore, it is now the responsibility of the county council because they feel the present situation can no longer be <Col N="2174" /> allowed to continue.  Seeing that the county council is prepared to do everything within its power, it is not unfair for me to suggest to the Minister that he should come to their help.</P>
    <P>The position, as I see it at any rate, is that it will be a minimum of ten years before all the people who need houses and whose condition is well known to the Minister are dealt with. That, in my opinion, is inexcusable.  If the Minister is prepared on Committee Stage to make provision for dealing with that matter, I can assure him he will have the thanks and the gratitude of the people living on small holdings all over the country.  I welcome the present measure for the good points that are in it, but I am very sorry indeed that the Minister who has the information through inquiries carried out by the local authorities is not prepared to do more.  As a result of the information available to him, the Minister must be preparing fresh legislation to enable him to solve that problem and if he is able to tell us in his concluding remarks that a Bill to meet these requirements to which I have referred is likely to be brought in by October or November at latest, then I have no further criticism to offer at this stage.</P>
    <P>He should ask the Government to give priority, when they are arranging priorities between now and next October, to this very important matter of rehousing small farmers, and, indeed, persons with small incomes whose problem is not being solved and for whom local authorities are not in a position to build on existing grants.  If the Minister would get his teeth into that problem, he would be solving something that has caused anxiety not only to the people who have waited so long but to all the local authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>The second last speaker, Deputy Flanagan, gave a definition of an elderly person.  An elderly person is one who sits in the House from 4.30 until 10.30 p.m. trying to say a few modest words on a Bill like this.  It is a very ageing process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are aspects of the Bill which I like because they show a certain kind <Col N="2175" /> of thinking that appeals to me.  It is a tidying Bill and I hope it will tidy our country, urban and rural.  We have a heritage in this country of old houses, very badly run down houses and the third category, no houses.  That is being provided for as many labourers' cottages and small dwelling houses are being built.  They first create a problem for the Department as well as for us who are engaged in running our towns and cities.  A little off the main streets of many of our towns and, indeed, on the main streets and very near the centre of Dublin, there are 18th century and early 19th century houses which have now almost outlived their purpose.  They are big houses, reasonably well built, but which have been allowed to run down and I wonder are we making enough use of them and whether the Minister's Department should not see whether that kind of house could be maintained.</P>
    <P>They are still good structurally and from every point of view it is desirable that they should be maintained because they occupy a very prominent part of our towns and cities and are running down.  They are in the twilight area&mdash;I believe that is the architect's term &mdash; and that is a depressing thing in any place.  We do not want it.  I think, probably with a considerable investment of public money, these houses could be converted into dual residences or flats, but we just cannot nibble at the idea.  It will have to be a global proposal.  Unfortunately the kind of houses I refer to are fairly common.  It is a kind which is prevalent throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the proposal in the Bill that we should provide homes for old people.  It is proposed we should put up £300 per dwelling and that the local authority would put up a similar sum.  To utilise that kind of money properly, you could use a number of those old houses and the £600 could be expended in providing dwellings inside the shell of these big houses.  That would seem to me to be a most sensible way of spending that money because I agree with other Deputies who have said <Col N="2176" /> that it is not possible to put up any dwelling of any duration or character for £600.  You could, however, do a lot of good work by using these old houses in the way I have suggested.</P>
    <P>When grants are given, and dwellings built as a result, it would be no harm, particularly in the case of the more modest type of house, in the interest of tidier towns, if the owners of these working class houses were tempted to maintain the paint work on the outside. There is a charitable institution in Cork city which maintains very modest dwellings for about 20 or 25 aged people.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The charitable institution to which I was referring is a very old one dating from the eighteenth century.  As I said, it houses about 20 or 25 old people, male and female.  They all have separate rooms. The building is very run down in condition.  I have been wondering if the grant provided in this Bill for making houses available for old people could not be devoted to an institution of that type so that separate dwellings could be provided in it.  Perhaps the Minister would answer that question when he is replying.  There are other homes of that kind in Dublin and Limerick and I feel we would be making a marvellous effort to accommodate properly our old people if these grants could be made available for the reconstruction of these old homes to provide separate dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that grants could be given for the restoration of premises over a period so that the restoration work would not involve any substantial expenditure at any one period.  I think that is a wise thing to do.  Planning officers and town architects frequently put a stop to applications for repair grants for a house because they say in a vague kind of way that the area is scheduled for demolition under a town plan, and though the house may have 20 years' life in it, because of this vague suggestion that it might interfere with the town plan nothing can <Col N="2177" /> be done with it and it is allowed to fall into complete disuse and crumbles away to nothing.  I am pretty sure that over 10, 12 or even 20 years, it will still not be demolished and over that period the kind of expenditure envisaged here could give it an extra lease of life.  I welcome that part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The section which proposes that architectural experiments should be carried out so that we could devise a standard house is a good thing, if we are careful that we do not over-standardise and that we keep the rural scene interesting &mdash; that we do not have row upon row of houses of the same type.  We have experience from the 18th and 19th centuries of that kind of thing and we know what a dismal picture it creates.  If there is anything I am proud of in our housing scheme in my native city, it is the varied kind of architecture.  That makes the houses good to live in because it makes the people feel they are living in an interesting place. While the idea of getting a prototype house designed is a good one, we should be careful that we have sufficient variation of design so that we will not have monotony in our landscapes or street scenes.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to fix a uniform maximum of £2,000 under Section 20 of the Bill by way of advances to borrowers under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  I do not think that is enough.  For housing in Cork three years ago, we got quotations at £1,400 per house.  This year, the best quotation we could get was £1,900.  I think that £2,000 for the man building a single house on a site where he has also to buy the lease of a bit of land is not a real figure.</P>
    <P>In the same respect, I do not think the present grants for house repairs bear any relation to costs today.  To my mind, they are roughly 33? per cent. too low.  The fact of the matter is that costs of that kind have increased by that amount during the past two and a half years.  If we do not realise that, we will be putting a sum on paper which will not be as effective in its results as we would desire.  In general, I think we should <Col N="2178" /> be all reasonably pleased with what has been done for the housing of the working classes since the war ended.  I am sorry the Fine Gael figures were better than those of Fianna Fáil because I should have liked to have seen the Fianna Fáil figures better since it would show they were getting on with the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is like the proverbial curate's egg &mdash; good in spots. The fact that the Minister has included in it practically all the sections of the Private Members' Bill which the Labour Party introduced, which was defeated by the House and which the Minister criticised so severely, gives us a certain amount of satisfaction.  In that Bill, we dealt only with one or two aspects of housing and like everybody else in the country interested in the matter, we were expecting a very comprehensive Bill now.  We were therefore disappointed to find that the Bill introduced today does not go nearly far enough in most of the things the Minister seems to be attempting to tackle.  Like most of the Deputies on this side of the House who have spoken, I am very disappointed that the amount of the grant has not been increased, both for the erection and reconstruction of houses. It is quite possible that somewhere in the Bill power is given to the Minister to alter the grant at certain stages. That may be the answer to the problem.</P>
      <P>I feel that the present system whereby the maximum grant given by the Department cannot be exceeded by a supplementary grant from the local authority has not been working so well, because most local authorities seem to try to get away with the smallest possible grant they can give. If the Minister felt that he could not substantially increase the amount of the grants for the erection of new houses, he could have introduced an innovation which would reduce the amount of interest on any loan given for the building of a house.  In that way he could have given assistance if he did not want to give direct assistance by way of increased grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, of course, that the difficulty <Col N="2179" /> is money.  I do not intend to make it a Party political issue.  I do not want to say that it is because a particular Government are in power.  We all know that the amount of money we would all like to see provided is very great. On the other hand, it is most unfair for Deputies to stand up here, no matter from which side of the House, and try to politically colour the picture which is being put before the House.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate, as I have been for many long hours, like Deputy Barry I was learning things.  I do not mind at any time people talking about something they know, particularly if they know their subject well, but I dislike people who do not know their subject proceeding to lecture members of the House on that subject.  That has happened on more than one occasion to-night from both sides of the House. In fact, in one instance someone talked about the easy way the local authorities could, if they so desired, solve all our housing problems.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority, Meath County Council, and despite the fact that the controlling interest in that county council is the Government Party &mdash; there have been changes from one side to the other over the years &mdash; down through the years that has been a progressive council; it still is and it does its best according to its lights to deal with housing.  Of course, we must, as a council, deal through the county manager, and the county manager must deal with the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council will build for people with up to £20 valuation, and despite that, we have given an official figure to the Department of 1,062 unfit houses.  Surely if we consider that figure in relation to the counties where people with valuations of £5 and £6 cannot have council houses built for them, and when we find they send in a figure of a few hundred unfit houses, there must be something wrong? Someone is trying to cod someone.  If the Department want to get the correct figure of unit houses, they should go a little further than sending a polite note to the secretary of a county council asking him to supply the figures of unfit houses in that county.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a separate figure for the urban areas and the county council areas.  I have given the figure for the county council area in Meath.  In Mayo, the figure is 4,894 unfit houses, almost 5,000.  In the neighbouring county, Roscommon, it is 397; Sligo, 526; North Tipperary, 232. It is asking a bit too much to expect that anyone would believe those figures could be right.  They are not comparable.</P>
      <P>As I say, Meath County Council erects houses for people with valuations of £20 in certain circumstances, and yet it has six times as many unfit houses as Roscommon.  The big trouble we find in Meath is that the people who have valuations of over £20 are living in very bad houses.  In Meath, we would call them small farmers, although in other counties a valuation of over £20 is a fairly sizeable farm. The small farmers in Meath, as in every other county, are not doing so well at present and, as a result, they are not in a position to house themselves. Very many of them are not in a position to carry out reconstruction. Unfortunately this Bill does not do very much to help that type of person. That is why I was hopeful that the grants would be greater, or that they could borrow money at a smaller rate of interest and could attempt to house themselves.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the size of the new houses being built.  While a figure of a minimum of 500 square feet and a maximum of 1,400 square feet may appear to be reasonable, there is one thing I dislike very much, that is, when someone builds a house an inspector comes with a tape measure and if it is inches out one way or the other, that is sufficient to prevent him from qualifying for a grant.  That should not happen.  I know of a few such instances.  It is despicable that just because the space is a few inches out a person should be debarred from getting the grant.  If a person wants to build a decent house, the design may be a little under or a little over but I think he should get the grant and no dickering about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2181" /> I know of one instance where someone built a house and found there was one complete room which was in excess of the floor space required.  It was at the end of the house.  He needed a workshop so he closed the door between that room and the rest of the house with the result that the house he intended to live in was within the floor space of 1,400 square feet.  He opened a double door in the other room and made it into a workshop and a car shed.  The Department took great pleasure in pointing out that there was still a lintel and that he might at a later stage, if his family grew larger, open the door between the workshop and the house so he could not get the grant.  The Minister will agree that there is no point at all in that sort of thing.  Either we want people to make an effort to house themselves, and we are prepared to assist them or we do not.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of improving the standard of building and the type of house are concerned, there is one question I should like to put to the Minister: has there been fairly recently a suggestion in the Department that people are tending to look for too high standards?  Is it not a fact that local authorities have been instructed to reduce the standards?  Is it not a fact that, in an effort to bring down contract prices, local authorities have been instructed to reduce the standard of the houses they are building for the working classes?  If that is so, is it right that somebody should suggest here that the standard is being raised and that we are encouraging people to raise it?</P>
    <P>I am aware of houses built to Departmental standards and if five or six people are sitting around a table and smoking for half an hour the ceiling, as a result of the alterations made, being so low, the place is full of smoke.  Because, again, the Department have given instructions, there is only one fireplace in the whole house and it is not in the room which the people are using.  Therefore, there is no way, unless they open the window or the door, of letting the smoke out of the house.</P>
    <P>I do not know whose idea it was.  I <Col N="2182" /> made inquiries and I was reliably informed that it was the Department that had issued instructions that the standard was to be lowered, that the standard was too high and that it was to be lowered, and therefore there would be a reduction in contract price. If the Minister considers or knows that to be untrue, I would be very glad if he would say so when he is replying because, believe me, I know where I stand in this respect.</P>
    <P>The question of repairs has been discussed or mentioned in the Bill and certain suggestions were made.  I am glad there is an arrangement by which a portion of a house can be repaired. A situation has arisen recently &mdash; it may be the regulation for a long time but it has come very much to the fore recently&mdash;of an inspector going down, inspecting the house and giving an estimate for the repairs to the house, an estimate which, in many cases, is very much lower than the cost of the work &mdash;that is beside the point&mdash;but an estimate for the job of work which must be done.  Then, when the job is finished, he will point to other work to which he did not pay attention when he first examined the house.</P>
    <P>He will inspect the house and say: &ldquo;The house is grand but you must do that as well.&rdquo;  A personal friend of mine in Deputy Mooney's constituency was told he would have to repair a conservatory attached to a house and which had no bearing on living accommodation. He could not do so, because all the money he could possibly get his hands on was spent on the work stipulated by the Minister's inspector in the first instance.  I think it is right that that situation should be changed.  If somebody wants to repair a certain portion of a house to live in, so as to have at least one or two good rooms, he should be able to get a grant for doing that type of work.</P>
    <P>We also have in the country districts a situation that somebody is living in a house on the outside of which he must do some repairs.  Under present regulations, the local authority engineers will inspect it, and sometimes the Department engineer, and may decide that the house is unfit for reconstruction. I have one instance at least <Col N="2183" /> and I have heard of one or two others where the people went ahead with the repairs and proved it was not true to say that the house was unfit for reconstruction. They reconstructed the house and made a good job of it.  In one case, the grant was paid.  In some other cases, the grant was refused because the Department or the local authority decided, before the work was started, that the work could not effectively be done.</P>
    <P>I do not think that sort of situation should be allowed to continue.  It is discouraging those who are trying to help themselves.  I am full sure that if the matter is brought to top level &mdash; the officials who are advising the Minister denied they were aware of it &mdash;this sort of thing could not happen. Unfortunately, no matter what you seem to do, there is always somebody half way up the line who will make a decision on it and that is as far as the unfortunate person who wants to repair the house will get.  Therefore, neighbours who might be encouraged to do something about their own houses will not attempt the same thing because of what happened to the first person.  I would ask that the Minister would take this into account when he comes to reply and would see to it that in future such things cannot happen.</P>
    <P>There is one question, lest I forget to mention it, on which I should like the Minister to clear my mind.  It concerns Section 11.  Subsection (8) of Section 11 says that no advances can be made: it is for the abolition of the existing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Subsection (8) of Section 11 states that no new loans are to be made under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, 1899 to 1958.  Section 20 gives power to fix the maximum advances under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act of 1899.  Maybe I am misreading it, or is there a contradiction in the Bill?  If there is not, then I am perfectly satisfied.  I wondered if there had <Col N="2184" /> been some slight error or error in the typing.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider the question of sites for people who wish to build their own houses? I thought some reference might be made to it in the Bill.  There is an unfortunate position in country districts where most people who want to build a house find they are asked a fantastic price for a site.  They often find that they can get a site very reasonably from a tenant of a vested cottage. Possibly an old person who has got an acre of good land on which there is more than one site would be only too glad to dispose of portion of the acre for the housing of some of his neighbours, but, because the title of the vested cottage is tied up in some way, it is not possible to use it for a site.  A loan, I understand, cannot be granted on foot of that particular type of site. Perhaps the Minister might consider if something could be done about that because it would relieve at least a number of people who at present are prevented from rehousing themselves because of lack of sites.</P>
      <P>I should also like the Minister to consider further encouragement to people who form groups to build houses.  I know that £10 extra has been given for years to those who form themselves into public utility or building societies.  Those people are encouraged to build their own houses and use this extra £10.  I think the Minister would be well advised if he would increase substantially that amount because it would encourage group effort.  I have in mind particularly a group who came together in my own village and built a very excellent scheme &mdash; it is almost completed now &mdash; with the full assistance of the local authority and the Department.  But there could be a little more co-operation from the Department, if there were an extra grant.</P>

    <P>The grant to members of a public utility society is in fact the easiest way to offer encouragement to people like this.  Also, a number of employers are rather anxious to build housing schemes for their employees.  Again, I think an effort should be made to encourage that type of building and <Col N="2185" /> perhaps a little more encouragement from the Department might solve the problem.  Those are matters which the Minister, I have no doubt, has gone into carefully or possibly they may not have been brought forcibly enough to his notice.  Perhaps, when he is replying, <Col N="2186" /> he might deal with that aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
