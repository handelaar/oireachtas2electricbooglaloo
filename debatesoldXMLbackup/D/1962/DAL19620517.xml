    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I should like to ask him one or two questions.  Last year, I raised the question of the people who got a licence to go into Castlecomer and at the time, the Minister stated that there would be arbitration.  A full year has passed since that time and still there has been no arbitration. Apparently, the Minister was prepared to have two of his officials on this arbitration, if both sides could agree on certain points.  These local people should receive more attention from the Minister and his Department rather than that he should set up arbitration if both sides agree on certain points. The main feature of this is that the people who went in there to mine got permission from the Department and, when a solicitor for the local people wrote to the Department asking for some idea of the financial standing of these people, the Department said it was not their business to do that, to give them any guarantee.  I think it was the Department's business to do that from the point of view that had the local landowners not agreed these people could have come to the Department at that time&mdash;not now&mdash; and the Minister would have given them a licence enabling them to go in, whether the landowners desired it or not.  The Minister was empowered then to give them a licence.  Now, due to the efforts, I understand, of the Young Farmers' Association, that no longer obtains and the Minister will not give the licence unless there is agreement with the local landowners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, Yeats Limited could have gone into the land and the local people knowing that, and rather than have it done by force, agreed.  I do not think that relieves the Government or the Minister of the responsibility of compensating these people. We are all anxious for the country to be developed and these people did not wish to stand in the way of development. Now they find that their land is one big pond and five or six acres are covered with heaps of clay and <Col N="1033" /> refuse which was dug up.  I think it is a responsibility of the Minister and the Department to settle that matter.</P>
    <P>We had, also, a case of a Scotsman who came to work at the Castlecomer mines and who started to prospect on his own in Firoda, where there is supposed to be a good deal of coal. Several other people went in with him but apparently he eventually ran out of capital and left.  The other people carried on.  They went to the Department and received an offer of a grant of something in the region of £4,000. When the Scotsman was there, a shaft of 123 feet had been dug.  They carried on and went down a further 133 feet, to make a total of 156 feet.</P>
    <P>The Department have agreed to give them a grant towards the last 23 feet they sunk but have refused to give them a grant for the first 123 feet, on the ground that they had no agreement with the Department at that time.  Apparently, they had an agreement because the Director of the Geological Survey was down there on several occasions with these people and there seems to have been an agreement to give up to £4,000.  However, all they have got is a grant of £600.  When the Scotsman was there, he was able to get a supply of electricity if he lodged £400 with the E.S.B. but these people had to lodge £1,000 with the E.S.B.  I think it was a matter of the transfer of E.S.B. stock from one of the owners to the E.S.B.  While the Scotsman only had to lodge £400, the local people, the Irish people, had to lodge a sum increased by 150 per cent. to £1,000.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to bring the first case to a conclusion. The place is an eyesore and it is disgraceful the way the whole country has been torn up and left there.  These people cleared out without compensating anybody.  In the second case, one businessman in Castlecomer has already sunk £5,000 in the project. They have already struck coal but they have to bring the road a bit further to the coalface and they cannot do it without additional finance.  They have given a lot of employment and I would appeal to the Minister to give them <Col N="1034" /> a loan or a grant to cover the work that has been done up to the present. They have used about £8,000 of their own money.</P>
    <P>We have cases of grants of 100 per cent. being given for building and 30 per cent. for machinery.  These are people who have done work in their own locality and all they want is a grant in proportion to the amount of work they have done.  Mining comes natural to these people in Castlecomer and I would appeal to the Minister to bring the case in Clough, Castlecomer, to a conclusion.  Last year, when I appealed to him, the Minister promised to have arbitration set up but apparently these people have welshed on him.  If the compensation cannot be got from them, I think it is up to the Department, who gave them licences to these people, to compensate the owners of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was inevitable that this debate should range over a wide variety of subjects.  It is always the case in relation to the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It was to be expected that much of the debate would be taken up by comment on our proposed entry into the European Economic Community and even on this subject, Deputies' views varied rather a lot.  There did seem to be the common approach that entry for us was necessary, if Britain became a member, but the views of Deputies as regards our prospects, if we became a member, varied from undue optimism and sober realism to what I consider unpardonable pessimism.  However, I shall refer to that more particularly later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I could not understand was the number of Deputies who referred to the Common Market as if it were for us an economic abyss about which we know nothing.  The Treaty of Rome has been in existence since 1957.  It has been available to anybody interested in it for study and since our application for entry was made in July last year, it has been debated in all its aspects so far as it is known throughout the length and <Col N="1035" /> breadth of the country.  As well as that, there is in existence the Government White Paper prepared last July which indicated the effects of our joining the Common Market, so far as they could be indicated at that time. Therefore, I think it is wrong for any Deputy to suggest that we know nothing about the Common Market.</P>
    <P>After all, it is, as we know, an economic coming together of six independent States in Europe, with a view to ultimate closer integration, economic and political.  This economic integration means the disappearance of all restrictions of trade between the member countries, the ensuring of free movement of persons and goods between the countries and the right of establishment of businesses and of service companies, etc., between one State and another.</P>
    <P>That is, of course, an over-simplification of what it means but the terms of entry for each of the countries will be negotiated by the new applicants and have been negotiated by the existing members and there are provisions there for dealing with the particular points of view and difficulties of applicants for membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>In the first place, I do not think there is any necessity for the forebodings of doom which have come from members of the Labour Party in particular.  They suggested that the Government had been telling the people that a veritable Utopia awaited us on our accession to the European Economic Community.  I think it is only right to say that if the Labour Party spokesmen examine the statements of the Taoiseach and other members of the Government, even before our application for membership of the Community was made, they will see that it was stated in these speeches that entry to the Common Market was no bed of roses, that it would present this so often used word &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; to our industry and agriculture and that, therefore, our competitiveness in both these fields would have to be increased considerably, if we were to take advantage of the opportunities available in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> These forebodings of gloom seem to indicate that those who made them were either deliberately ignoring or not aware of the fact that if a nation is accepted as a member of the Community, it is not likely to be pushed over a precipice and left at the mercy of what is at the bottom of that cliff. There is a transitional period and that transitional period is due to expire at the end of December, 1969.</P>
    <P>As of now, that gives us almost eight years in which to prepare for the full impact of the competition that agriculture and industry will meet in the Common Market.  There is the consideration that as far as industry is concerned, the members of the Community will have reduced their tariffs 50 per cent. by July of this year.  It is reasonable for us to hope and expect that if our application for membership is accepted shortly after that&mdash;before the next tariff cut is effective, or even after it&mdash;we would not have to bear immediately the full impact of a tariff reduction at the same rate, and we have made that known to the Ministers of the members countries in the subsequent negotiations that were continued between senior officials of our Governments and senior officials of the Governments of member countries.</P>
    <P>We have asked&mdash;and I think there is every possibility that it will be granted&mdash;for a rhythm of tariff reduction that will suit the industries now protected by tariffs in this country, a rhythm that will end simultaneously for the other member countries at the end of December, 1969, and we believe that if the interim period is fully taken advantage of by our industrialists and farmers, by and large, we shall be in a reasonably competitive position then to enable the bulk of our industries to survive and our agriculture to compete successfully in the Common Market. In respect of agriculture&mdash;it is not my province&mdash;at no stage was it ever suggested from these benches that the agricultural produce market in Europe was wide open to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputy Tully to pinpoint one authoritative statement made here or outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall send the Minister copies of them to read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have on occasions&mdash;I did myself, and I have heard the Taoiseach do so&mdash;stated that in most of the agricultural commodities we produce and in which we are interested, these countries are already self-sufficient.  That has been stated over and over again and I have never heard or read a statement by any Minister to the Contrary.  It was suggested by Fine Gael speakers that we had been dilatory in taking the measures necessary to gear our economy for membership of the European Economic Community.  Fine Gael have thrown up this argument which I think I can describe fairly as a gimmick.  They have suggested that as far back as 1957 they were telling us, the Government, that we were about to become members of the community and they say they told us that was the time to prepare.</P>
      <P>The reason I call it a gimmick is that I believe somewhere in the councils of Fine Gael, whether at their Party meetings or their Central Council, an appraisal of the effects of Common Market membership was made.  It was anticipated that there might be some redundancy in industry here and therefore they were going to get off to a head-start and say if and when these redundancies came about, they had warned us as far back as 1957 and we had done nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one throws one's mind back to the position in 1957, one will see what the basis of these warnings was.  At that stage, there was a change of Government and negotiations had already taken place about our possible membership of the European Free Trade Area.  The Taoiseach, who succeeded Deputy Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce, continued these negotiations for membership of that organisation until the negotiations broke down in December, 1958, at a meeting in Paris.  It is difficult to see how Fine Gael, who were in the Government who started our negotiations for membership of the European Free Trade Area as early <Col N="1038" /> as 1957, 18 months before these negotiations came to nothing, were able to tell us we were likely to become members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>There was certainly no evidence then that Britain was likely to become a member of the Common Market. On the contrary, when negotiations for the European Free Trade Area broke down, Britain immediately instigated negotiations, and eventually succeeded, to establish another form of looser economic association than that effected by the Six Common Market Countries.  Ultimately, as we all know, after many meetings of the new European Free Trade Area organisation, and realising it would be in Britain's better interest to become a member of the Common Market if she could also make provision for her EFTA partners, she applied for membership.  It was then that Britain decided on her application for entry to the EEC.  It is difficult in the light of that succession of events to take seriously the assertion of Fine Gael that they knew we would apply to become members of EEC.</P>
    <P>Let us examine whether or not we took in time measures designed to appraise our people of the type of conditions they would have to contend with on our becoming members of the EEC.  Even before the EFTA negotiations broke down in December, 1958, there was established for the first time the scheme of technical assistance grants for industry.  If that was not an effort to gear our industry for conditions of greater competition, I do not know what was.  That was introduced in a matter of months after the accession to office of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1957.</P>
    <P>I want to say this in respect of the manner in which industrialists have taken advantage of, or neglected to take advantage of, that scheme.  I have been urging industrialists on every occasion I can to utilise the technical assistance grants scheme more and more, not only because I felt it was necessary, but in particular because those industrialists who had taken advantage of it and had consultancy <Col N="1039" /> examinations carried out by experts of their processing, production, marketing, etc., were able to point to greater sales, increased business and increased employment as a result of greater efficiency suggested by these consultants.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the scheme has not been availed of to a greater extent, but that is no fault of the Government. Rather was it the fault of those industrialists who felt that such examinations of their businesses were not necessary in their cases.  But apart from the fact that not sufficient industrialists have taken advantage of the scheme, let me say in fairness that industrialists generally and the Federation of Irish Industries as a body have taken enthusiastically to the probability of our becoming members of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>As was to be expected, shortly after our application was made, the Taoiseach, with appropriate Ministers, had consultations with all the interests concerned, including the Federation of Irish Industries, the different farmers' associations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I cannot speak for the farmers' associations but I have been present at those conferences in so far as they affected my Department and I can say that the organisations representative of these various interests approached the prospect not only enthusiastically but realistically.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish posed a question yesterday, whether, in the event of some industrialists not going along with the recommendations of the Committee on Industrial Organisation, the Government proposed to take action and what action they proposed to take. It is very unlikely that any industrialists whose undertaking has been examined by the working party of the CIO will drag his feet in the matter of preparing himself for membership of EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked in particular how some facets of our administration in regard to aid to industry and inducement to greater production might be affected by our membership.  In particular, he asked what would be the fate of our existing tax concessions and whether it would be possible to continue <Col N="1040" /> them when we became a member. I must say at this stage it is not possible to give a precise answer to that question.  Earlier this month, the Taoiseach was asked in the House a question on similar lines, and that part of his reply which dealt with existing tax concessions, as reported in the Official Report of 3rd May, read as follows:</P>
    <P>In advance of the examination of our aids and incentives by the Commission of the European Economic Community in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Rome Treaty, it would not be possible to say whether any of these would be deemed incompatible with the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to refer to the provisions of the Treaty in relation to such State aids as summarised in paragraph 63 of the White Paper on the European Economic Community. Article 92 of the Rome Treaty states that Government assistance &ldquo;which distorts or threatens to distort competition shall, to the extent to which it adversely affects trade between member States, be deemed to be incompatible with the Common Market.&rdquo; But there are exemptions from this provision.  The Commission of the EEC have completed a general inventory of existing aids given by countries within the Community and working parties have been set up to examine these aids.  Rulings have been given in certain specific cases.  It seems that State aids can be retained until the Commission establish they are incompatible with the Rome Treaty.  In the event of any of our aids being challenged as being incompatible, we would seek to justify them to the Commission as being within the provisions of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned this aspect of our position in his statement of January 18th to the Ministers of the member countries.  He referred to State aids in a manner which implied we would be able to continue them. So far, there has been no query from the EEC to us on this particular point. I might mention that some of the member countries already have in <Col N="1041" /> existence State aids.  They may be challenged, but at all events they still continue in existence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the allegation that the Government were slow in taking positive steps to prepare our industry for membership of the EEC, there were further suggestions that what has since been done was not sufficient and that there were panic measures.  I do not think anybody can suggest that the setting up of the CIO was a panic operation.  I said already, replying to a debate some time ago in which Deputy Sweetman made a similar allegation, that even before our formal application for membership of the Common Market was made in July, a preliminary committee of the CIO had already been set up in June.  That led, immediately after our application for membership of the Common Market was made, to the setting up of the Committee on Industrial Organisation as we now know it.  They immediately proceeded to set up these working parties comprised of a high Government official, a Government economist or an outside economist, as the case may be, and if desirable a representative of the industry itself.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of these examinations which were conducted in an orderly way, following questionnaires supplied to and filled in by the different industries, that the Interim Report was signed in February of this year.  Sometime later it was submitted to the Government and it was published on the 10th April, the day before Budget day.  I should like to comment on that in case by any chance publication at that stage might be construed as having some special significance.  It had, and it was this: in some of the recommendations of the C.I.O. there were considerations of a budgetary nature, for example, the doubling of the tax concessions on depreciation of machinery and industrial buildings, and it was for this reason that there was a slight delay from the actual receipt of the recommendations by the Government to the ultimate publication of them.  It was, perhaps, obvious that the Government would accept, as they did, the recommendations of the Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> Deputy Denis O'Sullivan made the comment, as did Deputy Sweetman in the course of the Budget debate, that the provisions in the Estimates of £100,000, to cover this depreciation was a poor effort for the reorganisation of industry but, as I said already, that is only a rough estimate as to what this tax concession will cost and if more industries replace existing machinery more quickly, extend their buildings more quickly, whatever cost to the Exchequer these will entail will be readily made available by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave expressed surprise that the C.I.O. in their report had deferred comment on the grants legislation. That recommendation of the C.I.O. is clear, I think.  It reads at paragraph 37 of the Report:</P>
    <P>(i)  The legislation dealing with industrial grants should be amended to enable An Foras Tionscal to make a grant in respect of an industrial project which involves a switch from one field of activity to another and which would not qualify for a grant at present, provided An Foras Tionscal is satisfied that the undertaking is of a reasonably permanent nature and will be carried on efficiently.  We should like an opportunity of commenting on any proposals to change existing policy in regard to industrial grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in the course of his Budget speech, said that the recommendations of the C.I.O. had been accepted and that the recommendation in relation to industrial grants would be dealt with in amending legislation which would shortly be introduced. That legislation is being prepared and, as requested by the C.I.O., there will be consultation with them before the legislation will be introduced in the House.</P>
    <P>To sum up and to discount the suggestions that little is being done as a result of the recommendations of the C.I.O., I should like to repeat briefly what these were: first, there was the doubling of the initial allowance under the income tax code for modernisation; secondly, loans on deferred repayments and deferred interest terms for a five-year period for re-equipment <Col N="1043" /> of any kind in industry; thirdly, grants towards capital outlay on extensions to new activities and grants for what were described as switches from one field of activity to another; and, fourthly, increased technical assistance grants which would henceforth cover a wider scope.</P>
    <P>That, of itself, is an indication that the Government are taking reasonable steps to re-adapt industry to meet the conditions that would apply in the Common Market.  I should like to remind the House that on the 14th December of last year I made a statement, in reference to the CIO and whatever recommendations they would make, that any industry that undertook measures to help make its production more competitive for entry to the Common Market in any way might proceed immediately because the recommendations of the CIO, whatever they might be, would be made retrospective to that date. Therefore, industries were in no doubt then that State assistance would be forthcoming for whatever extra costs would be involved in specifically preparing an industry for Common Market conditions.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Treacy is in the House I might comment that it was the first time I heard him speak and I was rather surprised that a man from a county whose products I have admired in many spheres of activity over the years should have worn such a dismal mantle.  However, he was, perhaps, repeating the tale of woe that some of his leaders had produced during the recent Labour Party Conference in his reference to thousands of persons losing their jobs.  His remarks are apt to the extent that he inquired whether the Government were taking any steps with regard to the setting up of a redundancy fund in the event of persons losing their jobs following admission to the Common Market.  Again, I think I can refer to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome in this respect and quote from the Government White Paper which dealt with this aspect of our entry.  Paragraph 75 reads:</P>
    <P>In order to improve opportunities <Col N="1044" /> of employment for workers and thus contribute to the raising of the standard of living the Treaty established a European Social Fund financed by contributions of Member States.  Its task is the promotion of employment facilities and of geographical and occupational mobility of workers.  The Fund provides fifty per cent. of the cost of:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  ensuring productive reemployment of workers by means of occupational re-training and of re-settlement allowances; and</P>
    <P>(b)  granting aids for the benefit of workers where employment is temporarily reduced, or wholly or partly suspended, as a result of the conversion of the enterprise to other forms of production in order that they may maintain the same wage level, pending their full reemployment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will see that there is already in the Treaty of Rome a provision for a redundancy fund.  I might add that the CIO have under review the possibility of redundancy arising.  That is also under review in another organisation in which labour interests are also represented.  I refer to the Productivity Committee.  They have been examining the effects of redundancy.  In this case, of course, the redundancy with which they are concerned is the redundancy that may be caused by improved techniques, techniques which will increase productivity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  The redundancy fund to which the Minister refers is enshrined in the Rome Treaty.  My concern is the redundancy that may arise in the interim period; to quote the Minister, thousands of workers may become redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, again, to disagree with the Deputy's suggestion that thousands of workers may lose their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself spoke of certain numbers losing their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1045" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain numbers, yes.  I said there was that possibility and I should be burying my head in the sand if I were to refuse to believe that that possibility was there.  The Labour Party say they want to be realists about the position.  Of course, very often people who claim to be realists make the most outlandish statements, and then try to shelter behind a wall of realism.  I mentioned this morning that there was a certain amount of sober realism here yesterday, and that is the type of realism, I think, which ought to be applied to this question.  I never mentioned, as alleged by Deputy Tully, that thousands of people would be put out of employment.  I said the possibility was there that some people would be put out of employment.  The CIO have that matter under review and they will make recommendations to the Government as to what action might be taken; the Government will, of course, give full consideration to such recommendations, as they have done to all recommendations from that body.</P>
      <P>Different Deputies made statements during the debate on different aspects of the Common Market.  It would be difficult for me, no matter how much I might desire to do so, to deal with each point made.  However, in respect of those Deputies who feel despondent about our entry into the Common Market, I should like to give my experience in Brussels.  I went to Brussels a day before the Taoiseach last January.  Deputies may remember that at the time climatic conditions were uncertain.  There was a danger that planes might not leave from particular airports.  I took advantage of the fact that I was a day ahead of the Taoiseach to see as many people as I could in Brussels, members of the Belgian Government and, where possible, officials of the EEC Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing that struck me very much was the reply to my question as to how Belgian industrialists viewed the prospect of entry to the Common Market.  I was told that most Belgian industrialists were, at first, rather afraid of the prospect.  Many of them, being small units, feared they would be submerged by bigger units in the <Col N="1046" /> bigger industrial countries with which they would become partners.  I learned that the Federation of Industries in Belgium&mdash;I forget the exact title&mdash; were pretty strongly opposed to entry because of the damage that might be done to the interests of their members. Since they have become members, however, Belgian industries have expanded; they have increased efficiency and productivity and, at the same time, there has been an increase in the numbers of workers employed.  Their fears proved, happily, to be unfounded.  If there are fears in this country, I think it is equally likely that they will prove to be unfounded.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Sherwin who said last night that one must meet one's foe to test one's strength.  So far as the people of this country are concerned, I have always believed that it takes a certain amount of adversity to bring out the best in them.  I believe that when our workers and industrialists realise that they are in the Common Market, and that the tariff protection we have enjoyed will be steadily reduced, they will, with reasonable Government assistance, rise to the occasion.  By expanding employment in those industries that will succeed, any casualties that may occur will be absorbed into the more successful.</P>
    <P>The second topic of note that was touched on was industrial relations. Deputy Cosgrave referred to the Swedish and Dutch systems, systems which have produced conditions of industrial harmony in these countries that are the envy of other countries. Deputy Sweetman rightly pointed out that we could not willy-nilly import the Dutch and Swedish systems into this country.  I think everybody will agree with that point of view.  We can, however, learn from the systems these countries have adopted.  In fairness, I should say that Deputy Cosgrave did not suggest that we should adopt the systems.</P>
    <P>We all hope that the employer-worker conference, which has received such widespread approval, not only in the House but throughout the country, will have the success it should have. Deputy Tully gave a warning that this employer-worker conference must not produce another wages standstill order. <Col N="1047" /> I do not think that was ever the intention; I do not think anybody believed it was the intention.  I do not know where Deputy Tully got the idea.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the conference is, of course, to review employer-worker relations generally and to see whether greater harmony can be produced and whether better systems of resolving labour disputes can be devised.  In the meantime, as I announced some time ago, the Government and Government Departments have under review our system of labour relations, the constitution of the Labour Court, and other matters.  It is only reasonable that, while that review has reached an advanced stage, there should be consultation with workers' and employers' interests before anything further is done.  That consultation has been postponed, and rightly so, I think, until this conference has taken place and whatever consequent recommendations are made when working parties report.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen had some criticism to offer in regard to the Labour Court. Indeed, he trotted out a series of complain's. It is true he made some suggestions for remedying them.  He mentioned that the Labour Court was too slow in coming into disputes.  I do not think it should be anxious to come into disputes too early.  I think that the ordinary processes of negotiation should be permitted to run their full course.  As everybody knows, the agreement produced by negotiation between workers and employers is the best type.  The Labour Court should come in only when it appears that it is likely that such agreement will not be reached.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen said the conciliation service of the Labour Court is not strong enough in numbers.  That matter is being considered so that in future conciliation machinery will not suffer by the lack of numbers or by the quality of the personnel to whom conciliation will be entrusted.  In regard to Deputy Mullen's reference to too few factory inspectors, I think he is looking for a standard under which the ratio of inspectors to workers would be higher than applies in most countries.  We believe our inspectorate <Col N="1048" /> is adequate.  The proportion of inspectors to work being done in the different companies is favourable with that of Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Mullen also had in mind the delay in making awards known.  The Court having heard the dispute, the delay in making awards known is sometimes undue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That was probably due, in recent months, to the fact that there was no deputy chairman, Deputies generally will realise that it is not very easy to get a man of the calibre required who will be acceptable to both worker and employer interests.  I had that difficulty for several months recently until eventually there was the solution of the deputy chairman problem.  The solution was arrived at in so far as the existing chairman was about to retire, having reached a certain age.  The deputy chairman now serving is chairman designate.  Therefore, between him and the existing chairman, some arrears of work have been caught up upon.  I hope it will not arise in the future. That is the reason there was some delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a group of workers in my constituency whose dispute was the subject of hearing about two months ago.  The award is not yet known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That may have been before the deputy chairman was appointed.  I hope such complaints will not be necessary in the future.</P>
      <P>I shall probably take what I have to say in relation to industrial development out of context.  Criticism was made of the manner in which some foreign industrialists approach labour conditions in this country.  I have had very few complaints from trade unions about industrialists abroad who have started production here.  Before grants are negotiated by An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority, these industrialists are made fully aware of the necessity to make themselves familiar with labour conditions, with trade union organisations, and so on, in this country.  By and large, they do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> I do not think it is fair to say that foreign industrialists have deliberately in any way tried to challenge the authority of trade unions in this country. Difficulties may arise because of language differences, as happens in some cases, and because the industrialist has not full appreciation of the method of solving whatever difficulties are involved.  These industrialists are given every opportunity, and I believe they take every advantage of it, to familiarise themselves with labour conditions.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of industrial development.  Some Deputies repeated suggestions, which I have tried to refute on a number of occasions, that only foreigners are treated favourably by An Foras Tionscal and that An Foras Tionscal, the Minister, the Industrial Development Authority or somebody else directs industries to one location or from one location to another.  The facilities in the Undeveloped Areas Act and in the Industrial Grants Act are available to any person, irrespective of his country, as long as the proposition is sound and as long&mdash;this is a statutory obligation on An Foras Tionscal&mdash;as the undertaking has a reasonable prospect of permanence.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more likely to give cause for dissatisfaction than that an industry should start, aided by a State grant, in a particular area and then, because proper examination was not made of its prospects to survive, closes down in a short time.  It is to avoid such instances and developments that the obligation is put on An Foras Tionscal to ensure, as far as they can, that the industry will be of a reasonably permanent nature.  It is only natural that they would lean towards Irish interests, if there were a contest between Irish interests and foreign interests in this matter.</P>
    <P>I want to refuse the suggestion that any preference or that favour is shown towards non-Irish applicants for grants.  Similarly, I want to refute a suggestion that I or any of the authorities dealing with industrial development exercise influence in persuading people to locate their industry in a particular area or not to locate <Col N="1050" /> their industry in another area.  The practice has been well-established, and I think it is a wise one, that the promoter of an industry is a man who knows best where his industry is likely to survive and prosper.  It is not for me or for anybody else to tell him where to go.</P>
    <P>The facilities of different areas throughout the country are brought to the attention of each prospective industrialist. It is very seldom that an industrialist will come here and say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to build a factory or to start an industry.  Where shall I go?&rdquo;  If he does, in that event, he is given information about all areas in the country and he is invited to inspect them and to make whatever inquiries he likes.  Generally speaking, it happens that he has already been contacted by a local group which puts forward the claims of a particular area.  He comes with the idea of setting up his industry in a particular area.  It is possible that he might, having come here, favour an area other than the one he comes to but in that event, An Foras Tionscal do not encourage him in any way to leave the area in which he proposed to set up initially.  I do not know whether what I have said will allay any suspicions or fears Deputies might have in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Minister for just a moment?  Is it not a fact that if an industrialist wants to set up his industry outside the development areas, he is first required to prove that it is not possible to set up his industry in a development area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not required to prove that.  This is not some administrative gimmick that I or An Foras Tionscal or the Department engage in.  It is a statutory provision which I might read for the Deputy. An Foras Tionscal, like any other organisation, must have regard to their terms of reference, particularly when these are laid down by statute.  Section 2 of the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, as passed by this House, reads:</P>
      <P>wherever the Board&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, An Foras Tionscal&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>are of opinion that there are sound <Col N="1051" /> reasons why an industrial undertaking cannot be established or developed in the undeveloped areas and that the undertaking is, having regard to its size, character or the probable extent to which its products are likely to be exported, of exceptional national importance...</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say the Board may make grants.</P>
    <P>The net point is that the Board must be of opinion that there are sound reasons why the industry could not be established in the undeveloped areas. While An Foras Tionscal must have regard to the Act in that respect, I can assure the Deputy they do not apply too rigidly these provisions to the proposals that come before them.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to deal with all the comments made in the debate but I should like to deal with one in particular. It was made by Deputy McQuillan.  I hope I am not very thin-skinned.  I generally am not so far as Deputy McQuillan is concerned but in the course of the debate on Tuesday, as reported in yesterday's daily Press referring to criticism offered by his Lordship, the Bishop of Cork, on Government administration, the Deputy said&mdash;I quote from yesterday's newspaper report of the debate which reads:</P>
    <P>The one churchman in this country who had his ear to the ground and criticised what happened was Dr. Lucey, but he had been sneered at by the politicians.</P>
    <P>I think it is very wrong for Deputy McQuillan to make such an allegation. We must all realise that a member of the Hierarchy has every right to comment on economic affairs.  I accept, as the teaching of the Church in this matter, the words of Very Reverend P.F. Cremin, D.D., J.U.D., Professor of Moral Theology and Canon Law of Maynooth in his address at the consecration of His Lordship, the Bishop of Clovne, in June, 1957, on the duties of Bishops.</P>
    <P>Dr. Cremin then said, as reported in the daily Press of 10th June, 1957:</P>
    <P>While it was not for the Bishops <Col N="1052" /> to say authoritatively what might be the best solution of a political problem, they were entitled to say whether any particular solution was contrary to the moral law.</P>
    <P>He then went on to deal at length with the special teaching authority of bishops and continued:</P>
    <P>That special teaching authority of the Bishops extended only to matters of faith and morals; it did not extend to matters in which there were no religious or moral issues, such as those of a purely political or economic nature.  On these, of course, a Bishop might speak as an ordinary citizen, or as a student of a subject in question.  But then any opinion he expressed could claim only such respect as attached to it because of the intrinsic value or the special competence which the speaker might enjoy.  And people were free to assess its worth in the same way as they would an opinion put forward by any other individual with comparable qualifications to speak on the subject.</P>
    <P>I continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>But the Bishops' teaching authority did extend to whatever fell within the Church's proper purpose and mission, which was the salvation of souls.  And so it extended to any matter of faith and morals, not merely to those matters which were purely or partly spiritual, but also to those which involved some religious or moral consideration, even though the matter in question in itself was such as would not ordinarily concern the Church's interest.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any reasonable person in politics or outside them could object in any way to this statement. Early this month, his Lordship.  Most Reverend Dr. Lucey, was reported in the Press as having said in his Confirmation address to the children of the parish of Rath and the Islands, County Cork:</P>
    <P>West Cork wants no hand-outs from the dispensers of patronage in Merrion Square or elsewhere.  It wants only justice, elementary social justice...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> I believe that to dispense patronage is understood by ordinary people as to do something discreditable and I take it that in his reference to the dispensers of patronage in Merrion Square his Lordship means the Government.  The Government try to carry out their functions in accordance with the law of the land and especially in accordance with the teachings of His Holiness, Pope John XXIII, as enunciated in his Encyclical, entitled <i>Mater et Magistra</i> without discriminating unjustly against any section or area.</P>
    <P>It is only to be expected that the Government cannot satisfy everybody and it is only natural that they will be criticised.  His Lordship has as much right as any citizen, and, perhaps, more in certain circumstances, to offer criticism. However, lest silence on my part would be construed as acquiescence, I, as a member of the Government who is also a member of his Lordship's flock, regretfully feel constrained to refer to the criticism I have just quoted, which, I feel, does not instil in the public respect for the civil authority.  I am very sorry that it came from such an exalted source.  I refer to that only because Deputy McQuillan raised it in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>To refer to other matters that were raised, perhaps I might go on to the references to the cost of living which were made, in particular, by Deputy Cosgrave, that is to say, the cost of living as affected by price control or lack of price control.  The policy of the Government is based on their view that competition is the most effective means of controlling prices.  Deputy Cosgrave subscribed to that point of view in the course of his speech on the Estimate.  It was also the considered view of the House when the Prices Act, 1958, was passed without a division.  At the same time, I would not wish anybody to get the impression that the Government would be slow to invoke the provisions of this Act, if that were necessary.  As Deputies know, the Act provides for the fixing by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of maximum prices for commodities where the prices charged are excessive owing to causes <Col N="1054" /> within the control of manufacturers or to undue labour costs and also where, by reason of the existence of restrictive practices, excessive prices are being or may be charged.</P>
    <P>In considering manufacturers' prices regard must be had, of course, to variations from time to time in production costs.  If production costs, including labour costs, increase, there must be a corresponding increase in the price of the product, unless an improvement in productivity helps to offset the burden of increased costs on industry.</P>
    <P>Many of our industries are dependent on imported raw materials and the House will agree that I or the Government have no control over the import prices.  Any significant increase in the cost of such materials must inevitably add to the cost of the end product.  Similarly, significant increases in labour costs will inescapably be reflected in higher prices, if the wages increases won are not warranted by a corresponding improvement in productivity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to my references to the eighth round of wage increases and, fairly enough, said he did not want to read anything into them that I did not intend.  He assessed what I said fairly well but, lest there may be any misunderstanding of what I meant, it was this: the eighth round was, as everybody knows, a status increase, in other words, an increase that made for a higher standard of living for the working population, and that is exactly what this Government and, I am sure, every member of the House wants to achieve.  The greater the gains they can win in that respect, the more everybody will be pleased with the results.  But, what I wanted to say and what I think I did say fairly clearly, is that we must have regard to the fact that wages increases as they occur must be matched by increased productivity, if we are to avoid increased costs.  Otherwise, wages increases of themselves would produce that spiral we want to avoid of wages chasing prices.  So that a policy in that connection which will advance the standard of living of our people in line with their productivity <Col N="1055" /> is the one that we all desire to achieve and the greater the increase on both sides in that respect, the greater will be our ultimate prosperity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned certain increases that were taking place in our cost of living.  It seems to me that some of the recent increases must be attributed to increases in production costs.  I am not saying that to lay the blame at the door of either workers or employers but we had achieved in the years from 1957 onwards relative stability in prices. There was that increase caused by the removal of some subsidies in 1957 but the February 1957 figure, before that, was 135 (base 1947=100); in August, 1957, the figure was 143. There was the immediate impact of the removal of subsidies.  That figure fluctuated.  It varied, but with relative stability right through 1958, 1959 and to early 1960, since when there has been a slight increase from 144 in February, 1960, to 154 in February of this year.  We had been seeking price stability and we had achieved it fairly well but I hope this recent trend of increase in prices will again stabilise itself and that people who have secured increased wages will be able to enjoy the full advantage of them.</P>
    <P>There were some references to our mining operations and, in particular, the operations at Tynagh.  I should like to allay any fears that people might have that those who own land are in any way at the mercy of the mining operators.  I should like to repeat, for the benefit of the people on whose lands mining operations are undertaken, what the position is&mdash;the legal position as far as prospecting is concerned and the rights and obligations of those on whose land prospecting is carried out.</P>
    <P>Under the Minerals Development Acts of 1940 and 1960, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is empowered to grant prospecting licences whenever it appears to him that there are minerals on or under any land and that such minerals are not being worked or are not being worked efficiently. Section 8 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, confers on the <Col N="1056" /> holder of a prospecting licence the right to enter on the land described in the licence and to carry out certain operations in search of minerals.  These operations include borings, sinking pits, removing water from old workings and digging and removing reasonable quantities of the minerals for the purpose of analysis, test, trial or experiment. A prospecting licence does not confer on the holder any right to engage in commercial production of minerals.</P>
    <P>The Acts provide that whenever damage to the surface of any mine or to mineral deposits or to water supplies or a nuisance is caused by the licensee exercising his rights under a prospecting licence the holder of the licence shall be liable to pay compensation for such damage or nuisance. The amount of compensation which should be paid may be agreed between the land owners and the licence holder, but in the absence of agreement, a procedure is available under the Acts by which the issue may be referred to the Mining Board which is an independent statutory body.  Any person claiming to be entitled to such compensation may apply to the Mining Board to determine the amount of the compensation which should be paid and, on the hearing of the application, the person claiming the compensation is entitled to appear before the Board and be legally represented and to adduce evidence.  The Board have discretion in regard to the costs of the parties in any proceedings.</P>
    <P>I may add that an applicant for a prospecting licence is required to satisfy the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to his character, financial standing and technical qualifications.  It is the general practice to require companies applying for prospecting licences, unless it is known that the companies are of high standing or have assets in the country already, to deposit certain sums with the Minister in advance of the issue of prospecting licences.  This is a safeguard to ensure that funds will be available to meet claims.</P>
    <P>I have spelled that out in detail because Galway Deputies have <Col N="1057" /> approached me.  Deputy Hogan O'Higgins has put down a number of questions and Deputy Millar and Deputy Carty have come to me about the feelings and the fears of the land owners in the Tynagh area.  For that reason, and so that they may be able to appraise their constituents of their rights in the matter of prospecting licences, I have gone into the matter in detail.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a subsequent operation.  If the prospecting indicates that mining operations would prove possible, then the prospector or anyone else is entitled to apply for a mining lease.  In that event the State makes an agreement with the lessee and ensures in that agreement that all interests are adequately safeguarded. Apart from that being ensured in the lease, the Mining Acts of 1940 and 1960 make adequate provision for such safeguards.  Again, if compensation is not agreed upon between the owner of the minerals, in this instance, and the mine operator, the matter is referred to the Mining Board, and in this case the compensation is usually paid out of the royalties from the earnings of the mining operator from the operations themselves.</P>
    <P>Of course, surface owners come into the reckoning here, too, and, again, when mining operations are engaged in, the surface owners have their remedies against the mining operator, remedies which are safeguarded by legislation.  As the House knows, there are two types of mining.  In open cast mining the operator has no choice.  If the minerals are on the surface he has to get them by open cast methods and if they are deep down he has to mine deep.  Deep mining is the one that causes the least disturbance to the land holder.  Open cast mining creates the difficulties to which Deputy Crotty referred.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I have had a number of consultations with representatives of the National Farmers' Association who represent the farmers in that area.  I had arranged to see the President of the N.F.A. on Tuesday of this week but by reason of the Estimate being taken I had to postpone the <Col N="1058" /> interview which will take place in a matter of days.  As a result of that meeting, and, perhaps, whatever other activities are being undertaken in the Department, I hope to resolve the difficulties of the farmers in that area sooner or later.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made that some Irishman was not getting as much assistance as a Scotsman who previously worked a mine in the Castlecomer area referred to by Deputy Crotty.  The facts are that an Irish group took over from the Scotsman and a technical assistance grant of £2,400 was promised, of which £600 has been paid.  The grant was related to 50 per cent. of the cost of certain work carried out by the company, the Firoda Collieries.  Last October, a shaft was erected and since then the Geological Survey Office has been unable to certify, because of flooding of the shaft, the amount of work done on which a further instalment of the grant could be paid.  The company have been told that they will have to clear the shaft before the Geological Survey Office can assess the amount forthcoming, and I think the ball is more or less at the feet of the company at this stage.  I think that gives Deputy Crotty the information he requires.</P>
    <P>There is another major matter to which I should like to refer.  To an extent, I am anticipating a question put down by Deputy Byrne, originally for today but postponed at his request to next Wednesday.  I did not intend to refer to the nitrogenous fertiliser factory in Arklow and, in particular, its location but two Deputies, Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy P. Brennan, referred to it yesterday in the House. Each gave his unequivocal approval to the site and told the House that represented the feelings of the people of the area.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, there has been adverse criticism in the Press of the site involved.  I should like to say that the closest possible consideration was given to this matter before the site at Shelton Abbey was ultimately selected.  Shelton Abbey is not only a building.  It is a townland, and a fairly extensive townland. I think I do not have to say <Col N="1059" /> that it is located in the Arklow Valley which is a rather restricted area in any event for industrial location.</P>
    <P>Selection of Arklow in the first instance was dictated by the decision to use pyrites as a raw material for the production of the nitrogenous fertiliser. Pyrites is a native raw material and there is an obligation on us to use native raw materials in so far as they can be economically used.  I stress the word &ldquo;economically&rdquo; in particular relation to the production of fertiliser. Pyrites is produced commercially higher up in the Avoca Valley.  It can be brought by pipe line to a factory that wants to use it, in the region of the neighbourhood of the mining operations.</P>
    <P>It was, from the economic point of view, necessary to locate the factory in the Arklow area and the available sites in Arklow were examined. Reasonably enough, those sites were very restricted.  There was the site now decided upon; there was the portion of the site in the possession of the St. Patrick's Copper Mines which is used as a spoil dump by the mine; and there was the ground at the harbour which has since been suggested by the Earl of Wicklow as suitable.  Each of these sites was very closely examined.</P>
    <P>The spoil dump location would be quite unsuitable as the dumped material was so soft that it would be unable to bear any buildings whatever. The harbour site, portion of which is the property of the Earl of Wicklow, was found to be unsuitable for many reasons.  In the first place, it was too small, the acreage being something like 20 to 25 acres.  The requirements of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory are 40 acres.  Therefore, it would not supply nearly sufficient space to accommodate the proposed factory and of course it would not provide space for the expansion of the factory itself and for the establishment of subsidiary industries that are likely to follow by reason of the production of ammonia on that particular site.</P>
    <P>As well as that, the harbour site is low-lying and is partly in a swamp. Very substantial filling would be required and that filling would have to be brought a considerable distance. <Col N="1060" /> In addition, the other foundations are very poor and would require an exceptional amount of piling work as the subsoil consists mainly of fine sand and estuarine silt not capable of supporting the type of roads it would have to bear without expensive piling which would have to be brought down to bedrock, a total of 64 feet.</P>
    <P>I should like to explain in this connection that the site may be suitable for other forms of industry but in the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers, there is compression machinery which is placed on the floors which must be separated from the building itself by a quarter of an inch or half an inch in order to avoid the effect of vibration on the building.  The machinery generally is very heavy and the extent of piling required would be so expensive as to endanger the economy of the whole operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, this site is a difficult location from the point of view of transport.  A road connection would have been possible only if a level crossing were possible at the northern end of the Arklow bridge and would require the removal of one or two houses.  That may not be a big consideration but over and above that, the particular location, if anybody is familiar with it, is really difficult from the traffic point of view.  The county manager would object to any greater extensive use of the roadway because even in ordinary times, and particularly at tourist times, this is a bottleneck, a narrow bridge coming from the northern side of the town to the town itself.</P>
    <P>In the case of the existing site, that would be avoided because the site is beside the Avoca River which runs immediately beside the railway and road which leads to Gorey.  The traffic to the factory and from the factory bearing the nitrogenous fertiliser to the southern parts of the country would be able to by-pass Arklow town itself, with the making of a road from the factory, which is some distance from the harbour, to join the Dublin road on the other side.  That means traffic going northwards and north-westwards would be able to avoid the town.  I can assure <Col N="1061" /> the House that that is essential because in this respect there are several other matters that are important.  The cooling water necessary and the parties themselves would, if the harbour site were selected, have to be taken over very much longer distances and the high tension power supply would have involved difficulty because of the proximity of houses and the adjacent tourist amenities which were developed recently at substantial cost to the local authority, with the assistance of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be familiar with this very desirable amenity which is beside the harbour where they have extensive recreation grounds, a swimming pool and lagoon for boating.  If the site were at all suitable, the factory would have to be established up against that amenity.  However, to come back to Shelton Abbey.  It has the advantage that the factory would be screened from public view and what I think is important, and which should allay the fears of those people who are apprehensive about the location of the factory there, it can be screened and will be screened from Shelton Abbey itself which, as Deputies know, is now a forestry school.</P>
    <P>Shelton Abbey looks towards Arklow town.  In front of it is a long meadow possibly half a mile in length and very extensive in acreage.  It bears away to the right towards the river and it is in that corner of the site that the factory will be established, a considerable distance from the forestry school.  There will be a line of trees and possibly, if necessary, an embankment which will be landscaped which will seclude the factory from the house. The road on the other side, which will be quite near the factory and which is quite a scenic road, is already so covered by trees on the factory side that even the highest chimney the factory will erect will be invisible from the road.</P>
    <P>I want to assure everybody that the gravest consideration was given to the selection of the site and it was proved after close examination that this was the only site available.  As well as that, not only is it suitable from the <Col N="1062" /> point of view of location, but it requires the minimum of development work. Test boreholes showed that the subsoil consisted of coarse gravel, cobbles and boulders and piling work would be limited only to the very heavy structures and be limited piling at that, such as for compressors and other heavy machinery.  As well as that, the fuel oil necessary can be brought from the harbour to the site by pipeline.</P>
    <P>I also want to say that the authorities and interests who might in any way be affected, or who ought be consulted, were consulted and Bord Fáilte are quite happy about the location of the factory on this site.  I hope what I have said will allay any fears in those people who have doubts about the location of this particular site and that the House will agree with what has been expressed by local Deputies as the feeling of the local people themselves. They consider it a very suitable site and it will not be an obstruction to any aesthetic view at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Leneghan asked whether this nitrogenous fertiliser factory was the one which was promised&mdash;I think that was the word he used&mdash;to Ballina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the price of nitrogenous manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what factory Deputy Leneghan was referring to, but in the background planning of this factory, it was decided that native raw materials would be used to whatever extent was possible in accordance with the economics of production of nitrogenous fertiliser.  It was thought at one time that the gasification could be produced by milled peat.  Bord na <Col N="1063" /> Móna had acquired the Blackwater bog in Offaly and they told the Government that they had this bog ready for operation and asked would they use it for the purposes of electricity or for the purposes of a nitrogenous fertiliser factory.</P>
      <P>At that time, there was a very significant reduction in the price of nitrogenous fertilisers being imported into this country.  We were getting them in here from various countries at prices lower than the prices that obtained in the country that produced them for export to us.  It became apparent then that the production of nitrogenous fertiliser from gas produced from peat and from whatever factor produced the sulphur would not be competitive with the then prevailing prices.  It was decided to release the bog in Blackwater to Bord na Móna for E.S.B. purposes and there is a power station being built there at present.</P>
      <P>The Committee were asked to keep the prospects of the production of nitrogenous fertiliser under review and to plan a factory based on native raw material and they were told that when it became apparent that we could produce nitrogenous fertiliser at a price competitive with the imported prices, we would do so.  The Committee kept the matter under review and a lot of costings were submitted voluntarily by world-famed companies and eventually the majority of the companies interested said that we could produce nitrogenous fertilisers at a competitive price even with the reduced import prices from native pyrites and fuel oil produced in the refinery at Cork Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was on that basis that the decision was taken to proceed and I want to assure the House that it was only on the basis that the fertiliser can be produced at prices competitive with import prices that the matter has been undertaken at all.  I have given the House the assurance that the industry will not have to be subsidised, nor will the farmers have to pay more for their fertiliser.  I am confident that these two undertakings <Col N="1064" /> will be carried out by me or by any other Minister who comes after me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I brought Deputy Leneghan into it, too.  I am loath to keep the House any longer and if I do not refer to certain points, it is not through any discourtesy to the Deputies who raised them.  I think, in the interests of expedition, I ought to conclude now, but I should like to refer to what Deputy Lalor said about distribution in the retail trade and to the suggestion that there should be some restriction on retail outlets.  The organisation catering for the retail trade has been making representations for the past 25 years or so for such restrictions.</P>
      <P>I think any Minister, or anybody else with responsibility, will realise that such restrictions would be difficult to impose and might well make for inefficiency in the distribution trade in this respect.  I am not suggesting that there is inefficiency but this is a competitive era when various restrictions on trade of all descriptions have been removed and in such an era it behoves those in business to make the best use of such facilities as are available to them.  Those who will make use of these facilities and who have goodwill in their local communities will be able to maintain their business and their customers and, by increased efficiency in the presentation of their goods, attract new customers as well.  I think I should conclude now and apologise to those Deputies who made points to which I have not had time to reply.</P>

      <P>I propose to follow the usual practice by taking Votes 8 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vote 8 covers the salaries and incidental expenses of the various staffs needed to deal with the services for which provision is made in Vote 9.  I may mention that a certain amount of reorganisation of staff has recently been carried out with a view to increasing efficiency.  The increase of £79,200 over last year's provision is due almost <Col N="1066" /> entirely to the pay increases recently granted to all classes of civil servants.</P>
    <P>The increase in Vote 9 of £1,331,000 over last year's provision is mainly due to an expansion of activities and, to some extent, to wage increases.  The services covered by this Vote are numerous and varied.  They comprise the erection and maintenance of State buildings, the care of other State property such as harbours, parks and national monuments, the erection and improvement of primary schools, the execution of arterial drainage schemes and many minor miscellaneous services. The services can be divided into two main classes, architectural works and engineering works.</P>
    <P>The two main classes of services are covered by two major subheads of the Vote, viz. subheads B and J. 2.  Subhead B, which totals £3,320,000 contains the provision for the erection, reconstruction and improvement of public buildings and for engineering works other than arterial drainage. Subhead J. 2, which totals just over £1,000,000, contains the provision for arterial drainage construction works. These are paralleled by the next two largest subheads&mdash;Subhead C, amounting to £720,000, which covers the maintenance of State property, and Subhead K, amounting to £518,000, which covers the provision and maintenance of the machinery required for the engineering services.  Most of the remaining subheads relate to what may be regarded as the ordinary &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; activities of the Office of Public Works&mdash;furnishing, heating, lighting and cleaning of the various State properties, and the payment of rents, rates and postal and telephone charges.</P>
    <P>About half the total of Subhead A &mdash;Purchase of Sites and Buildings&mdash; relates to the purchase of sites and buildings for the Garda Síochána.  As was mentioned by my predecessor last year, a comprehensive programme for the erection of new Garda Stations has been undertaken.</P>
    <P>Deputies have already been furnished with a statement setting out the particulars making up the bulk provision for Subhead B and it is not, I think, necessary for me to go into the details. <Col N="1067" /> A few items, however, merit special mention.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for expenditure on the extension to Leinster House, which is so badly needed for Ministers and the members and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and also for members of the Press Gallery.  The plans are well advanced; tenders will be invited this month and it is reasonable to expect that building operations will commence in June.</P>
    <P>Work on the construction of the Garden of Remembrance at Parnell Square is making good progress.  The original proposal for the Memorial Sculpture was for a central feature comprising a monument representing Éire guarded by four warriors of the provinces with a background of patriots in bas-relief, but consideration is now being given to an alternative which has been suggested by the sculptor, namely, the metamorphosis of the Children of Lir, which may provide a more appropriate feature for the setting of the Garden.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, new headquarter offices for the Department of Health and Social Welfare are to be erected on a portion of the former Beggar's Bush Barracks at Haddington Road.  Aras Mhic Dhiarmada, the present headquarters of the Department of Social Welfare, will be handed back to Córas Iompair Éireann when the new building is ready for occupation.</P>
    <P>The planning of the new structure, which will be 20 storeys in height, is proceeding, and it is hoped to have tenders invited for its construction before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out last year, many of the buildings at Dublin Castle which are being used as Government offices are in a critical condition and the stage has long ago been reached when the provision of new buildings was essential. Work on the rebuilding of the cross block between the Upper and Lower Castle yards is proceeding and good progress has been made on the preparation of plans for a new Stamping Branch.  Deputies are aware that some very interesting archaeological <Col N="1068" /> discoveries were made during building operations on the cross block site and I have arranged for a full report to be prepared.  I hope to have this by 1st June.</P>
    <P>Extensive improvements have already been completed at Dún Laoghaire mail boat pier, and still further works are being done.  These include the erection of a permanent shelter at the side of the east approach road with a sailing ticket kiosk, the provision of cranes for handling cars on the mail boat pier, the erection of a left luggage office, new toilet accommodation, improvement of the approach roads, the extension on the west side of the upper deck of the pier, duplication at the west side entrance of the facilities already provided on the east side.  A sum of £90,000 is provided for a car-ferry terminal which the Minister for Transport and Power hopes to arrange for.  If the present plans mature the scheme will involve interference with direct access to the sea by the National Yacht Club.  The Commissioners of Public Works have had discussions with the club and will do what they can to meet the club's requirements.</P>
    <P>The amount being provided for improved accommodation for the Garda Síochána is substantial.  Satisfactory progress is being made with the new training centre for Garda recruits at Templemore which is expected to be completed about the middle of 1963.  Progress on the erection of new Garda stations and improvement of existing stations also continues and will be reflected in increased building operations in the current year.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, a substantial improvement scheme has been completed at the Bridewell station; work is in progress on the erection of a new station at Cabra; while tenders for a new divisional headquarters at Crumlin will be invited in about 4 months' time.  In addition, the planning of new stations at Clondalkin, Raheny and Rathmines is in progress.</P>
    <P>In the provinces a new divisional headquarters was completed at Roscommon last year, and a new district <Col N="1069" /> headquarters is being erected at Bantry, Co. Cork.  Plans for a new district headquarters at Ballyconnell, Co. Cavan, have been completed.  New stations are being built at Grangemockler, Co. Tipperary, Glynn, Co. Wexford, Enfield, Co. Meath, Cloone, Co. Leitrim, and Collooney, Co. Sligo, and work is expected to commence shortly at Banagher, Co. Offaly; Kingscourt and Killeshandra, Co. Cavan; Strokestown, Co. Roscommon; Castle-bellingham, Co. Louth; Clontibret, Co. Monaghan; Portumna and Ahascragh, Co. Galway; Castlefin and Burtonport, Co. Donegal, and Killala, Co. Mayo. Several other cases are in various stages of development.  The total programme covers the erection of some 200 new stations, each of which will include living accommodation for at least one married Garda.</P>
    <P>Under Irish Governments, over 1,500 new schools have been built and a large number of improvement schemes have been carried out.  The total cost to the State is nearly £18 million to date. In the past nine years, there has been a marked acceleration in the building programme.  In that period, 616 new schools with accommodation for 100,000 pupils, and 334 major improvement schemes affecting 78,000 pupils were completed at a cost to the State of £11½ million.  As a matter of interest I give the record for each decade since 1920-21 inclusive:</P>

    <P>A record figure for State expenditure was reached in the year ended 31st March, 1962 when £1.7 million was spent, 81 new schools, with accommodation for 11,680 pupils, and 50 major improvement schemes affecting some 9,000 pupils being completed. Ninety-eight new schools and 65 major improvement schemes are under construction <Col N="1070" /> at present, and it is hoped that some 130 new contracts will be placed this year.  In order to meet this programme, a sum of £1.9 million is being provided for 1962/63.  This is the highest amount ever provided for the service.</P>
    <P>In recent years, people have become more school conscious and the proposals for new schools are now very great indeed.  The available information indicates that some 750 schools are in need of replacement and over 300 others need to be improved by major works.  All the time, of course, there will be schools reaching the state when they must be replaced to the extent of about 40 a year.  Allowing for this, to clear the arrears will take at least ten or 12 years, and a State expenditure of up to £20 million, at present prices, will be incurred.</P>
    <P>I have given quite a deal of time and thought to the entire question of primary school buildings.  Our present planning regulations were introduced in 1935, to replace those of 1908, but since then dramatic changes have taken place in the available forms of construction, planning standards and educational methods, and I regret to say that it is apparent to me anyway that this country has not kept up with these developments.</P>
    <P>At the present time in Ireland there is a growing demand for school buildings, and while it is true to state that this year a record expenditure has been made on national schools, we must not forget, also, that the annual wastage rate is around 50 per cent. of the number completed.  I am satisfied that a complete reappraisal of the position must be made, and certain far-reaching decisions must also be arrived at.</P>
    <P>Recently a party consisting of members of the staffs of the Office of Public Works and the Department of Education with a representative of the Managers' Association and an independent chartered quantity surveyor visited Great Britain to see some of the prefabricated structures erected and being erected.  Great strides have been made there in the past few years and a number of <Col N="1071" /> independent systems have been highly developed.  Much use of these has been made in school building under the aegis of the Ministry of Education. I understand that in speed of erection there are definite advantages and that the buildings can be aesthetically attractive.  Whether the prefabrication method could be successfully and economically applied to school building here is being thoroughly examined.</P>
    <P>A provision of £140,000 has been made for the major fishery harbours project which envisages large scale improvements at a number of centres recommended for development by the Swedish engineering expert, Mr. Bjuke, who was commissioned by the Government to advise on various aspects of the fishing industry. Preparatory works in the nature of boring surveys, soil sampling, and model investigations are under way and it is hoped to commence construction works at two sites, namely, Killybegs and Castletownbere, before the end of the current financial year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £50,000 has been provided for improvement works in fishery interests at other small harbours around the coast as follows: Ballinacarta, Burtonport, Greencastle and Portaleen, County Donegal; Clogherhead, County Louth; Enniscrone, County Sligo; and Ballyhack and Cahore, County Wexford.  Provision is also included for a model investigation in connection with proposed improvement works at Kilmore Quay, County Wexford.</P>
    <P>A large amount of building work in agricultural interests is in hands and in the planning stage and improvement works are under way or due to start during the year at several centres including the agricultural schools at Athenry, Ballyhaise and Clonakilty and at the Veterinary College, Ballsbridge Abbotstown Farm and the Munster Institute.</P>
    <P>Almost £¼ million is being provided for new works for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at various places throughout the country, the largest single item being for the proposed new central sorting office <Col N="1072" /> in Dublin, on which work has now commenced.</P>
    <P>The second largest Subhead, J.2 deals with arterial drainage construction works and the other J. Subheads cover associated services.  The accelerated arterial drainage programme approved a few years ago is proceeding. Works are in hands on four major catchments &mdash; Corrib-Clare benefiting parts of Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon; Inny in Counties Cavan, Longford, Meath and Westmeath; Maine in County Kerry; Moy in Counties Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo; on one minor catchment &mdash; Broadmeadow benefiting portions of Counties Dublin and Meath; and on two embankment units &mdash;the Fergus estuary in County Clare and the Shannon estuary (Coonagh section) protecting lands in Counties Limerick and Clare.  Two schemes&mdash; Ballyteigue and Kilmore in County Wexford, and the Deele and Swillyburn in County Donegal&mdash;were completed during the year.  The total cost of all works completed and in hand amounts to £14½ million benefiting an area of 290,000 acres of agricultural land and opening up about 826,000 acres of bog for development.</P>
    <P>It is expected to commence works in the Killimor, Galway, minor catchment shortly and later in the year on the major Deel Catchment in Counties Limerick and Cork.  Survey and design work will continue on the Boyne affecting Counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, Westmeath, Offaly and Kildare; the Erne in Counties Cavan, Leitrim, Longford, and Monaghan; the Suir in Counties Tipperary and Waterford; the Maigue in Counties Limerick and Tipperary; and CorribMask catchments affecting Counties Galway and Mayo, and on the rest of the Shannon estuary embankments protecting lands in Clare and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The extension of the main arterial drainage programme to deal with intermediate rivers, that is, small independent catchments, was slow in the initial stages.  Work on one scheme, the Swilly embankments in County Donegal, has been commenced; a tender has been accepted for the Owvane in County Cork, the first 1945 <Col N="1073" /> Act scheme to be carried out by contract; the Duff in Sligo and Leitrim will be advertised for contract very soon and later in the year the Matt or Ring River in County Dublin, the Brickey in County Waterford and the Abbey in Donegal will also be advertised. Design work is proceeding on schemes for the Abbey, Donegal, the Assaly, Wexford and the Carrigahorig, Tipperary, and surveys will be done this year on the Glenamoy, Mayo, Knockcroghery or Ballyglass, Roscommon, and the Creegh, Clare.  The target of having four separate schemes at the works stage each year will soon be reached.</P>
    <P>During last year, the engineers of the Office of Public Works and the Electricity Supply Board presented their joint report on a first stage of investigations into the River Shannon flood problem in the light of the Rydell report.  The Government have decided that the detailed engineering surveys etc., recommended in the report will be undertaken as soon as the necessary staff can be made available for the purpose.  A comprehensive statement on this matter will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be well to recount briefly the various stages in the development of a drainage scheme. The catchment has to be surveyed, the data obtained, plotted and studied, and a design of works evolved.  This work must be carefully done by skilled men and the time consumed on it is unavoidable to get good results without wasteful expenditure.  A formal scheme is then prepared.  This is a comprehensive document embodying detailed maps and showing the works proposed to be carried out and proposed interference with properties.  The scheme has to go on exhibition locally and notices must be served on the persons whose property will be interfered with.  Persons affected may lodge observations within a month.  The local authority has three months in which to lodge observations.  All observations have to be considered by the Commissioners who then have to consult with certain other Government Departments. Finally the scheme is submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation. <Col N="1074" /> All these steps can take several years for a large scheme and even for the small intermediate schemes, up to two years are needed. The reason I go into detail in this connection is that, first, I had to obtain this information for my own benefit and, secondly, I appreciate the fact that there are many new Deputies here to whom this explanatory statement may be of assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that there are priority lists for the major and minor catchments.  When the Act was passed it was necessary to have such lists to avoid complete chaos.  These were prepared on the best information available.  In the early years slight modifications were made but latterly it has been decided by successive Governments that these lists would be adhered to and it is not proposed to depart from them now when we are roughly half way through the programme.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable attention focussed recently on flooding arising from breached embankments and storm damage, and many seem to think that the Commissioners of Public Works are responsible for making good the damage and for the upkeep of embankments.  That is not so.  The Commissioners' responsibility begins only when what is termed an &ldquo;existing embankment&rdquo; has been formally transferred to them by Order under Section 31 of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  An &ldquo;existing embankment&rdquo; as defined in the Act is one which protects lands that are, or have been, the subject of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts.  Only an existing embankment can be transferred and the transfer order is not made until the Commissioners are in a position to commence works.  The Department of Lands have some powers in relation to the maintenance of a limited number of embankments in respect of which the Land Commission administers trust funds, but the responsibility for embankments rests primarily on the landowners.</P>
    <P>It is well that this should be clearly understood and I would strongly urge the farmers concerned to carry out themselves repairs which are often within their competence in the early <Col N="1075" /> stages and not to be waiting until the damage is so great that they have to be calling on local county councillors and Deputies to make representations to the State to come to their aid when the initial repairs have been neglected.</P>
    <P>It has been indicated in reply to questions in this House that a Coast Protection Bill will be introduced this year.  This Bill will deal with coast erosion as such, that is, encroachment by the sea that is a continuing process causing progressive damage and not occasional flooding caused by storms or other abnormal occurrences.</P>
    <P>The remaining subheads of the Vote do not I think call for any special comment but Deputies will not that there is an increase of £41,000 in Subhead C, Maintenance and Supplies, which bears the cost of maintaining State buildings, parks, harbours and national monuments.</P>
    <P>My predecessor made mention here last year how shortage of staff was hampering progress with our work on the preservation of national monuments in State care.  I am very conscious of the importance of our ancient monuments from both the national and the tourist point of view and I share the view of many others that perhaps we have not done enough to preserve our heritage of monuments and to make them attractive and instructive for our own people and for visitors to our country. Within the past few months, we have succeeded in getting two additional clerks of works and have got approval for the recruitment of an additional assistant inspector.  There is an increased provision in Subhead C this year for work on the preservation of the monuments in State care and I have recently been discussing with the National Monuments Council the whole question of the future policy in regard to the Monuments service and I hope that we can look forward to a considerable increase over what has been done in the past in regard to this small but important service.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, there is one item to which I would like to draw particular attention, even though it does <Col N="1076" /> not appear in either Vote 8 or Vote 9. This is the restoration of Kilmainham Jail.  As Deputies will remember, the building was handed over in May, 1960, to a voluntary body which had been set up with the object of having the premises restored.  Although less than two years have since elapsed and although the project is being carried out only as a spare-time activity by those engaged on it, a considerable part of the scheme has been already completed&mdash;and this notwithstanding an outbreak of fire last January which damaged some of the work already done.  It gives me great pleasure to pay tribute here to those responsible.  The trustees, the committee of management and the large body of voluntary workers are all giving of their time, energy and talents most generously and certainly deserve great credit.  I am sure all here will join with me in paying this well deserved tribute for what has been done to date and in expressing the hope that the efforts of the Committee and voluntary workers will reach a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board of Works&rdquo; which is the usual expression to describe my Office often comes in for more criticism than many Government Departments combined.  A certain amount of this is perhaps deserved but in all Government Departments the world over, &ldquo;the Ministry of Works&rdquo; inevitably has to endure such censure. In the main, we are the executing agent for most Departments of State and our task is an unenviable one at times.  I can assure the members of the House, however, that we shall continue to be as co-operative as possible, and if any member has any particular problem, I will be only too pleased to discuss the matter with him, personally, at any time.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for affording me a copy of his brief.  I also want to wish him well as this is his first Estimate.  I have some remarks to make about it and some faults to find in it.  I always commence <Col N="1077" /> my address on any Estimate by referring to my own constituency. That has been pressed upon me continuously by various Fianna Fáil Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries. When an Estimate comes out and I get the opportunity of skimming through it, I discover that large sums of money, millions of money in some cases, are being spent in various parts of the country and that very little of it or none at all, finds its way into my constituency.</P>
    <P>In the reconstruction of Leinster House, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will draw the attention of his Department to the necessity for providing rooms that will be smaller than the existing Committee rooms, rooms in which Deputies could meet Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision for three such rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary and I compliment him.  I do not want to labour that but every Deputy knows the difficulty he has when his constituents or members of his county council come to Leinster House, that they have to stand around in corridors because there is no fixed place for them to go to meet a Minister.  That is a great improvement.</P>
      <P>I also suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the ventilation in this House is something to which attention should be given.  I am sure he has the matter in hand. This was an old house and it must have been quite a problem for the Board of Works to take it over and make it suitable for its present function.  If the conditions which obtain here obtained in offices and factories outside&mdash;I have said this before&mdash;the owners of such premises would be prosecuted under the Factories Act.  The atmosphere here is certainly not healthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Garden of Remembrance in Parnell Square, it is good to know that progress is being made.  Perhaps it is just as well that, <Col N="1078" /> instead of having a whole group of statuary, there will be just the Children of Lir.  Certainly that would be more symbolical.</P>
    <P>I note the proposal to construct new Government offices on portion of Beggar's Bush Barracks in Haddington Road.  When these offices are completed, the intention is to move the staffs of the Department of Social Welfare at present housed in Busarás out to Beggar's Bush.  I should like to know for what purpose Córas Iompair Éireann require the offices now occupied by the staffs of the Department of Social Welfare.  Córas Iompair Éireann is shrinking every year.  It is now only a matter of the scrap-iron men scrapping the railways. When that is finished, there will only be the bus transport.  I am sure they have enough offices to cope with that. They have very fine offices in Kings-bridge and on the Quays.  This whole question should be re-examined.  The possibility is that the new offices at Beggar's Bush could be used for some purposes other than housing the staffs of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Civil servants in Dublin Castle are working under the most dreadful conditions. The offices are unsafe.  If there is to be any evacuation to Haddington Road, it is the staffs in Dublin Castle who should be sent out there.  Even if the buildings in Dublin Castle are made safe, there will still be a grave problem of overcrowding. Indeed, the whole premises are somewhat antediluvian.</P>
    <P>I do not criticise this outlay of £90,000 for a car ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire.  It is an important port. However, I am sure I shall be excused if I ask why money is always being pumped into Dún Laoghaire?  Rosslare is an entry port.  It has not been plugged by British Railways for some reason or other, but it is able to deal with traffic with much more dispatch than Dún Laoghaire, especially in the peak periods.  These moneys are being justified on the ground of the enormous rush that comes at Dún Laoghaire.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has no responsibility but why, in the name of heaven, do they not divert some of the traffic to some other ports?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the Parliamentary Secretary has no responsibility.  I understand the position.  With regard to Garda barracks, I see that in counties Dublin, Cork, Roscommon, Wexford, Leitrim, Sligo, Offaly, Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Galway and Mayo, all sorts of activities are going on, improving and building Garda barracks.  There is not one barracks listed in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about time someone thought of paying that tribute. When the emergency came, the Garda in Waterford were then housed in the military barracks.  That is now empty. The Garda were removed from that central position&mdash;incidentally, the military barracks had been modernised&mdash; down to the old County Club at Adelphi Terrace on the edge of the city.  They have been there ever since. The old County Club is a most unsuitable building.  It is draughty; it is holed; it is out of date.  If any new barracks are to be built, or new accommodation to be provided for the Garda, then Waterford city has a claim.</P>
      <P>With regard to schools, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the planning regulations introduced in 1935 to replace those of 1890.  He said we have not caught up with developments. I compliment him on that approach because there is nothing like making advances.  I should like to make a suggestion.  Perhaps the architects and engineers in the Office of Public Works will not like this, but I do not make the suggestion with any intention of criticising them.  I was at the opening of two new schools recently.  The layout has improved considerably in recent years, but it is imperative that we should keep up with developments abroad.  I suggest that the Minister should hold a public competition for a school to seat 600 pupils, 200 pupils, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one of the new schools I saw opened recently, there is a limestone mural portraying the saint to whom the <Col N="1080" /> school is dedicated.  I think that is an excellent idea.  I suggest that in the competition I commend to the Minister's attention, there should be included in the specifications and plans a piece of sculpture, or a painting, or a mural of some kind, so that the Office of Public Works might act as a patron of the arts, so to speak, as well as providing the accommodation.</P>
    <P>I defer to the Office of Public Works in the matter because they deserve to be complimented on the manner in which they furnish offices.  Whoever plans the furnishing certainly knows his job.  These things do not just happen by accident; there has to be planning.  As far as furnishing goes, the Office of Public Works are doing a splendid job.  I hope they will continue that wholly commendable work. I am not being old-fashioned in this regard.  I have seen some of the modern offices and they are not as nice as some of the older ones.  That is a matter which, I am sure, the Parliamentary Secretary will take up with his officers.  I would commend to him what I have suggested about having a competition for the plans of schools and even public buildings occasionally.</P>
    <P>Now, here is an old bone of contention with me&mdash;fishery harbours. This is one of the principal mysteries of Government administration that I cannot fully understand.  I took the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor to task the year before last and last year because he had spent £100,000 on a port, Greencastle, in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I went to the trouble to find out how much fish was landed at Greencastle last year.  I discovered that they landed 4,000 boxes of fish.  For ten years I have been saying that the port of Dunmore East in County Waterford lands more fish than all the other fishing ports in Ireland put together.</P>
    <P>There is provision for a sum of £140,000 for fishing harbours this year&mdash;Killybegs and Castletownbere. A fish factory was opened at Killybegs a couple of years ago and a sum of £250,000 was lost.  There were three trawlers which should have been called the <i>Pinta</i>, the <i>Nina</i> and the <Col N="1081" /><i>Santa Maria</i>.  I do not know what their names were but they were responsible for a big loss.  They were based at Killybegs at the commencement of what was called a noble enterprise which cost the taxpayers £250,000.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far the Parliamentary Secretary can go in answering all these points.  I should like him to know that the money diverted to fishing harbours for years past has been devoted to fishing harbours which do not catch the amount of fish that Dunmore East catches and which do not justify the present expenditure on them.</P>
    <P>There is a famous fish factory in Galway and another in Castletownbere. Of course there was the wonderful one in Killybegs that lost all the money.  Then we had the miserable one that was built in Dunmore East which would not be big enough to deal with lollipops not to talk of the huge fish catches that come into it.  These small ports catch 4,000 boxes of fish in the year, 7,000 boxes or 70,000 boxes.  Just now we hear of Killybegs with 100,000 boxes.  It may be said to me that the £140,000 is money well spent.  At Dunmore East we landed 300,000 boxes of fish last year and the year before and the year before that again.</P>
    <P>We do not know where we stand as regards the Bjuke Report.  We were told that a great fishing port was about to be constructed at a cost of £250,000 at Passage East, County Waterford. We then heard that the river at Passage East runs too fast for a port to be built there and that whatever borings were going on there&mdash;and &ldquo;borings&rdquo; is the right word &mdash; had ceased.  Nobody knows&mdash;or maybe it has been kept a secret&mdash;whether a fishing port will be built at Passage East or whether the Department will relent and go to Dunmore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not reported even yet?  I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for that information. This £140,000 will be spent on Killybegs and Castletownbere and a further sum of £50,000 will be spent in County Donegal.  I am not a Donegal man but I have spent many a happy day in Donegal.  However, they must have some kind of magnet in the mountains in Donegal which can draw all this money to it.  In the South of Ireland we are catching much more fish but we cannot get a financial break at all.  A small work will be done in the river at Ballyhack.  That is all we shall get out of it.</P>
      <P>A sum of £250,000 is being provided for post offices.  There are to be two central sorting offices in Dublin.  We need all these things.  I now come to arterial drainage, the second largest subhead.  The total cost of all works completed and in hands amounts to £14½ millions benefiting an area of 290,000 acres of agricultural land and opening up about 86,000 acres of bog development.  Arterial drainage is rather wonderful as is the reclamation of land.  However, I have seen much land reclaimed when it would have been better to allow the water to stay on it.  I have seen much waste, rocks and unpassable swamps after so-called drainage works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw it in the West of Ireland and I thought to myself that the money could have been better spent there on something that would be of more lasting benefit to the people. When we have this list of arterial drainage work before us and when we read of an expenditure of £14½ millions we wonder if that expenditure is for the purpose of improving the land or merely to give hand-outs.  At that rate, it would be better to carry out work in an area and then finish with it in the same way as they used to build piers in fields and erect a statue of some person.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is the first person to say that. I asked his two predecessors about it and they did not say that.  I had an idea the Parliamentary Secretary did not think it economically justifiable because he switched moneys.  He started to repair embankments in the Shannon in County Limerick.  Limerick land is very good land and the expenditure would be far more justifiable there.  I thought to myself that the Parliamentary Secretary from Limerick, apart from doing anything for Limerick, knows the Limerick land.  He has probably seen so much money pumped into draining the land that is not so good or is practically useless that he has come along to this as a kind of justification.</P>

      <P>I should commend you if you did.  Still on the subject of arterial drainage, it is said in the Minister's statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected to commence works in the Killimor, Galway, minor catchment shortly and later in the year on the major Deel Catchment in Counties Limerick and Cork. Survey and design work will continue on the Boyne affecting Counties Louth, Meath, Cavan, Westmeath, Offaly and Kildare; the Erne <Col N="1084" /> in Counties Cavan, Leitrim, Longford, and Monaghan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and here comes the poor Suir, like the favourite at the Curragh yesterday:</P>
    <P>the Suir in Counties Tipperary and Waterford; the Maigue in Counties Limerick and Tipperary; and CorribMask catchments affecting Counties Galway and Mayo, and on the rest of the Shannon estuary embankments protecting lands in Clare and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I have here the priority list given to me by the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor and I note that the Suir is No. 15.  I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that the land behind the embankments in the Portlaw area, around Fiddown and further up into Tipperary is of first class quality.  Some of it when dry in summer is fine fattening land and some of it, believe it or not, is highly rated land.  That scheme should be brought forward.  Not only would it be of national benefit to have this land drained but it would be doubly beneficial to have land of such good quality brought into production.  We have here also all these intermediate rivers and, again, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bring Waterford a little forward.</P>
    <P>I have an idea how a fishery harbour is drawn to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary but how does one bring coast erosion to his attention? I know that a Bill dealing with the matter is being introduced but how does coast erosion become the child of the Office of Public Works?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance was able to &ldquo;pull a fast one&rdquo; and get money for Rosslare before any Bill came along.  I have seen the fine strand of Tramore with the tide flowing right through all the embankments to the Back Strand.  Nobody would assist us.  The county council put up some barriers and fenced the tide back for a <Col N="1085" /> bit but last year it came through again. I put down some Parliamentary Questions about it but nobody would come to our aid.  The county council made some use of the railway sleepers that the Minister for Transport and Power was peddling down there.  They bought some and put them along the strand in an attempt to keep the water back. Now there have been breaches of that barrier also.  I have heard appeals here by Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Corish and they did not fall on ears that were deaf in the case of the Minister for Finance as far as Rosslare was concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary should think of the great strand, Tráigh Mhór, and what is likely to happen in another bad season.</P>
      <P>Very good work has been done by the National Monuments Council, as exemplified by the job they did at Jerpoint Abbey, near Thomastown.  It was a wonderful job.  A big portion of the walls of Waterford still stand and the Corporation, in clearing houses, have helped to expose these walls which are in very good condition. Some day I hope to have the Parliamentary Secretary in Waterford so that he may seen them.  Great towers stand on these walls and with the co-operation of the Board of Works and the Tourist Board they could be made a tourist attraction.  I shall send the Parliamentary Secretary a copy of a talk given on the walls by Mr. Carroll, borough surveyor to the Old Waterford Society.</P>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would send me the names of the members of the National Monuments Advisory Council.  I hope it is representative of all areas as that would be a good thing.  I suggest that a council like that should meet in various centres throughout the country during the year and report to the Parliamentary Secretary.  It would be well for them to visit his own city of Limerick and also Cork, Galway, Waterford, Kilkenny, Wexford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Many of these historical things have disappeared. They have been used as quarries.  It would be a shame if fine stretches of wall, some half-a-mile or three-quarters of a mile long, still standing with turrets and towers on them, were to suffer the same fate.</P>
      <P>Again, I sincerely wish the Parliamentary Secretary a successful term of office.  He knows I do.  I hope he will continue to answer Parliamentary Questions in his customary manner.

    <P>Fearacht gach seirbhíse poiblí eile, éilíonn an chosaint náisiúnta tuille airgid thar mar rinne cúis don tír anuraidh.  Is iad luach saothair agus liúntaisí phearsanta faoi ndear do leath an easnaimh de níos mó ná milliún punt atáthar ghá iarraidh don bhliain nua airgeadais.</P>
    <P>Fearas cosanta an chéad mhéadú eile is mó ina dhiaidh sin a atann an Meastachán thar anuraidh.  Ach, ar ndóigh, ní h-íontas é sin agus gach saghas soláthair ag daoirsiú.  Siad an dá cheann sin&mdash;fir agus fearas&mdash;dlúth agus inneach aon chóras cosanta.  Ní fhéadfaí an tArm a fhágáil chun deiridh san ochtú babhta bhreisiú luach saothair, cé nár deárnadh an oiread glóráin ar a son is a rinneadh dá lán eile.  Nuair a bhíonn sábháil airgid agus laghdú chostas seirbhíse poiblí dá dtóiríocht, is iondual go mbítear ag braith ar an Arm ina gcomhair; agus, ar ndóigh, tá géillte againn i mbliana don bhraith sin.  Is ioma sin soláthair eile a beifí ghá iarraidh dá mbiodh an sparán poiblí sách teann chuige, nar is ioma sin gléas, fearas agus trealamh a theastaíonns ó Arm ins na saolta deireannacha seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom, freisin, abhfad níos nó caiteachas ar cheathrúin pósta agus ar fhoirgníocht ná mar atá meastaithe don bhliain atá amach romhainn.  Tá céad seasca dó tithe nuacha tógtha ag <Col N="1088" /> an Arm ó stop an cogadh agus faoi láthair tá ocht dtithe á dtógáil ag Scoil Phrintísigh an Arm, Nás na Rí. Ní féidir ach oiread áirithe de tithe a dhéanamh gach bliain, ach coinneófar ar an obair seo go dtí go mbí ceathrúin pósta maith sláintiul ag gach saidiúr pósta.</P>
    <P>Shiúl mé cuid mhaith de na dúin, agus, cé go bhfuil siad beagnach ar fad sean, caithfidh mé an Cór Innealtóirí a mholadh as ucht an chaoi atá siad ag coinneál orra in éadan deachrachtaí. Tá an Cór sin agus an Cór Ordanáis, an Cór Comharthaíochta agus an tAer Chór le moladh freisin as na scoileanna phrintíseachta atá á reachtáil acu i Nás Na Rí, Baile Dhómhnaill agus Campa Tréineála an Churraigh.  Ba uchtach mór dom na ranganna stócaigh a fheiceál ansin agus iad go dian dícheallach ag foghlaim céard na h-innealtóireachta agus eile.  Sin taobh don Arm a ndéantar coitianta neamhshuim de: sé sin chomh fóintiúl is a bhíonns an oiliúint a cuirtear ar na saidiúirí agus iad arís ag tóiríocht fostaíochta shibhialta. Seadh, is ioma sin deis foghlaoma atá curtha ar fáil don earcach óg san Arm; agus mar bharr ar na deiseanna sin tá cuid is mó de na bunáiteacha Airm suite cóngarach do scoileanna ghairmoideachasis.</P>

Is oth liom a rá go bhfuil sé thíos faoina neart agus go mb'éigean fir gan Ghaeilge a thabhairt isteach ann lena choinneál ag imeacht.  Idir phá is eile tá an saidiúracht ionchomortais le fostaíocht shibhialta.  Ar an ábhar sin, ní fíor a rá nach bhfuil saothrú le fáil ag cuid mhaith díobhtha siúd a bhíonn ag imeacht leo thar lear.  Ní fheicim fáth ar bith nach bhféadfadh an Ghaeltacht an oiread eisiomairceóirí a sparáil is a choinneódh <Col N="1089" /> an cathlán seo ag imeacht.  Is féidir le stócach sheacht mbliana déag a dhul san Arm ach cead agus beannacht a athar agus máthar aige chuige sin.  Dá mbíodh a leithéid staidéarthach agus fonn staidéir air, d'féadfadh sé feabhas mór a chur ar a oiliúnt is ar a eolas in aon tréimhse amháin thrí bliana.

    <P>This Estimate is for the sum of £9,051,164 gross and, after the deduction of Appropriations-in-Aid, £8,048,100 net, an increase of £1,158,060 over the net estimate for 1961/62.  Towards the end of that year, there was a supplementary estimate for a token sum of £10 but that did not affect the position materially.</P>
    <P>Deputies may find it helpful if, before proceeding to an analysis of the Estimate, I make some observations of a general nature on the work of my Department and of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence organisation during the financial year 1961-1962. Foremost in all our minds, I am sure, are the members of the Defence Forces who are serving with the United Nations in the Republic of the Congo. The policy of providing a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force in support of the United Nations mission there has been maintained by the Government during the past year, and <Col N="1090" /> the implementation of this policy has, from a national point of view, been the most important task of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Despite many difficulties at home, the Permanent Defence Force, from a very small strength, has supplied for overseas duties a minimum of one battalion.  Indeed, in May of last year, as a result of a request from the United Nations for more troops, another unit was organised and sent to the Congo.  The Defence Forces have also provided officers and other ranks for duty at UN Headquarters at Leopoldville.  In round figures, this has meant that the Defence Forces have maintained a force of from 800 to 1,000 all ranks for overseas duties, and when I say that this represents a figure in the region of 10 per cent. of the entire permanent force, it will be seen how great, relatively, our efforts have been in fulfilling our responsibilities as a member of the United Nations.  The UN Force in the Congo continued to be commanded by our Lieut.  General Seán McKeown until the 31st March of this year.</P>
    <P>It is pleasant to recall that no difficulty has been experienced by the Army authorities in obtaining the numbers of officers and other ranks required.  Staffs at all levels and all Corps have ensured that, when a request is made by the United Nations to the Government, a sufficiency of all classes, line and technician, is available to fill the organisation.  I know that much effort has been necessary to ensure that our personnel have left our shores properly trained and equipped for their tasks, and full credit must go to the staffs and Corps concerned.</P>
    <P>Practically all of the service given by our units to the United Nations has been in the province of Katanga, where UN has been faced with some of its most difficult tasks.  On several occasions, in pursuance of the policy laid down, our troops have been engaged in operations to restore and maintain order.  It is gratifying to be told that these operations have been carried out with such skill, courage and restraint, and that our troops <Col N="1091" /> have earned much credit for themselves and their country.  We have, unfortunately, suffered casualties in these operations and our sympathies must go out to the relatives of those officers and men who have made the supreme sacrifice in the cause of world peace.</P>
    <P>Much valuable experience has been gained by officers and men of the Defence Forces from operations with the United Nations forces, and this experience will be a continuing source of benefit to us for years to come.  I was very pleased when the former Chief of Staff, after his most recent visit to the troops in the Congo, reported to me on the outstanding work done by Irish Commanders and staffs, the very considerable status our troops have gained and their very high morale.  I was doubly pleased when the present Chief of Staff and former UN Commander, on his return to duty here, confirmed all that I had already been told about our troops. I am confident that the next unit which will go to the Congo will be no whit less worthy of praise than its predecessors.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which our units serve with the United Nations Force were improved considerably during the year.  The United Nations agreed to pay for a tropical walkingout uniform, made here in Ireland, for officers and men; and a considerable quantity of equipment for messes and dining halls has been sent to the Congo.  We are trying all the time to ensure that our forces in the Congo will have the best conditions possible.</P>
    <P>Once again I am happy to pay tribute to the public-spirited activities of the many individuals and firms who have continued their work in organising and providing comforts for our troops overseas.  These activities are very valuable in sustaining morale, and the fact that the good work has continued in respect of every contingent is in itself a tribute to the patriotism of the citizens concerned.</P>
    <P>Neither must I let the opportunity pass without mention of our troops at home.  On these has fallen the brunt of the normal staff work, training and administration of the Defence Forces. <Col N="1092" /> To them, the organisation, preparation and equipping of units for overseas duties have made an even greater demand on their time.  Staffs and Corps have faced and solved these problems with a combination of skill and enthusiasm which has been most gratifying to experience.  These problems included organisation and training, transportation of troops and stores and packaging of equipment, often at very awkward times and even during holiday periods. It is due to the unselfish efforts of those left behind that the normal running of the Defence Forces, and the preparation of troops, their despatch to UN missions and their reception when repatriated, have continued smoothly.  I know that these efforts will be maintained so long as we continue to send troops on overseas duties.</P>
    <P>Foremost amongst the home duties of the Defence Forces has been the continuing process of the integration of Regular units and those of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  Combined training of the staffs of integra ed units has been carried out at various levels, with a view to the welding of the two constituents into a working entity.  During the year, new police and medical units of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil were raised.  The strength of An Fórsa has been well maintained, although the continuous turnover of personnel does cause some worry.  From the organisational point of view, most units of An Fórsa are fairly well up to strength but because of this turnover and the limited amount of training that can be done, the standard of training is not as high as we would wish.</P>
    <P>These are difficulties inherent in any voluntary force and, despite them, unit and formation training improved considerably in the past year.  Every effort continues to be made to improve the standard.  Planning for mobilisation and use of the Defence Forces in emergency continues at all levels.  A series of exercises covering Regular and Reserve forces was held during the year to practise mobilisation procedures and duties.  These will be continued on a wider scale.  A suitable amount of new equipment was secured during the year and it is hoped to supplement this in the coming year. We have not yet built up anything <Col N="1093" /> like full mobilisation stocks of defensive equipment, and proposed purchase for 1962/1963 represents only an instalment towards that end.</P>
    <P>Not alone is the prestige of the Defence Forces high at present, but so also is morale.  As from 1st November last, substantial increases in pay and allowances have been introduced and have met with a favourable reception.  Improvements have been, and will continue to be, made in the conditions under which the soldier serves.  Barracks continue to be improved in so far as financial considerations allow, and there has also been a great improvement in the housing situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to be able to say that, in view of these developments, suitable recruits for the Permanent Defence Force have been coming forward in sufficient numbers, but that is not the position.  There is no doubt that the pay of the Army now compares favourably with that in outside employment, and that the Army offers an attractive career to young men interested in an active life.  The recent recruiting campaign did not succeed in bringing the non-commissioned strength up to the figure of 8,000 which is really the minimum figure needed for our current commitments. I ask all people of influence to encourage the idea of service, whether in the permanent Defence Force or in the Reserve components such as An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muiri.  Otherwise it is inevitable that there will be gaps in our national defence position in the event of sudden emergency.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be glad to learn that, during 1961/62 the normal complement of 55 boys between the ages of 15 and 17 years enlisted for Scoil Phrintisigh an Airm; that 34 boys between the ages of 16 and 18 were enlisted as Apprentice Mechanics in the Air Corps and 29 applicants between the ages of 17 and 28 as technicians in the Air Corps and Signal Corps.  As well, 21 boys have been enlisted for training as bandsmen in Scoil Cheoil an Airm.  All these specialised activities of the Army are particularly worthy of support and encouragement, because <Col N="1094" /> of the excellent careers which they make possible.</P>
    <P>Twenty non-commissioned officers of the ranks of Sergeant and upwards have been assigned to a potential officers' course of a year's duration. Those who complete the course successfully will be commissioned as Second-Lieutenants to fill appointments as stores officers, administrative officers and assistant Quartermasters.</P>
    <P>Since 1952, pilots for the Air Corps have been recrui ed solely through the medium of the Short Service Commission Scheme, which was initiated primarily for the purpose of providing an adequate number of pilots for the Reserve of Officers (First Line).  With the expansion of Aer Lingus in recent years, these pilots as well as some Regular pilots of the Corps have been absorbed by that company, so that there is now a shortage of Regular Officer pilots.  It is intended, on that account, to select ten of the Army Cadets appointed in 1961 for training as pilots af er they receive their commissions in 1963.  In addition, and as an immediate step, six young permanent officers have been transferred to the Air Corps from other Corps to undergo training as pilots.  The question of the training by the Air Corps of pilots for Aer Lingus is at present under consideration between Aer Lingus, the Department of Transport and Power and my Department.</P>
    <P>In 1961, teams from Scoil Eachaiochta an Airm competed in nine international shows&mdash;at Dublin, London, Marseilles, Nice, Rome, Harrisburg, Washington, New York and Toronto.  I am happy to say that at these shows they won 15 first, 19 second and 16 third prizes.  Teams from An Scoil competed also at 19 provincial shows.  The results achieved in 1961 show an improvement on those of the previous year, and I am sure that Deputies will wish the School continued success in 1962.</P>
    <P>Throughout the year, the Naval Service provided fishery protection within the limit of its resources.  For some months past, however, it has not been possible to have more than one corvette on fishery patrol duty at any one time because of a shortage <Col N="1095" /> of sea-going personnel to man an additional vessel.  Every effort is being made to recruit the required personnel, and here again I would urge all who are in a position to help to do so.</P>
    <P>The preparatory work in connection with the setting up of the Observer Corps, about which my predecessor spoke when introducing last year's Estimate, is in hands.  The head-quarters staff, consisting of personnel of the Permanent Defence Force, has been assembled and is engaged in the preliminary work that must precede the recruitment and training of the Reserve element of the Corps.</P>
    <P>From the Army I turn now to Civil Defence.  One of the features of recent times has been that public interest in Civil Defence has manifested itself to an extent previously unequalled.  For the greater part, this increased interest stemmed from events in the international sphere&mdash;namely, the recurrence of tension over Berlin since August last and the publicity given to the hazards of radioactivity resulting from the resumption of nuclear tests by the U.S.S.R. in September.</P>
    <P>Whether as a result of this increased interest or of intensified activity on the part of local authorities or a combination of both, there has been an overall net increase (allowing for wastage) in the strength of the Civil Defence organisation of some 1,500, making the current strength approximately 7,600.  These figures show that the previous rate of growth of the organisation has been maintained. Quite a number of the new recruits are in centres in which Civil Defence was organised last winter for the first time, and it is to be hoped that in such places those recruits will encourage many more to enrol.  As matters stand, however, we have got to face the fact that the numbers in Civil Defence, even though they continue to grow, are still pitifully small in relation to the size of the problem that might have to be faced, and so, as I did when speaking about the Army, I urge all who can do so to lend their aid and encouragement to Civil Defence recruitment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> At the same time, I am confident that the measures now being taken to develop a control structure within each county and to organise the Warden Service in every parish and ultimately in every townland and street, will have its impact on recruitment even in outlying districts.  The initiation by local authorities of arrangements for the control and organisation of the Civil Defence services at county level was, in my view, the most significant development which occurred during the year in relation to the organisation of Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>These arrangements include special measures for the recruitment&mdash;by way of personal canvass and selection&mdash;of the large number of persons required for the Warden Service&mdash;from County Chief Warden down to the Patrol Wardens who would have a townland or a street as their responsibility. Deputies will recall that these arrangements were referred to by my predecessor in introducing last year's Estimate.  He explained that the arrangements had been accepted in principle by the local authorities and he expressed his appreciation of the co-operation received from all concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the implementation of the arrangements, I am pleased to say that, for the greater part, local authorities and their senior officers who have accepted certain personal obligations as heads of Services have faced up to their responsibilities in a most effective and realistic way.  Already, the training of the persons nominated for the various key appointments has been begun by my Department at An Scoil Cosanta Sibhialta.  In view of the large numbers to be trained, however, it will be a considerable time before a fullyeffective control organisation will be available.  It is expected, nevertheless, that the nucleus of the Warden Service, on which the control organisation so much depends, will be well under way by the end of the present year.  There is also great need to establish units of the Welfare and Casualty Services, and I am hopeful that once we get the Warden Service effectively organised in every parish, we will have achieved <Col N="1097" /> a significant breakthrough in the matter of organisation.</P>
    <P>The second important organisational development which took place in the past year was the implementation of the first stage of the development of Civil Defence Regional Control&mdash; namely, that the Government have now decided that senior Civil Servants should be designated to act as Regional Civil Defence Controllers.</P>
    <P>Another most important development was the assignment to full time Civil Defence duties of eight military officers of the rank of Commandant&mdash; one to each group of three or more counties comprising a Civil Defence region.  This development was also foreshadowed by my predecessor last year.  While these officers have specific responsibility for planning and study of regional control, one of their primary functions is to give the fullest possible advice and assistance in civil defence matters to the local authorities within their regions.  They will work in co-operation with County Managers and other officers of the local authority and will continue to be paid in full by my Department.  They have already been only six months in the field, but in that short time it has become abundantly clear that their presence and the advice and assistance which they provide to the local authorities have given a tremendous fillip to organisation and recruitment at local level.  Having said that, I now want to make it absolutely clear that the assignment of these officers to Civil Defence work locally, and the success which they are making of it, is not in any way to be regarded as weakening the concept of local authority responsibility for Civil Defence, particularly in the matter of recruiting and training.</P>
    <P>On occasions during the year the idea has been mooted that the Army would take over responsibility for Civil Defence.  To some extent, that idea may have arisen because of the assignment of the eight military officers to duties as Regional Civil Defence Officers; it may also have derived from the terms of a reply given by me to a question in the House on the 16th <Col N="1098" /> November last.  On that occasion, I indicated that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  a plan to cope with a civil defence situation, including particularly the hazard of radioactive fall-out, had been prepared and was in the process of being implemented;</P>
    <P>(2)  pending the implementation of this plan in an effective way, a special interim stand-by plan has been prepared;</P>
    <P>(3)  this interim plan consists of a series of improvisations aimed at making the fullest use of the Civil Defence resources available now and linking them up with existing organisations such as Oglaigh na hÉireann, An Garda Síochána, certain other State Departments and semi-State Organisations and Voluntary Aid Societies.</P>
    <P>Underlying this plan is the presumption that if a Civil Defence situation arose with little warning now or at any time in the immediate future, before the Civil Defence organisation has been fully developed, all the existing resources of the States would have to be utilised to the fullest extent practicable.  It can be accepted that the Army, by virtue of its organisation and training, would have an important part to play in any Civil Defence operations, provided, of course, that at the particular time it would not be required to discharge its primary role of military operations in defence of the State.  Civil Defence must, however, be regarded as essentially civilian, and in many important respects, for example, the Warden and Welfare Services, local in character.</P>
    <P>The general increase in Civil Defence activity which has occurred in the past year and which is expected to be maintained during the year ahead inevitably entails additional expenditure&mdash;both by the State and by the local authorities&mdash;and this is reflected in the provision for Civil Defence which, at £250,396, is £87,121 higher than last year's figure of £163,275.  I will deal in detail with the provisions later on, but at this stage I would particularly like to mention certain expenditure for which provision is made for the first time&mdash;<Col N="1099" /> namely, £50,000, included in the provision for Grants, in respect of County and Sub-County Control Centres and £10,000, included under Regional Controls, etc., for Regional Control Centres.</P>
    <P>These Control Centres would be set up in buildings of solid construction especially protected and equipped to enable the control element of Civil Defence&mdash;at sub-county, county and regional level&mdash;to continue to function under operational Civil Defence conditions, especially if the country were contaminated by radioactive fall-out. The building required for use as a County Control Centre would have to be located in or near the County town, while the Sub-County Control Centres would be located in the principal towns.  It is intended that, as far as possible, existing local authority premises should be adapted for use as County and Sub-County Control Centres and that in peacetime the building so adapted should be used also for Civil Defence training purposes. What we have in mind is that where there is, say, a large basement underneath the present County Council premises, it should be adapted as a Control Centre for operational purposes and should be used also for peace-time training purposes.</P>
    <P>It is essential that every county should tackle as a matter of urgency the question of providing these County and Sub-County Control Centres.  As a first step, my Department is asking local authorities to examine the matter immediately and report as to the availability of premises which would conform to the general requirements for County and Sub-County Control Centres.  Following this, it is intended that the buildings tentatively selected should be inspected by a Technical Officer of my Department, in the light of whose advice plans and estimates for the work involved in each case would be submitted to my Department for approval.  Until such plans and estimates are available, it would not be possible to estimate the overall cost in respect of these Control Centres, but it is expected to be fairly substantial, possibly of the order of £750,000.  Seventy per cent. would be <Col N="1100" /> met by the State by way of grant. Nobody regrets more than I that we should be confronted by expenditure of this kind and of this magnitude, but it becomes an inescapable necessity because of the terrible dangers which would arise in the event of another world war.</P>
    <P>Because of the heavy burden which the provision of these Controls would impose on local authorities, it is proposed to vary the existing procedure whereby grant is payable one year in arrear and, instead, to provide for advances of grant on foot of work completed. Such grant payments in 1962/63 will be met from the provision of £50,000 I have mentioned.  The balance of the expenditure will, of course, have to be met in coming financial years.</P>
    <P>As regards the Regional Control Centres, Deputies will recall that it was indicated by my predecessor last year that, for purposes of overall Civil Defence Control, it was necessary to establish a superstructure linking local controls with the Central Government and that, to this end, it was necessary to establish eight Civil Defence Regions.  For operational purposes, it is necessary that protected and equipped Regional Control Centres should be provided, and it is proposed to start on this work as soon as possible in 1962/63.  Again, it is not possible to estimate accurately the overall cost of these Regional Control Centres, but it is expected to be about £50,000, inclusive of equipment.  As I have said, £10,000 is being provided for 1962/63, and the balance of the expenditure will arise in future financial years.</P>
    <P>Having concluded my general survey, I should now like to deal with the individual subheads of the Estimate which show marked increases or decreases in relation to last year's provisions. First I should say that the pay, allowances and maintenance of the Permanent Defence Force account, as usual, for the major portion of the Estimate.  The provisions in these respects are spread over a number of subheads and amount to almost £5,460,000 or 61 per cent. of the net Estimate.</P>
    <P>As regards the Permanent Defence Force, the Estimate continues to be <Col N="1101" /> framed on the basis of the full peace establishment of 1,359 officers and 11,607 men, with deductions made in respect of the numbers by which the actual strength is likely to be below establishment over the year.  The net average strength for which the Estimate provides is 1,145 officers, 124 cadets and 7,750 men of all corps.  It is our hope that, in the course of the year, we may reach the desired figure of 8,000 other ranks.</P>
    <P>The increases in pay and allowances to which I referred at the outset are estimated to cost £538,000 during 1962/63.  They are provided for in Subheads A&mdash;Pay of Officers, Cadets, N.C.O.s and Privates; B&mdash;Marriage Allowance; E&mdash;Pay of Officers of the Medical Corps; P2&mdash;Naval Service; and Y1&mdash;the Reserve Defence Force. Except in regard to Y1, to which I will be referring later, I do not think that it is necessary for me to say anything more about these Subheads.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £7,746 in Subhead A3&mdash;Bounties, Rewards and Gratuities, and this is explained by the fact that it has now been decided that any non-commissioned officer or man who extends his service after three, six or nine years' service, will receive a gratuity of £25 on the occasion of each such extension.  It is our hope that this will be an incentive for trained men to continue in service rather than to go to the Reserve or to leave the Army entirely.</P>
    <P>The increases of £81,877 in Subhead C&mdash;Pay of Civilians attached to Units &mdash;is attributable almost entirely to increases in wages.  Higher rates of allowances are also partly responsible for the increase of £54,212 in Subhead G&mdash;Subsistence and Other Allowances &mdash;but mainly the increase is due to the sum of £44,700 provided for allowances in respect of the children of officers.  These allowances in their present form were introduced in February, 1961, but specific provision was not made for them in the Vote for 1961/62.  They have been met from the Vote generally.</P>
    <P>Subhead J&mdash;Mechanical Transport &mdash;shows an over-all increase of £13,040 as compared with 1961/62. The provision of £85,320 for capital expenditure on vehicles is £11,940 <Col N="1102" /> higher than the corresponding provision last year.  This is accounted for by a net increase of £13,940 in the provision for the purchase of new vehicles for the Army, which is partially offset by a decrease of £2,000 on repayable advances to officers for the purchase of motor cars for use on duty with An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, An Slua Muirí and An Cór Breathnadóirí.  The remaining £1,100 arises from increased vehicle maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £16,699 in Subhead K&mdash;Provisions and Allowances in Lieu &mdash;is attributable to the reduced strength.  It has also been assumed that a contingent of battalion strength will be on overseas duty throughout the year.  The provisioning of our troops in the Congo is a United Nations responsibility, and the cost does not have to be borne by the Vote for Defence.</P>
    <P>The provision in Subhead M for uniform clothing for N.C.O.s and Privates, £148,500, shows a decrease of £6,865 as compared with the corresponding provision of £155,365 last year.  While a decrease of some £17,500 as compared with last year might have been expected, as about 250 fewer men are being catered for, the necessity to purchase increased supplies of ground sheets and reservists' kits, as well as increased costs, have resulted in a reduction of only £6,865.</P>
    <P>The question of introducing a standard uniform of new and improved design for members of Na BuanÓglaigh and An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil has been under examination for some time, but no final decision in the matter has yet been reached.  It will be appreciated that a matter of this kind requires very thorough examination from the points of view of both design and financial implications.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £67,966 in Subhead O&mdash;General Stores.  The principal increases are £28,871 for signal equipment, £9,088 for camp equipment, £18,452 for aircraft, etc., £2,626 for workshop equipment and £14,174 for radiac equipment.  These increased provisions are partially offset by an increase of £8,000 in the amount deducted in respect of stores ordered but not delivered.  In connection <Col N="1103" /> with radiac equipment, I should explain that the 1961/1962 provision of £20,505 was included under the heading &ldquo;Educational and Training Equipment&rdquo;.  It will be seen that it has a separate heading this year, as the supplies now required will, to a large extent, be operational as well as for training purposes.</P>
    <P>Increased provisions for signal equipment and radiac equipment are considered necessary as these items would be particularly useful in maintaining communications and saving life in the event of hostilities involving destruction of telephonic communication and the presence of radio-active fall-out.  The increase under the heading of aircraft, etc., is due mainly to the necessity for the replacement of the Dove aircraft which crashed at Shannon in January, 1961, but portion of the provision for a new aircraft, £40,307, is offset by a decrease of £19,690 in the provision for radio aids at Baldonnel.  The increased provision for camp equipment is due to the need for replacing sandbags and worn-out cookers.</P>
    <P>In Subhead P&mdash;Defensive Equipment&mdash;there is an increase of £300,949 as compared with the original 1961/62 Estimate, and of £169,949 as compared with the 1961/62 Estimate plus the additional expenditure covered by the recent Supplementary Estimate.  The increase is due chiefly to proposed increased purchases of light weapons and replacement of armoured vehicles and ammunition.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, Subhead P1 &mdash;Civil Defence&mdash;shows a net increase of £87,121 as compared with the amount provided in 1961/62.  I have already dealt with the question of regional, county and sub-county controls, which account for £60,000 of this increase.  There is also a new provision of £9,000 for the purchase of sirens for use for warning purposes in the cities and larger towns.  As well, there is an increase of £26,298 in the provision for equipment and stores, and an increase of some £3,500 arising from the Government's decision during the past year to increase the rate of grant payable to Local Authorities in respect of <Col N="1104" /> expenditure incurred by them on Civil Defence as from the first of April, 1961, from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent., the maximum authorised by the Air Raid Precautions Acts.</P>
    <P>Part of the increase is due to the necessity to repeat sums amounting to £14,500 which were included in the 1961/62 Vote for five ambulances and a mobile control unit for training, the delivery of which could not be secured during that financial year.  The provision covers further purchases of fire appliances, ambulances, radio instruments, sets of special manpack rescue equipment and uniforms, as well as additional mobile feeding unit vehicles. All this equipment is intended primarily for training volunteers and is being purchased by instalments.  The bulk of it is being distributed to local authorities throughout the country and it will, of course, be suitable for actual operational purposes should the need arise.</P>
    <P>The increase of £9,403 in Subhead R&mdash;Fuel, Light, etc.&mdash;is due to the increased cost of fuel.</P>
    <P>Subhead S&mdash;Barrack Maintenance and New Works&mdash;shows an increase of £10,160.  This increase arises under the heading of barrack maintenance.</P>
    <P>The erection of a new girls' school to accommodate 448 pupils at Campa an Churraigh is proceeding and is expected to be completed in 1962/63. In recent years, 162 new houses have been erected for married soldiers&mdash;88 in Dublin; 30 at the Curragh; 20 in Athlone; and 24 in Cork. Provision was made in the Estimates for 1961/ 62 for the erection of eight Soldiers' Married Quarters at Naas, but it was not possible to commence this work until very late in the financial year. The work will be completed during 1962/63, and a decision will then be taken, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time, as to where the next quota of houses will be erected.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £6,320 in Subhead T&mdash;Military Lands.  This is partly attributable to increased wages and partly to proposed acquisitions.  In connection with this subhead, I may mention that, as Deputies are aware, the Curragh of Kildare Act, 1961, permits of the inclosure by fencing of <Col N="1105" /> parts of the Curragh, subject to the prior voluntary surrender and extinguishment of a number of grazing rights commensurate with the area to be inclosed.  As stated by my predecessor during the Second Stage of the Bill, the Racing Authorities have been concerned for a considerable time over the impairment of race tracks and training gallops due to sheep grazing. Arrangements are at present being made for the inclosure, subject to the provisions of the Act, of some 800 acres of the Curragh, embracing the race tracks and certain training gallops.</P>
    <P>While the increase in Subhead V&mdash; Barrack Services&mdash;is only £2,110, I take advantage of it to say again that attention continues to be given to the improvement of amenities for soldiers living in barracks.  For some years past steel chairs and plastic-topped tables have been replacing timber forms and trestle tables in dining halls, and steel wardrobes are being provided in billets, as well as chairs, bedside lockers, bedside rugs, writing tables, and so on.</P>
    <P>The provision for Cumann Croise Deirege na h-Éireann&mdash;£16,450&mdash;is contained in Subhead Y2.  It shows a reduction of £4,000 as compared with 1961/62.  The reduction is entirely in the amount required for the Emergency Relief Fund, which is estimated at £2,000 as compared with £6,000 for 1961/62.  The provision for the normal activities of the Society is £10,000, that for the White Russian refugees from North China is £4,000, and the State contribution to the International Committee is £450.  These three amounts are the same as in 1961/62.</P>
    <P>The Society continues to work in various spheres.  In the field of normal activity, recruiting, training and instruction are being pressed forward.  The Society is in the process of increasing its fleet of ambulances and improving certain premises.  The work in connection with the White Russian refugees from North China continues at Naomh Aindrias.  In the field of relief, the Society contributed £1,000 during the year for Angola and it has launched an appeal for help for the Freedom from Hunger Campaign. <Col N="1106" /> This campaign has the full support and approval of the Government. Deputies will be already aware, from various authoritative statements made on the subject, that hunger and famine are widespread in many lands, and literally hundreds of millions of men, women and children live in the shadow of death from these and associated evils.  The Freedom from Hunger Campaign is a genuine work of charity that transcends national boundaries.  I commend it strongly to the Irish people as a cause worthy of their most generous support.  I should like to thank the Society for its very great efforts in all the fields of humanitarian relief.</P>
    <P>The increase of £40,580 in Subhead Y&mdash;Office of the Minister&mdash;is almost entirely due to the pay increases received by the Civil Service staff of the Department.  Pay increases also account partly for the increase of £35,750 in Subhead Y1&mdash;The Reserve &mdash;but there are also other factors such as the increased cost of rations and increased allowances.  The provision for clothing for members of An Fórsa. Cosanta Áitiúil, An Slua Muirí and An Cór Breathnadóirí shows an increase of £9,043 over the corresponding provision in 1961/62.  This is accounted for by a decrease in stocks in hand and increases in prices.</P>
    <P>The only other point I think I need mention is that, as from the beginning of the financial year, 1962/63, expenses in connection with the Offences against the State Acts are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, and no provision is made, therefore, in the Vote for Defence.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have given Deputies an adequate explanation of the Estimate. I shall be very glad, when concluding, to supply any additional information desired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, indeed, given us a fairly comprehensive survey of his Department and has given it in a very amiable way.  I want to join with him in complimenting our troops who have served overseas and who have apparently done so well.  I want also to join with him in extending the sympathy of the House and the nation to the relatives <Col N="1107" /> of those who died in that service. May God deal lightly with them and may they rest in peace.  I trust that those who are injured will soon recover.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on the Minister's statement, there are a few points I should like to make.  During the year, in some sections of the foreign Press there was an attack made upon United Nations troops and our troops did not come off unscathed in that attack.  I am perfectly satisfied there was no ground that would justify such an attack, but I feel the Minister and the Government did not refute it sufficiently or vigorously enough.  It is too bad that any section of the foreign Press would try to libel the troops of any nation, and in particular the troops of this country, who were sent out by the State and the people in the interests of peace and humanity, and that they can do so with impunity.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, the Press have a certain freedom of action but they should not be unjust or unfair, and I think they were both unjust and unfair in their statements relating to the United Nations troops and especially in their slanders upon our troops.  Of course they did withdraw what they said to a certain extent but that is not sufficient because when mud is slung, some of it is inclined to stick.  I am availing of this opportunity to express my confidence in our troops and in their conduct generally in the discharge of their duty in the Congo which must in all the circumstances be a very difficult task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the Vote this year is very substantial.  That is inevitable, I suppose, and if we were paying for the troops in the Congo, it would be much higher.  I am glad that General McKeown, Commander of the United Nations forces in the Congo, has returned safely and well.  It is admitted on all sides that he has discharged his duties in an excellent manner.  I want to compliment him upon his efficiency and to express satisfaction that he has returned to his normal duties.  It is something to know that the high ideals of the soldiers of Ireland have been upheld by the manner in which he has discharged his duties.  I welcome him <Col N="1108" /> back and trust he will get some rest for a time.  However, that is a matter for the Minister and himself.</P>
    <P>There are a few points with which I should like to deal before going into the Minister's statement in detail.  First, what was the nature of the inquiry held recently in Kilkenny barracks? How was it initiated and what are its findings?  It is important we should know these things but if the Minister feels he should not give the information in the House, I shall be glad to get it personally.  I am rather perturbed by rumours I have heard but it is hard to establish the truth, especially when I have, over the years, purposely avoided making any contact with members of the Defence Forces or the civil staff, except in an official, routine way, and it is not easy to ask for information on these points.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement was elaborate and covered a great deal of ground.  I am thankful, and I am sure the House will also be thankful, to him for the manner in which he has presented it.  When we realise that the Army is operating with depleted numbers, we must wonder why recruiting has been so slow and difficult.  The Minister says that the rates of pay compare favourably with those in outside employment.  I do not think that is right.  While I do not pay very much attention to comments in the newspapers, when people use the pen to express their dissatisfaction, it does indicate that there is some cause.  There is no smoke without fire.</P>
    <P>This correspondent, who apparently is in the Defence Forces, points out that the pay and allowances are inadequate and puts that down as the cause of the failure of the recruiting drive.  He goes on to say, as published in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Monday, 7th May, 1962:</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot say the recent recruiting drives have been a success despite the fact that he is prepared to accept ex-soldiers up to the age of 38 years, and down to the age of 17.  Indeed, recruits have been accepted under 17 years, as no proof of date of birth is asked for.</P>
    <P>The correspondent continues:</P>
    <P>The following will give some idea <Col N="1109" /> of how badly treated the soldier is as far as pensions and gratuities are concerned:</P>
    <P>Pensions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Weekly rates: Private soldier, 21 years' service: married, 43/3; single, 30/-.  Sergeants-Major, 21 years' service: married, 68/3; single, 55/-.  Gratuities for the soldier: nil.</P>
    <P>Even after 40 years' service the soldier does not receive a gratuity. Apparently there is a gratuity now on rejoining of £25 and then it is pointed out that there is a gratuity for the officers.  This correspondent says a good deal more and it shows that there is dissatisfaction.  He says:</P>
    <P>The Minister considers the princely sum of 3s. 9d. per day is sufficient for a soldier's wife to provide food for her husband, while the Minister for Justice considers 5s. 6d. per day a suitable figure to give those who look after the Gardaí dogs.</P>
    <P>When a thing is expressed in such terms, it indicates a definite sense of grievance.  There is a responsibility on the Minister and the Government not only to keep morale high, but, as far as is humanly possible, to ensure that the grievance is eliminated.  The human element should be taken into consideration, not only in relation to the officers and N.C.O.s but also in relation to the men and their wives and families.  The Army should be not only disciplined but happy and contented. I know it is not easy to achieve that, but that should be the Minister's objective.  He should impress upon the officers that they should make life for the ordinary soldier the best this country can provide.  That applies to uniform, food, lodgings, married quarters and the provision in lieu of.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn that the integration of the F.C.A. into the regular Army is working well.  That is something we all desire.  It is a development that can be of very great importance to the nation, if danger threatens.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement was a very elaborate one.  He takes this opportunity to thank firms, and others, who contributed towards providing comforts and amenities for our troops in <Col N="1110" /> the Congo.  On behalf of my Party, I should like to add my voice to that tribute.  He says the troops engaged in the Congo have got new walkingout uniforms manufactured in this country.  I am glad the United Nations think our troops are entitled to better walking-out uniforms, but surely there is a responsibility on both the Minister and the Government to ensure that the men serving at home are also thought of and that their uniforms and amenities are as good as those anywhere else.  That is something to be desired because it helps to maintain morale and keep the troops in good heart and in good condition.</P>
    <P>While it may not be possible to provide the equivalent at home of what our troops in the Congo enjoy, an effort should be made to raise standards at least for them.  At the moment, one-eighth of the troops are away from normal duties serving in the Congo; another one-eighth are being prepared for service in the Congo. That means that one-quarter are not available for ordinary duties.  That, in turn, imposes a very great hardship upon the remainder.  I appeal to the Minister to see to it that the pay and allowances for these men are as good as, if not better than, those obtaining in outside employment.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the young men to join the Army.  In doing so, they secure a benefit for themselves and they render a valuable service to the nation. Recruiting will never be as successful as it ought to be, if the pay and allowances are not as good as they are elsewhere. They have, of course, never been as good.  It is also true to say they have never been so far behind as they appear to be at the moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the difficulty in keeping the F.C.A. up to a certain strength, is that due to emigration? Can the Minister give any reason for that position?  Is it that the young men get fed-up, as it were, after a period of two or three years?  Is there any cause to which can be attributed the short time they remain in the F.C.A.?  The Minister says that the F.C.A. are fairly well up to strength but, because of the turnover and limited amount of training that can be done, the standard of training is <Col N="1111" /> not as high as we would wish.  I think the question of compensation enters into the picture here.  There should be some compensation for these volunteers who go for training annually.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that mobilisation stocks have not been built up.  I suppose it is difficult to do that, but it is vitally important that we should not be caught on the wrong foot.  The Minister should get such stocks as high as possible.  It is not easy to get orders filled and it is not easy to ensure that what one gets will be effective when the drumbeat of battle sounds.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has increased considerably and it is important that the allowances to the families of soldiers should be adequate.  Where soldiers are in occupation of local authority houses, the rents are high and the allowances are sometimes very inadequate.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a little more vigour in the recruiting campaign.  If the Minister and the Army authorities invited local representatives, clergy, doctors, engineers and so on, to meetings, they could join recruiting for the Army with recruiting for Civil Defence.  The Minister points out that grants for Civil Defence are fairly substantial. Greater success and headway could be made if, at some recruiting meeting, invitations were sent to certain people to assist the officers to get recruits.  I do not know whether or not an advertisement that an officer would turn up in a town on such a date would get to all the people who would ordinarily make excellent recruits.</P>
    <P>On the question of uniforms, I should like to know if the new uniform has been made available to all our troops.  The uniform has been a long time under review but, because of stocks and one thing and another, we did not get it.  If the new walking out uniform for our troops at home has been issued, is it satisfactory?  I have seen a few soldiers wearing it and it looks smart but I have not seen any since.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the initiation of an officers' class for non-commissioned <Col N="1112" /> officers.  The young soldier, on joining the Army, ought to have an opportunity to become Chief of Staff, like the young Garda.  When a young Garda joins the Force, he has the Commissioner's baton in his knapsack, if he makes the grade.  It is well that a young man joining the Army can now get to the top, if he is good enough, if he works hard enough at his training.  His loyalty, devotion, discipline, good conduct and so on would also be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that the apprentice scheme is working and that sufficient numbers come forward to fill the vacancies.  It is important that Air Corps pilots be trained so as to meet, as far as possible, all the requirements of Aer Lingus.  I urge the Government to take every step possible to provide sufficient pilots so that the commercial air companies of this State will always have Irish personnel available to fly their planes.  It is important that we should supply our own needs in that respect.  The only way in which that can be done is by training more pilots.  It may cost money but I think it will prove to be money well spent.  Ten or 20 pilots in the year is a rather small number because, when you provide for your requirements at home and what you require for Aer Lingus, it is very doubtful if that number would be up to full strength or would meet our requirements.</P>
    <P>There are just two points I should like to make in regard to the Equitation School.  I am glad they had such success last year and so far this year they are apparently doing as well.  It is important that every effort be made to keep the quality of the horses up to standard.  If we have the horses, I do not think there is any difficulty in finding men to ride them.  If we have a proper training school, we will always find that that is the position.  Their successes in 1961, as given by the Minister, are a very striking record.  I want to compliment them and to tell them how glad I am that they have discharged their task so well.</P>
    <P>I regret to learn that the Naval Service is still short-handed.  It is imperative that our fisheries be protected but <Col N="1113" /> that cannot be done, if we have not the men and the material.  It is important that our Naval Service be at full strength.  I support the Minister's appeal to those in a position to join to become recruits in the Naval Service.  I appeal to them to do so because it is an interesting life.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn also that the Observer Corps is going ahead and improving.  That is something to be desired.  It will be available should the necessity arise.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a lot of things on Civil Defence.  It is hardly fair that there would be any question about its being a national charge.  The imposition of 20 or 30 per cent.  On the rates does not tend towards greater efficiency or greater willingness to work.  It may be argued that it is a service for the people.  The Minister for Local Government, the Taoiseach and the Government know that the rates are already sufficiently high.  If we add a burden like this to the rates, while the initial expenditure might not be objected to, when there is a danger that the 30 per cent.  May involve a very great sum, then, of course, it becomes a serious problem.</P>

There have also been replies to Parliamentary <Col N="1114" /> Questions.  It is intended to continue to provide essential information according as it becomes available, but it is considered premature to issue a further White Paper until&mdash;on the basis of negotiations with the Governments of the member States of the Community &mdash;the terms and conditions on which Ireland may be admitted to membership are known, as only then will it be possible to indicate the detailed implications.</P>

In relation to the political implications, Deputies who read this morning's newspapers will have much more up-to-date information than the Government could possibly supply by means of a White Paper and, furthermore, they will have an indication of the difficulty of attempting to make an assessment of probabilities in that respect at this time.</P>

Does he not also agree, even on the basis of the reply given by him, that it would require an enormous amount of research by members of the public to annotate and get together the various replies given in this House to questions put to the Taoiseach?  Does he not accept that the ordinary member of the public is unable to provide that research and to get the information in <Col N="1115" /> that way?  Would it not be far better if the Government would disclose to the country in one document, for anyone who wants to read it in one document, such information as they now have, knowing and accepting, as I freely accept, that further information will become available in future weeks and months?

      <P>I am aware of the statements referred to by the Deputy.  What Mr. Mansholt seems to have had in mind was the undesirability of promoting, as a means of maintaining farm incomes in less developed regions, lines of production for which these regions are not economically suitable and which can only be disposed of with the aid of State subsidies.  It is not the policy of the Irish Government to encourage the production of cereals or sugar beet in areas unsuited to these crops.  As regards the prospect for sugar beet production in the European Economic <Col N="1118" /> Community, it would not be possible for me at this stage to make any reliable forecast.  This will depend on a number of factors including the Community's common policy on sugar which has not yet been formulated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>The Road Fund grants notified to the Waterford County Council in respect of the financial year 1962-63 and referred to at (2), (3) and (4) of the Deputy's question, are the same as those allocated in respect of the financial year 1961-62 and are as follows:</P>
      <P>(2)  £32,800;</P>
      <P>(3)  £89,800;</P>
      <P>(4)  £5,000.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the amount of the upkeep grant referred to at (1) of his question is contingent on the amount provided by the council for this purpose and the rate of recoupment has this year been increased from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent.  The amount of this grant in 1961-62 was £26,320.  The grants at (2) and (3) are also contingent on a minimum provision for upkeep equivalent to that provided in 1961-62 being made in 1962-63.  Having regard to the increase in the rate of recoupment of the main road upkeep grant from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent. this condition would have been met by a reduction of £6,580 in last year's provisions. In fact, however, the amounts originally proposed to be provided out of rates have fallen substantially short of the minimum requirements and my Department is in correspondence with the council on the matter.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the subject is to be considered further by the council at a meeting on 28th instant.  Pending the result of this consideration the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to indicate the precise amounts of the grants which will in fact be allocated to the council for 1962-63.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average monthly employment on road works in County Waterford in <Col N="1123" /> 1961-62 was 374.  It would not be possible to give an estimate of the numbers to be employed in 1962-63 as this would depend on the types of works to be undertaken by the council in addition to the amounts of the grants and of the local rate provisions.</P>

      <P>I have, of course, no responsibility for the dispatch of goods by rail and I have no direct knowledge of the incident referred to involving an order for farm-requirements.

      <P>Yes.  A research bureau was set up three years ago in the Department. It has since collaborated with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and with one of the Training Colleges in several projects.  It is my intention that it continue to pursue research in accordance with our needs.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 to 21 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the first Question, like the other two, is intended to be read in the context of the provisions of Section 15 of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not think that I could be expected to attempt to answer such a question as how many premises could be structurally adapted for use as restaurants, since given sufficient money to spend on the job, it would be difficult to find any premises of any kind or condition which could not be so adapted.</P>
      <P>Section 15 is very far from providing that a licence to sell intoxicating liquor with a substantial meal can be got for any restaurant.  The requirement that the premises must be structurally adapted for use as a restaurant is clearly only a minor one compared with the requirement that the premises must be <i>bona fide</i> and mainly used, not just for any kind of restaurant business, but for supplying substantial meals of a kind that come within a definition set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The applicant for the licence would have to satisfy the Circuit Court, on sworn evidence, that his premises was one which qualified&mdash;it is not a question of the police having to prove the contrary.</P>
      <P>Not only must the main business of the premises be the supply of substantial meals costing at least 5/- but the licence, when granted, would apply only to the serving of drinks with meals of this kind.</P>
      <P>While I am not prepared to hazard any guess as to the number of restaurants that now exist or that might come into being which could be shown to the satisfaction of the Circuit Court to be doing a business consisting in the main of the serving of substantial meals costing at least 5/-, I do not think that there is any doubt that the number is and would remain very small.</P>

      <P>The Minister has replied to a supplementary question by Deputy Corish related to the possible number of restaurants which might qualify under the section, if the Bill became law.  I should like to know from the Minister if, prior to the introduction of the proposal, he or his Department made any effort to assess the number of restaurants in the country which are outside the Bord Fáilte registration.  Has he any idea at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not made any such attempt because I do not think it would be of any value.  The matter was very carefully considered. One of the things that might help to throw some light on the problem is the number of wine licences which were applied for.  I want to point out to the Deputy that practically any restaurant proprietor in the country can, by paying £1, get a wine licence. The significant factor in that situation is the small number who have done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully accept that.  I think the fact that so few restaurants, out of the total number, have applied for wine licences is a good indication of the number who will apply if Section 15 becomes law. The provisions in the Bill are such, I think, as to limit very considerably, first of all, the number of restaurants who will be able to apply and, secondly, the number who will want to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was dealing with grants to local authorities for expenditure on Civil Defence.  I notice that there has been an increase to 70 per cent. but 30 per cent. will be a very heavy burden on an already heavily burdened section of the community.  The fact that it is now payable in advance may have some effect.  When the local authority makes its estimate and finds out its requirements for Civil Defence for the year, I presume that immediately the 70 per cent. will be <Col N="1130" /> placed at its disposal.  There is no doubt that that will be a great incentive because it will save interest on overdrafts.</P>
      <P>The purchase of ambulances is very commendable.  I trust that when they are secured, care will be taken of them because there is a danger that when they are brought to a district, they will not get the care which everyone expects them to get.  I appeal to everyone concerned to exercise as much care of this equipment as if it were their own property, because it is their property. It may be of greater value than they think because it may be used to save their lives, if the occassion arises.</P>
      <P>I want to join the Minister in thanking the Red Cross for its work.  I am glad to know of its continued activities and success.  That is a very important work and I trust it will continue to flourish, that more people will take an interest in it, and that there will be more volunteers to work in its different spheres of activity.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if, on the question of promotion in both officer and N.C.O. ranks, he is satisfied that there is no cause for complaint.  I have heard whispers, but rumours are something to which very little attention should be paid.  I am not paying any attention to them because if attention were paid to them, it might make the Army the plaything of politics.  I want deliberately to avoid that.  I want to ask the Minister to see to it, in the question of promotions, that fair play and justice are not only done but will appear to be done.  That may not be too easy, but I appeal to the Minister to make every effort to achieve that standard.  He and his staff should keep their ears to the ground so that if there is any complaint, they will know of it and the matter can be explained to those who think they have a grievance. It is as bad to think you have a grievance as to have one.  If you think you have a grievance and there is no ground for it, it is worse than having a genuine grievance.  I wish the Army continued success.  I trust that their representatives in the Congo will continue to reflect that glory, and live up to the standard, that we all desire for our troops whether at home or abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I once heard it said that a soldier was a person who during a war or a time of emergency was entitled to the highest respect that could be given to anyone, but during peace-time, he was a person who got very little respect from anyone.  I am afraid that the soldiers serving in this country are no exception in that regard.  I know quite a number of the serving soldiers.  I had the honour of serving in the Defence Forces during the emergency and I know the type of treatment which can be given to our men.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate affair in the Congo which resulted in Irish soldiers being sent there, and unfortunately some of them losing their lives, as the Minister rightly said in the cause of freedom, if it did nothing else, brought home to the civilian population the worth of soldiers at all times.  Our soldiers, by going to the Congo and risking their lives, proved that they are as good and as brave as the soldiers of any other nation, and they gained respect not only for themselves but for their comrades who remained in Ireland. I hope that once the public conscience is awakened, our Irish soldiers will be treated with respect.  I believe that the men in the Army are usually a very fine type and they should be given the best treatment.</P>
      <P>The Minister, referring to the pay of the Defence Forces, said that the rates now were comparable with those in outside employment.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on being almost mainly responsible for the last increase in rates granted to the Defence Forces.  It did a lot to wipe out the slur cast on the Defence Forces by what is well known among Army personnel as the fourpence a day rise.  It was a dreadful thing that that fourpence a day was ever allowed to go through, that it ever received the Government's sanction.  To those who were in the Army when it was granted, it will remain as a gratuitous insult by a then Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has rectified that position.  I would not, however, agree it is true to say that the Defence Forces are getting rates comparable with those in outside employment.  The <Col N="1132" /> man in outside employment is a member of a trade union and receives pay and conditions negotiated for the type of work he does.  He goes home at night when his day's work is done and he knows when he is going home and he knows what he is required to do.  That does not apply to members of the Defence Forces.  I know that certain ill-informed people talk about the soft time the soldier has, that he has nothing to do but hang around the barracks all day and spend most of the time sleeping.  Anybody with experience of Army life knows that is not true and that, in fact, the soldier from reveille which is at 6 a.m. or 6.30 a.m., until Lights-Out at night, is on duty all the time.  In fact, he can be required to do whatever duty he is called on to do, not by being asked to do it but by being ordered to do it under pain of military discipline, irrespective of whether he wants to go to see his family or whether he has another appointment.  He is always on call while in the Army.  In fact, he is on duty for 24 hours of the day; except for the two weeks' annual holidays he is always on call.  When we say the rates of pay are comparable with those in outside employment we are not comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to continue the good work he started and try to do something more to compensate the serving soldier for the hardships with which he has to put up.  I am aware that over the years improvements have been made in the conditions of soldiers, particularly in regard to bedding accommodation and food. We know that in some units, particularly during the Emergency, when there were many people under arms, conditions in most cases were not all that were to-be desired.  The Minister should aim at improving still further the serving soldier's accommodation in barracks.  The day is coming when a certain amount of privacy should be given in bedding accommodation to all serving soldiers.  An attempt was made at this some years ago but it did not go very far.</P>
    <P>Another attempt should be made to have more variety in the type of food given to soldiers because, after all, they are human beings and if they are getting <Col N="1133" /> food, even though we are told it is good, wholesome food, day in day out, of the same type and the same quantity, at the same time, it becomes a little unpalatable.  The Minister should endeavour to have his cooks blossom out.  While I do not expect them to produce French dishes, at the same time they might be able to produce dishes which are different from the general run.  I know some dishes were produced during the Emergency which were called French names and which were never on any menu, but at the same time an effort should be made to try to improve the soldiers' menu.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in the dress the soldiers wear.  I know that a walking-out dress was provided some time ago which was some improvement, but I do not think anybody will go into ecstasies about the wonderful change. A little more imagination could have been used and the Minister might endeavour to improve it still further. The ordinary battle dress, the uniform they wear during the day, is the one I want to refer to particularly.  I understand we are now the only civilised nation which has still held on to what is vulgarly known as the bull's wool uniform.  The bull's wool uniform should be abolished.  Perhaps the Minister would endeavour to do something about that also.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the type of boots supplied.  Long ago they were supposed to be only for marching and another type was for use on parade so that the Commanding Officer could see his face in them.  I do not know whether it is possible to combine the two but the footwear should be modernised and made more comfortable. That would help to keep up the morale of the soldiers.  If the soldier has to walk around in old-fashioned boots of the First World War type it does not tend to make him feel any more enthusiastic about his job.  The question of time off is a further matter which I would ask the Minister to look into.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the present size of the Army, coupled with the fact that a considerable number of serving personnel are in the Congo, has resulted in extra pressure being put on those <Col N="1134" /> who remain, but there should be some system devised by which regular breaks could be given to those serving.  The soldier has usually to work every day until 4.30 p.m. and then he is free to go out if the orderly sergeant does not catch him and give him some duty which he had forgotten about up to then, and he is free until 12 o'clock, or a little later if he has a late pass. The trouble about it is that the soldier, and I am mainly dealing with the private soldier and the junior N.C.O., cannot plan for more than a couple of hours.  Granted, some are not doing too badly but at the same time some effort should be made to give more guaranteed time off even if it would mean they would have to stay in barracks on certain evenings for longer periods than at present.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that efforts are being revived to promote from the ranks.  I know it is only from the rank of sergeant up, but the Minister might go a little lower and take on the better type of recruit, because if it reaches the stage where the man, who is thinking of joining the Army, finds that he has a chance of promotion to officer rank it will be an incentive which is not there at present.  While it is all right to say that a man can become an N.C.O. and then qualify it by saying he may become an officer, I think that because of the small number of privates at the present time and because of the fact that some people say that we do not want a Chinese army, all officers and no privates, a view with which I do not agree, that is no reason why the number of officers and N.C.O.s should be kept down.  If we are going to have a Defence Force which can hold its own when required to do so we will want to have the necessary numbers of officers and N.C.O.s.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are officers and N.C.O.s on the Reserve and that the Chief of Staff and the Minister may say that they can be called on when required, but I do not believe that is any use at all.  We should have a number of young men who would be able to play their part, when called on, and the Minister would be well advised to build up to the maximum, <Col N="1135" /> as far as officers and senior N.C.O.s are concerned.  It would provide an incentive for the enthusiastic young soldier to know that he had some promotion before him.</P>
    <P>There is another question, that of soldiers living out of barracks.  I know that the married soldier gets a fairly good marriage allowance but if that married soldier in living in a local authority house, such as here in Dublin city where he has to pay a differential rent, he has to pay an amount of money which far exceeds that which his comrade living in barracks is required to pay.  Something should be done to compensate these soldiers now living out of barracks who have to pay as much as 30/- a week more than the person living in an Army house and, as a result, has 30/- a week less to live on. That is the test.  The Minister might decide that it would be a good idea to level out that.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider the question of providing houses for soldiers living in country districts.  Meath County Council does not discriminate against soldiers although I understand that there are some local authorities that do.  In Meath we consider the soldier in the same way as anybody else where accommodation is concerned but it often happens that there would be half a dozen people looking for the one house.  The soldier, not being a native of the area, would be competing against five people who are natives. The conditions of the applicants may be the same or that of the soldier might be worse but if the soldier gets the house, there is a lot of talk about his getting it and local people being passed over.</P>
    <P>In Gormanston Camp there are a number of serving personnel requiring accommodation and there is no reason why the Minister should not have houses erected on the sites available, or why he should not come to some arrangement with the local authorities in Meath or Dublin to have houses erected for these people.  I am not sure if the Minister has power to do that, but he will know whether he has or not, and I should be glad if he would <Col N="1136" /> refer to it when replying.  Not alone would that result in relief for local authority housing but it would also supply those soldiers, who may be separated from their wives and families by lack of accommodation, with much needed accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in the Vote which is very unreal, that is, the £25 paid to the men who re-enlist.  What does the Minister think the fellow is going to do with the £25?  Does the Minister believe that £25 will encourage a man who has served a period in the Army and gone into civil life to re-enlist?  It reminds me of the old story of the fellow who took the Queen's shilling and got a few drinks and did not know what he was doing.  He was broke and had nothing to do but to re-join.  It would appear that the same idea was at the back of the minds of the persons who suggested giving £25.  If there is to be a re-enlistment fee, let it be related to conditions in 1962 and not to those of 1900.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear the Minister's reference to the Naval Service and to the failure to get recruits for that service.  It is a service that we should do everything possible to keep up.  I have a certain connection with the fishing industry and one of the things that fishing people are always looking for is protection.  We know the depredations committed by foreign trawlers at the mouths of our main salmon fishing rivers.  They can make a clean sweep with their nylon nets and take more fish in one day than our own fishermen would take in a year.  We are told that there is a fishery protection service and, while I do not know how the Minister would arrange it, he should try to encourage energetic young men to join the Naval Service even if it means training them for a life as inshore fishermen later on.  I think this effort should be made.</P>
    <P>We call ourselves an island nation but we have only three small vessels which are supposed to cater for all our needs.  That is too ridiculous for words.  I am not blaming the Minister for it.  This condition of things has been handed down from year to year and from Government to Government. But if the matter were properly tackled <Col N="1137" /> the Minister should be able to get enough men who would take an interest in becoming the future inshore fishermen of this country as well as being the future protection service personnel.  I suppose the Minister is aware of what happens in the towns and villages along the sea coast where groups of young men aged between 17 and 20 go away to serve on sea-going vessels as their fathers went before them.  After a few years, they come back and settle down to continue fishing or whatever is their families' line.</P>
    <P>I feel confident the Minister, if he puts the right energy into it, can persuade these people that it would be far better they should join the Irish Naval Service rather than go abroad on some tramp steamer.  The question of the type of discipline they would have to put up with might be discouraging, and while I believe you cannot run any service without discipline, at the same time, I suggest that in order to encourage these young people we should not have any martinets, people who are prepared to keep up the old spit and polish from reveille in the morning until lights out.  There should be an effort made to ease the restrictions somewhat in an effort to get the right type of young people into the service.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear reference to the fact that modern weapons are being bought.  We still see soldiers training in this country, in this year, with the old Lee-Enfield and while it did serve this country and, I suppose, a number of armies in two world wars, it would be too bad if it had to be produced again, should a third world war unfortunately start.  The modern light weapons available now, no matter what the cost, should be used here. This question of trying to train soldiers with out-of-date weapons is something which is only playing at the game and should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has said the integration of the FCA into the Regular Army is proceeding well.  I was glad to hear that.  We in the Labour Party suggested that some years ago, but it was not at all popular.  However, I am glad the Minister has found it is working out well but I should like to warn him that he should not rely too much <Col N="1138" /> on appearances.  It would be wrong for the Minister to say that, because he has on paper a certain number training in the FCA who hold periodic camps and inspections, everything is grand and that if ever we had another emergency, which, I trust, will not arise, we had the hard core of a Defence Force.  It is important the Minister should realise there will have to be some effort made to keep a certain number in the FCA in this country.  Under the present position where there is a hard core remaining there is still a very big shrinkage.  Throughout the country certain young people join the FCA and carry on with enthusiasm for six to 12 months, but then disappear.  It simply means that you have not got the continuing trained personnel which on paper you might appear to have.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like the Minister to remember is that during the last Emergency, there was an idea in the country that the FCA and the Regular Army were two units which could be closely knitted together in case of necessity.  I know there was a deep distrust between the Regular Army and the LDF as it was then known.  There was an idea in the Regular Army that, after all, the LDF were only civilians who could not be trusted.  That was a great mistake. People who have been in the LDF will remember that those in that force were, perhaps, better trained than some of our regular soldiers and that they should be entrusted with little more responsibility.  Consequently, when the Minister refers to integration, I would ask him to see that it is real integration, not something which breaks down when the test comes along.</P>
    <P>One other question I should like to refer to is that of Army pensions. The Minister must do something about Army pensions.  We are still very mean in our approach to it.  If somebody serves in the Army for a number of years he should get a decent pension, not just a small sum which is of very little use to him.  At the moment, we have numerous people completing their 21 years' service and preparing to retire at a relatively young age.  Many of them may be only 37 or 38 years of age, and, <Col N="1139" /> unfortunately, at the moment there is an idea in the minds of certain employers, regrettably in some instances, in the minds of State employers, that when a person reaches that age, he is a bit over the top, as far as work is concerned.  Directives have been sent to certain State or semi-State employers that they are not to employ a man of over 40 years of age and, consequently, a person leaving the Army at, say, 38, may find it extremely difficult to get any kind of employment.  I would ask the Department which such a person has served for 21 years to see that he gets a decent pension.  I feel sure the people of the country would not impede the Minister in any effort he might make to improve Army pensions.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer in this connection to Army officers with pre-True service.  The retirement age for such officers was reduced in 1957. This appears to have been an injustice to those men who came into the service of the State at its establishment. They were people, many of whom fought during the Civil War against the present administration. Despite that, they served the present Government loyally through the years and many of them were, in fact, responsible for the training of the present Army.  They turned out to be excellent soldiers, excellent officers. There was once a suggestion that those older men were holding up promotions of younger men by being retained and an order was made that they should be retired forthwith.  In July, 1949, the Minister for Defence amended the regulations and provided one year's additional service for any officer who had pre-Truce service.  In November, 1954, the Minister gave a further year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a reference here to Civil Defence.  In that reference, it is assumed that wonderful progress has been made in regard to Civil Defence and bouquets are thrown around to various people for the wonderful efforts they have made.  I am afraid I cannot agree with the Minister that Civil Defence is being dealt with seriously at all.  In a number of areas, some people have taken it up enthusiastically, but I think there was a lot more interest in it two years ago than now. The ordinary person does not know what it is all about.  If you expect people to take an active interest in it, an effort should be made to explain it to them. I know that Civil Defence officers have been appointed in certain areas, that meetings have been held with public representatives and that there have been film shows and so on to show what the effect would be if an atomic bomb were dropped, but the ordinary man-in-the-street does not appear to know what Civil Defence is all about. This is not true not alone of the country districts but also of the towns and cities.  It is suggested that cellars under local authority buildings be used for training, but there is no suggestion as to what should be done, if they are not available.  If Civil Defence is as necessary as the Minister says, it should be brought to the notice of every citizen by all possible means.  It is the Minister's responsibility to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> I should like to refer briefly to the question of civilian employees, to which reference is made here.  Here again the State has been dragging its feet.  We have the case of a group of very humble people, the civilian pioneers attached to the military camps.  Their rate of wages is tied to the local county council rate, which is pretty low, and their hours of work are the same as the local council workers.  It has been that way for years. When wage rates are negotiated for the local authority workers, the civilian employees get the same increase.</P>
    <P>This year, however, something different has happened.  This year, for local authority workers, there has been a reduction in working hours from 48 to 45 and the introduction of a five-day week.  But while the Department of Defence always said they kept in line with the county councils, they have not done so on this occasion.  Instead, they kept their employees on a five-and-a-half day week of 48 hours.  Eventually, when pressure was put on them, they agreed to reduce the number of hours to 45, but even then they would not grant a five-day week.  To make matters worse, the maintenance workers in the camp I am referring to, who were on the same rate as building trade operatives, now have a five-day week of 45 hours, while these unfortunate people, paid less than anybody else, will not be allowed to work a five-day week.</P>
    <P>I do not know what big brain decided this should be done.  While, perhaps, this is a task the Minister should not have, I think he will have to do something about it.  We did everything we could, but all we got were very polite answers from the Department of Defence.  The Department are always very polite, but they have not done anything further about it.  I should like the Minister to have that matter investigated.  I do not want the Minister to make any comment on it because it is a matter that should not have to be brought to his notice at all.  In regard to the service medal, does the Minister want to deal with that under Pensions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin commenced his contribution to this debate by referring to allegations made against our troops in the Congo.  I read a great many papers and I know that allegations were made against other troops.  According to what I have read, there was some truth in these allegations. But it was admitted that there were absolutely no grounds for the allegations made against our Irish troops.  Any charges arising in relation to our troops in the Congo were in regard to ordinary disciplinary matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin also asked about some inquiry in Kilkenny barracks. He said that the Minister might not like to comment publicly on it, but he would like to know privately.  If the matter is to be raised here publicly, then I am afraid the Minister will have to make any comment he has to make on it publicly.  I do not know what is happening in Kilkenny barracks.</P>
      <P>With regard to our forces in the Congo, may I say that this Congo adventure has provided our troops with an opportunity of gaining experience? When the Army was first set up, we were in the happy position of being able to recruit people who had taken part in the Great War.  During the last emergency, we had a great many trained people.  It is so long since there was a war that there are now no first-class trained personnel. In other words, our Army has no real experience of war.  The experience gained in the Congo will be a great asset.  We have discovered, for instance, that our weapons were not up to standard.  The Congo is somewhat primitive and trouble met there would be nothing like the kind of trouble one might meet up with in a more modern country, but we have at least had some experience.  Our troops did some fighting.  There were casualties. We had the opportunity of comparing ourselves and our equipment with the troops and equipment of other nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the experience gained there, we now know that we need a <Col N="1147" /> lighter automatic weapon with a greater firepower.  The intention now is to equip our Army at home with similar weapons, although these weapons are expensive.  So long as we make a start in the right direction and keep moving, there is some chance that we will bring our home forces up to date.</P>
    <P>Criticism was made that some of our vehicles are very poor and were rejected by the G.O.C.  That was stated in English newspapers.  I notice that the Minister stated today that £300,000 was provided for the purchase of automatic weapons and armoured vehicles.  That is all to the good.</P>
    <P>I see one danger.  With the old Lee-Enfield rifle, there was always the possibility of getting ammunition because Britain was close at hand.  If necessary, we could ourselves manufacture the ammunition.  Indeed, there was always plenty around.  I am concerned about these Belgian weapons. It would be a bad thing to equip our Army with these and later find ourselves with weapons but no ammunition. Belgium is one of those countries that seems to be overrun very quickly when hostilities arise, or else she surrenders. She is not a very strong country.  If we are dependent on Belgium for supplies of ammunition, we may find our Army equipped with weapons rendered useless because there is no ammunition for them.  It is not a question of just one round; it is a question of 100,000,000 rounds. There must be no danger of the supply being cut off.  I impress that on the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Lee-Enfield rifle has become somewhat obsolete.  I have always held the view that any defence we are likely to put up here will be a guerilla defence.  In that case, the Lee-Enfield rifle will not be so obsolete at all.  I believe they are good for another 50 years.  We should not depend on them; we should not make them the Army's weapon, but we should keep them in reserve.  In the event of hostilities here, the Army as such will disappear.  The civilian army will take over then and that army will depend <Col N="1148" /> largely on what it can get its hands on.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of Civil Defence. It was said no one takes any interest in it.  Naturally&mdash;the only thing about it is that there is a certain glamour about the uniform and the social activities.  If that were not there, no one would join.  Civil Defence is like flogging a dead horse.  People are either not interested in war or they hold up their hands in horror at the prospect of war.  We must pay tribute to those who are prepared to serve in these Civil Defence groups.  They form the nucleus of a much larger organisation, should it become necessary to expand.  There should be a group in every city and town upon which to build, if the necessity arises</P>
    <P>With regard to recruiting, recruiting is never a success in peacetime.  In the old days, the officer class was manned largely by dud sons who failed in business. The rank and file were for the most part pressed into service.  They were people who had no hope of ever obtaining employment or making a living on their own.  They were the derelicts of humanity.  We know all about the press-gangs.  That was the old army.  We have to depend now on voluntary service.  That does not seem to simplify matters.  There is one bright star on the horizon now for N.C.O.s&mdash;&mdash;they can in future become officers.  If men have no outlet for promotion, they lose interest.  They become mechanical.  If one wants the right type, the intelligent and the ambitious, standards must be such that they can obtain promotion.  The fact that N.C.O.s can in future become officers should help recruiting.  The possibility is that this will have the effect of inducing a better type to join the Army and these better types will hold on rather than resign.  There should always be hope.  That is the one thing everyone should have.  We want to keep people interested.</P>
    <P>I was always against this business of picking people out to wear the braid. It is very strange that in times of revolution the gentlemen with the braid do not count very much.  It is the people who have &ldquo;it&rdquo; who forge their way to the front.  It is the sergeants, <Col N="1149" /> the corporals the privates and the people who were never in any organisation who often come to the front.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that non-commissioned officers can now become officers.  I hope the examination will not be made too difficult for them.  I hope their standard of education will not have to be too high.  We expect a certain standard but not perhaps the standard previously demanded that would bar many of them.  Allowances should be made for the fact that war is not just a game of being able to synchronise certain words and certain big words.  It is a question of courage, of sense and of grit.  War is where the animal instinct in the highest degree comes into operation, as well as just academic knowledge.</P>
    <P>I know that certain Parties here have a habit of picking their men for nomination to the Dáil and that, for that very reason, their organisation is a flop.  I know other organisations who allow their rank and file to do the picking and who are a great success.  I know that from experience. There is the answer to interest in the army.  Let the men feel they can get to the top, that there are no bars, and you will have a greater interest and a better type coming in and, furthermore, a better type will remain there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers before me, I should like to pay a tribute initially to the troops who have served in the Congo.  It is very right that we should try to understand the task which these officers, non-commissioned officers and men have been trying to carry out and, in fact, are carrying out brilliantly.  It is often felt, quite wrongly, that these troops were sent out as combat troops to fight a war.  In actual fact, in the initial stages, at least, they were sent out purely for police duties and were therefore, very correctly, very lightly armed.  Eventually, the situation did deteriorate in the Congo and more and more of our troops became involved in military operations.  In one of these operations, I think our troops have been very consistently misunderstood and in particular, the <Col N="1150" /> commanding officer of those troops.  I refer to the company which was engaged very heavily at Jadotville. This company was sent to that area purely to protect the European population against an alleged threat from the local tribesmen.  They were sent to protect human life and to preserve the peace.</P>
      <P>In actual fact, they had hardly arrived there before they were set upon by Congolese troops led by Europeans. In those circumstances, I think the company distinguished itself.  I think the commanding officer deserves the very highest credit for the skill with which he selected an advance position, for the skill with which he disposed his troops and for the fighting spirit which he infused into them.  They fought extremely well.  They suffered negligible casualties&mdash;mercifully, none was killed.  They did show they were good fighting men by inflicting very heavy casualties indeed on those who were attacking them, in spite of the fact that they were exposed to heavy attack from the air, as well as from the ground.</P>
      <P>An opportunity arose to negotiate a cease-fire and, in the circumstances, the commanding officer very properly, took that opportunity.  It must be remembered he was not there to win a military victory.  As he said himself, though he was grossly misinterpreted, if he had been fighting for Ireland, he would never have surrendered.  At Jadotville, he was not fighting for anything except self-preservation.  I think his action, in agreeing to a cease-fire, even at the risk of being tricked into a surrender, was absolutely correct and I think he took an extremely difficult decision.  He took it extremely courageously and well&mdash;and thereby saved the lives not only of his own men but of the Congolese who had been incited to attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he and his men were prisoners, they co-operated with their captors to the very limit, to such an extent that some of them even became the godfathers of the children of those who had taken them prisoner.  That, in itself, shows that, even as prisoners, our men were working for peace and <Col N="1151" /> co-operation and they did it extremely well.  I hope that, in due course, if it has not already happened, suitable recognition will be paid to this officer, and the officers and non-commissioned officers and men who served under him.  I think they have been grossly maligned in the Press of other countries and some times unintentionally misunderstood by ourselves.  It is all very well to say that an officer has done brilliantly by taking and securing very difficult positions.  The commanding officer at Jadotville had a very much more difficult job to do and, in my view, he did it supremely well.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Estimate itself, I would start with Subhead A.1 which refers to the pay of officers.  It is noticeable that in this Subhead a deduction is made in respect of numbers being below strength and a further deduction is made in respect of possible resignations.  To my mind, it is an absolute tragedy that a provision such as this should have to be made at all.</P>
    <P>It seems that it is accepted as inevitable that we shall never get up to our proper peacetime establishment, so far as officers are concerned.  One of the main reasons why our officer strength is below establishment is undoubtedly the question of pay.  This is a matter to which I referred when the Supplementary Estimate was introduced earlier this year.  In his reply, the Minister suggested that perhaps I was not quite fair in stressing the disparity between the pay, say, of a commandant and that of a higher executive officer in the civil service.  He suggested that there are other advantages and perquisites for officers which, if taken into consideration, would lead to a fairly general equalisation.  I question that: in fact, I deny it.  The only advantages and perquisites which an Army officer may be said to have are uniform allowances, free medical attention and widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <P>What is the value of the perquisites? First, the uniform allowance at the moment amounts to £39 per annum and nobody could say that is excessive or an amount which would give any great incentive to an officer to be too lavish with his expenditure.  It must be <Col N="1152" /> remembered that an officer must still provide himself with proper civilian clothing and consequently all he gets in respect of his uniform allowance is his working clothes and no more.</P>
    <P>Medical attention is provided for the officer only; it does not extend to his wife or children.  Its value can easily be assessed by comparing it with the facilities granted by Voluntary Health Insurance and nothing the very low premium payable to that organisation. To attempt to use this as a set-off against parity with the Civil Service is an inaccuracy.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the fact that whereas a man or woman may enter the Civil Service by passing an examination at the initial stage, or possibly by selection by the Civil Service Commission, an officer has a much harder job before he can secure his commission.  He must first pass all the necessary preliminary examinations which refer both to his mental capacity and his physical health which must be excellent.  He must then undergo long and arduous training in a military college, something that could never, and never does, happen in the Civil Service.  Conditions of service in the military college are severe and probably rightly so, but the hardship which is endured there and the intensive study are without parallel in the Government service.</P>
    <P>Further, having received his commission and having served for a considerable period before he can receive any worthwhile promotion, he must again submit himself to further training in the Military College.  That course also is arduous: it is exhaustive and exhausting and anybody who can undergo it and succeed deserves every promotion he can subsequently secure.</P>
    <P>We come next to the perquisite of widows' and orphans' pensions.  That pension is granted only because Army service is apt to be dangerous.  A civil servant is not accustomed to handling live ammunition or explosives or undergoing arduous training in the field which is dangerous.  Every officer is exposed to these risks.  Consequently, it is anticipated that the death rate from accidents alone is bound to be higher in the Army than in the Civil Service and provision must be made <Col N="1153" /> for widows and orphans accordingly. But it is entirely incorrect and unfair to suggest that by having widows' and orphans' pensions available to them, officers have an unfair advantage over civil servants.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to make some reference to the perquisites of civil servants themselves.  When civil servants are transferred to areas where it is difficult to secure accommodation, they are paid substantial disturbance allowances, but in the Army where transfers are much more the rule than the exception, the officer is fortunate when he avoids being penalised by being made to pay for single quarters when married quarters are not available.  Again, on the very day that a Civil Servant gets married, he receives a substantial gratuity; the Army officer does not. Certainly, it is not anything like as immediate and may not in fact be granted for some time.  That applies to the marriage allowance&mdash;he certainly gets no marriage gratuity.</P>
    <P>This leads to the question of children's allowances.  The Minister has been advised that the reason for the discrepancy between the allowances paid to the Army officer and those paid to the civil servant is these alleged perquisites and privileges.  I wish the Minister would pay more attention to the serving officers, especially those in G.H.Q. than to his civilian advisers because I think if he were more closely in touch with serving Army officers, he would know better than to accept such an explanation.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair and quite intolerable that serving officers should suffer this discrimination.  Even at this stage, I hope the Minister will reconsider the whole matter and say that it costs as much for an Army officer to rear a child as it does a civil servant and that in the future there will be no longer stupid discrimination of this sort.</P>
    <P>It is not right that it should be left to Deputies to raise these arguments. In the old days, long before this State was founded, the Army was not only referred to but accepted as &ldquo;the brutal and licentious soldiery&rdquo; who, more or less, had to be kept down lest they might run amok and ravage the <Col N="1154" /> civilian population.  Now there is no danger of the Army running amok; consequently, the situation should be altered by the creation of some proper negotiating machinery whereby the grievances of officers, N.C.O.s and men could properly be brought to the notice of the Minister direct.</P>
    <P>These are matters which affect morale tremendously.  We have seen trouble with other branches of the State service where representative bodies have not won the complete confidence of those whom they are supposed to represent.  I hope the Minister will not be discouraged by that and that he will seriously consider providing some negotiating machinery whereby officers, N.C.O.s and men can elect some body to represent them and make their views known.</P>
    <P>This is not merely a question of voicing grievances.  Very often, helpful suggestions could be made through such a representative body, if it were formed.  So, while I do not think that the lack of officers is entirely due to pay&mdash;I think it is very largely due to it&mdash;I hope the Minister will deal with the pay question and also with the other matters to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The actual discrepancy between the peace time establishment and the expected number of officers is 7.7 per cent.  To that must be added a further 2 per cent. for resignations.  Resignations disturb me because we should not have officers resigning as they are doing.  Officers should be so wrapped up in their job that they stay there as long as they conceivably can.  In fact, for various reasons which it is sometimes difficult to identify, far too many officers are retiring at a comparatively early age.  If there were greater expenditure I would think there would also be much greater economy because at the moment a tremendous amount of money is spent in enlisting a cadet, training him and bringing him to senior officer rank, or even up to junior officer rank, for that matter, and if that officer retires just after he is coming to his prime, a tremendous proportion of the cost of his training has gone down the drain.  It has always been a fault of the Department of Defence particularly to be penny <Col N="1155" /> wise and pound foolish, to be scrimping here and scrimping there, forgetting that they are thereby causing a tremendous amount of unnecessary expenditure elsewhere.  If the officers were treated much more fairly they would still not be treated unduly generously but the country would get a far better return on its money.</P>
    <P>Now we come to N.C.O.s and men. The Minister referred to the peace time establishment and admitted that there had to be a substantial allowance because it was not expected the peace time establishment would be achieved. It looks as if the actual strength will be 32 per cent. below the peace time establishment.  That, to me, is a very frightening figure.  There are various reasons for it.  One is, quite certainly, bad recruiting propaganda.  When one sees the sort of advertising which is carried out by State companies, particularly Aer Lingus, at the moment and also by large industrial concerns in this country one realises that publicity is a highly specialised business. The recruiting posters and Press advertisements show an appalling lack of imagination.  They certainly would not make me interested in even considering joining the Army.  One of them, a very big advertisement, which must cost a great deal of money, showed a number of men in ordinary drill order, peak caps, sitting motionless on a Bofor anti-aircraft gun on the parade ground.  Very small boys may like playing with a machine which has handles which you can turn, but it is a pastime which rapidly palls, and how anybody can be expected to get passionately excited about joining the Army by seeing these men sitting on an anti-aircraft gun holding on to handles, just beats me.  Quite apart from anything else, this was the gun which was turned down by the United Nations military staff for duty in the Congo against, not offensive jet aircraft, but merely training aircraft.  The gun itself, possibly, was all right but the gun controls were not sufficient even for duty in the Congo.  There was extraordinarily bad publicity and extraordinarily bad psychology.</P>
    <P>Possibly somebody thought that was <Col N="1156" /> a bad idea and the next advertisement was equally large with some very small photographs, very badly reproduced, of soldiers in rather odd positions with equipment in their hands which was quite unidentifiable.  There was one soldier who appeared to have an overgrown drainpipe pointing in a certain direction; others who were using equipment which I could not identify.  The only thing which was perfectly clear was a nice picture of a private soldier in walking-out dress. The walking-out dress is not too bad but it is not all that glamorous as to make a fellow feel &ldquo;Would it not be gorgeous to be dressed like that fellow?&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  It could very probably be put that way.  Nobody's girl friend would feel all that &ldquo;fetched&rdquo; by that photograph either. I would ask the Minister to reconsider this question of publicity and do as has been done in Armies all over the world, that is, employ a professional publicity firm to do a good job.  I do not know who has done the job so far.  I only hope they were not professionals.  If they were professionals the only explanation possible is that they were told to do it at an absolutely cut price. That is possible.  No decent publicity agency would ever produce such rot, such unexciting, boring nonsense as has been published in the name of Army recruiting.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from that, the general public relations system of the Army is practically negligible.  The Army is never brought to the notice of the public.  It is kept very much in secret. Even our troops going to the Congo and coming back are hardly seen at all by the public.  They are assembled almost in secret in various places, whipped out to the airport and everybody is held well back while they board the planes and disappear.  When they come back, they are spread around the country as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite understand that troops coming back from the Congo do not wish, first of all, to be faced with long <Col N="1157" /> ceremonial parades, and so on but it should be possible when a battalion returns from the Congo to have it broken up into its constituent companies which are organised on a command basis and let those companies come back again after their period of leave has expired and parade through the towns and cities of their command area.  Let their officers and N.C.O.s give lectures to the public, demonstrate the equipment they have been using, show some of the colourful mementoes and souvenirs they have brought back with them, describe the situation in the Congo, why the troops are being sent out there, and so forth. I know some of the officers have done a superb job of lecturing to civilian organisations on their operations and experiences in the Congo.  They are <Col N="1158" /> well able to do it.  With a bit more imagination the message of the modern vocation of an Irish Army could be got across to the civilian population, with tremendous effect.</P>
    <P>When this House decided unanimously to send troops to the Congo, I felt this would be the Army's finest hour.  The Army has done superbly well but it has not received the recognition it deserves; it has not received the support it should have received and, particularly, it has not had the influx of new recruits which undoubtedly it deserves.</P>

      <P>A grant towards the cost of carrying out a scheme of improvements at Damastown National School was sanctioned in January last by my Department.  The carrying out of the scheme is a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works.  It will be necessary for them to have detailed working drawings and specification prepared as a preliminary to the invitation of tenders.  Owing to the very heavy volume of work which the Commissioners have in hands, they will not be in a position to undertake the preparation of the working drawings for some months.</P>
      <P>The alternative site offered by the Reverend Manager some time ago for the erection of a new national school at Ballyboughal has not yet been examined.  It is understood that the Commissioners of Public Works propose to have the site surveyed during the next week.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to replace the existing premises at Naul by a new school but no progress can be made until a site acceptable to the Commissioners of Public Works is made available.</P>
