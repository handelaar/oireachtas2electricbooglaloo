      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what consideration has so far been given to the question as to the extent, if any, to which it will be necessary to alter (a) the Constitution and (b) domestic law to meet the requirements involved in membership of the European Economic Community under the Treaty of Rome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the names of the members of the committee established by the Attorney General to consider and advise on the possible legislative changes necessary should Ireland adhere to the European Economic Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, Sir, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>As the House has already been informed, an inter-departmental committee was set up under the chairmanship of the Attorney General to examine the legal problems which will arise in connection with this country's accession to the European Economic Community.  The constitutional implications are also being covered.</P>
      <P>The Departments of External Affairs and Justice, as well as the Office of the Attorney General, are represented on the committee.  It is the practice not to publish the names of civil servants who are members of inter-departmental committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say how long, in fact, the committee has been functioning, how many meetings have been held and whether, to date, the committee has ascertained that it will be necessary to amend either the Constitution or the domestic law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to give the information the Deputy requires, regarding the number of meetings held by the committee, without notice.  The committee has been functioning for some time and is likely to continue to function for some time yet.  It is dealing with a problem on which the position of the Community itself has not been clarified and which was the subject of a protracted debate recently in the European Parliament. I do not think it would be wise for us to try to reach conclusions in our own behalf in this matter until the views of other countries, which have similar problems, become known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether between now and Ireland's proposed acceptance into the EEC it will be possible for workers declared redundant as a result of regrouping or reorganisation in industry, in agriculture or in CIE to apply for retraining or resettlement grants, or any other facilities or benefits, said to be available to them under the provisions of the Rome Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty of Rome provides for the establishment of a European Social Fund to which the Member States of the European Economic Community shall contribute and from which they can draw, on specific conditions, a proportion of what they spend on the resettlement and retraining of workers or on the maintenance of their wage levels.  It is not clear to what extent expenditure incurred under those heads in advance of our becoming a member of the Community would qualify for recoupment from the European Social Fund. This is a matter on which clarification will be sought in negotiations with the Member States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Taoiseach has accepted, in regard to the various CIO reports, that regrouping or reorganisation will be needed and that, in relation to some of them&mdash;particularly the rayon and cotton industries&mdash;in order to make Ireland competitive in Continental markets, it would mean possibly the declaration of at least 30 per cent. of the persons employed as redundant? If we are to be ready by the time we enter the European Economic Community, these people may be declared redundant.  Will any action be taken to protect their position or to help them in resettlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably be disappointed to learn that three new mills of that kind are at <Col N="1130" /> present under construction, the promoters of which are fully aware of the competition they will have to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not answered my question.  I asked whether, if these people are declared redundant, they will be eligible for any resettlement grants which are said to be available to them under the Treaty of Rome.  Have they any guarantee that these grants will be made available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the urgency, which the Taoiseach has emphasised, in relation to all this regrouping and reorganisation, would he not agree that if he could make this point clear to the workers and the trade union movement, in the first instance, without any further delay, he would get much more co-operation, certainly from the workers, who may feel their jobs are jeopardised?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>Imports of cars are brought to account under the headings of the Official Import List, which does not distinguish between individual makes of cars.  However, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing, firstly, the value of road motor vehicles (body and chassis aggregates) imported from Czechoslovakia each year from 1959, and in the first nine months of this year, and secondly, the number of Skoda cars registered and licensed for the first time in each year since 1959 and in the nine months ended 30th September, 1962.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Imports of Road Motor Vehicles (body and chassis aggregates) from Czechoslovakia in each year 1959-1961 and in the period January-September 1962.</P>

      <P>Suppose the Minister's case is valid, that the figures on the basis asked for are irrelevant, surely from the point of view of reasonable public relations these figures ought to be supplied, leaving it quite open to the Board of CIE to say to the deputation: &ldquo;We gave you these figures at your request but for the following reasons they are not really relevant to the question to be discussed between us as to whether a line is to be closed or not&rdquo;?

As I indicated in a speech I made on the occasion of my last Estimate any complaints of a kind which have a common relation to the transport of livestock are particularly carefully looked at in my Department and appropriate representations made.  The <Col N="1143" /> number of complaints made is absolutely negligible in the last six months and I would be glad to hear of any exceptions, if the Deputy would care to communicate them to me.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose taking Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that the number of employees who received compensation in consequence of the termination of their employment with CIE during the period 1st October, 1958 to 1st November, 1962, was 976; of this number 928 were awarded compensation in the form of an annual sum and 48 by way of lump sum.</P>
      <P>In addition, 516 employees received lump sum compensation for worsening of conditions on transfer, following redundancy.</P>
      <P>The total number of workers included in the foregoing who received compensation in consequence of the termination of their employment with CIE during the period 1st January, 1959, to 1st November, 1962 was 850.</P>
      <P>CIE have informed me that it is not possible to segregate from their records, which include transfers and dismissals of all kinds, particulars of the numbers of short service and other employees who were either transferred or dismissed without entitlement to compensation because of permanent redundancy.</P>
      <P>The continuing reorganisation of the undertaking has achieved economies in equipment, operating and maintenance costs as well as in labour, and it is not possible to segregate savings due to redundancy alone.  The overall reductions in expenditure have been reflected in the Board's accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy cares to ask a question about the matter, I can give him very explicit information about the consultation that does take place in the case to which the Deputy referred previously in the matter of the works at Spa Road.  The consultations began as long ago as 1959.  In June, 1961, the Trade Unions were <Col N="1145" /> given full information on the way in which redundancy would be carried out.</P>

      <P>The voluntary contribution payable by importers of fresh fish is an integral part of revised importing arrangements introduced a few years ago.  These arrangements enable me to exercise effective control over the imports and at the same time enable the importers to buy to the best advantage so that fish can be imported more cheaply than before.  Such a reduction in cost falls to be offset against the contribution with the result that the price payable by the consumer should not be higher than under a more rigid system of import control which I would feel obliged to impose in the absence of the contribution. In other words, the contribution at the rate of 3d. a lb. to the Fishing Industry Development Fund must not be considered in isolation but as part of arrangements aimed at providing cheaper fish for the consumer.</P>

The suboffice at Clash became vacant and was filled on two occasions.  The usual procedure for filling sub-postmaster vacancies was followed in these cases. They were advertised locally, the candidates were interviewed and the premises offered by them inspected by the local postmaster who furnished reports to headquarters.  In one case there was only one candidate and he was appointed.  In the other cases the postmaster's report and the applications were examined by a selection board consisting of senior officers of my Department.  In each case the selection board recommended not more than three candidates as suitable for appointment and I appointed one of the candidates recommended by the Board.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state with regard to St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, Dublin (a) the number of first year students who passed the last first-year final examination and the number who failed, (b) with regard to the pupils who failed, the subjects in which they failed, (c) the number (if any) of students who, having failed, were subsequently recalled, although they had been notified that they could not be recalled, and (d) if any of the students referred to at (c) were recalled, the reasons for their recall, and the reasons why others who failed were not recalled.</P>

      <P>In order to be recalled to the second year of training at St. Patrick's Training College a student must reach a standard at the first year examination which is acceptable to the Training College authorities and my Department and must be favourably recommended by the College authorities. Four of the 106 students at the first year examination in 1962 failed <Col N="1164" /> in two or more of the subjects English, History, Geography, Practice of Teaching and Hygiene and were in addition not given a favourable recommendation. These four students were not recalled.  There was no case such as that referred to in (c) of the Deputy's question and (d) does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>This matter was fully discussed by Dáil Éireann in connection with the passing through the House of the Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) (Amendment) Act, 1961.  It was then apparent that the majority of the Deputies agreed that the financial allocation laid down in the Act as between post-primary and University scholarships was a fair one.  Nothing has happened in the meantime which would lead me to believe that the provisions of the Act in this respect have proved inequitable. I do not propose, therefore, to introduce amending legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a scheme in operation in my Department for providing State aid towards the cost of supplying school books to necessitous children attending national schools.  My Department also urges, in its annual circular to managers and principal teachers regarding the list of approved text books, that care be taken to see that school books are not changed too frequently.  I do not at present propose to take any further steps in the matter as I do not feel that it is one which should be given precedence over other educational items which will demand added expenditure from State funds.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the House that a new National Loan will open for subscription on Monday next, 19th November. The Loan will be for £20 million but £4.8 million of the stock is being allotted to certain life assurance offices so that the amount available for public subscription will be £15.2 million which will be underwritten jointly by the Banks and the Government.</P>
      <P>The rate of interest will be 5¾ per cent. per annum and the price £99 for each £100 of stock purchased so that the annual return on each £100 of cash invested in the stock will be £5 16s. 2d.  The stock will be redeemed at par not later than 1987 and may be redeemed at any time from October, 1982.  As the issue is being made at a discount, there will be a capital gain of £1 per cent. on redemption and this will be tax-free to the ordinary investor.</P>
      <P>The usual provision is made in the Prospectus whereby only 10 per cent. of the purchase price need be paid on application, the remainder being paid in three further instalments spread over the period to the middle of January.  This should facilitate investors in taking up stock.  On the other hand, those who wish to pay the full amount on application next week, or to complete their subscription on 12th December, will be entitled to discount equivalent to an interest rate of 5¾ per cent. per annum on the advance payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax privileges attached to recent National Loans are again included. Interest will be paid without deduction of income tax at source, but, of course, holders will, if ordinarily resident in <Col N="1169" /> the State, be liable for whatever tax on the interest is appropriate to their respective incomes.  Stock of the issue will be accepted at its nominal value as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties on properties of which it formed a part.  The stock and the interest on it will be exempt from all Irish taxation, present and future, if owned by a person neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
    <P>The issue is being made under the authority of the Appropriation Act, 1962, and other statutes.  Both principal and interest will be a charge on the Central Fund.  The attractive interest rate it carries, its status as a trustee security, the concession whereby it will be accepted in payment of death duties and the substantial sinking fund allocations should ensure that the stock will always have a high market value.  The Government stockbroker will at all times be prepared to buy and sell reasonable amounts of the stock, and this will help to maintain an active market in it.</P>
    <P>An additional £5 million of the stock will be issued to Departmental Funds in conversion of Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Loan is required to assist in the financing of State capital outlay on agriculture and industry; on housing, sanitary services and schools; on afforestation and fuel resources; on transport and on other development schemes in pursuance of the Programme for Economic Expansion.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are well aware, it is primarily to our own people we must look to provide the funds needed for national development.  It is only by applying the maximum amount of resources to productive purposes at home that we can increase employment and raise living standards.  I should like, therefore, to stress once again the continuing need for a high level of savings.  The new loan gives an excellent opportunity for the investment of savings, and subscribers to it will be doing their part to promote the development of the national economy while at the same time securing for themselves a safe investment <Col N="1170" /> and an attractive annual return on their capital.</P>
    <P>The prospectus of the issue will be published in to-morrow morning's newspapers.  Copies of the prospectus with the application form for subscriptions attached will also be available as from to-morrow from any bank, stockbroker or post office.  The lists will close not later than Friday, 23rd November.</P>
    <P>I confidently ask for the full and active support of every Deputy in the House for the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinarily, Deputy Sweetman would speak on behalf of this Party in regard to a matter of this kind.  Having lost his voice, he has asked me to deputise for him on this occasion.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of this loan, on behalf of the principal Opposition Party in this House, I desire to say that we commend it to the investors of this country as as good a security as money can buy.  We have always believed that any security issued on the credit of the Irish nation was a good security.  We believe it now as we believed it in the past.  In the fullest possible confidence, we recommend it as such to our people or to any other people who may be interested in its purchase.</P>
      <P>So far as the issue price is concerned, bearing in mind the current information, it would seem that the interest rate is generous and, with the prospect envisaged by Mr. Jacobsson in his reports on the necessity for cheaper money and an expansion of the monetary policy throughout the free world, it is highly likely that an issue price of £99 for each £100 of stock, with 5¾ per cent.  interest, will be difficult to match in the early future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, on the basis of the security, with its long-term aspect, on the basis of the value of the interest rate and on the basis of the issue price, we have no hesitation in recommending to our people and others, at home and abroad, generous investment in what may be the most advantageous <Col N="1171" /> Irish loan to which they will have access for a considerable time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to commend this loan and to recommend it warmly to the people who are looking for a very safe investment at a pretty generous rate of interest.  I am glad the Minister has been able to announce on this occasion, even before the issue of the loan, that the insurance companies have agreed to take up a substantial portion of the loan.  I hope that indicates that the non-Irish companies recognise an understandable obligation to invest in Irish loans a substantial portion of the premium incomes they collect in this country. This is a commendable development. The companies are to be praised for doing it.  I hope the only problem for the future in this respect will be that they will decide to invest an increasing sum of money in the sound securities which are issued by Irish Governments, not for warlike purposes but for sound, constructive schemes of national development.</P>
      <P>In the days of our political infancy in this House, it was fashionable at the time for some Deputies to say that a loan issued by a particular Government was that Government's loan. Others took malicious delight in saying that this was the Government's loan and in trying to detract from the success of it.  With the effluxion of time and the coming of political maturity, that mentality has evaporated.</P>

      <P>We now recognise that a loan is a loan issued by the Government by and on behalf of the Irish people.  Here in this House we are all expected to defend it, and rightly so, because such loans are used for the benefit of the Irish people.  We have learned through time that there is no suitable alternative to using our own money, our own savings and the savings of our people, for schemes of national development.  Every other country in the world which has reached political maturity has had to develop its resources by relying on the savings <Col N="1172" /> of its people.  There is no short cut to that and the printing presses have never proved an effective answer to the problem of providing money for national development.</P>
      <P>These schemes are vital for the development of the nation and they are necessary in order to provide opportunities of employment for our people and at the same time, to provide social standards and conditions of living that will induce our people to remain in their own country and give it the benefit of their brains and energy in order that we may be able to keep abreast with the nations of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to amend the law relating to companies, which is at present laid down in the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1959.  In 1958 the report of a Committee (now known as the Company Law Reform Committee) which had been appointed by the Attorney General to examine the need for changes in our system of company law, was published, and copies were circulated to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As an interim measure, a limited number of the more important changes recommended by the Committee were dealt with in a special Bill which is now on the Statute Book as the Companies Act, 1959.  At that time I explained that the preparation of a second Bill to carry through the remaining changes in the law which were deemed to be necessary would be a very complex and formidable task and that some time would be needed to prepare a comprehensive and carefully thought out measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event, the preparation of this second Bill has taken rather longer <Col N="1173" /> than I expected, but this was due to a large extent to circumstances beyond my control.  The principal problem was that while the preparation of the Bill was in progress, two further investigations into company law were commenced, one in the Six Counties and the other in Britain.  We cannot, in framing our legislation, ignore any changes which may be contemplated in the Six Counties or Britain, with each of which we have such close commercial ties.  In this connection I would refer to the recommendation of the Company Law Reform committee that company legislation in this country should not depart too far in its general principles from that in operation in Britain and the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The Committee drew attention to the fact that company law as it exists in Britain is familiar to business and commercial circles in the United States and in the countries of Continental Europe.  They also referred to the fact that the encouragement of outside investors is part of our public policy, and they thought that a system of company law corresponding broadly with that in force in other countries would be a material inducement to investment here.  These points have been borne in mind in drawing up the provisions which are contained in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of alignment with the law in neighbouring countries, a peculiar difficulty has now arisen.  The Six Counties legislation was enacted as recently as 1960, and it will differ substantially from British law if the recommendations of a recent Committee of Enquiry which reported in Britain are accepted, as they seem likely to be.  It is, of course, not possible to bring our law into line with two enactments differing considerably from each other.  I am, however, quite satisfied that subject to a number of amendments which I propose to introduce at the Committee Stage, the provisions contained in the Bill now before the House will deal adequately with the circumstances of our own particular case and that, if enacted. they will bring about a very considerable <Col N="1174" /> improvement in this particular branch of the law.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should wait until British company law has been amended following the recommendations of the recent Committee which reported there, but I am quite convinced that no useful purpose would be served in so doing.  Our company law is seriously out of date and successive Ministers have over the last 30 years been endeavouring to secure the opportunity of putting it right; now that we have gone this far and have prepared a Bill which I regard as perfectly suitable for Irish conditions there should be no going back, and I hope that Deputies will agree with this view.</P>
    <P>This is, I believe, the biggest piece of legislation which has been put before the Oireachtas since the establishment of the State.  With its 400 sections and 13 schedules it is so all-embracing that it is rather difficult to give a satisfactory summary of its contents.  An explanatory Memorandum giving some brief information about the principal changes which are now being made has been circulated to Deputies, and I hope that they will find it useful in considering the measure; if any further information of a more detailed nature is required I will be glad to provide it during the Committee Stage.  In what follows I propose to mention only the major provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>First of all, I would like to refer to the provisions relating to accounts, which are set out in Sections 147-159 of the Bill.  The existing requirements in regard to accounts are scanty in the extreme, and there has for a long time been a demand that more comprehensive information should be statutorily required.  The better-run companies have, of course, even in the absence of statutory requirements, made a practice of preparing informative accounts which are useful both to their own shareholders and to persons having business dealings with them.  There have, unfortunately, also been a number of &ldquo;black sheep&rdquo;, who have persisted in the preparation of accounts designed more to conceal the true position rather than to provide an accurate indication of the state of their finances. <Col N="1175" /> It is now proposed to place a specific obligation on every company to keep proper books of account and to prepare each year a profit and loss account and balance sheet which, apart from giving a true and fair view, must also comply with the detailed requirements of the Sixth Schedule.</P>
    <P>In the case of holding companies, there will in future be an obligation to prepare group accounts, the effect of which will be to give a concise picture of the financial position of the holding company and its subsidiaries considered as a single undertaking.  As recommended by the Company Law Reform Committee, however, it is considered unnecessary to apply the latter provision to private companies, but as Deputies will see from Section 154, the interests of shareholders in private holding companies are being adequately safeguarded in another manner.  Any directors who do not adequately attend to their duties in regard to the keeping of books of account and the preparation of the profit and loss account and balance sheet, will render themselves liable to the very severe penalties set out in Sections 147 and 148 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The directors of every company will be required not merely to lay the detailed accounts before each annual general meeting, but also, in compliance with Section 159, to send them to shareholders and debenture-holders three weeks beforehand.  In order to ensure that the interests of creditors and other persons are safeguarded, Section 128 imposes on every public company the obligation to file these accounts with the annual return which is sent to the registrar of companies each year and which is available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>The obligation to file accounts for public inspection will not, however, apply to private companies.  This does no more than continue a privilege which private companies have enjoyed for very many years, and is in conformity with the recommendations of the Company Law Reform Committee. I do not think it necessary to set out in detail here the various arguments for and against the continuation of <Col N="1176" /> this privilege, and I think I can do no better than to refer Deputies to paragraphs 110 to 120 inclusive of the report of the Company Law Reform Committee, which I think deals adequately with the point.  Deputies are probably aware that this privilege was partially withdrawn in Britain in 1948 and that its total withdrawal has now been recommended; the situation in the Six Counties is, of course, the same as that which obtains here.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that conditions as regards company organisation in Britain differ considerably from those prevailing here in Ireland, and the arguments which might be put forward for the publication of the accounts of private companies in Britain would not necessarily apply here.  The vast majority of private companies established here are family concerns essentially of a private nature in which outside interests play little or no part and this, I think, is the principal reason why we should not impose on them the altogether new requirement that they should file their accounts.</P>
    <P>Since I am on the subject of accounts, I think it no harm to refer to the fact that the report recently published in Britain recommended a considerable number of changes in the British provisions relating to the form and content of the profit and loss account and balance sheet. Generally speaking, the effect of these recommendations, if adopted, will be to require disclosure of certain matters in rather greater detail.  I think there is probably a good deal to be said for many of the recommendations which have been put forward, at least in relation to the larger type of company.</P>
    <P>It would, however, be impossible to say at this stage whether all these recommendations will be accepted, and, if so, in precisely what form effect will be given to them.  I think it would be most unwise to impose on our companies more onerous obligations in regard to disclosure of their financial affairs than those which prevail in neighbouring countries, since this would place them at a competitive <Col N="1177" /> disadvantage.  It was, however, always my intention that the accounting provisions of the new Act should be drafted in such a way that improvements might be introduced by a simple procedure from time to time.  To this end, Section 396 enables me to make Orders altering the provisions of the Act in relation to accounts, and in particular the provisions of the Sixth Schedule.  If at any time in the future it is considered desirable, after consultation with the professional bodies concerned, to make any changes in this respect, there should be no difficulty in taking the appropriate action.</P>
    <P>In so far as insurance companies are concerned, the position after the enactment of this legislation will, I think, be regarded by them as rather unsatisfactory, inasmuch as their statutory accounting obligations will be dealt with by two seperate, though related, branches of the law&mdash;the Insurance Acts and the Companies Acts.  I do not think there is anything we can do just at the moment to rectify this difficulty as it is very desirable that, in so far as accounts are concerned, they should receive treatment similar to that of their British competitors, and I have little doubt that the companies agree with this view.  It is my intention, however, to give some further thought to this matter and it may be possible before very long to bring all the accounting requirements relating to such companies together either in the Insurance Acts or in the Companies Acts.  There are ample powers to make the necessary Orders under both sets of legislation.</P>
    <P>Some important changes are also being made in regard to the winding up of companies.  Deputies are probably aware that the law in relation to voluntary winding up in particular, has been most unsatisfactory for many years, especially in the case of insolvent companies.  There have been quite a number of cases in which due regard was not had to the legitimate interests of the creditors of such companies and the winding up was conducted as if it were the concern only of the shareholders. As the law stands at present, the members of a company which is <Col N="1178" /> being wound up voluntarily have control over the liquidation; this may be logical enough in the case of a company which is in a position to meet all its financial obligations but it is quite inequitable in cases where some creditors are likely to be left unpaid.</P>
    <P>In order to implement some recommendations on this point by the Company Law Reform Committee, it is proposed, therefore, to provide that, in future, voluntary winding up will be divided into two classes, namely, members' voluntary winding up and creditors' voluntary winding up.  If the directors of a company wish to have the liquidation carried out as a members' voluntary winding up, they must prepare a declaration that the company will be able to meet its debts in full within a period not exceeding one year.  There are a number of safeguards to ensure that the procedure involving the making of this declaration is not abused.  Where directors are not in a position to make this declaration, i.e. where the company is insolvent, then the liquidation must proceed as a creditors' voluntary winding up, and in that event substantial control of the proceedings passes to the creditors whose interests are to a large extent given precedence over those of the members of the company.  I think Deputies will agree that the new arrangements which are proposed in Sections 257 to 273 are both fair and sensible.</P>
    <P>Section 285 of the Bill is designed to effect some changes in the law relating to the payment of debts in a winding up, and I feel sure that the commercial community in general and small traders in particular will regard certain provisions of this Section as being most welcome.  The position in regard to the priority afforded to State debts is explained in the Memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill, and may be summarised by saying that, after claims secured by fixed charges have been met, State debts have first call on the assets of a company which is being wound up. There are no consequences of any practical importance arising out of this preference in cases where the company concerned is in a position to meet all <Col N="1179" /> its commitments, but it operates most harshly where the company is insolvent. In that case, the entire assets of the company may have to be set aside to meet the claims of the State and there may be nothing left to pay the debts of unsecured creditors.</P>
    <P>Both the Bankruptcy Committee which reported in 1930 and the more recent Company Law Reform Committee were in favour of a diminution of preference in respect of State debts, on the grounds that it is most inequitable to give priority to the State, which can carry on without difficulty if its claims are not met, over a small trader who may be placed in a very serious predicament by failure to secure payment for his debts.  Section 285 provides, therefore, for the abolition of all preferences enjoyed by the State, except in relation to twelve months' assessment of taxes.  The Company Law Reform Committee (but not the Bankruptcy Committee) were in favour of the abolition of the twelve months' tax preference also, but I think there is something to be said for retaining this.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the explanatory Memorandum, Section 285 also introduces a number of important changes to protect the interests of employees in a winding up.  Insofar as arrears of pay are concerned all clerks, servants and workmen will in future be entitled to preference in respect of services for the period of four months preceding the winding up, while the existing ceilings of £50 for clerks and servants and £25 for workmen are being raised to £200 all round.  These employees will also be entitled to preference for all accrued holiday pay. The existing provisions relating to preference for workmen's compensation payments are also being amended to strengthen the position of any injured workers to whom the company may have obligations.  There is also an entirely new provision giving preference to amounts due from a company in respect of its liability to employees for accidents, other than liability under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, it is in the <Col N="1180" /> course of winding up a company that most offences by fraudulent directors and promoters come to light.  The existing provisions for the prosecution and punishment of such persons are unsatisfactory and this situation is now being rectified.  Section 293 of the Bill contains a long list of actions which will in future be regarded as misdemeanours and sets out substantial penalties by way of fine and imprisonment.  This section in effect applies the same provisions to the winding up of companies as are applied by the Debtors Act (Ireland), 1872, to the bankruptcy of individuals. Section 245 incorporates a number of improvements which will render more effective the powers of the Court to examine suspect persons.</P>
    <P>Further new provisions to deal with offences coming to light during winding up are set out in Sections 295, 296, 297 and 299; the object of all these provisions is to ensure that wherever possible, persons who have acted dishonestly will not go unpunished. These provisions should not cause any difficulty for upright directors and promoters, but I hope that they will be an effective deterrent to fraudulent activities by unscrupulous persons.  In order to provide further safeguards for both the shareholders and creditors of companies changes are also being introduced in Sections 286, 288, and 289, to deal with fraudulent preferences.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are probably aware, about 95 per cent. of the companies registered in this country are private. Because of the nature of their constitution, and the way in which their internal affairs are regulated, it is sometimes possible for the majority of the shareholders in such companies to act unfairly towards the minority. The Company Law Reform Committee referred to practices of this kind in paragraphs 123 and 124 of their Report, and as the existing remedies are not effective, they recommended the enactment of special provisions designed to protect minorities from ill-treatment of this kind.  Rather elaborate provisions to this end are set out in Section 205 of the Bill.  It will be noted that no attempt was made to specify the type of activity which <Col N="1181" /> is to be regarded as unfair or oppressive; I consider it preferable that the Courts should be allowed to exercise the widest discretion in this matter both as regards the determination of what falls within the Section and as regards the prescription of remedies.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions also in the Bill designed to protect minority shareholders.  Section 166 enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce to appoint an inspector to carry out an investigation into the affairs of a company if he is satisfied that any of the shareholders are being oppressed, and Section 170 empowers him to petition the Court either for a winding up order or an oppression order if the report of the inspector indicates that the suspicions were well founded.  In Section 213 it is provided that a company may be wound up compulsorily if the Court is satisfied that there is oppression.  I should like to mention in this connection that a petition for winding up on this ground, and also a petition for an order under Section 205, may be submitted not only by members of a company but also by personal representatives, trustees, or persons who are beneficially interested in shares by virtue of a will or intestacy.  The reason why special provision is made for such persons is that most cases of oppression arise where a shareholder dies and the directors are not prepared to act fairly and equitably towards those persons who become entitled to the shares.  A further provision of the Bill which is of interest in this connection is Section 78, the purpose of which is to protect shareholders against any unfair variation in their rights.  Under this section also the court is given the widest powers to deal with whatever situation may be presented to it.  Any variation of rights which the court feels is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of any shareholders may be set aside by it.</P>
    <P>Prospectuses inviting members of the public to subscribe for securities are not commonly issued in this country, for the reason that only public companies, of which there are comparatively few registered here, may finance their activities in this way. <Col N="1182" /> It has been considered desirable, nevertheless, to review the law relating to prospectuses and similar documents, and a number of changes, having as their object the protection of the public, have been provided for in Sections 43 to 58 inclusive.  In drawing up these provisions I have had to ensure, first of all, that adequate protection for prospective investors was provided, but care was also taken not to impose any unreasonable burdens on companies which might hamper them in their lawful activity of seeking finance from the public.  It would be possible to introduce all sorts of onerous requirements in connection with the contents of prospectuses, but I feel sure that in this Bill we have gone far enough.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, there are at present no provisions in the Companies Acts insofar as prospectuses of foreign companies are concerned.  This omission is now being rectified by Part XII of the Bill which deals with the prospectuses of such companies whether or not they have established places of business in this State.  The requirements in relation to such prospectuses are much the same as those which are applicable to the prospectuses of Irish companies.</P>
    <P>Every company is owned by its shareholders and the directors merely act as stewards of the business on their behalf.  It has, therefore, been the practice for very many years to include in the Companies Acts various provisions designed to facilitate the coming together of the general body of proprietors for the purpose of reviewing the company's affairs.  Insofar as the present Bill is concerned the relevant provisions are set out in Sections 131 to 146 inclusive, and these represent a considerable elaboration and improvement on the existing law.</P>
    <P>One of the principal changes which is being made is in regard to the length of notice which must be given for calling meetings, which is dealt with by Section 133.  The object of the new requirements is to ensure that any member who might wish to attend a meeting or to appoint a proxy will have reasonable notice thereof and <Col N="1183" /> will, therefore, be in a better position to make the necessary arrangements. Important changes are also being made in Section 136, in regard to the appointment of proxies and, generally, that section implements the recommendations of the Company Law Reform Committee.  If a member cannot attend personally at a meeting it is only right that he should have the power to appoint another person to represent him and to speak and vote on his behalf.  Section 136 contains suitable provisions to this end.  A further change which is being made is that the existing provisions in relation to extraordinary resolutions are being discontinued.  In future there will be only two types of resolution, viz. ordinary and special.  Section 141 provides that any references to extraordinary resolutions contained in existing Acts and other documents shall be deemed to be references to special resolutions.</P>
    <P>Further changes designed to protect shareholders and other persons have been made in Sections 165 to 173 which relate to the appointment of inspectors to investigate the affairs of companies.  I have already made a reference to some of these changes in my earlier remarks about the protection of minorities.  However, I should like to emphasise that my policy in regard to the utilisation of these powers of inspection will remain much the same as it has always been with successive Ministers of my Department.  The appointment of an inspector to investigate the affairs of a company is of its very nature something which cannot be kept secret and as soon as it becomes public knowledge some damage is inevitably done to the commercial reputation of the company in question, even if it is subsequently found that there was nothing amiss.  In the past it has always been the practice in considering applications for the appointment of Inspectors to bear this point particularly in mind, and, so far as I myself am concerned at any rate, there will be no change in this respect in the future.</P>
    <P>In the Companies Act, 1959, provisions <Col N="1184" /> were for the first time introduced in our law to enable companies to issue redeemable preference shares. During the passing of that measure through the Oireachtas, the suggestion was put forward that companies should also be given the right to attach redeemable rights to shares which had been issued as irredeemable preference shares, subject, of course, to the appropriate consent of the members of the company and of the shareholders of the class concerned.  I undertook to give some thought to this idea, and if it were found practicable to devise a workable formula, to introduce a suitable provision in the Bill which is now before the House.  This matter has been given the most careful consideration, and I think that Section 65 of the Bill can be regarded as meeting all reasonable requirements in this respect.</P>
    <P>It would be rather dangerous to provide unduly wide powers to convert shares in this manner to all companies, and it is for that reason that the section is hedged about by a number of safeguards designed to prevent abuses. In the first place, it will be noted that the section is confined to public companies. The possibilities of abuse are, I am afraid, too great to permit of the extension of the concession to private companies, where it could be manipulated fairly easily by unscrupulous persons to their own profit with little or no danger of public comment. Secondly, the section applies only to preference shares which were issued before the 5th May, 1959; the reason for this is that as from the date in question it was permissible under the Companies Act, for any company limited by shares to issue redeemable preference shares, and there could, therefore, be little justification for allowing them to convert preference shares issued after that date in irredeemable form.  Thirdly, it is provided that nothing in Section 65 will oblige any shareholder to accept redemption of his shares.  It may well be, of course, that the terms on which a shareholder accepted his shares oblige him to be bound by the decision of a certain majority of his fellow shareholders and any provisions of that <Col N="1185" /> kind will continue to operate.  I understand that there may well be cases where the redemption of preference shares under the provisions of this section would be a happy release for the shareholders concerned provided the transaction can be arranged on acceptable terms, and for that reason I feel sure that its enactment will be generally welcome.</P>
    <P>The interests of shareholders may be adversely affected by unreasonable or reckless actions on the part of a company's officers in connection with the transfer of shares.  A number of provisions are being introduced in Part III to provide additional protection for shareholders in this field. Examples of such provisions are Section 84 which obliges a company to give notice of refusal to register a transfer within two months after lodgment, and Section 85 which imposes certain obligations on a company in connection with the certification of transfers.  I might also refer to Section 86 which requires a company to complete and have ready for delivery the certificates of securities within two months after lodgment of the transfer documents; under the existing law the period of two months runs from the date of registration of the transfer, which might not, of course, be effected for a considerable time after lodgment.</P>
    <P>On this subject of the registration of shares I would like also to refer to Section 80 which discharges companies in certain circumstances, form the obligation to number shares.  I feel sure that this concession, which was recommended by the Company Law Reform Committee, will be very welcome to the commercial community.  A general dispensation as regards numbering cannot, however, be given as the interests of shareholders demand that shares should be readily distinguishable from one another in cases where they are not fully paid up or do not rank <i>pari passu</i> for all purposes.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of new provisions are being introduced in the Bill in connection with directors.  There is, at present, no obligation on any company to have directors and this is now being <Col N="1186" /> rectified by Section 174, which requires that every company must have at least two.  As every company must have not less than two members, this requirement should not cause any problem; it is desirable in any event that a specific obligation of this kind should be imposed since the directors of a company are charged with numerous responsibilities under the Bill.  For that reason also it is desirable that the directors of a company should be physical persons, and Section 176 provides therefore that a body corporate may not in future be a director; companies which at present have bodies corporate acting in the capacity of directors are being given a period of three months to replace them by physical persons.</P>
    <P>A number of provisions are also included in the Bill with the object of bringing the activities of directors more closely under the control of the shareholders; for example, Section 181 requires that the appointment of directors must be voted on individually, while Section 182 will make it easier in future for shareholders to dispense with the services of any director with whom they are not satisfied before the expiry of his period of office.</P>
    <P>Sections 186, 187 and 188 contain provisions requiring shareholders' consent for payments to directors for loss of office in connection with the take-over of the shares or business of a company.  There is also in Section 185 a prohibition on tax-free payments to directors, while Sections 191 and 192 require that particulars of directors' salaries, loans and other payments, must be shown in the annual accounts.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of comment in recent years about the rights and duties of directors in relation to their companies and it has been suggested that these rights and duties might be set out in some detail in the Companies Acts.  I have come to the conclusion that it would be extremely difficult to draw up any general provisions of this kind which would be suitable for application to all companies and I think that sufficient guidance in these matters is provided by case law rather than by statutory enactment.  I think it is <Col N="1187" /> desirable, however, to enact provisions designed to bring to the light of day dealings by directors in the shares of their companies, and also their interests in contracts which their companies enter into with other parties; suitable provisions to this end are included in Sections 190 and 194.</P>
    <P>Since a director is, as a general rule, appointed by the shareholders, it is desirable that the assignment by him of his office to another person should be subject to control, and Section 191 deals with this matter.  Section 200 is designed to ensure that directors and other officers of a company will be answerable to shareholders for neglect of their duties and cannot disclaim responsibility by virtue of unreasonable escape clauses contained in articles of association or other documents.</P>
    <P>Two further provisions of interest under the heading of directors are Sections 183 and 184; the former contains a prohibition on undischarged bankrupts acting as directors, while the latter enables the Court to restrain persons convicted of certain offences from acting as directors.</P>
    <P>In the Companies Act, 1959, a provision was introduced with the object of facilitating mergers which had the approval of the vast majority of the shareholders concerned and which might fall through because of the intransigence of a small minority. Although I have had no complaints about the manner in which this section has worked in practice, it has been found on re-examination that it could, perhaps, be drafted in more precise terms.  The more elaborate provisions are now contained in Section 204 of this Bill and I feel sure that this will meet all reasonable requirements, providing as it does suitable facilities for the acquisition of the shares of dissentients and at the same time giving those persons adequate protection against abuses.</P>
    <P>In Part VII of the Bill a number of new provisions are being introduced in connection with receivers.  The object of these is to protect the members of the company in respect of which a receiver is appointed, and to safeguard the interests of its creditors <Col N="1188" /> and other persons doing business with it.  A number of clauses to assist receivers in dealing with certain difficulties which may arise for them are also included.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill continues, in improved form, the provisions of the existing law relating to the registration of charges.  The object of these requirements is to ensure that persons doing business with a company will have a readily available means of ascertaining how far its assets have been charged as security for debts. Apart from the additional obligations now being imposed on Irish companies in this respect, foreign companies having places of business here are now, for the first time, being bound by these requirements as to registration of charges.</P>
    <P>Now that we are imposing rather comprehensive obligations on companies in the matter of accounts, it is important to ensure that the law in regard to auditing is satisfactory.  It would, I think, be quite illogical to enact all these detailed requirements about the contents of accounts and at the same time to allow any person, no matter how much or how little he knows about accountancy, to act as auditor.  In Section 162 of the Bill it is proposed, therefore, to provide that, subject to certain exceptions, only persons having recognised professional qualifications can audit the accounts of companies.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of the Bill to which I would like to make some reference are Section 8&mdash;modification of <i>ultra vires</i> rule&mdash;Section 10&mdash;altering the objects of a company&mdash;Section 22&mdash; trading under names other than corporate names&mdash;Section 37&mdash;pre-incorporation contracts&mdash;Section 62&mdash;share premiums&mdash;and Section 63&mdash;issue of shares at a discount.  It is not necessary for me to go into any detail about these matters but I would draw the attention of Deputies to the relevant notes in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that some Deputies will have views to offer on the question of requiring disclosure of beneficial ownership of shares.  A requirement of this kind, but of rather limited application, <Col N="1189" /> was recommended by the recent Committee of Inquiry in Britain.  In so far as we are concerned, however, I am satisfied that no provisions of this nature are required.  The Company Law Reform Committee examined this matter in some detail in paragraphs 103 to 108 of their report and came to the conclusion that such provisions, however carefully drafted, would be easy to evade.  They pointed out in any event that in the great majority of cases in this country shares are registered in the names of nominees for legitimate commercial reasons.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see from page 6 of the explanatory memorandum, it is not proposed to accept the recommendation of the Company Law Reform Committee that the issue of shares of no par value should be permitted in this country.  There does not seem to be any general demand for the legalisation of such shares, and as far as I can see the question has been given more importance than it deserves.  I have noticed that the most recent Committee of Enquiry in Britain has recommended that provisions should be enacted permitting the issue of shares of no par value in that country.</P>
    <P>I see no reason, however, to follow suit here as there is no evidence that those concerned with the administration of company affairs would wish to see a change of this kind effected, nor is there any reason to believe that any difficulties which may arise for investors in connection with the present system of nominal value shares would thereby be eliminated.  I should like to make it clear, however, that if at any stage it becomes clear that it would be desirable to amend the law in this respect, I would be prepared to seek the Government's approval for the introduction of the necessary legislation. Amendments to legislation other than the Companies Acts would, probably, also be required.</P>
    <P>Deputies may also wish to know why we have no legislative provisions dealing with unit trusts.  Some years ago an inter-departmental working party looked into this question of unit trusts and found that there was no need for legislation to control the <Col N="1190" /> activities of promoters of this investment medium.  In fact, no Irish unit trust has, to my knowledge, been established and so far as foreign trusts are concerned.  I have had no complaints about their rather limited operations here.  It may also be asked why we have no legislation specifically dealing with &ldquo;share-pushing&rdquo; such as that which has been passed in neighbouring countries.  The fact is that we have had very little trouble from share pushers in this country and controlling legislation is not called for.  It is probable that a recent case in which very large amounts of money were involved will spring to the minds of Deputies, but I should like to point out that branches of the law other than the Companies Acts were primarily concerned in that case.</P>
    <P>There would, of course, be little point in imposing obligations on companies and their officers unless suitable provision were made for the prosecution of offenders.  A good deal of attention has been given to this matter and a number of new provisions designed to facilitate prosecutions are included in Part XV.  I should like to refer in particular to Section 385 which will remove certain difficulties which have arisen in the past in connection with summary proceedings; it is not always possible to bring proceedings within six months after the commission of an offence as the law at present requires and for that reason a period of three years is now being provided for.  Section 386 provides for a minimum fine for second or subsequent offences, and its principal purpose is to deal with persons who have been in persistent default of their obligations under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>I think it is undesirable that persons who are guilty of offences under this branch of the law should have the protection of the Probation of Offenders Act, and accordingly, Section 387 excludes such offences from the scope of that Act.  There is also a very useful provision in Section 384 which will make it easier for the police to procure evidence of offences from the books of a company where suspicions have been aroused.  Section 382 is also <Col N="1191" /> of some interest; the existing law does not contain any suitable provision for the prosecution of companies on indictment and this omission is now being rectified.</P>
    <P>Apart from these special provisions under the heading of &ldquo;Offences&rdquo;, I should like to point out that particular attention was paid to the insertion of suitable penalty clauses in the appropriate sections throughout this Bill. Entirely new penalties were provided for where none existed up to this, while in other cases the penalties by way of fine or imprisonment set out in the existing Acts were substantially increased wherever the nature of the offence seemed to require it.</P>
    <P>On this question of offences, I should like to advert to the recommendations of the Company Law Reform Committee that the enforcement of the requirements of the Companies Acts should be regarded as a matter of major importance.  As the Committee pointed out, incorporation under the Companies Acts is a privilege, and the terms on which it is granted should be observed.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to make it clear that I accept the Committee's recommendation unreservedly, and that, to the extent which our resources permit, steps will be taken to ensure that the requirements of the law are complied with, and that offenders are punished.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, of course, a consolidation as well as an amending measure and it contains many provisions which simply repeat existing requirements with little or no change.  I think it unnecessary to make any reference to the sections which come within this category but I would like to assure the House that all the provisions of the Bill, both new and old, have been the subject of the most careful consideration. It is more than 50 years since the last major Companies Act became law.  It would probably be too much to expect that anything we enact now will give such long service but I am confident that the present Bill will meet our needs for a considerable time to come and that it is well deserving of the support of the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> I might point out, in conclusion, that as I mentioned earlier, this is probably the biggest Bill ever to be introduced in the Oireachtas and therefore, not simply because of that but because of its very nature, it might be better to refer the Committee Stage to a Special Committee.  I am in the hands of the House in that respect.  If the House agrees, I will move the necessary motion at the appropriate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the suggestion which has just been made, there should be general agreement.  Because of the complex nature of this measure and the fact that physically the Bill is so large and will in Committee absorb a good deal of time, it seems an eminently suitable measure to refer to a Special Committee.</P>
      <P>I should like at the outset to pay tribute to the work of the Company Law Reform Committee which was set up by the inter-Party Government in 1951 and which reported in February, 1958.  This complicated and difficult matter was the subject of lengthy and careful consideration, eventuating in the report presented to the Attorney General.  As a result of that report, this Bill has been prepared. The members of that Committee were so appointed as to represent the interests best qualified and most intimately concerned with the complexities of company law.  The Committee consisted, in the main, of lawyers and accountants and had available evidence from many other bodies and persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to express appreciation to the Minister and his Department for the rather full memorandum which was circulated with the Bill and which indicates the various changes proposed and refers to the recommendations which have been adopted from the Company Law Reform Committee.  It also refers, where appropriate, to where the Bill departs from these recommendations.  This memorandum has been extremely helpful.  It would have been even more so if it had been possible to include in it references to the appropriate sections of the 1908 Act.  Because of the very size of this measure and the <Col N="1193" /> large number of sections in it, it is very difficult to follow in detail in the various sections where alterations and variations are made.  The fact that that is so emphasises the desirability of referring this measure to a Special Committee.  It is a specialist subject and it is essential that the law should be brought up to date and made as clear as possible.</P>
    <P>The Jenkins Report which was published in the summer of this year expressed the view in an early part that this was a field of legislation in which finality was not to be expected and while that is true, nevertheless, in the light of the very big changes that have taken place in this country, and, of course, so far as they are concerned in Britain and elsewhere, the Companies Acts passed many years ago required to be amended.  The report of the Company Law Reform Committee is an exhaustive one and is an indication that law reform is a continuous process.</P>
    <P>While much has been accomplished since the law reform programme was initiated some years ago by the inter-Party Government, and continued by the present Government, the need to press on with reforms is ever present and time and care is required in undertaking that task.  Much of the work can be undertaken only by experts and specialists in a particular sphere. While it is generally accepted that reform should be pressed forward as rapidly as possible, nevertheless, some of the reforms must evolve as a result of experience and not appear to be the result of a hurried effort to make changes merely for the sake of change.</P>
    <P>The Committee which was appointed and which considered this question was appointed on the basis that it would be qualified and informed to give this matter full and careful consideration. The very great economic changes, the industrial progress since the foundation of the State and the growth in the number of private companies from 1,088 companies in 1925 to 7,385 in 1956 indicate the need for a modern Companies Act.</P>
    <P>Company law is a specialised sphere <Col N="1194" /> of legal work not practised to any great extent in this country by most lawyers.  On the other hand, in Britain, which has had a highly industrialised economy for a considerable time, company law is a remunerative and specialised branch in which many are engaged.</P>
    <P>With the increase in industrialisation and the great increase in the number of companies, the legal work here in this branch of the law will likely grow.  The need to bring the law up to date has been evident for a considerable time but, in particular, since the 1948 Companies Act in Britain.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as the Minister said, follows, in the main, the recommendations made by the Company Law Reform Committee.  Because of the very extensive and careful consideration given by that Committee to this problem, I believe that wherever the Bill departs from these recommendations the strongest possible case in so far as any major change is concerned should be made to justify that departure.</P>
    <P>There will undoubtedly be general agreement with and approval for the decisions on which the Committee based their recommendations and the reasons for the general approach to this matter which the report follows. In the main, commercial practice is either the same as or similar to that obtaining in Britain.  At the same time, our system is a good deal less complex and the same complex provisions which are contained in the British Companies Act, 1948, are hardly appropriate or necessary in this country.</P>
    <P>The important guiding headline to be followed here is that the law should be definite, as simple as possible and flexible.  It must provide adequate safeguard and protection for the public, shareholders, employees and others who are concerned.  This aspect of company law is paramount and is of importance not only to the categories mentioned but in order to safeguard the commercial reputation of the country.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, the number of cases <Col N="1195" /> where dishonest trading or practices occur in this country are few but the publicity attendant on these cases can do, and has done, considerable damage. The provision included in the Bill, which gives the High Court power to restrain certain persons from acting as directors or from managing companies, is necessary, if the commercial reputation of companies, traders and the country is to be maintained.  Most of these provisions will be more appropriate for consideration on Committee Stage but certain matters fall to be referred to on the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>One particular aspect of the economy here which is not directly referred to in the Bill, although to some extent I imagine it will come within the ambit of the changes being made, is the position of State Companies, semi-State and statutory bodies. These undertakings have generally operated on somewhat different lines from public or private companies.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, appropriate to consider whether these State companies should adopt, as some of them do, a different system of accounting from that operated in the case of public or private companies.  It is true that these bodies are set up to perform a specific function and to serve the community as a whole.  While most of them present their accounts in a form similar to that hitherto adopted by public and private companies, not all of them present their accounts in a sufficiently detailed manner for a proper understanding of the financial and trading position of the company concerned.</P>
    <P>Under the existing Section 113 of the 1908 Act, the accounts which were presented to accountants and the details furnished to accountants were comparatively meagre.  The changes being made in this Bill are not merely desirable but will generally be welcomed. It is, I believe, important, therefore, that State Companies and semi-State bodies should supply similar information and that the same obligation will therefore, in the future, rest on these companies as will rest on public or private companies, so far as the changes proposed are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> It is recognised that a State company is selected and appointed either in pursuance of a statutory obligation or under the Companies Act, with financial backing from the appropriate Minister or with funds provided by the Industrial Credit Company, or whatever the manner in which these companies have in many cases been formed.  Nevertheless, it is in the interests of the company and of the country that, consistent with the ordinary requirement that no unnecessary trading information would be divulged which would operate to the disadvantage of the company concerned, full and accurate accounts should be presented to the House in order that the House and the country may see accurately its financial and trading position.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in the present Bill, commencing at Section 147, and which are based on the paragraphs and recommendations in the Company Law Reform Committee Report, will generally be welcomed. This report adverted to the fact, in paragraph 170 and subsequent paragraphs, that at present, under existing law, there is no obligation on a company or its directors to keep proper accounts, proper records or proper books of account.  The result is that in many cases the accounts presented do not give an accurate or full picture.</P>
    <P>While this report wisely goes on to state that there are many misconceptions about the function and nature of a balance sheet and indeed about the function and nature of the actual details which should be presented either in the accounts or in the balance sheet, nevertheless, the position as it has existed is such that it has given rise on many occasions to adverse comments by accountants, lawyers and by shareholders and others whose interests were affected.  It is, therefore, a matter on which there will be general agreement with the proposed changes so far as accounts and accountancy are concerned.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of this matter which, I think, probably go a little too far from the point of view of placing onerous responsibilities and duties on companies and their accountants.  In <Col N="1197" /> the main, as the Committee stated, most of the companies in this country are small companies.  Many are family business and a great many are small companies.  In some cases, there is the usual practice of a family having a director in a particular company and when the question of auditing the accounts of that company arises another member of the family comes in and carries out the audit.  Under Section 162 of this Bill as now drafted, that position will no longer operate.</P>
    <P>I think there is no objection in principle to a member of a firm coming in to audit the accounts.  Of course, it would be wrong to have an accountant who is a director of the firm acting as auditor but small companies could be put to considerable expense and trouble if a member of the firm is unable to act as auditor.  I feel that the obligation as set out in Section 162 is onerous and difficult to justify.  In the event of any person acting improperly, he would be liable whether a member of the firm or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that it is not proposed to accept the recommendation contained in the Company Law Reform Committee's report at paragraph 63 dealing with the issue of shares of no par value. I would like to know what the reason is for not accepting that recommendation. The Minister did say that there does not appear to be any general demand for it.  However, I feel that where this Bill departs in any material respect from the recommendations of the Company Law Reform Committee, strong reasons should be advanced for such departure. Admittedly, the Committee did not give many reasons except the one reason that the system has been in operation in Canada and the United States for about 50 years and that in view of the growth of external investments here, we should fall into line with the practice in these countries. The Committee did say in paragraph 65 of its report &ldquo;We consider that a very strong case for the introduction of shares of no par value has been made and we recommend that companies in this State should be permitted to create and issue such shares.&rdquo; However, this is a matter which we <Col N="1198" /> can consider on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One important change being made is that dealing with prospectuses.  The important change is in Part III of the Bill which seeks to safeguard the investing public.  This change is long overdue and should obviate some of the losses incurred by investors in the past because of claims made in prospectuses.  It is a desirable thing to include foreign companies in these changes.  As the Minister said in his introductory speech, it has been desirable to review the law relating to the issue of prospectuses.  It is also desirable that whilst adequate protection should be given to prospective investors, onerous obligations should not be imposed on companies which would hamper them in their normal activities of seeking public subscriptions. The change whereby certificates of experts will require to be furnished and the obligations which are imposed on those furnishing them should obviate a recurrence of any of the things which have happened previously.</P>
    <P>Another change is that dealing with inspections.  I believe in this part of the Bill and I was glad to hear the Minister say that he proposed to continue the policy which has been operated by Ministers for Industry and Commerce since the State was set up, that this power would be used only where it was justified by the information available to him and only in the last resort.  It would also seem right that the Bill should provide for some minimum qualifications for inspectors. As the Bill is framed, no qualifications are laid down and it ought to be possible to provide certain minimum qualifications on appointment, either experience in trade or certain rank in the Civil Service and a certain number of years service.  I feel we should try to frame the section so as to provide for a certain minimum of qualification.</P>
    <P>One of the matters in that connection which could pose a difficulty is the section which, while designed to provide protection for the shareholder, could also create difficulty for those responsible for the management of the company.  Under Section 66, the Minister may appoint an inspector in cases where members of a company <Col N="1199" /> consider they have not been given all the information relating to its affairs which they might reasonably expect. I have heard of a case where a question was asked at a company meeting by a person who was engaged in the same business as the company. The Chairman refused to give the information and that person said he had endeavoured to force the company to do it.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is drafted, Paragraph (b) (3) of Section 156 seems to me unduly wide and might operate to the detriment of the company concerned because in any case of this sort there might well be a divergence of opinion, not merely between the chairman and directors but even between one shareholder and another, as to what information a shareholder could reasonably expect.  I believe that the accounts as they are will now have to be given in such a way as to ensure that a full and fair picture of the finances of the company will be available, that where these accounts give these details, it ought not be left to an individual shareholder, because it can well happen that a crank or a person with a bee in his bonnet about a certain aspect of company administration could raise difficulties to the detriment of the company which he might want to exploit for his own individual reasons.  This section as drafted seems to me so wide that such a person could cause difficulties for a company, with possible resultant damage to the company and the other shareholders.</P>
    <P>The proviso in Section 119 dealing with a list of shareholders also seems unduly onerous, at least so far as big companies are concerned with long registers of shareholders.  While it is desirable that a full opportunity to inspect the register should be provided, the period allowed for the information required seems inadequate and the physical problem of supplying lists of shareholders might be very difficult for certain firms.  There should be some alteration in that section in order to afford, on the one hand, adequate opportunity to those who wish to inspect the lists and, at the same time, <Col N="1200" /> not to impose an unduly burdensome liability on the company or companies concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 65 confines the issue of redeemable preference shares to public companies whose shares are quoted on the stock exchange and continues the provisions here included in the amending Act of 1959.  Consideration should be given to extending this to public companies not quoted on the stock exchange, and indeed to private companies.  There seems to be no great reason why this proviso might not be extended and it is certainly worthy of further consideration.</P>
    <P>A matter which is dealt with in the Bill is the question of transfers, and Section 81 prevents transfers without an instrument of transfer.  While this provision may be necessary, stamp duties on transfers should be reduced to nominal amounts in order to make shares more attractive as a means of investment and to stimulate a greater interest by the general public in stocks, shares and debentures of public and private companies.</P>
    <P>One of the desirable developments in this country, and one which has grown over the years, has been the interest of the small investors, the growth of the number of small investors, investing out of savings in companies and any onerous liability such as heavy stamp duties has a particularly deterring effect on such an investor.  As a method of inducing small investors to put their savings into companies, the rate of stamp duty should be kept to the minimum possible and I believe that any incentive which we can provide for small investors should be so provided.</P>
    <P>The least satisfactory feature of the company law reform is that dealing with winding up.  This, I think, is due to a considerable extent to the fact that although the matter was given prolonged consideration by the Committee, the Committee found it impossible to reach unanimity on this point and have, in paragraphs 197(a) to 197(c) of the report, given the views of certain members, and in paragraphs 198(a) to 198(c) supplied the views of the other members of the Committee who took a different attitude.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> The law at present on this matter is unsatisfactory and the connection between winding up and bankruptcy law is so close that both must to an extent be considered together.  The changes which are proposed in Sections 257 to 273 appear to be an improvement on the law as it has existed up to the present.  The urgent need for reform in bankruptcy law has been recognised.  Indeed, as long ago as March, 1927, the Minister for Industry and Commerce appointed a Committee which reported in 1930 on the winding up of companies and societies, and recently a new committee has been appointed.  I hope the Committee which is considering this matter will report as quickly as possible because of the close connection between the two matters, and the Committee which reported on the company law adverted to the fact that they were not asked to report on bankruptcy law, that it was outside their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the close connection between winding-up procedure and bankruptcy law makes it obvious to some extent that the changes made should be made in the light of the experience in both spheres of legal activity.  Although the Company Law Reform Committee did not reach agreement on the changes which should be made, it does seem that the changes contained in the Bill are an improvement on the position as it has existed up to the present.  I believe there will be general approval for the penalties provided for in Section 293 for breaches of the law by directors or others and for the changes which are made in respect of persons found guilty of misdemeanours. I was indeed somewhat surprised that offences of this sort would be so lightly described as misdemeanours, but I take it that it is the appropriate description.</P>
    <P>A most welcome change is that contained in Section 285.  I believe it is one that will be welcomed generally, based as it is on the recommendations made by this Committee.  It is the proviso dealing with the State's priority in the matter of debts.  This has been the subject of comment on many occasions. It is a relic of a situation which existed in the past, giving the State a prior <Col N="1202" /> right.  As far as this country is concerned, it is a relic from the Crown precedence which was granted in the time of British occupation.  The change is not only overdue but equitable and I feel that the Minister might even consider going as far as some people had thought he would, that is, to wipe out even the year which is being allowed under the present changes.</P>
    <P>The last matter I wish to refer to is the question of take-over procedure. Some opinions have been expressed that there should be included in this Bill provisions dealing with, even in general terms, the question of take-over procedure.  This is undoubtedly a matter which has attracted far more attention and interest in Britain, and probably elsewhere, than it has here. It was adverted to by the Jenkins Committee in the report published last June.  Even here, we had over the past few years occasion to notice some of the circumstances in which that take-over procedure was adopted.  This is undoubtedly a question in which there may be conflicting interests but, nevertheless, it is a matter which should receive some consideration.  It may be possible to frame, between now and consideration of the Bill in Committee, appropriate requirements governing any action taken by those interested in take-over bids to acquire the shares or portion of the shares of a company.</P>
    <P>At any rate, in view of the development of industrialisation, the advent of the European Economic Community and our likely adherence to that body, the prospect of take-over procedure being invoked in the future is much more likely than it was previously. We ought, if it is possible to do so, profit by the experience elsewhere and so frame legislation as to avoid the dangers inherent in that procedure when applied in certain circumstances. I believe it would be helpful if the Minister could, in advance of the meeting of the Select Committee, circulate his amendments so that we could consider them.  That will also enable other bodies who are interested, chambers of commerce, individual traders or companies and bodies such as the Bar Council, the Incorporated Law Society, the Association of <Col N="1203" /> Chartered Accountants or other bodies to offer their views in order to have them considered and, if agreed, incorporated on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to advert, that is, the qualification of accountants.  I think there will be general agreement that, in the main, properly qualified chartered or professional accountants, members of an association of certified and corporate accountants, are the appropriate people to audit and present accounts for companies. Nevertheless, as the Bill stands, it recognises the position of non-qualified accountants who are practising up to a certain date.</P>
    <P>It goes further and gives the Minister the right to decide who is or who is not qualified.  I feel that in a matter of this sort, it is an invidious obligation and open to objection to give the Minister, or any Minister, the final say on the qualifications or otherwise of a person.  Indeed, one of the duties which fell, and falls, to the Minister in the Department of Industry and Commerce is to supply or approve of a list of public auditors.  It always seemed to me in the past that it was a difficult and invidious task, because in some cases the names of persons with full professional qualifications were not inscribed on that list and others who had no professional qualifications were put in.  They probably had a prior application in and were included in it.</P>
    <P>I believe these are matter which undoubtedly are best left to the bodies concerned.  While there will be general approval of any measure to safeguard professional standards, it appears to me that in so far as legislation dealing with accountancy is concerned, it should be in a separate measure and not introduced as a sidewind into a measure of this sort.  These are matters which we can consider more fully on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Subject to that, I believe this measure is an improvement on the Act which has been so long on the Statute Book.  The members of the Committee who gave consideration, time and effort to the preparation of <Col N="1204" /> the report deserve not merely the best thanks of those of us who are charged here with the responsibility of endeavouring to enact the best measure possible, but also the thanks and gratitude of the community for the work, effort, knowledge and experience they devoted to their task in the interests of the commercial reputation of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, as the Minister indicated, a very technical and a very complex Bill.  It lends itself to discussion more on Committee Stage than on Second Reading.  For that reason, therefore, I propose to reserve any comments that I should like to make on the details of the Bill until such time as the Committee Stage is reached.</P>
      <P>There are certain observations one is entitled to make at this stage.  It is 55 years since the previous Act dealing with company law was introduced. That Act has held the stage over a long period, a period which has seen many changes not merely in the company law of our neighbouring countries but in the whole industrial structure of the world.  I have here some statistics which indicate that in 1925 there were fewer than 1,500 companies, that is, public and private.  By 1957, the number had grown to over 8,000, so that during that period of 32 years, the number of companies registered in the country had increased over seven-fold.  That accounts for only 32 of the 55 years which have passed since the existing Act was introduced. I have no doubt that the numbers since 1957 have also increased considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is not to be wondered at that we need a Bill to-day which will take note of the far-reaching social and economic changes that have taken place since the first decade of this century&mdash;the radical change in the public attitude towards the ownership and control of industrial and commercial concerns; the application of a policy of tariff protection; the growth of monopoly; the divorce between ownership and control, which indicate that not only is a searching review of company law desirable but that reforms must be introduced which <Col N="1205" /> will have the effect of protecting the public in a much more positive way than they are protected under the existing company law which was introduced in the days of free enterprise and which gave the <i>entrepreneur</i> of the day as much freedom as he could wish for himself, while at the same time not providing the adequate protection which the modern state finds necessary in order to protect the shareholders and those with whom the companies trade.</P>
    <P>In any scheme of company law here, I think it is very obvious we must be careful, while maintaining our own independence and safeguarding what is best in our own interests, to have regard to the legislative proposals which govern British company law and Six Counties company law because commercial relations between these three areas are so interwoven that it is a national advantage to us, as it is to the other two areas, that all three trading areas should know the conditions on which companies operate, should know as trading units the protection they have under the company law of the other country and should be familiar with the methods which can be used, should it ever be necessary to seek the protection of the courts for the purpose of satisfying legitimate demands.</P>
    <P>In our approach to this amending Bill, therefore, our concern ought to be to mould it as nearly as we can to the comparable law which obtains in countries with which we do most trading, while, at the same time, maintaining and safeguarding our own fundamental rights.  It seems from examination of this Bill and the British Act that the British Act has been taken as the basis here and there is a good deal of what we might call convoying between the two countries in our approach to the problem of companies. As a further consideration, now that the European Economic Community has appeared on the horizon and if, as anticipated, we become members of E.E.C. and if, as we hope, we will be engaged in close and significant trade relations with them, a knowledge of company law will be useful, particularly to companies here that trade <Col N="1206" /> with continental firms as, likewise, knowledge of our law will be useful to them.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether there is any committee of the Council of Europe or of the Common Market countries sitting on the question of an attempt at providing for the Europeanisation of company law.  I know the matter was discussed once at Strasbourg by the Council of Europe.  Whether it has proceeded to a more positive stage of evolution, I cannot say but there is much to be gained by our association with any type of European committee which seeks to give an international code of company law which can be understood so that language means the same in one country as in the other and those who engage in trade will know what their rights are.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this is an amending and consolidating Bill and that we are not likely to tackle a Bill of this kind for many years again until this House is much older. Therefore, I think we ought to endeavour to inject into the Bill the most modern and most reasonable thoughts in respect of company law that we can formulate.  For that reason, I hope there will be general agreement to refer this matter to a committee. There are no political issues involved. It is a pedestrian task of trying to do the right thing in a whole variety of circumstances for the proper regulation of company law and the protection of investors and traders.</P>
    <P>When the last company law Bill was introduced in 1908, there were relatively few public companies in the country, relatively few private companies. At that time, the industrial stage was represented by the personally-owned company where a man or his family owned a business that they had inherited from their predecessors and which they hoped to pass on to their successors.  The old concept of personal management of industry has been largely superseded by the joint stock company or by the type of private company in which there is very little personal ownership but rather ownership based on the investment of money and the motivating influence is not so much the success <Col N="1207" /> of the personal enterprise as the return of dividends to shareholders.</P>
    <P>In the old concept of the family-owned industry, the owner was probably proud of the part which industry played in providing employment and producing goods and that was his business.  The modern approach to the ownership of industry is: what is the return on the capital invested?  To-day, because of this policy, you may find a person is part-owner of a rubber plantation in Malaya and next week he may sell his shares there and buy tea shares in Ceylon.  The following week he may decide to buy copper shares in Rhodesia.  He may change his mind again and say he knows of a good mine in Canada.  That is the new type of ownership of industry.</P>
    <P>The old type of private, personally-owned enterprise has very largely&mdash;not altogether&mdash;gone into the limbo of history.  It is because of the emergence of the new private or public company that it becomes necessary to amend our law and provide the necessary protection for the investors or share-holders&mdash;in many cases, people of very small means&mdash;and for the traders who trade with these companies.</P>
    <P>The main considerations will be to ensure that the companies operate fairly and that those who are entitled to see company accounts will be given sufficient information to enable them to understand the accounts.  Most people who are familiar with published accounts&mdash;many of them of public companies&mdash;find it impossible to get adequate knowledge of the precise position of the company if they have to rely solely on the information provided in the published accounts.  I hope that, subject to preserving the reasonable secrecy which the small private companies are entitled to expect&mdash;and nobody desires to ruin a small privately-owned, struggling company by turning the searchlight on it&mdash;reasonable information is made available, particularly where the private company is one which engages in very extensive activities and where its financial collapse might involve considerable hardship for small traders and investors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> There are two other points to which I should like to refer, although, as I said, I could wait for the Committee Stage, but I merely want to put a question mark in the Minister's mind. He said in the course of his speech that we have no legislation dealing with the small unit trust here.  If that is so, I do not know what the present law in the matter is.  I think the Minister might have a look at that again. These unit trusts have been making very rapid progress in Britain.  Millions of people in Britain now belong to them and hold shares in them.  More and more of them are being established and, in the main, the investor is the small man in England, not the well-to-do man, but the small man of thrifty habit who is in a regular job and has a pretty fair income.  Perhaps he would like to save something each week and put it into a trust where he can invest with plenty of facility and hope that by the time he comes to retire, he will have accumulated a fair sum of money which will help him in the autumn and winter of life.</P>
    <P>It would not surprise me if one of these days we woke up and saw an advertisement in the newspapers announcing the establishment of &ldquo;The Shamrock Trust&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Harp Unit Trust&rdquo; and were told that this is the thing, that if you want to make sure that the winter of your life will be marked by roses and honey, you have got to invest in the unit trust.  I do not object to these unit trusts.  I think they are good for thrifty people and that it is better to see money spent in that way than in the optimistic hopes that some old horse will pass 50 others at the winning post and that we will get wealth in that speedy and miraculous way.  But if we have no legislation dealing with unit trusts, having regard to the fact that they are operating across the Border on a fairly substantial scale, I understand, and in Britain, it surely is time we had a look at the matter to see at this stage, as we are dealing with company law, whether we ought not to take some power to deal with the problem.  At all events, it should be examined, that is, on the assumption that we still have no legislative powers to deal with it.  If we have not, then because of its rapid and <Col N="1209" /> successful development in Britain, it would be advantageous if we were to have some legislation to deal with the subject today.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to raise is in relation to the small creditor.  Where a company becomes insolvent, under existing company law, the State can move in and sweep into its arms everything owing to it and people to whom money is owed simply get the fragments if any fragments are left.  This procedure comes down from the old kingly right that whatever the king wanted, he had to get and whatever money was owed to him must be paid. I am glad that the Bill has shed a lot of what one might call the &ldquo;lootful&rdquo; habits which were operated by the State up to the present but the Minister in the new legislation is keeping the right to collect in relation to the 12 months assessment of taxes.</P>
    <P>In 1962, the Minister should abandon that.  After all, the State, wealthy as it is, and with the resources it has and its ability to tax every citizen, if it has not got sufficient money, should not claim a greater priority than any of the very small traders and very small investors who will be looking for a portion, and only a portion probably, of what they have invested in a company and what is due to them from the insolvent company.  The Minister would do this legislation good if he were to adopt the attitude that the State would take its place with the rest of the people because it does not desire to get out of an insolvent undertaking any more than the ordinary citizens, who comprise the State, get out of it proportionately.  Perhaps the Minister will see his way to deleting the remnant of the provision which he is retaining in the Bill and put the State in the same position as any other person entitled to claim against the assets of the insolvent company.</P>
    <P>Might I make one suggestion which I think will help the Minister's Committee? A committee may well go through a Bill of this kind and produce for him an agreed measure in a shorter period than if the Bill were the subject of contention and stubbornness across both sides of the House. The Minister will come in on the Committee Stage, in ordinary circumstances, <Col N="1210" /> with a brief which will give him details about each section and about the variations in the new sections from the sections in the old Bill. He is familiar with the kind of brief he gets.  Would it be possible for him to prepare a few copies of such a brief to be made available at least to groups in the Committee so that one would have a knowledge nearly akin to the Minister's of this complex and highly technical matter?  The more we understand the Bill, the better it will be for the ultimate legislation and the speedier will be the consideration of it.  If the Minister would agree to such a proposal, it would help him to get his Bill through and contribute to an intelligent understanding of the Bill.  As I said, this will probably be the last Bill on company law that this House will enact for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome extended to this Bill which has been so very long awaited.  It is not a very exciting measure but it is certainly a very bold one and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.  Its object, as I see it, is to restore the relation between management and ownership of limited companies and to bring within the ambit of company law the old companies and subsidiary companies which are such an important feature of commercial organisation to-day.  The greatest merit of the Bill is that it will ensure publication of most of the information which shareholders need in order to appreciate the value of their property.  It will bring about great improvements in the presentation of company information. The Bill has, however, social implications which should be adverted to.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Transport Bill, 1962&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We want the Minister to reconsider seriously the question of public transport at this time.  We believe it must be evident to the Minister now that he is not likely to fulfil by <Col N="1211" /> 1964 virtually any of the objectives laid down by the 1958 Act.  It must also be evident to him that in continuing to drive the Board of CIE forward on this futile exercise of trying to break even by 1964, he is just going to do more and more damage to the company, its employees and to do even greater damage in rural Ireland in regard to the facilitating of the depopulation which has gone on as a result of the changes brought about by the changes in public transport amenities there.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister can claim here from the findings that are available to us&mdash;limited and suspect as they are, coming from CIE&mdash;that any significant advance has been made on the many fronts upon which a public transport service could have made gains if it had become a dynamic, viable, effective and efficient public service during the three or four years under which it has operated within the scope of the 1958 Act.  So far, the only comment I gather from the Minister&mdash;I hope we will hear from him &mdash;was in regard to the increase in passengers on the road transport side.  The Minister should not take too much heart from that.  It must be clear to him that if there is a significant reduction in the railway services, then the public are left with little alternative to carry out its reasonable functions of doing a job of work and of attending to its ordinary everyday duties, visits to local towns, social functions and so on.  They are inevitably driven to use road passenger services, however defective these may be.  The public must either walk or ride, and one simply cannot walk 15 or 20 miles to work and back again in the evening. On the other side, in regard to road freight, merchandise, livestock and rail passenger services, the Minister cannot claim on behalf of CIE they are showing any great advance which would lead him to believe the service will take over larger and larger sectors of what is now completely dominated by what might be called the private enterprise part of public transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must inevitably face <Col N="1212" /> the repeal of this section in the Act. In tabling this Bill, we were anxious that there should be a full-scale debate on this whole question of public transport. We fully appreciate it is unlikely the Minister will take this Bill as it is drafted and we appreciate that, if he accepts the principle, he will be responsible for redrafting the Bill so that any clause in the Act which needs to be covered by any such Bill will be covered.  We are merely concerned to get a debate on the principle of insisting that this company try to break even by 1964.  It seems to us there is little likelihood of this happening. Consequently, instead of continuing to do the damage which is being done by insisting on this clause, the Minister should face up to that with courage and a regard for his responsibilities to the public and should accept the need for some altered approach on the whole matter.</P>
    <P>We think the inevitable approach is to remove the imposition concerning breaking even and then accept the responsibility to subsidise the railway service from public funds.  It is an astonishing thing&mdash;perhaps in some ways, it is not&mdash;that to the Minister this word &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; appears to be a particularly unclean word.  He seems to show the greatest resentment to any suggestion that a subsidy should be used in this essentially social service or public amenity, whatever you like to call it.  The astonishing thing, really &mdash;and it may account for his hostility to this public service&mdash;is the fact that this person with very pronounced conservative, Tory convictions should find himself in the position of defending, as no doubt he will defend, the actions and activities of this semi-State service.</P>
    <P>Why can the Minister not accept the responsibility of keeping the public transport service going, basing the need primarily on the social requirements of the community rather than on the balance sheet approach, the cash register approach, the profit and loss approach, which up to the present has done so much damage? There is no doubt we have accepted the necessity for subsidies in relation to other sectors of the economy.  We know quite well the farming community <Col N="1213" /> need, and get, considerable subsidies of one kind or another.  The Minister for Agriculture seems to me to be the last person in the world to express his contempt for this need to have subsidies.  His attitude is that, if we are to create and maintain any sort of viable agricultural economy, there are certain price supports or subsidies which have to be conceded to the farming community, and he asks the public for these.  To the extent to which we keep any kind of balance between rural and urban life&mdash;of course, it is in great imbalance&mdash;we owe a lot to the fact that we accept this principle of subsidies.</P>
    <P>This is not an outrageous or novel suggestion or one of which the Minister need be particularly frightened. There is nothing wrong, unclean or obscene about this suggestion of subsidies. It is a perfectly legitimate suggestion accepted by many countries. Their attitude is that one should facilitate people living in remote areas because it is in the national interest to do so.  Of course, it is because, as people keep saying, the small farmer is the backbone of the community.  Therefore, he should be facilitated in remaining in, rather than being driven out of, rural Ireland into the cities and to other countries.</P>
    <P>Therefore in order to maintain that very important pattern of living in society, the Government should concede the need to accept the principle of raising subsidies for services generally.  The Minister is also in control of air services.  He knows quite well the approach to the treatment of air services of one kind or another&mdash; Atlantic services, European services or services between here and London. He accepts the need to subsidise these services, should the occasion arise.</P>
    <P>I understand that, taking the profit and loss approach, most of the European air services are bankrupt and are maintained solely by the payment of considerable sums in subsidies by the different Governments.  We accept this principle.  We do not expect the aeroplanes, in relation to the maintenance of the airports at Shannon, Collinstown, Cork, or wherever it may be, to pay from revenues for the <Col N="1214" /> maintenance of these great capital outlays.</P>
    <P>With the railways, on the other hand, we will not accept the same principle that the maintenance of rails should become a national charge.  It would be justifiable to make it into a national charge.  We subsidise the bus passenger services and we subsidise the rail freight side, by virtue of the fact that our roads are paid for as part of the national charge, either in the form of rates or from central funds.  In this way, it can be said that these services, which are becoming or which are so successful, are, in fact, getting a concealed subsidy, too.  The Minister is prepared to give this type of subsidy to the road services, to air services, to farmers.  He is prepared to give it for social welfare, care of the aged, health services, and so on, but he is not prepared to concede the same principle in relation to this very important service of railways.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of that, I wonder if the Minister would explain a certain figure in the annual report which seems to me to require some explanation. There may be a perfectly good explanation for it.  It is a figure, which recurs in three annual reports I have read, in relation to receipts from road freight working&mdash;the net freight railway loss on collection and delivery services.</P>
    <P>The amount debited to the railway as loss on collection and delivery service has not varied since 1959.  It is here all the time as £50,000, which is quite a considerable amount of money as a subsidy from the railways to the roads.  If this is in part or wholly made available to the road freight service from the railway services, it seems to me that there should be some reduction in that figure, in view of the fact that there has been a reduction in the railway services as a result of the closure of lines or the curtailment of services of one kind or another.  I should be glad of an explanation on that point.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that in my contribution I am not attacking at all the idea of public enterprise. As a Socialist, I believe in public enterprise.  The reason, I suppose, I <Col N="1215" /> have taken such a particular interest in the business is that I feel the whole conception of public enterprise in Ireland has been greatly contaminated and undermined in the minds of people generally, of workers in particular and the consuming public, the passenger also.</P>
    <P>For that reason, naturally, I should be the last in the world to attack the principle of public enterprise.  My main objection arises from the fact that this public enterprise&mdash;semi-State enterprise, whatever you like to call it; it is not a true socialist organisation because the workers are not in control of it&mdash;works under very considerable disadvantages, the main one being the necessity to attempt to pay its way by a particular date, which we believe is impossible, and also the fact that there is not complete public ownership of public transport.</P>
    <P>In so far as I pointed it out last night, on the haulage side alone, one in 80 or 90, I think, of the vans on the road are CIE vans and the rest are retained for private enterprise.  Clearly, private enterprise is interested in profits; it is solely concerned with profits.  It will concern itself with the less difficult side or the side which can more readily be made to make a profit.  Consequently, I suggest that in these circumstances the whole conception of public enterprise is working at a very grave disadvantage and is being shown up in a bad light in the country.</P>
    <P>Because of my belief in public enterprise, it seems to me that I have a particular responsibility to try to discuss the full implications of the present trend in public transport services generally.  I think it must be made clear that, bad as this service is, nobody could suggest it would be better run under private enterprise. There is no question of reverting to private enterprise.  There is no question of asking for the reconstitution of the old GSR or GNR Boards.  Clearly, these people attempted to run these concerns at a profit.  They found out, as we have found out, that it was impossible to do so.  They ended up in a semi-bankrupt or bankrupt state.</P>
    <P>The fact that it is not possible to run <Col N="1216" /> an equitably-run public transport service on State lines is no criticism of the general principle of the use of public ownership.  When it was in private hands, it was equally inefficient. It ran on the rocks and was virtually bankrupt when the State took it over.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been wrong and the Board have been wrong to give up all hope, as they appear to have given up all hope, of making a success of the rail passenger side of the service.  The company started off with a fairly primitive road freight type service. The Minister has made some.  I think, limited advances but I have no doubt he will claim he has made considerable advances.  However, the more he claims he has made considerable advances, the more he establishes the point that it is possible to start with very defective services and, by organisation of one kind or another, to build them up.</P>
    <P>He started in relation to road freight and passenger services, it is reasonable to suggest, at much the same place.  If he had concentrated to anything like the same extent on the rail passenger and rail freight side, it is quite possible that if he had made those services more attractive, provided better time tables and made them better generally, he could claim now that there had been some substantial advance on the rail passenger side as well as on the road passenger and road freight side.  It seems that the lunatic logic of this conception of having to pay our way will bring us to the position where the test will be applied to the new bus services now being provided.  We will be told that they are not changed and we will get a gradual contraction not only of the rail services but also of the bus services.</P>
    <P>The Minister's admiration of the Chairman and the Chairman's narcissistic admiration of himself reminds me of nothing more than the African tribes who shrink the heads of their enemies, then hang them up and admire them and expect everybody else to admire them, too.  The public cannot be expected to have the same regard for the very much less efficient and expensive services now being provided <Col N="1217" /> as the Chairman appears to have.  The whole position of public transport has to be reconsidered and I suggest the Minister should make the same approach to it as he has made to the air services generally.</P>
    <P>I make no apology at all for having taken up considerable time in the discussion of this Bill.  When the 1958 Bill went through this House, it was steamrolled through in the typically Deputy Lemass fashion&mdash;&ldquo;This is the answer to the problem; let us get it through and we will find everything all right by 1964.&rdquo;  It was quite clear that opposing the Bill at that time would be like throwing yourself under a steamroller.  It seemed to me at the time that the best thing to do was to let them get on with it and then approach it when the logic of the situation had altered existing circumstances. I do not think we can be accused of having hindsight in regard to these things.  We now make the claim that this was a bad principle.  It was quite obvious at the time that no suggestion would be accepted that it was a thoroughly bad principle and that it was not possible, consistent with the maintenance of a viable and healthy social unit, to run a public transport service in this way.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of unconscious humour was shown recently by a writer who came over here to have a look at the country, as so many are doing at the moment and then going back after 24 hours and telling the rest of the world what a booming economy there is here.  This writer wrote in one of the papers that Dr. Beeching had visited over here to see what Dr. Andrews was doing.  At that time, they were in the middle of a national rail stoppage because Dr. Beeching tried to do in Britain the same as Dr. Andrews has got away with here.  It is about time that Synge Street's golden boy, as he has been called, was told to come down off his perch and recognise the fact that in the operation of a public transport service of this kind there are more important things than making it pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no secret. The Deputy knows very well the precedent set here in regard to the reading of such statements.  In fact, it is only a courtesy.  First of all, I want to clear up some misunderstandings about the procedure adopted by CIE in connection with the closing of lines. In the first place, the objective of CIE is to maintain as much of the railway system as possible and the directors of CIE and the members of the Board have a tradition of wanting to maintain the railway service.  No calculations they make, no estimates prepared for them are falsified in order to prove that a railway line must close when in fact it could really remain open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the obvious reasons for that is that in relation to the financial betterment which can be achieved in closing railway lines, there is always the consideration of the contributing <Col N="1220" /> revenue to the main arterial system of the railways which is obtained as a result of traffic starting on the branch lines.  There is also the question of wanting, as far as possible, to preserve the staff of CIE to avoid as little disruption as possible and, in general, it is always desirable to maintain a particular form of transport system, if it can be done efficiently and economically.</P>
    <P>CIE commence by estimating whether a line is making a loss.  They do not pretend to be infallible about this.  It involves quite difficult calculations and it involves the most difficult form of accountancy because of the necessity for distinguishing between the relation of revenue received for a particular portion of line with the revenue which can be apportioned over the whole system in respect of goods which travel far beyond the branch line.  For this reason when CIE started to make final decisions about what should remain as the railway, they secured the services of a firm of consultants who are very well known and highly regarded, and they asked them to examine the revenue and expenditure in relation to the whole of the railway system, and in order that they should not be prejudiced in relation to any particular branch line, they instructed the consultants not to apportion the general overhead costs of the company against the revenue received from a particular branch line because they found it very difficult to make that calculation.  They also decided they would eliminate any doubtful costs and that the estimate of expenditure and receipts would be of a rock-bottom character on which they could rely.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that in this debate the number of Deputies who have charged the Board of CIE with either falsifying figures or misrepresenting the facts to deputations they have received is very small indeed, and I am utterly ashamed that one of the Deputies should have been from my own side of the House.  Most have refrained from irresponsible statements of that kind because they use their common sense and know that it is almost unimaginable that, with the very fine tradition of State companies <Col N="1221" /> which we have in this country, the directors of CIE, either collectively or individually, and apart from their own sincere convictions as to the future of the transport system, would put themselves in a position of embarrassing humiliation at a time when inquiries for new legislation are being made, when the whole question of transport is being examined in relation to the next five years' economic programme and when they are in a position that at any time any Government could institute any kind of public inquiry and make researches into the manner in which these calculations are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When it is a bit late in the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is utterly revolting that any person in this House would suggest, looking back on the very fine traditions we have, that there would be deliberate falsification of these figures designed to deceive the public, the staff of CIE and this House above all.  I have already explained how it is that receipts for traffic on branch line stations from private merchants show an excess over those published by CIE in connection with the lines which are noticed for closing. I do not think I need go into that now.  If goods are sent from Youghal to Dublin, quite obviously the Cork to Dublin lines must derive some profit from the carriage of the goods in relation to the apportionment of the receipts.  That is simple enough for anybody to understand.  I very much doubt whether one per cent. of the people of Cork were under any illusion about it after Deputy Corry published his figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is that CIE do not automatically close a line if they discover that there is a deficit in relation to its operation.  They then have to examine the cost of a substitute service and whether after providing a substitute service, they will be making any saying, whether in fact there will be any financial betterment.  They also have to bear in mind that it is in their interests to provide a good substitute service, to retain the goodwill of the merchants who previously have sent their goods by rail, to retain the <Col N="1222" /> goodwill of what is usually only a very very small number of passengers who travel on trains.  The social factor enters into their calculations; in other words, if by closing a railway line and providing a substitute service, they disrupt the social life of the community, they would at least hesitate before doing so.</P>
    <P>In this connection, they have shown the utmost willingness to receive deputations and I think the fact that the chairmen and members of county councils who have publicly stated that the Chairman of CIE met them in an extremely pleasant and friendly manner is a perfect answer to all the allegations of high-handedness and of a dictatorial attitude made by, I am very glad to say, only three Deputies.</P>
    <P>There have been, as I have said, exchanges of views, and local authorities can be of great help to CIE in assisting them to make a final assessment before the final decision is made to close a line.  For example, Cork Corporation were received by the Chairman of CIE and he had a very useful discussion with them.  The Chairman of CIE explained to Cork Corporation that the notice whereby the Youghal-Cork line might be closed was published as a preliminary notice. It was not the final decision and it was possible that there might be not an absolute closing but that some kind of a compromise might be effected because of other factors being considered by CIE.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see in connection with certain lines where closures were inevitable that both the chairman and members of the county council adopted a very reasonable attitude and that the chairman stated the closing of the railway line would not have any adverse influence on the locality.  That has been stated by the Chairman of Portlaoise. Town Commissioners and the Chairman of Kilkenny County Council. Taken as a whole, the sort of hysteria which arises when a railway closes or is about to close not only in this country but in every country seems to be somewhat mitigated at present.</P>
    <P>The question to ask county councils when they come to make these protests is a very simple one.  If there were a well-established bus and lorry <Col N="1223" /> service and if the number of private cars upon the roads had been numerous at the time it was proposed to start a new branch line, would it ever have been started?  If county councils were asked for their views on the amount of capital required to start a branch line of the kind now closing in their areas, they would be so horrified by the amount that they would say: &ldquo;If the Government can afford this amount for starting a branch railway line, they would be far better advised to give the money to us to improve the roads,&rdquo; and they would be facing realities as they should be faced.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy R. Barry for his qualified criticism of CIE.  What he said was stated very fairly.  Deputy O'Connor made an objective statement and he was frank enough to state the absolute truth.  It is the people of this country who are closing the branch railway lines by not supporting them.  There is nothing more democratic ultimately than the decision of CIE to close branch lines where they have not been supported, where the people preferred to use their own transport and where they have discovered that in modern conditions and in any circumstances, using private or any other form of transport, the double handling of goods is absolutely out. This automatically puts a minor branch line out of existence except for very limited classes of traffic on limited occasions.</P>
    <P>I do not know what to say to Deputy Lynch of Waterford because he is a person with such hysterical devotion to railways that I do not think anything I could say would influence him in the slightest.  The rate at which CIE started to tear up the lines in Waterford and Tramore has no reference whatsoever to this debate.</P>
    <P>He spoke about the burden on the ratepayers in relation to the closing of the railways.  He seemed to say something&mdash;I did not fully understand it&mdash;to the effect that the Minister for Local Government had been rather niggardly in making grants available for county councils affected by the closing of railway lines.  I found that for the Cork, Waterford and Clare <Col N="1224" /> railway lines that had closed, the Minister for Local Government made £379,000 available.  That was made available in order to cover the damage that would be done by an additional 30 lorries and buses substituted for all three railway lines with another 40 lorries and a few buses used occasionally for the beet season in three counties where there were something like 50,000 vehicles of all descriptions.  The Minister for Local Government made it perfectly clear that that very large sum was being given because it was absolutely no use doing any work on the particular stretch of road where it might be said that even a small increase in the number of lorries on the road would be bad for the road service, unless a certain amount of backlog work were done in any event. If backlog work were done afterwards, it would double the cost.  If you take a particular stretch of road and straighten it out, you might as well do fundamental work on the road.  As a result, very considerable sums were given.  From the point of view of county councils, it almost seems to be an advantage in the case of a relatively small branch line which is closed because more moneys have to be given by the Minister for Local Government. He has been obliged up to now to give rather more than is really necessary in order to do a very good job.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan spoke as though CIE were determined to close the whole rail system.  It would be impossible for me to say what the railway system is likely to be five or ten years from now.  I do know that CIE have asked for large capital grants in order to improve rolling stock and their premises and to modernise the whole system.  We are lending millions to CIE for the improvement of their rail services.  We are doing that in the belief that the railway will play a part as an arterial rail service in the economy of the country regardless of the many changes that have taken place in the character of transport in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to the closing of the railways in the midlands. I have already spoken about double handling being out.  In relation to the <Col N="1225" /> stations that are being closed on the Kilkenny line, in the case of eight of them from one to five passengers a day travel by train.  In the case of another three, seven to eleven travel by train.  That includes the Birr-Roscrea line.  To replace the whole of the rail traffic in the midland area, it will require something like six lorries and 12 extra lorries during the beet season and one bus.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat what I said on the last occasion when we had a debate on the annual report of CIE. When the substitution of road service is as low as that, I am quite willing to come before the House and say that, regardless of what CIE may have decided about those rail services, they are not rail services in the proper meaning of the term but bus and lorry services forced to travel on rails and stop infrequently.  They bear no relation to the transport needs of the country.  I am quite willing to state that definitely as my opinion.  Where one person gets into a train, that is not a rail service in the modern meaning of the term.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan also referred to the canals.  There is no decision about closing the Grand Canal.  The Royal Canal has been so long disused that it can be closed after taking appropriate legal steps.  CIE cannot deprive any farmer of any rights to which he was entitled of making use of the canals for water or any other purpose without making some agreement.  I need not go into that in detail, although Deputy McQuillan was wrong in suggesting that people could be deprived of their legally-acquired rights in relation to any amenities concerning the canals.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands was consulted in regard to the fishing amenities of the canals.  As Deputy McQuillan knows well, there are some stretches of the canal which are going to remain filled with water indefinitely for various reasons.  In connection with the Grand Canal, we will have to take a decision finally as to whether or not to close it or what to do with it at the end of the operation of the 1958 Act.  The Grand Canal has to be kept navigable for the period of the Act and then the final decision has to be taken.</P>
    <P>One Deputy, a humorous character, <Col N="1226" /> referred to me as &ldquo;Dame Pachyderm&rdquo;. I mention that in passing.  I do not think I have ever before been called after a prehistoric animal in the House, whatever else I have been called.  I do not know how it relates to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand on my belief that we should have the cheapest and best form of public transport possible, whether by rail or bus or in the air.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne made a very long speech and I will cover most of what he said in my prepared statement, but I should like to say that there are quite a number of socialists in Europe who believe that State companies should pay and that it is extremely bad for socialist morale for State companies not to pay.  The people, they say, should be prepared to pay for State-run services.  Losing State companies are bad for socialist morale.  They say that because a company is run by the State it should be more efficient.  It does not have to make profits unless they are ploughed back into the business; it does not have to pay dividends to private shareholders. Therefore, it should be more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other socialists believe that any equalisation that needs to be done in order to make all the services in the community available to the whole community should be done through social services and that that should be the main objective and that it is confusing the whole issue of socialism to have all sorts of subsidies by which the community subsidises one part of the economy and, as a result, pay more taxes and are unable to support another part of the economy.  I have read a great deal about socialism and socialist theory and a great many socialists think it is tremendously important, <Col N="1227" /> particularly in a capitalist world, that from the very beginning any State company should pay its way even if it causes some difficulty.  I merely mention that in passing.</P>
    <P>I think it would now be well for me to read my statement which covers the whole question involved in this Bill. This debate has been conducted by Deputies most of whom have ignored the Taoiseach's speech in 1958, when he clearly linked the 1958 Act with the Beddy Committee Report.  The Report made it clear that there would have to be drastic reorganisation and a reduction in railway staff, whose numbers per million passenger miles and per million ton miles of freight were two to three times the European average and hopelessly excessive.</P>
    <P>No one approving of the Act could be under any illusion as to the volume and scope of drastic reorganisation required.</P>
    <P>The extremely liberal redundancy provisions, in relation to which I have had no complaint, were an absolute pointer to the serious steps required to be taken.  Deputies have forgotten that 438 miles of line had been closed prior to 1958 and that those lines generally speaking were comparable in their economics to the present position of the lines now being considered for closing.</P>
    <P>The subsection of the Transport Act, 1958, which the enactment of this Bill would delete provides in effect that CIE should become self-supporting not later than 31st March, 1964.  That subsection replaced subsection 15 (2) of the Transport Act, 1950, which in effect required CIE to become self-supporting forthwith. The provision in the 1958 Act is, therefore, a more realistic one, being based on the expectation that radical reorganisation of the undertaking which the Board was being empowered to put in train would in fact enable them to break even within five years. No statutory direction of this kind to achieve a particular target, however sensible or realistic, can of its nature be mandatory.  It is, rather, an indication to the Board of CIE of what the Government and the Oireachtas <Col N="1228" /> expect them to achieve.  It was a target which was at once more realistic and inspiring than the very indeterminate provision which it replaced. The effect of deleting this provision from the Transport Act 1958, would be to remove all statutory incentive to CIE to break even.  It would indicate to the Board that the Oirechtas had no interest in its financial results and would, presumably, be happy to vote subsidies freely to meet whatever deficiencies CIE might incur.  While there may be an arguable case now or later for amending or modifying this section in some very limited respect, to delete it altogether is just plain silly.  The proposal is just another example of the extent to which ill-digested socialist notions have fuddled the heads of the authors of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The best justification of this section of the 1958 Act is that up to now it has proved to be a moderately realistic one.  The progress achieved by CIE has been far better than anyone could have reasonably expected in 1958.  By 31st March, 1961, CIE had reduced their annual deficit from almost £2,000,000 to £246,000 and the Board had high hopes that the undertaking might break even in the year ended 31st March, 1962.  In the event, the eighth round of wage increases, which, together with an associated improvement in working conditions cost the Board £2.35 million per annum, could not be met by a corresponding increase in revenue and the annual deficit reached the figure of £1,696,000.</P>
    <P>The eighth round has fallen more heavily on CIE than on most industrial undertakings.  This is, first, because wages and salaries form a very high proportion of outgoings in CIE and, secondly, CIE have been unable to recover more than a proportion of their increased costs by increased rates and fares.  This is so because public transport has no longer the monopoly it once enjoyed.  It is in fierce competition with private transport&mdash;with the growing numbers of lorries and tractors, private cars, scooters and mopeds.  The present prospects are that CIE results for the current year may not be substantially <Col N="1229" /> better than last year.  The Board, however, are more hopeful for the long term and have by no means abandoned their aim of achieving solvency by 31st March, 1964, after which date the present subsidy of £1.175 million per annum ceases to be payable.</P>
    <P>Criticism of the target set for CIE by the 1958 Act appears to be related partly to the necessity to increase charges to meet outgoings and partly to the closing of uneconomic rail services. So far as fares and rates are concerned, Dublin fares are comparable with those in British provincial cities.</P>
    <P>To maintain them at their present level there must be increased efficiency and services must be tailored remorselessly to true demand.  The Dublin services compare very favourably, both in price and comfort, with many Continental services, where seating is provided only for relatively few of the passengers.  Provincial fares are comparable with those in the Six Counties and relate to the low density of population.  Our railway fares are more or less on the same level as those in Britain.  Moreover, CIE's liberty to fix rates and fares entirely at their own discretion is very much limited by the impact of competition from private transport and, indeed, this competition has kept rates and fares below the level at which there would be sufficient to meet outgoings. CIE must, by increased efficiency, reduce costs and streamline their services to meet the challenge.</P>
    <P>We have had to subsidise CIE very substantially over a period in the hope of getting the undertaking properly on its feet.  At no stage, however, has the Government or the Dáil ever contemplated a situation in which the undertaking would be permanently in receipt of subsidies.  I know of no reason why, in principle, transport should be subsidised.  It is no more essential to the public than many other commodities or services which no one would dream of subsidising.  It remains firmly the Government's policy, therefore, that CIE, like other State bodies whose task it is provide productive services, should pay their way.  Deficit <Col N="1230" /> financing of the kind envisaged by the authors of this Bill would be as bad for CIE as for the public.</P>
    <P>Subsidy inevitably breeds inefficiency and encourages excessive staffing and feather-bedding and the whispering voice of &ldquo;It doesn't matter; the Government will pay&rdquo; is destructive of the morale of the staff, high and low.  Subsidies deprive the taxpayer of capital, of purchasing power and of savings which he could otherwise put to better use.  It is &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul&rdquo; and while operating subsidies might maintain staff in uneconomic and non-productive services in CIE, they would deprive people of employment elsewhere with the new or expanded industries that the purchasing power or capital diverted to subsidies might have financed.  May I point out that for every man employed in CIE as a result of an operating subsidy another man will be disemployed, or a young man or girl will fail to get employment somewhere else.  Deficit payments leave their trail with irrevocable and implacable regularity.</P>
    <P>I might mention in passing that we are all hoping that as a result of joining the Common Market the old system of agricultural subsidies will end.  We in our Party, and I think it is true of the Opposition, have always preferred, in the main, in normal circumstances, capital subsidies from the community which are productive in character.  No Government would want to pay current subsidies on the value of food produced, were it not for the fact that our trade relations are otherwise distorted.</P>
    <P>May I also point out, in relation to what Deputy Dr. Browne said, that if he imagines that the rich alone in this country could afford to pay a subsidy to keep CIE going, he is very much mistaken.  All subsidies are paid for by a very large section of the population and a very large ordinary section of the population pay the income tax of this country.  The idea that they can be continued because on the whole the rich will pay them is not reflected in the accounts of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>It would, no doubt, be very simple <Col N="1231" /> to put 3d. a gallon tax on petrol or to increase the tax on tobacco or stout to find the money for further subsidies for CIE.  But the very people who are now calling for subsidies would quickly cease their importunings if the Minister for Finance named a specific tax to cover an increased deficit.  It is very desirable that the taxpayer should realise how heavy the bill for subsidising CIE has been since the last war.  To meet the cost of losses, interest on transport stock and contribution towards capital expenditures, total State assistance to date amounts to £27 millions.  The present cost to the Exchequer of written-off losses, that is, capital no longer to be remunerated by CIE, together with the present temporary subsidy, amounts to over £3 million per annum.  I suggest that at the moment that is quite a sufficient subsidy for any transport services even for those who believe in it.</P>
    <P>I have, on a number of occasions, referred to the whole question of CIE policy in regard to closing uneconomic railway lines.  I will, briefly, give the facts again:</P>
    <P>(1)  There is nothing sacrosanct about a railway line.  I want to be absolutely frank with the House about that. I and my colleagues in the Dáil have not got any sentimental feeling with regard to the value of a railway as such. In many places it is as out-dated as the horse.  Lorries and buses can provide more convenient access to the factory, the farm and the home.  For many commodities double handling of goods is now &ldquo;out&rdquo; and it is essential to provide for their transport by direct road or by means of pallets or containers and a combined rail/road service.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this country the scarcity of villages, the huge mileage of roads per 1,000 population, the low number of cars per 1,000 miles of road&mdash;and this holds good even if the number should be doubled&mdash;make the operation of short-haul secondhand lines a complete anomaly.  Empty trains are a sign of decay&mdash;they prove the lack of modern, quick-change, dynamic thinking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> (3)  The substitution of a handful of buses and lorries for a semi-derelict railway line carrying only a bus-load capacity of passengers cannot create any appreciable problem for the county councils.  If, on the one hand, we take the cost of any necessary road improvements&mdash;and, as I have already said, the effect on the roads of secondary rail closures is slight&mdash; together with the cost of redundancy compensation, and on the other hand the saving to the railway organisation and the advantages to the community of the substitute road services, there are absolutely no grounds for disquiet as to the ultimate net advantage to the community.</P>
    <P>The last three railway closings, as I have already said, involved less than thirty additional buses and lorries apart from some extra buses and lorries for peak traffic.  The number of vehicles for the three counties concerned exceeds 50,000.</P>
    <P>In fact the Minister for Local Government gave Road Fund grants which far surpassed the requirements for heavier traffic, because in every case there was a back-log of improvement work and to carry out certain improvements and not at the same time effect basic improvements in the immediate road system would have been wasteful and uneconomic.</P>
    <P>(4)  Numerous industries of all kinds all over Europe are independent of rail transport, but no railway line will close here where there is any likelihood that some important industry would depend on its survival.</P>
    <P>(5)  By 1970, at the 1951-61 rate of private car increase&mdash;I mention those dates, not the last two years&mdash;one in every eight people will own a car. One in fourteen owns a private car now.  There are about 200,000 private cars and nearly 50,000 motor cycles, mopeds and scooters on the roads. There are 44,000 commercial vehicles, compared with the 950 road freight vehicles of CIE.</P>
    <P>(6)  The only purpose in preserving a rail system here is to provide fast, infrequently-stopping, long haul services for passengers and goods and to deal with peak and tourist traffic to <Col N="1233" /> main centres at certain times of the year.  This necessitates the closing of stations in many places.  The rail users are already compelling this change.  It was said the other day that a rail service can be likened to a continuous fast moving conveyor belt.  By this definition it is obvious that if motor traffic had existed at the time railways were built many branch lines would never have been constructed.</P>
    <P>A number of stations will be closing on the CIE main lines in order to speed up express services.  Average speeds on a number of the arterial lines will have to be increased to compete with private car traffic.</P>
    <P>(7)  The local authorities are, year by year, building wide arterial roads and CIE can only compete by closing minor stations and speeding up their buses and main-line trains.  The Councils who protest against the closing of branch lines are constantly improving their road systems along railway line routes and have never given a solitary thought to the idea that railways would be a better alternative, for the simple reason that road transport is growing and along some routes is more economic.</P>
    <P>Now to report on recent changes in the method of evaluation adopted by CIE: A proven system of estimating revenue and expenditure of every section of CIE rail services had been applied and the results indicate that the Beddy Committee predicted with great accuracy the lines that were likely to be retained.  The present railway system, less the lines to be considered for closing, would generally conform to that indicated in the Report.</P>
    <P>In order to compare trends here with those elsewhere, I have been following the position on the Continent and earlier this year had an opportunity to meet the heads of many important railways at an international congress in Munich.</P>
    <P>The International Railway Congress Association, whose members in one sense have a vested interest in keeping railway lines open, has called for a realistic approach in regard to the substitution of road services for uneconomic secondary railway lines.  The <Col N="1234" /> Association's view is that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Equality in the conditions under which competition takes place implies that the railway be freed from the obligation to operate secondary lines with little traffic which are not profitable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Association has accepted my invitation to hold its next meeting in Ireland in 1964.</P>
    <P>In France and Belgium, both with areas of intense congestion, where, even if our population increased by 50 per cent. and the number of our vehicles doubled, there would be no comparable problem here, standards for closing have been adopted.  In France, secondary lines have been marked for closing if the number of daily passengers did not exceed 350 and if goods tonnage did not pass 100 tons daily.  The French standard for replacement has resulted in the closing of about 8,000 miles of line for railway passenger services and about 1,600 miles for goods services.  In Belgium, the standard is below 1,243 passenger miles per day.  A large number of secondary lines have been closed.</P>
    <P>In the Netherlands, an intensely congested country with eight times our population per square mile, 67 per cent. of the passenger stations have been closed since 1939 and the railway service has been enormously speeded up.  A big mileage of lines has been closed.  All over Europe the same thing has been happening, while in the USA a similar pattern is emerging.</P>
    <P>The railway administrations report that there are always protests, but that substitute services are invariably found to be satisfactory and that long experience over years shows that protests are largely of an emotional nature, because later events prove that in fact the railway lines were closed because the vast majority of the people in the area in their own wisdom preferred other means of transport.  The advantages of the road services in these particular areas were selfevident:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> 1.  In many instances goods are delivered at an earlier hour.</P>
    <P>2.  The frequency of delivery can, in many cases, be increased.</P>
    <P>3.  Service is given directly to many places not previously served by rail. The flexibility of road operations brings service to the door of many customers for whom the former rail service was often, perhaps, rather remote.</P>
    <P>4.  Lorry crews get to know their customers&mdash;can even anticipate their requirements&mdash;and the day-to-day contact with the men who are actually doing the job is a very real benefit to traders generally.  This is in no way to depreciate the value of the railway services; for long and medium hauls the railway is still supreme.  But I am convinced that the Board of CIE is on the right lines in its search for a dovetailed, complementary service, using its road and its rail arms with a flexibility that ensures the best service for the customer and avoids duplication.</P>
    <P>There is nothing unreasonable about closing a railway line that is not patronised, provided that the taxpayers' and ratepayers' overall interests are safeguarded and that substantial improvements are effected by a more modern type of service.  Retention of uneconomic railway lines is opposed to the kind of dynamic modern operation necessary to our future progress. I find that some extravagant railway devotees put forward the excuse that no railways pay.  This is not true of a number of systems in different countries.</P>
    <P>There are at least three railway companies in Europe which pay at the present time, and if one examines the figures of other companies and subtracts the additional pension and capital expenditure due to losses, it will be found other companies show they are able to cover their expenditure, at least to a 99 per cent. degree.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear beyond all doubt that all the difficulties that arise from a decision to close a railway in a congested area of population&mdash;where the inhabitants are increasingly buying cars as the years pass&mdash;with the knowledge that people might be driven <Col N="1236" /> back to the railway because of extreme road congestion are absent in the present proposals by CIE.  Our population &mdash; human and vehicular &mdash; can expand enormously in the areas where closings are likely without any problem of congestion in the European sense arising.  All the arguments in favour of preserving a railway that is not patronised are those which keep us from looking forward.  Conservatism in economic thinking is fatal.  If the goods produced by one industry are too expensive the customers will buy elsewhere.  There is a vast amount of unused capacity in private transport should the public come to find rail and road transport charges too high.</P>
    <P>I next must give an account of the reorganisation work of CIE.  As the House is aware, the present Board of CIE, using the freedom and fortified with the directives in the 1958 Act, has striven with the utmost endeavour to improve the organisation and the efficiency of the undertaking.  One of its main concerns was the setting up of a commercial arm capable of selling energetically to take advantage of the commercial freedom given by the Act. Further, the management was decentralised to bring it into more personal relationship with local needs; to give quicker reactions to the public's requirements and to give greater scope for individual talents.  Apart from these alterations in the structure of management, the work of continually seeking after greater efficiency of men, machines and techniques has been pressed forward.  The measures taken include the following:</P>
    <P>Complete dieselisation&mdash;I should say that the purpose of providing diesel engines rather than steam engines was, in the main, for the very great economy effected by diesel engine operation and not, in the main, for increasing the speed of the trains.  The speed of some expresses has been increased.  The Dublin-Cork train takes half an hour less than it did in 1952.  The speed of the Dublin-Waterford train has been increased so that the journey which five years ago took three hours has been reduced to two and a half hours. As time goes by, I hope there will be further speeding up of services, although when I look at the timetables <Col N="1237" /> in some areas, it is obvious trains can be speeded up only if some of the stations, where only one or two people get in, are closed.  I cannot see any future for stations of that kind in the modern world.</P>
    <P>The other measures taken include the following:</P>
    <P>New carriages and wagon stock of modern design.</P>
    <P>Palletisation and containerisation.</P>
    <P>Greater segregation and quicker movement of goods (85 per cent. of all goods delivered within 24 hours).</P>
    <P>New road freight vehicles and more comfortable buses.</P>
    <P>Cleaning up and re-decoration of stations.</P>
    <P>Better amenities for staff.</P>
    <P>A new wagon shop at Limerick.</P>
    <P>The new North Wall depot.</P>
    <P>Coming soon&mdash;the mechanisation of track maintenance.</P>
    <P>The elimination of out-dated high cost methods in general.</P>
    <P>A new cost accounting system and, as I have said, a completely modern sales organisation. </P>
    <P>These efforts have resulted in improvements in revenue and in traffic carried compared with the period prior to the enactment of the Transport Act, 1958.  Railway receipts have increased from £7.5 million in 1958/59 to £8.3 million in 1961/62.  Road passenger revenue over the same period increased from £6.3 million to £7.2 million and road freight from £1.8 million to £2.8 million.  The board's package deal scheme, which has contributed over £900,000 in revenue, is playing a significant part in the improvement in the board's position.</P>
    <P>The board and the departmental managers have had an appallingly difficult task.  For nearly forty years there has been a dreary tale of losses, reduction of capital and a complete absence of the techniques of modern selling, of competition, of dynamic drive.  Consequently, the teams of consultants and the staff have had to make disturbance; have had to raise a lot of dust in their efforts to increase productivity.  It is difficult for loyal servants of any <Col N="1238" /> organisation to be told that methods of working and attitudes to selling must be drastically changed.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the staff are co-operating in making economies and in improving methods.  Here, again, I want to say, in relation to everything Deputy Dr. Browne has said about the relations between the board and the staff, that I am very well aware, so far as the vast majority of the CIE staff are concerned, that there is complete co-operation in the handling and development of this modernisation.  Of course, it is bound to create disturbance, to arouse, if you like, sadness in the minds of officials and to arouse resentment in the minds of people who, within the ambit of the powers of CIE over the past 40 years, were doing a very good job; who, working within certain limited procedures, were devoted servants of the company, and who suddenly find themselves having to alter entirely their outlook on railway running and on the whole service. But, making allowance for the difficulties which must be faced, I think the vast majority of the staff are showing very great co-operation in making economies and in improving methods.</P>
    <P>It is essential in such circumstances that all employees should have a reasonable understanding of events and that they should be afforded an opportunity of making contributions by way of suggestions, and so on.  I am glad to note that CIE, with the agreement of the trade unions, have been operating very successfully during the past couple of years a scheme of joint consultation between the management and staff which affords opportunities for co-operation and discussion on matters of mutual interest, including efficiency in the working of the rail and road services and in workshops and garages, the development of business and the best use of manpower. I understand that the councils have been of considerable value in improving the understanding between the management and staff and in the effort to create an efficient, economic and up-to-date transport service.</P>
    <P>That is my answer to what has been said by not more than two or three Deputies.  That is my answer to what they said about the Board's overbearing <Col N="1239" /> dictatorial attitude and to all the imputations against the Board by a handful of Deputies.  It is impossible to conceive that a very considerable number of joint industrial councils could operate successfully, where the executive staff meet the workers' representatives and discuss everything relating to the work in a particular district&mdash;how things are going; how the service is proceeding; suggestions for its improvement&mdash;if the whole service is supposed to be over-ruled and over-lorded by intolerant and dictatorial men.</P>
    <P>One of the most noticeable features of work in this House is that far too few Deputies in the Opposition demand more efficiency from State companies and far too few Deputies have bothered to ask CIE to show them the many improved systems of working already effected.  The paper read by the Chairman of CIE to the Institute of Public Administration on June 27th gives the main facts and I myself have inspected much of the system.</P>
    <P>Over a year ago, I said this about CIE in this House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No Minister for Finance faced with tremendous demands for seven-figure increases in educational and social services will want to subsidise CIE.  It will take the same kind of continuous, dedicated effort by management and staff working closely and enthusiastically together to maintain CIE as a company as solvent, for instance, as any to be found in a modern highly developed export industry facing cutthroat competition.  Let everyone dispel the idea that there will ever be an easy period for CIE when, either to management or staff, the prospects appear easy and cash returns are rolling in without tremendous effort. </P>
    <P>This warning is still valid.  It will demand of the Board and staff of CIE the maximum effort possible to create a public transport system that provides a competitive service.  The standards of speed and comfort on the arterial rail system as predicted by the Beddy Committee will have to advance as main roads improve.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> CIE is not a great transport organisation dominating and monopolising the entire world of transport, which, because of its essential character, must operate at no matter what cost.  It is a national transport organisation which, as each year passes, will compete more and more with a vast amplitude of private transport which can replace it unless the costs are kept competitive.</P>
    <P>These socialist Deputies are deluding the workers of CIE.  They are not in the position of being able to dictate terms to the community to demand subsidies from the State.  In every year that passes, attended by a growth of the national income, the number of citizens who would suffer grave inconvenience by a cessation of services will diminish.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delude the 22,000 workers in CIE.  They have acknowledged, by an almost complete absence of criticism, the fairness of the redundancy payments.  But they are not running a complete monopoly any longer.  It is possible even now for CIE to hive off sections of CIE activity to private enterprise whose services will be adequate and I shall not object to this if CIE are not permitted to modernise their methods in order to run the whole service at the lowest possible cost.</P>
    <P>There are a few groups within CIE who must cease thinking of themselves as in a privileged position.  I recognise that the vast majority, through the operation of joint industrial councils, are aware of the position, but they must not be deterred by the unrealistic attitude of the minority.  In this connotation some comment is called for on the huge eighth round wage increase together with the cost of associated improvements in working conditions which cost the Board £2.35 million in a full year.  As staff costs form a much larger proportion of costs in the transport industry, the effects of this increase are hard to absorb and will again adversely affect the financial position in the current year.</P>
    <P>As noted as far back as 1957, the staff costs per ton-mile of goods and and per passenger-mile on the railway are so far in excess of the European <Col N="1241" /> figure that the most drastic reorganisation is essential.</P>
    <P>Policy decisions, however, which will affect the whole economy if we join the EEC will inevitably increase competition by private transport.  Putting it another way: the taxpayer is not going to, and under EEC rules may not be permitted to, pay taxes in order that the cost of a railway ticket or the freight cost of sending a ton of goods may compete with the cost of driving a car-full of people to Dublin or sending the goods in a private lorry.</P>
    <P>Any other view would set a precedent for a whole series of State subsidy demands.  all of which would be self-annihilating as they would simply be transferring incomes without rhyme or reason from one group of people to another.</P>
    <P>The Board's progress since 1958 towards the development of an efficient and viable transport system in which rail and road services are fully coordinated has been most impressive. This progress has been commented on most favourably by railway experts from railway administrations abroad who have studied the measures taken by CIE.  The Board's aim is to provide a national transport system geared to meet the particular needs of transport users and when one looks at what already has been achieved in that direction there is no doubt but that the highest credit is due to the Board.</P>
    <P>When the 1958 Transport Act was enacted it was envisaged that, in the light of experience, new legislation would fall to be enacted at the end of the five-year period of reorganisation ending in 1964.  By then, a completely new factor will have to be reckoned with.  We shall, I hope, be in the Common Market and we will be required to comply with the common transport policy to be worked out under the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The common transport policy provided for in the Treaty has not yet been adopted, but, from the various reports and memoranda on transport published by the Community, the general lines of the common transport policy are beginning to emerge.  The over-all aim will be the development <Col N="1242" /> of an efficient transport system throughout the whole Community, capable of satisfying at minimum cost and under the best conditions, the requirements arising from economic expansion within EEC.  The greatest possible degree of competition will be provided for in the transport section. Restrictive practices will have to go and transport undertakings, including the railways, will be expected to compete on even terms.</P>
    <P>There will be no question of general subsidies for transport and our concept of a national public transport undertaking combining road and rail may even have to be modified.  It is clear that the Common Market is going to offer the same challenge to CIE as it does to our other industries.  The same drastic pruning, reorganisation and scrapping of obsolete and restrictive practices will have to be implemented.  It is all the more important, therefore, that the Board of CIE continue with renewed energy their policy of reorganisation and re-shaping of the undertaking, so that it will be in the best possible shape when we do enter the Common Market.  The Board may not, thereafter, have the same opportunity to put their house in order.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that CIE are on the right lines and that no change in the statutory directives to the Board is necessary at this time.  The proposed Bill is a foolish one and completely out of touch with reality.  I have no hesitation in asking the House to reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate, I had expressed my pleasure at the introduction of this <Col N="1243" /> Bill and had mentioned that it was a Bill which had more than mere commercial significance.  It is a Bill which could have considerable social implications for our people as a whole.  One of the most striking features of our economy is the extent to which the savings of our people are invested outside this country.  Our commercial development has, for historical reasons, been retarded in the past.  This Bill could have a very material effect on our prosperity as a whole by encouraging increased investment in home industry.  I think it is not an exaggeration to say that Irish investors, taken by and large, have not got an excess of confidence in Irish public companies.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to estimate how much Irish money is invested outside this country, but it is certain that it runs into hundreds of millions.  By boosting the confidence of Irish investors in our home industries, we can get an expanding market for Irish shares and this is a national need.  For that reason, one of the big considerations that we should have before us in relation to this measure is the need to encourage the small investor to invest here.</P>
      <P>This Bill also gives us an opportunity to ask ourselves in general terms what type of commercial society we wish to create in this country.  The Committee on Company Law Reform had very narrow terms of reference. That Committee, which was a technical one, ignored the considerations of social policy.  It behoves us in this House to ask ourselves and to ask the Minister to consider what are the paramount interests which should be protected by the State in regard to the encouragement and development of joint stock companies, whether the British blueprint is the best one for us.  This Bill is very largely a copy of the British Companies Act of 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can learn a lot by looking at the structure of commercial society in countries other than Great Britain, in smaller countries where conditions more closely resemble the position in this country.  In Germany, for example, it is an established feature of company <Col N="1244" /> law that the workers in heavy industry in that country are entitled to a share in the control of that industry and they have appointees on the boards of directors of public companies operating there.  It is an anomalous feature of our society that a private individual, by spending £100 to buy shares in a public company, can obtain for himself rights in that company, rights of control in its operations not possessed by an individual who may have devoted 25 or 30 years of his life to its service.</P>
    <P>These big issues have not been catered for in this Bill.  They have not been referred to by any of the interests most closely connected with this Bill, but they are issues upon which we should examine our first principles. Again, American company law is in very marked contrast to the conservative structure of British company law. I am not going to attempt to answer the query which I have posed but I would like to see those more able than I address themselves to this problem. There are some features of British industrial law which I would not like to see reproduced on a large scale in this country.</P>
    <P>I admit that there is considerable force in the arguments of those who say that we should adhere closely to the technical provisions of British company law but that does not debar us from postulating our own principles more suited to our situation upon which those technicalities should be based.  It is a fact, moreover, that the British Act upon which this Bill is based is already out of date in Britain. As the Minister said when introducing the Bill, the Jenkins Committee reported in Britain in June of this year recommending several major amendments of existing British law.  I feel that in so far as the recommendations of that committee may suit our purpose, we should anticipate a further British Act.  We have waited a long time for the introduction of this Bill and it is unlikely that we will have another Companies Bill for many years.  For that reason, we shall endeavour to legislate with our eyes on the future. I do not accept the arguments of the Minister that we should wait for the <Col N="1245" /> implementation of Jenkins in Britain before we follow suit in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave adverted to the application of this Bill to those State companies which are registered as joint stock companies under the Companies Acts.  There are certain provisions which in their present form in the Bill are not quite suitable for State companies. I have in mind in particular the provisions relating to investigation because they are particularly relevant to recent developments in this country. An investigation has recently taken place into the operation of one of our State companies and it would appear that the Minister is precluded under present law from making the report of that investigation public.  The public are most closely concerned in the operation of our State companies and it is right and proper that such reports should be made public.  For that purpose, this Bill would need amendment and I hope that during the course of the Committee Stage discussion, the Minister will recognise the force of that point of view.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the need for social objectivity in regard to this matter and I am very happy to see that the Bill enables Irish companies to operate profit-sharing schemes in the form of share ownership schemes for employees. Such schemes of employee share ownership have not been possible under the existing law.  I should like to see more such schemes developed. I should like to see fiscal inducement offered to companies to provide such schemes because it is not enough merely to make them technically feasible as this Bill does.</P>
    <P>In regard to Part II of the Bill, I believe the Minister has made the right decision in declining to interfere in the operations of private companies and I believe he has made the correct departure from the British precedent.  At the same time, we must always bear in mind that the right of limited liability which is conferred on a private company is a very great privilege.  It is one which can be very easily bought.  Many people have suggested that it is a privilege which can be too easily bought and exploited to the disadvantage of suppliers of <Col N="1246" /> goods and of the unwary.  The Bill makes no change in that respect.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill among other matters sets out the powers and duties of directors of public companies. Section 192 requires the disclosure in company accounts of loans made to directors of such companies. I do not think that section goes far enough in this respect.  I think loans to directors of public companies, personal loans to directors in their personal capacity, should be prohibited under this Bill, as is the case in England.  I do not accept the cautious view of the Committee on Company Law Reform in this matter.  If a director of a company is a sound commercial risk, he can borrow his money from the appropriate moneylending organisations&mdash;banks, building societies and so forth.  If he is not, it is an injustice to the shareholders of a public company that he should be permitted to borrow from that company.</P>
    <P>I would, accordingly, urge the Minister to have another look at that section and seriously consider following the British precedent and, in respect of public companies, totally to prohibit such loans to directors.  The argument of the Committee seems to be that there would be ways of circumventing the law, that if it were illegal for a public company to lend money to a director, ways and means could be devised whereby it could be lent to his wife or his family.  To my mind, in so far as the climate of public opinion is measured against such lending, I suggest an embargo should be imposed.</P>
    <P>In the same context, I do not think the provisions of the Bill in relation to the disclosure of nominee shareholders in public companies go far enough. The Bill provides for a separate register to be kept of directors' shareholdings and that this register may be inspected by members of the company. The Cohen Committee in Britain recommended full disclosure of all nominee shareholdings.  I agree that the British Government in 1948 did not implement the Cohen recommendations in full but that was for technical reasons largely and very probably because of the strength and force of <Col N="1247" /> vested interests in Britain.  Such considerations should not apply here.</P>
    <P>I realise that registration in the name of nominees is legitimate commercial practice and is convenient in many places, but the fact remains it can be abused by the unscrupulous, and illegitimate use can be made of information by those who buy company shares in the name of nominees. It can enable, among other things, the take-over of a company by stealth, so to speak.  We read in the papers some time ago of the case where the directors of Gallahers, the tobacco manufacturers, woke up one morning to find a considerable number of their shares were in the hands of another tobacco firm, having been bought in the name of nominees.</P>
    <P>The technical considerations advanced by our Committee here in support of their view that nothing should be done about this matter are, admittedly, considerable, but, to my mind, a means can be devised of compelling disclosure of nominee holdings where they are operated on a large scale.  To compel the holder of more than 10 per cent. of any class of share in a public company should be feasible and was, in fact, recommended by the Jenkins Committee in Great Britain in June of this year.  It is, furthermore, a system which works well in the United States.  That brings me again to the opinion I expressed earlier, that we should not lean over backwards to emulate the British all the time.  There is much which we can learn from practice in other countries.</P>
    <P>Again, on Part 5 of the Bill, very important provisions are contained in Section 184, which gives power to the courts in certain circumstances to restrain certain persons from acting as directors of companies.  Another section prohibits undischarged bankrupts from acting in that capacity.  It includes, I am happy to see, those undischarged bankrupts from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 184 is rather restrictive to that I think the provision should be my mind.  I do not want to go into it in detail at this stage.  Suffice it to say extended.  Companies enjoy considerable <Col N="1248" /> privileges by incorporation and the work of the directors normally takes place behind closed doors.  They should be persons of the utmost integrity. Therefore, persons convicted of any offences involving fraud and dishonesty should be debarred, whether in company proceedings or in other proceedings.  As I see it, Section 184 is confined to persons who are guilty of fraud in connection with company proceedings.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to what I would term this subject of &ldquo;chancey&rdquo; directors, I want to ask the Minister if anything could be done to keep foreign chancers out of our commercial society, as well as British ones and ones from Northern Ireland.  The name of a certain gentleman who engaged in operations in the stamp business immediately occurs to one's mind.  There is nothing in this Bill which will keep the like of the notorious Dr. Singer from trading in this country, unfortunately.  In these days, when national boundaries are rapidly ceasing to have the significance which they once had, it well behoves us to consider whether we can include within the scope of Section 184 and Section 183 persons who have been concerned in bankruptcy proceedings or fraudulent proceedings in countries other than Great Britain.</P>
    <P>It is imperative to protect our commercial reputation.  The Company Law Committee here adverted very strongly to that matter.  The Committee expressed considerable concern and said that our reputation had suffered by reason of some company failures which had taken place in this country. We are a country with an undeveloped commercial tradition and it is very important that this question of integrity should be cherished by us and fostered by the law to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I recognise, of course, that the vast majority of companies are efficiently and honestly managed.  I recognise that the vast majority of company directors are most worthy individuals.  I would be apprehensive that my earlier remarks might give the impression that I thought otherwise, but we in this Bill are catering for those who would be guilty of lapses from grace.  We are <Col N="1249" /> trying to protect in particular the investors.  That brings me to another section of Part 5 which contains the provisions referred to by Deputy Cosgrave in regard to the accounts of companies.  They have to be submitted to their shareholders.</P>
    <P>In this context, most of the remarks which I have to make relate to public companies.  I recognise that the position of private companies is a very different matter.  The Bill is going to require much greater disclosure of information to shareholders than has been customary in the past. I welcome that.  I think it is true to say that the accountancy profession, chambers of commerce and the commercial interests as a whole welcome this.  Sometimes appeals for a full disclosure are met by the remark that it is none of the inquirer's business. Part of the risk of loss is borne by persons other than the shareholders. It is borne by the customers and by the creditors.</P>
    <P>There are, perhaps, still some few directors who hanker after the old days when it was not necessary to submit accounts to shareholders at all.  Objection to full disclosure was on the ground that shareholders might not know what to do with the information when they got it.  There was resistance to inquiry because there were not very many black sheep.  Such an attitude is, to my mind, dangerous by reason of the fact that there is still in some quarters a lingering suspicion of directors and companies as a whole.  Anything that can be done to allay that suspicion should be done.  The essential feature of the accounting provisions in this Bill is the provision of fuller information to shareholders and, most particularly, the disclosure of reserves, directors' remuneration, the cost of company property and the depreciation provided in regard to assets.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part 5 in that respect are quite onerous.  They are not as onerous as I should like to see them but I admit they are quite onerous.  Certain companies are exempted from the operation of these provisions&mdash;banks and insurance companies. <Col N="1250" /> The view is that, by reason of their very special position, there is a very great need to maintain public confidence in the banks and that they should be permitted to carry on in the future as in the past.</P>
    <P>There is a further provision in this respect which I do not like at all. The Minister is taking to himself in this Bill the right to exempt from this full disclosure any such class of companies as he may choose to grant this privilege to from time to time.  I do not think it is right or proper that the Minister should be in the invidious position of picking on any class of companies and exempting them from this disclosure required of public companies as a whole.  There are highly exceptional circumstances which apply to banks and insurance companies.  I am at a complete loss to visualise what further classes of companies the Minister has in mind.  Indeed, I go so far as to say that it might create an opportunity for exercising a particularly objectionable form of patronage.</P>
    <P>This power to exempt further classes of companies from the disclosure provisions exists in Britain under the 1948 Act.  It is a power which is exercised by the Minister by making an order.  That power has been exercised by the Board of Trade in respect of only one class of company &mdash;shipping companies engaged in foreign trade.  The Jenkins Committee last June recommended that the privilege should be withdrawn from shipping companies.  So we are going to find ourselves in the position that this power will not be availed of at all in Britain and I am not aware of any need for it here or of any demand for it by those who are closely concerned in the operation of joint stock companies here.</P>
    <P>I said that the provisions of this Bill are already regarded as being out of date in Britain and in regard to these disclosure provisions, Jenkins has made some very fundamental recommendations which I urge the Minister to incorporate in the Bill.  If we want to boost the confidence of the Irish investing public in our companies, it is imperative that we should expect of our public companies the <Col N="1251" /> fullest standard of disclosure implemented elsewhere.  There may be in this country, indeed, greater need for disclosure than is the case in Britain.  For that reason, I urge the Minister to implement the recommendations contained in paragraph 397 of Jenkins which, among other matters, require public companies to disclose turnover or total sales.</P>
    <P>I think the figure of total sales of any company is a very fundamental and basic figure, the trend of which, considered over a period of years, can be very informative and revealing to shareholders and investors.  Jenkins has recommended provision of a five-year summary of turnover and of certain basic information on this question of results.  Considered over a period of years, to assess the trend of results is something which is very significant to investors and the provision of such information which can be provided at no great inconvenience would be very well worth while.</P>
    <P>I can see that there would be cases where disclosure of turnover might be detrimental to a company for unique reasons but, as a general rule, I think there should be provision in the Bill for disclosure of turnover and the provision of a five-year summary of results, which would include dividends and profits before and after taxation, to shareholders.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to accounts, in which naturally I am more interested than in other sections of the Bill, there is, as the Minister will be aware, a considerable problem in regard to the value of fixed assets.  These are days of very rapid inflation and the problem of accounting for inflationary changes is a very controversial one.  It is right and proper that in this respect we should adhere to orthodox practice but I seriously suggest to the Minister that in regard to the provisions in the Sixth Schedule, which sets out the accounting procedure in detail, some of those provisions, in paragraph 5 in particular, are so qualified as to lose much of their force, that is, in relation to the value of a company's fixed assets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> The cost of a property 50 years ago means very little nowadays.  I am not saying that the accounts of public companies should be governed by a provision for compulsory revaluation of fixed assets but it would be very useful and helpful to all concerned if accounts were to have appended to them a note estimating the replacement cost of fixed assets.  As to assessing the adequacy of provision for depreciation, which is a very important matter, I think it would be very useful if public companies were obliged to disclose to their shareholders the amount of wear and tear allowances allowed by the revenue authorities for tax purposes as a check upon depreciation provisions.  I cannot see that it would operate to any company's disadvantage and I think it is an item of information which would be most useful to the investing public and to shareholders.</P>
    <P>I suggest&mdash;and the Minister, as a lawyer himself, will be able to say whether I am right or wrong&mdash;that it is at present the case that the financial editors of our daily papers are circumscribed in the extent to which they can provide financial comment.  Frank Press comment on the operation of public companies is an invaluable guide for shareholders who nowadays are mostly small investors who need professional guidance.  In other countries, the Press can carry out a very salutary function in that regard. That function should be encouraged by giving the Press a form of qualified privilege and freeing it from undue fears of the law of libel in criticising boards and, if necessary, exposing unsound commercial practices.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the winding up of companies.  I welcome the increased powers which the Bill is giving to creditors in voluntary windings-up. Like other speakers, I want to refer to Section 285 which deals with the preferential rights of the State in such windings-up.  Despite the recommendations of the Company Law Reform Committee that the State, except in one small respect, should be put on a par with other unsecured creditors, the Minister has not gone the whole way with the Committee.  As Deputy Cosgrave has already said, in those <Col N="1253" /> cases where the Bill departs from the recommendations of the Committee, we are entitled to ask the Minister why.</P>
    <P>The Bill does remove the undesirable provisions of the Finance Act of 1924 which gave very sweeping rights to the State, but the Minister is retaining the right to the State to collect one year's income tax in preference to the claims of unsecured creditors.  I believe that provision will continue to work harshly against unsecured creditors and in that respect we must remember that there is a consideration applying in this country which does not apply in Britain, that is, that unsecured creditors here can be very small traders, whereas in Britain, with all its wealthy companies, most commercial concerns are accustomed to writing off bad debts, but the collapse of a firm with which a small trader has been doing business can spell ruination.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would urge the Minister to have another look at Section 285 and implement the Committee's recommendation in that respect in its entirety. I shall have more to say about Section 285 on Committee Stage; suffice it to say here that I am very happy to see that the Minister has included holiday remuneration as a preferential right for workers.  I would ask the Minister to use his influence with other Departments of State to see that they will not endeavour to throw over the preferential payments set out in this Bill, particularly the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>The Seventh Schedule sets out the matters to be expressly stated in the auditor's report.  We are again in the position that Jenkins has recommended a simpler form of auditor's report in Britain than is provided for in this Schedule.  Jenkins has done that at the behest of the English and Scottish Institutes of Chartered Accountants.  My view is that the essential duty of the auditor is to report to the shareholders of a company whether or not, in his opinion, the accounts are true and fair.  To arrive at an opinion, he applies his professional <Col N="1254" /> skill in examining the accounts. Having done that, he ought not to be required to do more than report his opinion, with such reservations as may be necessary.  It ought not be necessary to specify those matters of detail on which the auditor has satisfied himself on reaching his opinion.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he was imposing increased and very stiff fines and penalties for breaches of this Bill. I do not know whether one would regard £100 as a stiff penalty for a grave infringement.  I have run through the Bill quickly and a £100 fine seems to be the standard penalty.  On the assumption that we will not have another Companies Bill for many years I have been wondering if a section should not be incorporated which would give the Minister the right at any future date to stiffen the penalties by order, if he felt so disposed.</P>
      <P>In regard to filing the annual return of private companies, the annual summary, it is a fact that the average procedure is that if one examines a file in the Castle, one finds that the annual return is two or three years out of date.  I would urge the Minister, having given an extended time for the filing of the annual return, to see that the law is adhered to by the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to point to what I regard as a rather important matter.  In Britain, very important extra-statutory controls are imposed on public companies by the Council of the London Stock Exchange, imposed on those public companies whose shares are quoted on the London Stock Exchange, and that means most of the important British companies.  If I might give an example of one such control and apply its relevancy to this country, I would cite the case of a certain Irish public company which a year ago announced an increased dividend and immediately its shares increased substantially in price on the stock exchange.  It announced the dividend without making an announcement of what its profits were, a preliminary dividend announcement.  When the accounts came out, it was seen that the profits for the year had not in fact increased <Col N="1255" /> and, properly speaking, the price of the shares should not have jumped as it did on the stock exchange.  In Britain, the London Stock Exchange requires all public companies to make a preliminary statement of their profits and their dividend proposals.  Both must be done at the same time, so that if a company announces that it is going to increase its dividends, the shareholders will be informed through the Press whether or not that increased dividend is matched by increased profits.</P>
    <P>That is a very fundamental and basic control and one which serves a very useful purpose.  As far as I know, it is obligatory for such announcements to be made on a certain fixed date, a date fixed by reference to the end of the company's year and the announcement must be made whether or not the audit has been completed.  It can be made as a provisional announcement, subject to audit.  It ensures that information as to the reason is, through the Press, in the hands of the shareholders and the investing public at the earliest possible date, before people in the know can make out of their information.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill goes very much further, the Minister should get together with the Dublin Stock Exchange and ask them about these matters.  He should ask them if they would consider imposing here those necessary controls which are imposed by the London Stock Exchange in Britain.  If the Dublin Stock Exchange declines to do that, the Minister should for himself consider the necessity of incorporating such controls into the Bill.  It is better that controls of that nature should be by the stock exchange. In that way, they would be more elastic.  If they fail to conform to the best modern practice in other countries, the Minister should act accordingly.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Bill does not provide any age limit for directors of public companies as in Britain.  For my part, I think that is a good thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to endorse Deputy Cosgrave's commendation of the members <Col N="1256" /> of the Company Law Reform Committee, who did very useful service for the economy of the country in the examination they made of the subject and the report they prepared. I had intended to pay this tribute, at a later stage and perhaps it might be more appropriate at the end of our deliberations.  Nevertheless, it is only right that I should now support Deputy Cosgrave's commendation.</P>
      <P>In that connection also, I should mention the services given by Mr. Justice Kenny, who, at the suggestion of Deputy John Costello when Taoiseach, was invited by the then Attorney-General to act as honorary secretary of the Committee.  When the Committee had finished its deliberations and taken all the evidence, unfortunately the chairman of the Committee died and Mr. Kenny, as he then was, undertook the preparation of the report.  Subsequently, before his appointment to the Bench, he went to considerable pains in the drafting of this Bill.  He had not completed it when he was appointed to the Bench, but found time to do so subsequently. I feel, therefore, I ought to associate with the commendation of the Committee commendation of Mr. Justice Kenny's services in that regard.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies who spoke have observed, this is rather a technical Bill, one on which comment would perhaps be more appropriate during the course of the Committee Stage.  I am glad the House is agreeable generally to my suggestion that the Committee Stage should be entrusted to a Special Committee of the House.  I may, however, comment on some of the observations that were made during the course of the debate.  Incidentally, I should like to say to the Deputies who have spoken I was gratified by the close study they made of the Bill.  Obviously, they prepared themselves well for the Second Stage.  I hope that, when the Committee Stage will have concluded, the Bill will be in a much better form and will be a much better instrument to serve the purpose it is desired to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into all the points raised, but I will just mention a few.  Deputy Cosgrave suggested there <Col N="1257" /> were some restrictions about the issue of redeemable shares.  Under the existing law, private as well as public companies may issue redeemable preference shares.  The new provision is that public companies whose shares are quoted on the stock exchange may, in addition to issuing redeemable preference shares, redeem shares that were issued as irredeemable shares before the 1959 Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked to what extent State companies were covered by the provisions of the Bill.  State corporations, as, for example, the ESB, are outside the scope of the Bill.  Other state companies, such as those referred to by Deputy Byrne&mdash; companies promoted by the State under the Companies Act&mdash;are subject to all the requirements and provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also asked why the recommendations of the Law Reform Committee on the issue of shares of no par value were not accepted.  I dealt with this to some extent in my introductory remarks and the reasons are also fully set out in page 6 of the explanatory memorandum published with the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the points Deputy Cosgrave suggested, and one on which we can meet him, is his suggestion of setting out the numbers and identities of the sections of the 1908 Bill in relation to the current Bill.  That will be done and will be available to the members of the Special Committee, when appointed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to the possibility of there being introduced here unit trusts which are in operation in Britain and, to some extent, in the Six Counties.  There are no obstacles here to the establishment of such unit trusts.  We have no legislation dealing with them; but if any abuses emerge in the future that would require to be covered by legislation, I do not think we will have any difficulty in introducing the necessary legislation.  In the meantime, it is not easy to make provision against happenings in the future, the extent of which and the repercussions of which are not apparent to us at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne made a number of <Col N="1258" /> suggestions.  In the main, I think, he followed to some extent the recommendations in the report of the Jenkins Committee in Britain.  He observed that by reason of these recommendations, some of the provisions of this Bill are already out of date.  The evidence as adduced before that Committee was available to us during the course of the preparation of the Bill.  It was easy for the officers of my Department and the other experts who were consulted to anticipate, as a result of that evidence, many of the recommendations of the Jenkins Committee.  We were in a position to assess to what extent they would be suited to conditions here. Some of them were accepted as suited to our conditions and some we regarded as unsuited.  For that reason, I do not think the fact that the Jenkins Committee report was published after many of the provisions of this Bill had been drafted is an indication that any part of this Bill is already out of date.  In any event, to the extent that we find some of the recommendations of the Jenkins report are suitable for us and are not at variance with the provisions of this Bill, it will be an easy matter to introduce amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also suggested that we were incorporating in this Bill a power that the Jenkins Committee suggested should be excluded in the British law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be misinterpreting what the Deputy said. However, as I understood him, he said that the Jenkins Committee had reported on shipping companies, which were the only group of companies permitted not to disclose reserves, and that that permission was withdrawn from that group.  That does not mean that the power of non-disclosure was withdrawn completely.  The President of the Board of Trade still has that power vested in him.</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggested that I ought to take power to increase penalties.  Whatever about taking powers to make regulations providing for the better operation of the Bill, for the better presentation of accounts under the Bill, I doubt if the Deputy's Party would be too happy if I had powers to increase penalties in legislation that is already there.  Nonetheless, the £100 fines to which the Deputy referred are fines in cases that are brought under summary jurisdiction. In the more serious cases, which will be brought on indictment, there are much more severe penalties, not only by way of fine but also by way of imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I do not think at this stage I need go into any other details except to thank the Deputies who commended the Bill and who obviously realise that an immense volume of work had to be put into its preparation.  I think Deputies will agree with me that, having regard to the length of time&mdash; which was not very long, in the circumstances&mdash;since the Committee on Law Reform was set up, that it took to bring the Bill to the House, that I was quite right in not waiting until such time as the Jenkins recommendations were implemented in Britain.  I felt that to delay further would be a serious matter for us.  At the stage that the Jenkins Committee had reported, I had the bulk of this Bill in my possession and I was not going to release it again in case I might not see it for a long number of months afterwards. To the extent that there are recommendations that would suit our system in the Jenkins Commission report, we will naturally have an opportunity of dealing with them in Committee.</P>

      <P>I was referring last night to the various points raised by Deputies, when progress was reported.  Deputies Donegan, Corish, Davern and, indeed, a big number of Deputies referred to the reduction in the amount of money available for urban schemes.  As I explained in my opening statement, there is a substantial reduction&mdash; almost 10 per cent.&mdash;in the number of unemployment assistance recipients in urban areas.  There was a reduction of £27,000 in the provision this year compared with last year, a reduction of almost 10 per cent.  As will be seen the reduction in the funds made available is, for all practical purposes, proportionate to the reduction in the number of unemployment assistance recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> Deputy Corish admitted in his statement that it would cost millions to provide employment for every unemployed person in urban areas.  With the call on the public purse, an approach of that kind, admittedly, is just not realistic.  Take Dublin as an example.  These are astonishing figures and possibly may cause an amount of comment.  In my opinion, the system of unemployment relief, as envisaged in latter years, will require to be radically organised and much serious thinking will have to take place.  In Dublin, it costs between £35 and £40 per week to give one unemployment assistance recipient one week's employment.</P>

      <P>If there were 2,500 unemployment recipients in January, <Col N="1263" /> it means an expenditure of £5,000,000, as a shot estimate, and that will give Deputies an idea of what is involved. These people who get 12 weeks' work in one year are in receipt of unemployment assistance for the remainder of the year.  Of course, that does not happen in the other areas.  It does not happen in Cork or Limerick.  It is a godsend for an unemployment assistant recipient to get that twelve weeks' work, particularly around Christmas time.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the solution of the problem would be.  I know that the Minister for Local Government is aware of the position and he has invited me to have informal discussions with him to see what changes we can work out.  I had in mind a scheme but it might cause a certain amount of disturbance or anxiety in trade union circles.  However, if it is to cost £2,000 to put an unemployed man to work for one year, instead of having him working with the pick on what is not, at times, very productive work, I would prefer, with the co-operation of the trade unions, to see some of these very adaptable young men trained at some trade of a skilled or semi-skilled nature which might be of good use to them at some time.  That suggestion has not been examined.  At the moment it is a very vague proposition.</P>

It will not be decided by us here tonight but it will have to be decided by you and me and others in co-operation.

      <P>I wanted to say something more about the method being employed in Dublin so as to have it on the record but I do not appear to have it here.  Deputy Donegan mentioned the limited amount of employment given on Road Fund work as compared with previous years, having regard to the increased cost of machinery.  I am not dealing with the Local Government Road Fund; I am dealing with the comparatively small amount devoted to the Employment Schemes Office.  Deputy Donegan may be right in saying that less employment is now available but I would draw the attention of Deputies to the increase in Dublin from £80,000 to £400,000. Similar increases have taken place in a number of other centres.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the position in Drogheda regarding Road Fund employment.  In 1960-61, including main road improvements and upkeep, the amount allocated to Drogheda was £5,184.  This year, Drogheda got £25,000 for the reconstruction of West Street on the main Dublin to Belfast road and the total amount which Drogheda got is £30,627.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The labour content of that would be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1960-61, the contribution from the Road Fund was £700 and the local contribution was £800.  In 1961-62, the contribution was £4,750 and the local contribution was £800.  Whatever about any other place <Col N="1265" /> having a &ldquo;crib&rdquo;, Drogheda did not do too badly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to the date on which the census of employment is taken whereby these figures are based on three weeks in January.  He questioned that position.  In our experience, the incidence of unemployment is greatest in that period. Apparently there are special circumstances in Wexford where during a particular period in the summer, when work evidently is slack, the number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance is higher than in January. That is a statistical phenomenon.  I do not exactly know what the explanation is.</P>
      <P>In fact, the Special Employment Schemes Office do not provide employment in respect of unemployed persons in urban areas.  It is only persons in receipt of unemployment assistance who are catered for and the monthly statistics available do not give separate figures for all the different areas which qualify for these grants.  Therefore, a special census would have to be taken, the preparation of which, and its tabulation, would take a considerable time.  A census taken later than January would delay the allocation of the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of rural improvements schemes, reference was made by several Deputies to delays in submitting such schemes.  Deputy Tully complained about such delays, which hold up the apportionment of the money available.  I can tell the Deputy now that the amount of money available is notified to the local authorities in the last week of July or the first week of August usually, and that gives local authorities a number of months in which to prepare the necessary schemes.  These schemes are administered through the Department of Local Government and I shall certainly see whether it is possible to have the allocations notified to local authorities at an earlier date.  I shall bring Deputy Tully's complaint to the notice of the Minister for Local Government.  I would say that some of the delays could be overcome if members of local authorities urged county and city managers and their officials <Col N="1266" /> to prepare these schemes on time. After all, it is not such a hard job. Local authorities do not get all that much money to spend on these schemes and surely it is not too much to ask that such schemes, involving such small amounts of money, be prepared on time.</P>

      <P>Deputy P. J. Burke and others spoke about the time of year in which this work is carried out in urban areas.  Deputy Burke seemed to think it would be desirable to have these works carried out in a period other than winter so that better value could be got for the money spent.  I would point out to him that we must bear in mind the purpose of these schemes and be realistic about it.  We must appreciate that it is in winter the greatest hardship falls on the unemployed. These moneys are primarily intended for relief of these unfortunate unemployed people and I feel sure that, accepting such a position, Deputies will agree that the winter period is the most desirable time in which to provide such work.  We are all agreed that if we were catering for productive work, the summer time would be the best time in which to do it.  We shall, however, keep these matters under continuous investigation and bring about any variations and improvements we think necessary.</P>
      <P>In the same context, I would point out that people who are drawing unemployment assistance are doing so only after public investigation of their circumstances.  I believe it is generally accepted this is the fairest kind of check that can be kept on cases of hardship and consequently on the recruitment of employees under these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of minor improvement schemes, Deputy Geoghegan referred to the method by which <Col N="1267" /> selection is made.  He asked who picked out the schemes and how they were decided upon.  The amount of grants available in respect of these schemes is determined by the number of individuals in receipt of unemployment assistance in a particular electoral division.  With the sum available fixed within the limit of the £130,000 available under the appropriate subhead, the Special Employments Schemes Office examine the reports in respect of such matters as accommodation roads within each electoral division.  The scheme selected is always, in the view of that Office, the most urgently required in the area, having regard both to cost and to the amount of money available.</P>
    <P>Of course, I do not expect that all decisions on selections by the Office will meet with the approval of Deputies at all times.  Perhaps a Deputy will have made representations about a certain road he thought should be done and another road is done instead. It is impossible to satisfy every Deputy and every public representative in every case, but if I am given precise particulars about suggested wrong selections, I shall certainly look into the circumstances and if I find an injustice has been done, I shall try to rectify it.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will give my Office the details of these, they will be examined.  Deputy Geoghegan referred to the fact that in Connemara sand and gravel are carried into districts <Col N="1268" /> from 20 miles away when local materials could be used.  The Deputy must admit there are many areas in Connemara where suitable finishing material is just not available.  Is that not right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of Gaeltacht schemes carried out by the Special Employment Schemes Office on behalf of the Department of the Gaeltacht and in some rural employment schemes in that area, where substantial contributions have been collected, it is desirable to do a good finishing job on these roads so that they will be put into good order and condition to enable the county council to take them over and maintain them.  It is quite true that in a number of these cases, the engineers of the Special Employment Schemes Office have found it necessary to haul gravel long distances. If the Deputy will let me know where we can get as good type of gravel and sand nearer, I will be very happy to see that we draw from that pit.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the money used in reconstructing the roads to a final finish is invariably spent in the immediate locality where materials of a suitable type are easily available.  In the case of the minor employment schemes, the limited money available in many instances does not permit the Special Employment Schemes Office to do a very good job.  Where the beneficiaries desire a better standard job undertaken, the rural employment scheme is available to them for a relatively small contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the odd difficult farmer who refuses to sign the consent form. I referred to this problem in my remarks last night.  Where this Office repair existing roads to their present width and where there is no widening or other serious interference with <Col N="1269" /> a man's property, this Office are prepared to go ahead, notwithstanding the fact that one difficult man refuses to give his consent to the proposal. However, where widening is involved which would cause serious interference to a man's property, we would be open to a charge of trespass if we proceeded without the consent of the owner of the property.  Generally speaking, only about one per cent. of the cases dealt with under minor employment, bog development and rural improvement schemes create this kind of problem.  In many cases, the local clergyman and other influential people have succeeded in getting the objections withdrawn.  It is not too common a complaint.  We try to effect an amicable settlement in most instances.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taking over of schemes by county councils, nearly everyone who contributed to the debate referred to the rural improvement schemes for which, as I indicated in my opening remarks, a provision of £225,000 was made&mdash;an increase of £25,000 on last year's Estimate.  Most Deputies referred to the desirability of county councils taking over these roads when completed under the rural improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to a figure of £210,000 for County Louth which was the amount of money required to bring all the accommodation roads in Louth up to a standard which would enable the county council to maintain them subsequently.  The Local Government Act of 1953 enables county councils to take over for maintenance any road of public utility.  It was never envisaged under that Act that the State would provide the funds necessary to bring these roads up to county council standards.  Deputies who were then in the House will recall the clear case made in respect of that Bill that all the county councils wanted was the power to take over the roads and they would provide the money, not all the money.  The sum of £210,000 was the estimated full cost of bringing the roads in a small county like Louth to a proper standard.  Meath County Council has gone a long way towards providing <Col N="1270" /> the necessary funds.  Meath, as we know, is one of the richest counties in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be as rich as Louth, acre for acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the richest counties.  They have gone a long distance towards providing the necessary funds and they deserve every credit but there are many other areas in the country where the cost to the rates of doing this would be prohibitive. Even a comparatively small annual programme could mount up the county rates appreciably over a period of years.  Even a ten-year programme could become quite substantial.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that the rural improvement scheme was not designed to relieve county councils of the burden of improving such roads at all.  Its purpose was and is to assist farmers to carry out their responsibilities for the upkeep of farm and accommodation roads which are used by them daily.  It is therefore a fundamental condition of the rural improvement schemes that the farmers themselves must pay the appropriate relatively small contribution.  This contribution is scaled in accordance with the average rateable valuation of the land served and, as will be seen from the statement circulated by me with my Estimate speech, the grant goes as high as 90 per cent. of the cost and is available to farmers whose land valuation does not exceed £7, and so on <i>pro rata.</i> Between £25 and £50, for instance, farmers are asked to pay one-quarter and the State provides the other three-quarters.</P>
      <P>I should like to commend to the attention of Deputies the approach of Deputy W. Murphy from Clare on this problem.  I think he said there should be more appreciation by the farmers of the generous grants made available under rural improvement schemes.  He advised that everybody should not look for full cost grants for everything. That is a recommendation I particularly endorse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested the county councils should be enabled to contribute towards rural improvement <Col N="1271" /> scheme grants.  From what I already said, Deputies will understand that county councils cannot be permitted to make the contribution which farmers are required to make under the conditions of the scheme.  The beneficiaries must make the contribution themselves but where county council property is concerned, such as council cottages or cemeteries, if they are at the end of a byroad or a link road, or half way up it, we are prepared to accept a contribution from the county council.</P>

      <P>The hearse cannot be going over bumps and potholes.  We accept in those instances.  In the case of cottages, we accept contributions from the councils.  I presume these will be non-vested cottages.  We permit them to pay a reasonable share of the contribution.</P>
      <P>This is an important point about which several Deputies have written to me or asked for information.  What are the rules and regulations about county councils taking over roads on which we carry out work under the scheme?  Generally, most councils are now prepared to take over for maintenance accommodation roads which are put in good repair under a rural improvement scheme, assuming that the farmer beneficiaries have put up the necessary contribution.  We welcome that development.  This is particularly the case in the counties of which I have a note here, Galway, Roscommon, Cork, Tipperary, Kildare and Kilkenny.  In Counties Galway and Cork, we have a standing arrangement with the councils to notify them when we are doing a rural improvement scheme there, and they before it can fall into disrepair, take it over. We have that type of liaison.</P>

      <P>We are grateful for it also because, as it happens, the standard of work in all instances carried out by this Office was not and is not so &ldquo;hot&rdquo;.  There is no point in <Col N="1272" /> my opinion, in throwing loads of sand or gravel into potholes and having a contractor coming along to do it when it is gone in a week's time.  As far as I can see, this Office brings the roads up to quite a good standard when they have the co-operation of the county council.  That is as it should be.  What amazes me about this Office is that I see in the file, in answering Dáil Questions, that contributions were made to the same road twice or three or four times, in certain instances.  I think the economics of that would be that if a proper job were done in the first place, it would be far more beneficial and if a leaf were taken from these county councils I mentioned by other county councils&mdash;I do not see Limerick mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilbride interjected to say the grant applies only to that part of the road that goes through his land.  The type of road Deputy MacCarthy has in mind is a road possibly linking two other roads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise in this case.  If it goes through the land of ten people, they can fall back on the rural improvements scheme and contribute, but this is the isolated case of one person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There was quite a lot of comment about giving employment to the beneficiaries.  People said: &ldquo;All right; if a group of farmers come together to make the local contribution to the cost, they should be employed, if they are in need of employment.&rdquo; I think it was Deputy Reynolds who suggested that the preference at present being given to people in receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit is unfair to the contributors who made the scheme possible.  This is a problem that has arisen repeatedly over the years.  It is generally accepted that as it is the State which provides the greater portion of the money&mdash;in some instances up to 90 per cent. of the cost&mdash;it is not unreasonable for the State to insist that people who are unemployed and whose hardship is such that it is necessary to pay State money for their upkeep should get preference in employment on these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> After all, the farmers benefit in the form of improved access to their holdings from the relatively small contributions which they are asked to make, and to suggest that, in addition, they should be employed on the work, to the exclusion of their worse-off immediate neighbours is not a proposition which will commend itself to the House generally.  I think we should leave the method of employing people on these schemes as it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry and other Deputies referred to link roads and the difficulty of getting farmers to make the necessary contributions.  I should like to point out that in the case of link roads with substantial outside usage, this Office is prepared to give increased grants.  Indeed, there were one or two cases in the past two months in circumstances exactly similar to those cited by Deputy Corry where we did give increased grants and we are prepared to do so again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Deputy Crinion complained that the money available in some cases did not serve every turf producer.  The bog development scheme was never intended to drain every individual turf bank in the country.  The drains which are done under the bog development scheme are in the main outlet drains in the bog and these runner drains, as they are called, that lead from this outlet to the individual banks, and it is accepted generally that those runner drains are the responsibility of the farmers cutting on those banks.  Deputy MacCarthy referred to the unsuitable time of inspection of some of the small rivers going into the sea by officers of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  If it happened that an officer did look at an area in flood conditions, he would go back, and he has gone back, when the flood has subsided before submitting his report and recommendations.  Deputy <Col N="1276" /> MacCarthy complained that the Cork inspections are done from Tralee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, it must go to Tralee first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I checked up on that since last night and I see that the senior engineer in charge of Cork and Kerry is located in Tralee.  But the Special Employment Schemes Office have an engineer in Bantry and he does most of the Cork area.  The bulk of the work under the minor employment schemes, the bog development schemes and the rural improvement schemes, is done in the Kerry and West Cork areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilhawley referred to the small allocation for Sligo.  Sligo gets its proportionate share in relation to the number of unemployment assistance recipients from the urban employment schemes allocation.  It got two small grants for Ballymote and Tubbercurry and also it got its share under the minor employment subhead, totalling over £7,000.  Sligo did not do so well under the rural improvements scheme, due to the fact that the farmers have not taken advantage of the terms of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In regard to delays in inspecting rural improvement schemes, I explained at the outset of my introductory speech that there have been delays, owing to the fact that we have not got sufficient engineering inspectors. That is the whole trouble.  A competition was held by the Civil Service Commissioners to fill the vacancies which exist at present and I hope to have them filled in the near future, when it will be possible to overtake the arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give my personal opinion on this question of engineers and recruitment.  Until such time as there is uniformity of salaries among the Office of Public Works, the Electricity Supply Board and other State bodies, as well as the Department of Local Government and local authorities, as well as uniformity of increments, pensions and conditions generally, it is inevitable that there will be upsets.  It is heartbreaking for an office like the Office of Public <Col N="1277" /> Works to train a brilliant young engineer who stays with us for perhaps five or six years, who shows promise and gets tremendous experience, who is drawing £X from us and who perhaps becomes engaged to be married or gets married.  As he is human, if he sees an advertisement for a position in Tipperary North Riding which offers £230 more than he has, he will apply for it and it is very hard to blame him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the cause of all the trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy agrees with me because that point struck me.  As I say, you cannot blame him for taking this job at £200 or £300 extra, but it does mean upset. If you had this uniformity, an engineer, an architect, an accountant, or any professional man in our Office or any other State office, could continue to make his career in that office or Department instead of running from us down to Tipperary, or from Tipperary back to the crack organisation that pays the crack salaries, the ESB.  It is all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the small existing engineering staff we have inspecting rural improvement schemes.  A considerable effort has been made by this staff to reduce the arrears.  The figure was approximately 1,200 on 1st April and it has been brought down to 686 on 1st November.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy McLaughlin, referred to delays in inspecting.  Notwithstanding the inevitable delays, I should mention for Deputy McLaughlin's information that 114 schemes, costing nearly £19,000, were sanctioned for Leitrim in 1961-62, representing approximately one-eleventh of the total money for the whole country.  In the current year, 62 schemes, costing £15,000, have been approved for Leitrim, so that county has not done badly this year either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy referred to the <Col N="1278" /> Clonakilty pier.  If this is a small pier which could be put right for £3,000 or £4,000, we would be prepared to consider an application for its improvement. We will put up 75 per cent.  of the cost if the Cork County Council put up the remaining 25 per cent. and maintain it thereafter.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to deal with the points raised by Deputies but inevitably I have omitted some.  Any representation on these various matters which any Deputy might like to make to me will have my personal attention.  When the printed report of the debate is available, I shall go through it in detail and send each Deputy concerned a note about any of the points I have missed.  In addition, I shall write in more detail to the Deputies concerned in connection with anything I have referred to here to-night.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to thank Deputies on both sides for their kind co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants. </P>
      <P>The total provision in my Department's Estimate for the current financial year is £6,061,340.  There is a net increase of £572,880 on the corresponding provision in the last financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief increases are a grant of £200,000 to supplement the Road Fund; a sum of £155,000 representing the increase in the provision necessary to be made for recoupment of loan <Col N="1279" /> charges in respect of housing; and an increase of £100,000 in the provision for private housing grants.</P>
    <P>The total of grants and subsidies for housing now stands at £4,846,000.  In association with the expenditure of voted moneys, there is a steady rise in capital issues for housing purposes, which were just over £6,000,000 in 1961-62 and will probably exceed £7,000,000 this year.  The total sum to be provided for housing in the current year is therefore about £12,000,000, comprising almost £5,000,000 in grants and subsidies and £7,000,000 in capital issues.</P>
    <P>The volume of private housing now exceeds the output of local authority housing.  An increasing number of people find it possible with the assistance of the Housing Acts to provide their own houses.  This tendency is to be welcomed but I would also welcome a further increase in the output of local authorities.  The number of houses in progress last September was 2,502 dwellings as compared with 2,230 on the same date last year and I hope that there will be a corresponding increase in the number of houses completed this year as compared with 1961-62.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have done a good job on housing over the years.  By and large they have attained their post-war objectives by eliminating the back log of urban slum conditions and carried out a substantial programme of cottage building in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>There remains a substantial volume of unfit and overcrowded housing in the county health districts.  I think it would be true to say that a large portion of this type of bad housing relates to people who are either unable or unwilling to re-house themselves and whose names and housing conditions have not been on record.  This particular problem could not therefore be tackled without up-to-date information. Last year I mentioned the steps that were taken to have local authorities carry out comprehensive surveys in their areas so that new programmes could be prepared to eliminate the remaining unfit housing conditions.  I <Col N="1280" /> mentioned also that progress with the surveys had been slow and I stressed the importance of completing them so that the location and extent of the problem could be adequately gauged and a comprehensive programme formulated accordingly.  These surveys have not yet been fully completed but sufficient information is now available to show the general types of problems which remain to be solved.  So far as new legislation can assist their solution the Dáil has already approved of the Bill relating to grants and loans for private housing.  A Bill to supplement and improve the existing legislation relating to the housing functions of the local authorities is under consideration.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on grants towards private enterprise housing in the last financial year fell short of the amount provided by about £200,000.  This was due to some special difficulties which arose during the year which it is hoped will not recur.  Cement was in short supply from April to June 1961 owing to the strike that occurred in that period.  We had difficulties in recruiting and maintaining an adequate staff of housing inspectors.  Finally we had abnormally severe weather conditions during the Winter.  By increasing the voted provision for grants by £100,000 we propose therefore in effect to spend £300,000 more this year than last year. The staffing difficulties of 1961 have been solved and I expect that grant applicants will be given a satisfactory service in the present year.  Grant applications of all types in 1961-62 were approximately 22,000, being 18 per cent.  higher than those of the previous year and reaching the highest level ever experienced.  New house grant allocations rose by 3 per cent.  while reconstruction, repair and improvement grants rose by 22 per cent.  on the previous year.  The allocations for the provision of water and sewerage facilities in private houses in rural areas increased by more than 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>With the development of the co-operative group system for the provision of private water supplies, I anticipate still further increases in payments for these grants this year. <Col N="1281" /> Up to now 18 group water supply schemes covering 313 houses have been completed and 768 schemes to serve 12,000 houses approximately are at various stages of planning and development.</P>
    <P>The Estimate contains a provision of £475,000 for contribution towards loan charges of local authorities in respect of sanitary services works. This represents an increase of £50,000 on the provision for the previous financial year.  Local authority activity for the provision, extension and improvement of water supply and sewerage services throughout the country continues to quicken.  There was an increase of £500,000 in the draws on loans for sanitary services schemes in 1961-62 as compared with 1960-61.  The rate of expansion of the programme in the current and future years should, however, show a much higher rate of increase.  Schemes at the contract and later stages at present represent work to a total value of over £11 million.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary for me to refer again this year in any detail to the advantages of piped water supplies from the point of view of public health, agricultural efficiency, domestic comfort and tourist and industrial developments.  There is general agreement on the desirability of promoting something tantamount to a revolution in rural conditions so far as sanitary services are concerned.  There has been some argument about ways and means. I was credited, quite mistakenly, with the intention of solving the whole problem by means of regional water supplies.  The misunderstanding probably arose out of my desire to have county councils survey their areas in order to establish, on a basis of ascertained fact, what means or combination of means, would be the most suitable and economical for servicing the different areas.</P>
    <P>The surveys carried out show in all cases that the answer lies in a combination of the different methods&mdash; regional schemes, smaller public schemes, private group schemes and individual private installations&mdash;rather than in the exclusive use of a single type of scheme.  The results of the <Col N="1282" /> survey merely confirm what I have been stressing over the past three years, namely, that there was need for the fullest co-operation between local authorities, group organisations and private enterprise and that there should be a joint approach to the problem so that all the available resources may be brought into play to achieve our objectives as quickly and as economically as possible.</P>
    <P>Lest any vestige of misunderstanding of the regional programme should remain, I wish to say that I have made it clear to local authorities that regional schemes should be adopted only where all the factors, including topography, population distribution and density and the capacity of sources of supply, indicate that a regional scheme is best suited and most economic in the circumstances of a particular area.  Both directly through my administrative and technical officers and indirectly through the local authorities, I have taken every possible step to encourage the rapid expansion of private group schemes and individual private installations.</P>
    <P>I have asked local authorities to take special steps to make the inhabitants of those areas not proposed to be serviced by public supplies aware of this fact, so that the people concerned may avail themselves of the special movement which I am fostering for the development of co-operative supplies in such areas.  I propose also to extend the co-operation afforded by officers of my Department to advise and assist local authorities on water supply programmes with special reference to the possibility of securing economies in the case of some regional schemes by having the distribution network infilled as far as practicable by group schemes organised on a private co-operative basis.</P>
    <P>As regards prospective rate increases arising out of the sanitary services programme, the general picture presented by the programmes adopted to date shows for the 17 county councils who have so far adopted comprehensive or interim programmes that the average ultimate increase would be about 2/- in the £ and that the various rates making up this average would be <Col N="1283" /> subject to some reduction by the income from water charges.  This confirms me in the belief I expressed when introducing last year's Estimate that the elected members of the local authorities can be relied on to protect the interests of the ratepayers.  I hope that the general picture of progress which I am now giving will encourage other county councils who have not yet adopted definite sanitary services programmes to do so without delay, if only in fairness to private interests who are eager to develop their part of the programme but who must first know how far their county council intend to go with public schemes.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of costs of sanitary services schemes, I wish to say that I am by no means complacent in regard to current increases in construction costs.  Some increase can be accounted for by wage increases but I propose to keep a close watch on costs generally and to ensure that there will be as much competition as possible in tendering.</P>
    <P>This year again I have communicated with sanitary authorities about water safety, swimming pools and beaches.  I have expressed satisfaction with the progress made, particularly in the signposting of dangerous bathing places and in the supply of life-saving equipment, but I told them I was still deeply concerned at the continued loss of life through drowning. I have urged them to do all that was possible so that not a single life may be lost through lack of reasonable precaution.  In regard to swimming pools, I am gratified at the ready response of some sanitary authorities and private interests to my previous calls for a planned programme for the provision of adequate swimming facilities but I am still looking for a more positive approach by other local authorities where such provision is still needed.  The financial assistance available from the State and the local authority, combined with local effort and initiative, should enable safe swimming facilities to be provided, where needed, and, as a consequence, the young people could be taught swimming and life-saving in safe and healthy surroundings.  I have also <Col N="1284" /> urged on sanitary authorities the need for vigorous action to deal with dangerous nuisances such as broken glass and rusty tins on beaches.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made in the control of temporary dwellings in the past year but there are some notable exceptions, including areas of tourist resort, where there is still not effective control.  I should like to remind sanitary authorities again of my warning that if local initiative does not prove adequate in this matter it will be necessary to enforce the recommended standards.  I think that it would be reasonable to fix the present year as terminating the period in which a rather lenient view is being taken in the case of small sites where hardship might be involved by strict enforcement of the standards immediately.</P>
    <P>The development of caravan sites may be remunerative in some places, but I recognise that in others it is difficult to get an economic return from large scale expenditure.  I would again exhort local authorities to encourage the development of proper caravan sites by assisting with the provision of essential services to the boundaries of the sites where this can be done without undue difficulty or cost.</P>
    <P>The loss of some lives during the year from fire and the destruction of substantial properties by major fires, particularly in Limerick and Dublin, has caused me some disquiet.  I am satisfied that the fire service generally is satisfactory and I think that the avoidance of such disasters in the future can best be achieved by a major awareness of fire hazards on the part of the public.  I propose therefore to set in train arrangements for more effective fire prevention and control propaganda.  The making of such arrangements is at present being considered in my Department.  A review of existing fire legislation as well as an examination of the local fire services generally are also being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The good response to the schemes for the clearance and improvement of derelict sites which was shown at its initiation continues to be maintained, particularly on the part of private individuals.  Local authorities are assisting, not so much by submitting <Col N="1285" /> applications on their own behalf, as by inducing owners of derelict sites to give undertakings as to their clearance or development.  In the course of the year the scope of the Subhead was extended to enable grants to be paid for works of public amenity as well as for derelict sites.  Such works include the provision and development of parks, open spaces, playing fields, river-side walks, means of access to beaches and boating facilities.  The scheme can also be used for opening up scenic views, landscaping historic buildings and for the general improvement and protection of places and objects of interest.  There has been an excellent response to this scheme and works estimated to cost over £50,000 have already been approved.</P>
    <P>As already announced I have this year increased the main road upkeep grant from 40 per cent.  to 50 per cent. The effect will be not only to compensate road authorities for the abolition of the estate duties grant but also to provide a further relief to local funds in respect of their contribution to main road upkeep.  The grant for Dublin county borough has been increased from £90,000 to £400,000 as from last year.</P>
    <P>The road improvement grant for the other cities and for Dún Laoghaire has been increased by 50 per cent.  Urban authorities generally are being given an increase of 10 per cent.  in their grants as well as being compensated for the loss of their shares in the estate duties grant.  The total increase in the amounts of grants represent an increase of £760,000 over last year's level.  In addition, I have set aside £500,000 with a view to the execution of essential improvements on arterial roads, many sections of which are still sub-standard in width and alignment.  In doing so, I have in mind road safety considerations and also the desirability of effecting a reduction in transport costs on these main arteries in the interests of agricultural and industrial production and marketing.</P>
    <P>In connection with the termination of the estate duties grant, the debt to the Road Fund on foot of borrowings from the Exchequer has been completely <Col N="1286" /> wiped out by the Road Fund (Grants) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1962, which provides also for the conversion into non-repayable grants of the two repayable advances which remained to be made under the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959.  The net amount by which the Road Fund will benefit is equivalent to about 24 years' purchase of the estate duties grant.</P>
    <P>Since the Road Traffic Act became law last year, my Department has been engaged on the making of regulations required by many of the provisions of the Act.  At the same time, those provisions which did not require the making of extensive regulations were brought into operation.  Sixty-four sections and parts of two other sections were brought into operation as from 1st October, 1961.  These include section 26, which extends the number of offences involving compulsory disqualification, and Part V, which deals with more serious driving offences.  Parts VIII and IX give extended powers in the regulation of traffic and parking.</P>
    <P>Twenty-eight other sections were brought into operation on 1st May, 1962.  They deal with compulsory insurance and came into operation in conjunction with new regulations to replace the old third party risks regulations. Passenger cover is made compulsory not only for public service vehicles, as hitherto, but also for all passenger cars of the private car and private bus type and vehicles of the estate car and station wagon type.</P>
    <P>As a result of the making of new regulations on the international circulation of vehicles, it has become possible for this country to adhere to a number of Conventions on the subject.  Future regulations on matters such as lighting of vehicles, will also enable us to conform more fully with international practice.</P>
    <P>During the past year, work has proceeded on the preparation of regulations under the Act to deal with the construction, equipment and use of vehicles.  The first subject taken was lighting and reflectors.  A committee has been examining this subject in <Col N="1287" /> consultation with interesed bodies, and has practically completed its deliberations. I hope to announce very shortly my proposals in this regard.  The same procedure will apply to other subjects such as dimensions and weights of vehicles, braking, etc., which will be taken up immediately the proposed regulations on lighting and reflectors have been completed.  All these proposed regulations will be published in advance so that the public can comment on them.</P>
    <P>I have recently made comprehensive regulations on traffic signs which include, amongst other provisions, signs for the built-up area speed limit. I have drawn on the experience of the local authorities in the matter of this speed limit and, at my suggestion, they drew in turn on the advice of local technical committees.  Their recommendations as to the roads which should be included in the 30 m.p.h. speed limit and the special roads to which 40 m.p.h. should apply have all been received and examined by my Department.  The drafting of the necessary regulations is at an advanced stage and it should be possible to bring these speed limits into operation early next year.  A considerable amount of work on the provision of traffic signs is involved.  I hope to announce shortly my proposals for ordinary speed limits which will apply to specified classes of vehicle.  This involved checking the speeds of various classes of vehicle on selected roads.</P>
    <P>In the matter of traffic and parking bye-laws, my consent is required, and where the bye-laws are local, the local authorities must be consulted.  It is the intention that my Department will help as far as possible to ensure that the Garda and the local authorities work together as a team, and that the bye-laws prepared will be sensible and effective.  On quite a number of sets of bye-laws, both general and local, a considerable amount of work has already been done by the Garda in consultation with my Department.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the first parking bye-laws under the Act of 1961, i.e., those relating to Dublin city and <Col N="1288" /> county will be in operation by January next.</P>
    <P>I regard the provision of off-street car parks as a major contribution towards improving traffic flow, and in this connection a circular letter has been issued to local authorities drawing their attention to the provisions of Section 101 of the 1961 Act, and urging them to use the powers in the section which enables them to provide off-street car parks or to assist in their provision by the contribution of money, the execution of works or the grant or lease of land.  The cost involved in the provision of car parks may be included in the expenses which may be charged to the annual Road Fund grant allocations for road improvement and for main road upkeep. Some of the schemes for carparks submitted to my Department have already been approved and there are a few still under consideration.</P>
    <P>The introduction of parking meters or of parking discs in the Dublin city area is another aspect of the parking problem which is receiving attention. The Dublin Corporation is taking the leading part in this examination with the help of my Department and the Garda.  There are many problems involved in the introduction of either of those systems and the experience of the operation of such systems abroad will have to be examined before any recommendations on the introduction of either system in Dublin can be made.  To mention some of the problems, full consideration will have to be given to the selection of locations, the effect on the present parking arrangements and on traffic flow, the means of enforcement and the collection and disposition of the charges.</P>
    <P>Regulations were made by me on 30th May last and are entitled the Road Traffic Act, 1961 (Section 103) (Offences) Regulations, 1962.  These regulations provide for the operation of the system generally referred to as &ldquo;fines-on-the-spot&rdquo; and they apply only to certain offences, all of which are in the parking category.  Under this system, the sum which a motorist will pay will be ten shillings.  He will be given a notice, or a notice will be affixed to the vehicle, alleging the commission of an offence and informing <Col N="1289" /> him that if payment of the sum is made at a stated Garda station within 21 days, a prosecution will not follow. He will be free, however, not to pay that sum and to opt for a prosecution in court.</P>
    <P>These regulations have not been used yet as new parking bye-laws under the Act of 1961 have yet to be made.  As I have already stated, these bye-laws for the Dublin area should be made by January next and then, it is hoped, the regulations will be used in the Dublin area.  They will also relate to the stopping of buses and to parking at bus stops and taxi stands.  The Commissioner of the Garda recently made bye-laws, with my consent, controlling the use of busstops by buses and other vehicles.</P>
    <P>Another example of the general co-operation between my Department, the Garda and the local authorities in the matter of traffic, particularly in the Dublin area where the problems are most intense, is in the question of traffic lights, pedestrian crossings and street markings.  The Road Fund grants are available towards these, and proposals for them are examined jointly.  I recently approved the provision of a substantial number of new traffic lights and pedestrian crossings in Dublin.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act which will, in my opinion, lead to a substantial improvement in driving behaviour is that dealing with driving tests.  The establishment of driving tests is an exceedingly complex matter and will require an extensive staffing organisation at headquarters and throughout the country.  The organisation of this establishment is at present being planned and every effort will be made to have the tests in operation without avoidable delay. A special section is being set up in the Department to deal with this work.</P>
    <P>The use of road safety propaganda is being intensified with the objects of inculcating general principles for good road behaviour and of securing public acceptace of the various measures which will be introduced from time to time for the protection of road <Col N="1290" /> users.  Every method of propaganda will be used and in particular television. A number of short films on specific subjects are being made here and others made in Britain have been purchased.  In all this I have had valuable help from voluntary bodies such as the Safety First Association and from the newspapers.  Radio Éireann is also assisting by the broadcast at intervals of a number of road safety slogans, also the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which are using such slogans on stamp cancellations.</P>
    <P>Illustrated folders on zebra crossings and other subjects have been published.  Further to the publication of two editions of the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo;, a revised version has been issued embodying alterations arising from the coming into force of the 1961 Act.  I should mention that I have had the assistance during the year of an informal group representing various interests engaged in road safety propaganda and I should like to take the opportunity of thanking those voluntary members who gave freely of their time for this work, and indeed those other voluntary workers who are assisting my Department in other ways, such as in the preparation of various regulations.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the road traffic side, the Commission set up in September, 1961 to consider means of determining the impairment of driving ability by alcohol or drugs has held many meetings to date and members of the Commission have also been examining continental practice.  I hope to receive the report of the Commission in the present year.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £2,000 in the Estimate for grants to An Comhairle Leabharlanna.  The Comhairle is empowered to assist local authorities in the improvement of their library services and the increased provision is being made to enable them to make grants for this purpose.  This follows the making of regulations by me last November providing for a scheme to assist local authorities in the improvement of their library services.  Grants from the voted provision will be made available to An Comhairle Leabharlanna for the recoupment of up to <Col N="1291" /> 50 per cent.  of the annual loan charges incurred by library authorities on the provision, improvement and furnishing of library buildings, major acquisitions of books and the provision of mobile libraries.  I trust that the scheme will encourage local authorities to undertake a thorough reorganisation of their library services.</P>
    <P>Another subhead in the Vote for my Department provides £5,000 for contributions towards loan charges to county councils in respect of seeds and fertilisers supply schemes.  This is to enable county councils to avail themselves of existing legislation to adopt special schemes to help farmers who had suffered crop losses in the heavy storms of autumn 1961.  Short-term loans at an interest rate of 2 per cent. may be made to farmers who suffered in these storms to enable them to purchase seeds and fertilisers.  The difference between the interest on the loans and that paid by the councils on money borrowed for the schemes will be made good by grants from this provision in the Vote.</P>
    <P>The state of the rate collection at the end of the last financial year was satisfactory in most counties, the overall collection having reached 97.3 per cent. of the warrants.  This year there have been rate increases in every county except one, the average county rate being 43/3d.  as against 40/11d.  last year.  The latest round of wage and salary increases has been largely responsible for the increase in the rates.</P>
    <P>The total revenue expenditure of local authorities in the past year was £60.8 million while the corresponding estimate for this year is £65.1 million. Receipts from rates in 1961-62 met 38.2 per cent.  of the total expenditure while the State grants accounted for 42.6 per cent., the remainder of the expenditure being defrayed from miscellaneous receipts.  In the current year receipts from rates will meet 34.1 per cent.  of the expenditure while contributions from State sources will account for 46.5 per cent.  There is therefore evident this year a much more pronounced trend in the direction of increasing State aid for expenditure <Col N="1292" /> on local services.  This is due mainly to the greatly increased agricultural grant which is being made available this year.  I may say that the agricultural grant for the current year is estimated at £8½ million as against £5.8 million last year and that it will meet 55 per cent.  of the gross rates on agricultural land as against 41 per cent.  last year.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure of local authorities in 1961-62 amounted to £10.1 million, an increase of £1 million on the previous year's expenditure.  The bulk of local capital requirements continued to be obtained from the Local Loans Fund.  The total net indebtedness of local authorities as at 31st March last is estimated at £154.2 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>In doing so, I take the end of the Minister's speech at the outset and will deal with the financial situation as he presented it to the House.  The Minister points out that expenditure from rates has been increasing and that in this year there had to be an increased subsidy from the State to enable ratepayers to bear their burden and in order that this burden might be lightened somewhat, particularly where the farming community are concerned. Everybody is aware that in the year just passed, there was great unrest throughout the country because of the rates burden and it was brought very forcibly to the notice of the Minister and his Department that the agricultural community did not feel themselves able to bear any further impositions on rates for local services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, we have had cause to examine the system under which rates are based on a system of valuations which has been in operation in this country for over 100 years.  That is something that requires to be carefully examined.  There is involved here the basic principle that the individual should be asked to contribute only in accordance with his ability to pay. That hinges on a number of factors. There is the question of the number <Col N="1293" /> of dependants any individual has to support and there is equally the question of farmers' holdings, particularly the small farmers about whom we hear a lot at the present time.</P>
    <P>The problem of the small farmers has been recognised through the action of the Taoiseach in setting up a committee to examine the position.  They reported there was great need for a change of outlook, in so far as small farmers are concerned.  The position as envisaged by the Minister's statement generally leads one to believe that the outlook is one of increased expenditure.  This increased expenditure will fall to be met under several headings.  The amount the State, which is the ordinary taxpayer, will contribute to that may be an increased percentage of what is to be spent by the local authorities, but the problem at the present time is whether we have not reached the stage where we ought to set ourselves priorities in regard to the programme which we envisage can be undertaken by the local authorities who, in the main, are agents for the central authority.  In the carrying out of these schemes, the central authority, the Oireachtas and legislation passed here, impose these burdens on local authorities.  The type of grants made available to the local authorities, mainly of the percentage type, are of the kind which can be used to induce or compel the local authority to conform to the will of the central authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions the indebtedness of local authorities as being estimated at £154,000,000 at present.  That is something which ought to make us think because if we relate that to the paying capacity of the community, then we find ourselves in the position that no less a sum than approximately £7,000,000 has to be found annually to meet the capital repayment of the sums borrowed by local authorities.  A further £3,500,000 has to be found to meet the charge for interest on such advances.  This sum of £10,500,000 is, I suggest, a very formidable sum for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is need for a review in regard to the type of grants payable to the <Col N="1294" /> local authorities.  The Minister in the past year has done something in that respect.  He has dealt with one of them but I suggest that the Minister could equally and with profit deal with some more of these grants and rationalise them.  In that manner, we could get not only better administration but some savings both at central authority and local authority level.</P>
    <P>In the main, the types of grant payable are grants by which the central authority and the Legislature are enabled to get the local authority to implement decisions taken without the local authority really having any say as to whether they desire it or not or whether they think it suitable or not.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of his speech, the Minister refers to housing which is one of the large component parts of the service provided under the auspices of his Department.  I notice reference to the fact that private housing now exceeds the volume of local authority housing.  That, indeed, is very admirable and very desirable.  The more encouragement we give to that element of the enterprise of people, the better. It is something we ought to commend by the promptness and despatch with which we make available the facilities provided by legislation to applicants for housing grants.  My information is that there is delay in the payment of housing grants, both new house grants and reconstruction grants.  That is not confined to any one area.</P>
    <P>The decline in house building was referred to by the Minister in his speech, as well as the necessity for a housing programme.  I am sorry that the survey which it was intended should be completed has not so far been successful.  I feel sure we need some radical thinking in regard to our housing programme.  Not alone is there in local authority areas a programme of housing needs which fall to be met but there is also a replacement programme which will fall to be met over the years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the replacement programme, a rough and ready calculation leads me to believe that one per cent.  of the housing in any particular area would represent the replacement <Col N="1295" /> needs, if the life of a house is taken as 100 years.  That can be applied to any local authority area to arrive at the future housing needs in an area.  Not all of that will fall to be met by the local authority effort.  Indeed, it may even be less than half of the amount.</P>
    <P>Let me take as an example the case of my own constituency.  A survey in Limerick in 1946 revealed that there were something like 22,000 houses. Taking one per cent.  of that, it leaves 220 yearly requiring to be replaced and taking even less than half as being those who need to be rehoused by the local authority, that, in itself, is a respectable housing programme for any local authority to envisage.  But if we add to that approximately 300 further houses required in the area, that, without the replacement figure, would be a long programme for the local authority to deal with.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained some of the delays by mentioning the causes&mdash; lack of inspectors and difficulties in regard to cement.  These are some of the problems which slow down the housing programme.  The Minister says he has an adequate staff of housing inspectors now.  I do not know if this problem is related to a matter mentioned earlier on another Vote, whether some uniformity is not really required in regard to the inspection staff available to the Department of Local Government just as it is required, as mentioned here, in the Office of Public Works.  Uniformity should keep the inspectorate staff available to the Department to enable them to carry out inspections without losing the staff they have at any particular time.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that, for one reason or another, there is this slow-down in the housing programme, so far as local authorities are concerned.  That is illustrated by the answer the Minister gave me on 29th May this year in which he set out the number of houses built by local authorities in different years and, not alone that, but the number built by private persons with the aid of grants under the Housing Acts.  These figures have shown a steady decline from a figure of 5,267 in 1954-55 or 3,467 in 1957-58 to 1,238 <Col N="1296" /> in 1961-62.  If I were convinced that decline in housing was due to the fact that all who need houses had been rehoused, this would be a pleasant picture to contemplate but we all know that a great many still need rehousing and that a large number are people who fall to be housed by the local authorities.  Therefore, we cannot afford to be complacent about this situation.</P>
    <P>The number of houses built by private persons with the aid of grants has also shown a steady decline from 5,000 in any of the three years 1954 to 1957, or from 3,629 in 1957-58 until last year when there was an improvement from 3,952 in 1960-61 to 4,049 in 1961-62.  The upsurge the Minister has referred to in the expenditure on grants for private housing is welcome, if it has the effect of stepping up the tempo of housing.  I suggest that one way to ensure that will happen is to see that grants due to be paid are paid without undue delay and that there is no undue delay in regard to inspection.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say what trends if any, can now be noted from the survey carried out in the Department according to his reply to a question of mine on 8th March as to what seems to be the size of the problem still facing both local authorities and the central authority.  The Minister referred to it but I am sure his figures are now much more up-to-date than on 8th March and that he could give us a clearer picture of housing needs now.</P>
    <P>In addition to housing, there is the question of procedure in regard to the acquisition of sites by local authorities. Where an application is made to the Department for a compulsory purchase order, sometimes sites are included which are given voluntarily.  Sites given voluntarily&mdash;I say this subject to correction&mdash;should be excluded from a compulsory purchase order.  The increases in the remuneration of both workers and tradesmen, as the Minister realises, has increased the costs of house production over the years.  The cost has increased even since last year and I think the time has come when there should be a further look at the need for increases in the grant level to meet increased costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> There are other features of housing of which at present we are aware. When houses are being built, the desire to get the house completed, often restricts the scope of the house and I wonder whether such devices as using the space over the rafters, which could be made available by using heavier rafters to allow for the construction of dormer rooms, would be permitted to qualify houses for grants.  It is something that merits the Minister's attention. If somebody could devise a house which we could call expandable, it might frequently meet the needs of Irish family life.  The suggestion I heard of providing that gully traps and such things be kept at a reasonable distance from the house to allow for future development is something that might merit the future attention of architects and engineers.  In cases where local authorities have to submit their housing requirements to the <Col N="1298" /> central authority, I suggest that a very useful type of process, perhaps, might be man-to-man talks between the representative of the local authority&mdash; the manager&mdash;and his opposite number in the Minister's Department.</P>
