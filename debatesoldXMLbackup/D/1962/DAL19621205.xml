      <P>asked the Minister for Health what steps have been taken to accommodate a dispensary doctor in Drumkeerin, County Leitrim, as many local residents have to travel a distance of sixteen or eighteen miles to Drumshanbo to see their dispensary doctor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy has in mind the provision of a dispensary residence for the district medical officer in Drumkeerin dispensary district.  This would be a matter for the health authority in the first instance and I understand that the authority are not prepared to provide a dispensary residence in Drumkeerin dispensary district, particularly at present, as the reorganisation of dispensary districts in the area is under consideration.</P>
      <P>Eligible persons resident in Drumkeerin dispensary district should not have to travel to Drumshanbo to attend their district medical officer. Dispensary sessions are held twice weekly at Drumkeerin and the district medical officer is obliged to attend eligible persons at their homes where they are unable to attend the dispensary or require his services urgently. I understand that the health authority have received no complaints regarding the service being provided by the district medical officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost of floating the issue of £17½ million of 6 per cent.  Exchequer Stock in the Autumn of 1961 was £132,190 of which £122,365 represented underwriting and brokerage commissions and the balance of £9,825 other expenses including the cost of advertising.</P>
      <P>The amount involved in issuing the loan at £97 per cent. instead of at par was £525,000.  This is not, however, part of the cost of floating the issue as it will not become payable until the stock of the loan is being redeemed, and, like the annual interest, is proper to the cost of servicing the loan over its life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has given further consideration to easing the estate duties on Irish investments and real estate owned by residents in this country; and, if so, what is the result of such consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent legislation has <Col N="661" /> afforded considerable relief in relation to estate duties on estates generally. The Finance Act, 1960, raised the exemption limit from £2,000 to £5,000. The Finance Act, 1961, reduced the rates of duty on estates between £5,000 and £8,000 and, in the case of estates in excess of £100,000, established a uniform rate of 40 per cent. in place of the previous rates which proceeded to a maximum of 53 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under the Finance Act, 1956, the value of a considerable range of Irish industrial securities is reduced by one-third for estate duty purposes where the deceased dies domiciled in the State.  Furthermore, stock of certain National Loans is accepted at its nominal value in payment of death duties although the market value at date of death may be below the nominal value.</P>
      <P>The question of any further easement in the death duties field is a budgetary matter to be examined at the appropriate time in the light of the Exchequer position and of other relevant considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>While one can appreciate the distance the Minister has gone, would he not consider the fact that the complete abolition of duties, as suggested in this Question, would bring a big inflow of capital into the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's attention been directed to a flaw, or something which I think is a flaw, in the legislation, that if, through inadvertence, death duties are paid in cash and the estate in fact proves to have Irish Government securities which would be eligible for the concession he mentions, of payment of death duties at par, the Revenue Commissioners have not the power to refund the cash and accept the <Col N="662" /> securities, and would he consider remedying that flaw, if it were unintentional in the original legislation?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is of course aware that the Government's preference in the matter of extending fishery limits is to get general international agreement on the subject.  Unfortunately, there seems to be little hope of getting world-wide agreement in the years immediately ahead.  We have been driven since the failure of the 1960 Geneva Conference to agree on an extension of the limits, to seek agreement between a limited group of countries. To this end, we have been consulting and are still in consultation with a number of countries but so far without success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The talks between British and Irish officials on the 23rd November were limited to the scope of Article 5 of the 1960 Trade Agreement.

The Committee's survey reports on two industries have been published, and the surveys of a number of other industries have now reached an advanced stage.

      <P>The following improvement schemes have been approved for execution by Waterford County Council under the main road improvement grant, 1962/63: T.13 between Grange and Pilltown, £10,000; T.12 at Burgery, £6,630; at Ringcrehy, £6,410; at Gortavickery, £6,650; and T.75 at Ballymacmague, £3,005.</P>
      <P>A £5,000 scheme at Portlaw which is part of a major improvement proposal on L.26 is under consideration in the Department.</P>
      <P>The council's original programme under the county road improvement grant was made up of 93 schemes of which 90 were approved.  There were 46 schemes for the surface-dressing of work previously carried out and 44 schemes of further improvement.  The remaining three schemes involved the construction of new roads and the council have been asked to submit details of these.  This programme absorbed the full amount of £84,800 available under the grant, but two further schemes costing £2,177, to be financed out of savings or, failing that, by transferring funds from some of the other schemes, have also been approved.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>All advertisements for the Garda Síochána Entrance Examinations clearly state that passing the examination will not give any entitlement to appointment.  It has been the practice for some years past to call for interview and medical examination all those who qualified in the written examination.  Because of the large numbers so qualifying and the limited numbers of vacancies arising, the time-lag between the date of publication of the results of the Examination and that of the call-up was so great&mdash;in some cases almost two years&mdash;that I have come to the conclusion that, for the future, the proper course is to hold two examinations each year and to call a limited number, say 200, from each of these examinations.  This will ensure that the time-lag between qualifying and call-up will be considerably shortened and that highly qualified candidates who would otherwise be attracted to other employment will not be lost to the Force.</P>

Taking all the circumstances into account will he call those who qualified in the recent examination, or make a public statement that it is the intention of the Department to alter a practice that has been in operation for a number of years?

      <P>Is the Minister aware that for the first time notices were sent out to the candidates that they had passed the examination, without further comment?  It was not until about a week later notices followed stating that &ldquo;inasmuch as you got 260th place and there are only 200 vacancies, you are not eligible for appointment and it is suggested you take a second examination&rdquo;.  Is the Minister aware that that procedure was never followed before and that it has caused a great deal of disappointment and upset throughout the country?</P>

      <P>I am not sure it has never been followed before.  I agree it has not been the practice in recent years.  The practice in recent years has been to call everybody who qualified at the examination.  I want to point out, however, that the examination is conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners. It is only one of the qualifying elements.  There are still tests in oral Irish, a medical examination and so on.  The notices which were sent out were merely an indication from the Civil Service Commissioners to the effect that the person concerned had passed the qualifying examination.  The advertisement published made it absolutely clear that the mere passing of that examination did not entitle anyone to be called.  The situation was that we were getting to the ridiculous stage that, if all the candidates who qualified in the recent examination were to be called, it would be late in 1965 before some of them would be called.  Most Deputies will agree that that would be an entirely undesirable position.  I am endeavouring to get back to the situation where almost immediately after an examination is held, the persons who qualify will be called for interview.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital and Gewerbesteuer (Trade Tax) (Federal Republic of Germany) Order, 1962,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid on the table of Dáil Éireann on the 19th day of November, 1962.</P>
      <P>This motion relates to the implementation in Irish law of a comprehensive Convention with the Federal Republic of Germany for the avoidance of double taxation of income and capital.  The Convention has been signed on behalf of the Irish Government but before it can enter into force the necessary steps must have been taken under the law of both countries to give effect to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> So far as concerns Ireland, it is necessary to comply with the provisions of Part VII of the Finance Act, 1958.  Section 44 of that Act provides that an arrangement entered into with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation in respect of income tax, sur-tax, corporation profits tax and any taxes of a similar character shall have the force of law in this country if the Irish Government makes an Order accordingly. Where the Government propose to make any such Order, however, a draft must first have been laid before the Dáil and a resolution passed approving it.</P>
    <P>Deputies will find the text of the Convention scheduled to the draft Order.  The usual brief explanatory note is appended at the end of the Order but, for the convenience of Deputies, a separate memorandum has also been circulated which explains each of the articles in the Convention in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The Convention, generally, follows the main lines of our Agreement with Sweden.  It is also broadly in line with modern international tax agreements and, as far as was found possible, incorporates articles of a model double taxation Convention already adopted by the OECD.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum has drawn attention to a feature in the Convention of particular importance in the context of encouraging the investment of German capital in Ireland.  In so far as the Federal Republic is to exempt income from sources within Ireland which &ldquo;may be taxed&rdquo; in Ireland in accordance with the Convention, substantially the same result is achieved as would flow from a matching credit provision, because the exemption will be granted whether or not the income is subject to Irish tax.  The income concerned is income from trading in Ireland through a permanent establishment and dividends from Irish companies of whose voting shares at least 25 per cent. are held by Federal Republic parent companies.  In these cases, therefore, the benefits of the exports tax relief and the tax relief to industries set up in the Shannon Customs-free <Col N="695" /> Area will be preserved for Federal Republic interests.</P>
    <P>The Convention will enter into force upon the exchange of instruments of ratification.  It will continue in effect indefinitely but may be terminated by either Party by giving written notice not earlier than the 30th June, 1963. Upon entry into force, the Convention will have effect in Ireland&mdash;(a) in respect of income tax for the year of assessment 1959/60 and subsequent years; (b)  in respect of sur-tax for the year of assessment 1958/59 and subsequent years; and (c) in respect of corporation profits tax for any chargeable accounting period beginning on or after the 1st April, 1959, and for the unexpired portion of any chargeable accounting period current at that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will accept it is desirable that we should extend our Conventions for double taxation relief to as many countries as possible.  From recollection &mdash; I should like the Minister to verify this for me&mdash;we have already the double taxation agreement of 1926 which was negotiated by Mr. Ernest Blythe with Britain.  In addition, we have in more recent years double taxation Conventions with the United States of America, Canada, Sweden and now with Germany.  I cannot at the moment think of any other but I should like the Minister to verify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any doubt that of all the agreements negotiated, the simplest from our point of view and the most advantageous both from our point of view and from the point of view of the other party to the Convention was the double taxation agreement with Britain.  It was at that time very much more in the nature of pioneering work than double taxation agreements are today.  It was, at the same time, perhaps, easier to have a simple exemption form such as the British one because our system of taxation here corresponded at that time and since to the British system more nearly than to any other&mdash;the system operative then and now by which a resident in Ireland who is not resident in Britain is able to get back the whole <Col N="696" /> of the British tax.  That is advantageous for residents of this country.</P>
    <P>So far as other systems are concerned, the Minister said that this is modelled on the Swedish Convention negotiated some little time ago.  I cannot remember for certain whether the American and Canadian Conventions were on a credit or exemption system and I should be glad if the Minister would refresh my memory in this respect.  I find it difficult to understand how this agreement can be based on the model agreement of the OECD when one bears in mind that it is an agreement on two different bases.  It is an agreement in respect of the credit system on the Irish side and the exemption system on the German side.  As I understood it the OECD model came down rather more flatly that like should be taken with like and that if there was to be a credit system in one country, it should be matched by a credit system in the other, and if there was to be an exemption system in one country, it should be matched by an exemption in the other.</P>
    <P>I should have liked the Minister in his introductory remarks to give us some indication as to how our adherence to the European Economic Community would affect the working of this double taxation agreement. Germany, as we all know, is one of the Six and, if my recollection is correct, this is the first double taxation agreement that we have negotiated with any member of the Six.  In the present position of our negotiations, when we were negotiating such an agreement, we must have had very much before us the effect of entry into the Common Market on such a Convention and I am very disappointed indeed, therefore, that the Minister did not think it worthwhile to explain to the Dáil how his experts consider this Convention would be affected by our becoming members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The only book in English that I have ever seen on German taxation&mdash;unfortunately, I cannot speak German&mdash; indicated to me that the total number of taxes in the Federal German Republic was about 50.  I know we <Col N="697" /> have picked out the four main taxes here, but, as far as I can see, there is no note anywhere in this Convention in relation to the other 46, some of which are, perhaps, of special relevance, such as the taxes that operate in Berlin, but the manner in which, as I understand it, this double taxation Convention will operate in respect of goods made here and profits arising from them in the export market seems to me to be limited by the provision in relation to the holding of 25 per cent in the Irish company by German nationals or by a German parent firm.</P>
    <P>The memorandum which the Minister was good enough to make available to Deputies is prepared with the usual clarity with which the Revenue Commissioners indicate their views but I am afraid that, in relation to the impinging of the special provisions dealing with a holding by German nationals of shares carrying voting rights in an Irish company of at least 25 per cent. it is not anything like as clear as that to which we are accustomed. The &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; which is referred to in Article 3 is defined in the earlier article but the definition in the Convention is not such as to be conclusive.</P>
    <P>For example, if a German company has an agent here&mdash;only one&mdash; and that agent does the business of the company, gets the goods in and despatches them around the country, it seems to me that could come within the term &ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; in paragraph (g) where it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;permanent establishment&rdquo; means a fixed place of business in which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.</P>
    <P>I should have thought there would have had to be some reference, in addition, to the ownership of the place of business and where it was carried on&mdash; and I use the term &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; to signify in the widest possible terms the tenancy of a place of business.</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the Convention draws attention to the most unusual situation adopted by Professor Erhard in Germany to ensure the financing of <Col N="698" /> German economic revival.  In Germany if you do not distribute your profits, you pay far more in taxes than if you do.  The tax, as the Minister said in his memorandum, in respect of distributed profits at present is some 15 per cent. of the profits so distributed but in respect of the part of profit ploughed back into the business&mdash; something we regard as highly desirable&mdash;the rate of tax is not 15 but 51 per cent., three and a half times as much.  It seems rather difficult to understand the reason behind that but, perhaps, part of the explanation is that we have here a system by which the dividends paid to the shareholders of a company are entitled to take credit for the income tax paid by the company and, perhaps, the same does not arise in Germany in quite the same way in the case of corporation tax and income tax.</P>
    <P>I am not able, I fear&mdash;perhaps the Minister is&mdash;adequately to pronounce the titles of the various German taxes but it seems peculiar that the rate of deduction on the visible profits is frozen by this Convention at 15 per cent, and, even though the German Republic may reduce its rate of taxation on profits that are divided, the Convention does not permit any profit to accrue to Irish nationals from that, unless the German Government at the same time reduce the taxation on undistributed profits.  Frankly, I do not understand at all why that is necessary.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Minister has indicated in his explanatory memorandum that the Federal Republic is only prepared to recognise to a limited extent deduction by a company of Irish tax from the dividend as for German tax from the recipient could affect vitally the whole scope of this Convention in so far as any profit would arise from German investment in Ireland.  Article 22, as well as Article 6, of the Convention applies to that.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see also that the Convention in relation to royalties goes further than our own law in respect of royalties and that there will be exemption for capital sums paid, although here, in relation to Irish residents, that exemption does not fully <Col N="699" /> apply.  I do not understand why it is optional under Article 14 to tax directors' fees here or in either country. If directors' fees are paid in either country, it would seem to me to be mandatory that they should be taxed in the country in which they originate. But as far as I can read in the article and in the memorandum, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used, not the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It must also have been a matter of very great pleasure to the negotiators and, indeed, of personal satisfaction to the Minister when the negotiators came back to report to him that public entertainers in both countries were exempt from tax under the terms of this Convention.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to tell us how Article 21 in particular will be affected by accession to the European Economic Community.  Are we to be in the position in that Community that we must grant the same personal allowances and reliefs to non-resident nationals as we must to resident nationals and if so, does it mean that inevitably we must grant the same reliefs to Germans who are not resident here but who because of Article 21, are entitled to claim exactly the same benefits as our own people are entitled to claim?</P>
    <P>In regard to the Order itself, I am a little worried about the terms of Article 23.  If it is clear beyond question that the exchange of information between the Revenue authorities of Ireland and the Revenue authorities of Germany is strictly limited to such information as may be absolutely necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Convention, then that is all right; but I am apprehensive in case there should be anything in this, either by implication or otherwise, which would mean that the German Revenue authorities would have the right to ask the Irish Revenue authorities for any information about the financial affairs of any citizen of Ireland, or resident here, for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>It is of course a vital principle that the confidential information given to the Revenue authorities to enable a person's tax to be adequately assessed or properly assessed&mdash;perhaps as most <Col N="700" /> of us think it is not adequately but grossly assessed, a better phrase would be &ldquo;properly&rdquo; assessed&mdash;will in no circumstances whatever pass out of the control of our own Revenue authorities.  In some European countries, it is an expressed feature of their tax laws that the income, and amounts returned for income, of individual citizens should be made public so that perhaps there would be, as is believed, a greater inducement to tell the truth.  I doubt whether it would be effective in that way here, but whether that is so or not, it is a system which is entirely foreign to our way of life, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>It must be made crystal clear, beyond all question, that there is no right whatever in the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany to ask our authorities here for any information relative to the affairs of any taxpayer, except in so far as that taxpayer claims the benefit of the double taxation agreement in this Convention and that accordingly, in order for him to get that benefit, the information must be made available for him.  That is the case where it is made available at the taxpayer's own request.  Of course if the taxpayer asks for information to be made available, the true information must be submitted and not only such extracts as the person might wish.  At the same time, it conforms to the principle that the confidence is the confidence of the taxpayer and it can not be disclosed to any other person.</P>
    <P>The corporation tax, the trade tax and the capital gains tax which are assessed in the Federal Republic of Germany have been dealt with fairly fully in the Minister's memorandum. As I say, I understand there are about 50 different taxes altogether levied, exacted or whatever word one likes to use, in the Republic of Germany. How far does this Convention deal with any others?  How far, for example, does it deal with the real property acquisition tax?  There is a reference to tax on immovable property but I took that reference to be something analogous to our Schedule A income tax and that the real property acquisition tax in Germany is quite a different thing.  I <Col N="701" /> should like to know whether that will come within the scope of this Convention.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, apart from the actual taxes themselves, there is always considerable difference between the method of assessment of tax. Is it clear under this Convention that in relation to profits arising here, the method of assessment so far as this Convention is concerned will be the Irish method?  My reason for asking that is that the Federal Republic of Germany have an entirely different system of dealing with depreciation, and an entirely different system of dealing with the valuation of stock and in their writings off and carryings forward adopt methods quite unknown to us here.  Unless we are to have the system of the country itself adopted in the initial instance, it will mean virtually an impossible jungle through which nobody will be able to penetrate and that in turn will prevent the easy flow of trade, and particularly the flow of trade in manufacturing businesses, between one country and the other.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I have considerable sympathy with the Minister in dealing with a matter of this kind because no matter how simple one might be, one could go on, <i>ad infinitum,</i> posing questions on a double taxation agreement such as this, questions which would be extremely difficult to answer off the cuff, so may I say to the Minister that if he has difficulty answering some of the questions I have posed, I shall be happy enough if he sends me an explanation later on.</P>

      <P>For my own information and for the information of others who might be equally ill-informed, I want to ask the Minister if, while a Convention of this type is being arranged, there is a very complete examination of its impacts on the economy of this country?  For instance, are we in a position to know that what we lose on the roundabouts we get back on the swings?  I am quite unaware of how these examinations are conducted and I should like to know and the public would like to know, <Col N="702" /> whether all the reliefs given in one set of circumstances roughly correspond to the reliefs received on the other side of the Convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might start by assuring Deputy Barry that there is a very full examination of the impact of these matters on our finance and economy here.  I might also say to Deputy Barry that these negotiations go on for a very long time.  They must have been going on for two years and there was nothing done very hurriedly.  We try to get the best arrangement we can and, on the whole, this arrangement is a pretty good one.  There is one clause to which Deputy Sweetman referred and to which I shall come in a few minutes. Apart from that, the agreement is easy to understand and is quite good.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Sweetman said, the first agreement was in 1926.  It was with Britain and was more or less a pioneering performance, although I believe at the time the League of Nations laid down certain rules which might be followed.  After that, we had agreements with the United States, Canada and Sweden and they were on the credit method, as is this one also.</P>
      <P>There are many taxations in Germany, but, as we are dealing here with profit and income, there are only four of them which need be taken into account.  These are income tax and corporation profits tax, which we have here, and then they have the trade tax and the capital tax.  These two are collected by the municipalities and by the other provincial legislators and therefore there are only the two that are taken by the Federal Government itself against the two we collect here, income tax and the corporation profits tax.  I am including surtax with income tax here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point mentioned by Deputy Sweetman is that there is a difference between the two countries with regard to the question of dividends.  It is laid down in this agreement that a person in Germany, whether an Irish or German citizen, drawing a dividend from Ireland, is not given credit for income tax having been paid on that dividend. We do give that credit here notionally because in this country we charge the <Col N="703" /> corporation profits tax with the income tax.  That having been done, the dividends are distributed from the fund from which income tax has been taken and it is not charged to the recipient of the dividend.</P>
    <P>In Germany, the company pays the income tax and when the dividend is distributed to the shareholder, he pays the tax again.  To get over that difficulty, the agreement provides that the German Federal Government will relieve the recipient of the dividend in Germany from an Irish company of 18 per cent. of the net dividend payable.  It is a compromise because the German Government, according to their law, can only regard the person getting a dividend from here as not having paid tax on it while we regard him as having paid full tax on it.</P>
    <P>As regards EEC conditions, it is not apparent so far that any change will have to be made in this agreement but it is quite possible that, as time goes on, it may have to be changed.  I am afraid we will have to wait until we see what these changes may be or whether time will necessitate any alteration being made in this agreement. There is appropriate provision in every one of these agreements for anything like that taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about that; it probably would not arise for five years in any case.  There might be one point on which a change might arise in the meantime, that is, the point of permanent establishment.  A good deal of space is given in the agreement to this definition.  It is the same in the Swedish agreement and it follows the pattern laid down by OECD.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if what I am about to say covers the point the Deputy raised.  If an agent in Germany has power to conclude a contract, he would be regarded as <Col N="704" /> having a permanent status in Germany. That, I think, comes near the dividing line.  A person over there doing a bit of business and coming back here would not be regarded as permanently established there.</P>
      <P>On the question of the exchange of information, it is only intended to give whatever information is necessary to carry out the agreement but it is intended to give that information in good faith.  We could not give guarded information because that would be unfair to the other party and we expect the same treatment from them.</P>

    <Title>Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1962&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to continue the Exchange Control Act, 1954, for a further four years.</P>
      <P>Before the war, when sterling was freely convertible into any other currency, this country could at all times rely on using sterling so as to make payments or transfer money to any country.  The restrictions on sterling transferability which have been in operation in varying degree since 1939 suspended this facility and made it necessary for us to control our payments to and receipts from non-sterling countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exchange control was first operated under emergency legislation <Col N="705" /> which was replaced in 1954 by the Exchange Control Act.  The Act was expressed to expire on 31st December, 1958, as it was hoped that the need for exchange control would have ceased by that date.  This expectation was not, however, realised and in 1958 power was given to extend control for a further period of four years to the end of the present year.  On that occasion I expressed the hope that it would, meanwhile, be possible to abolish all exchange control, but unfortunately this cannot yet be done.</P>
    <P>In general, the 1954 Act provides for the control of (a) payments to and payments on behalf of persons resident outside the sterling area; (b) dealings in gold and foreign exchange; (c) dealings in and the export and import of foreign currency securities and unregistered securities; (d) dealings in sterling area securities on behalf of persons resident outside the area; and (e) the export and import of currency notes.</P>
    <P>It provides that goods may not be exported to a country outside the Sterling Area unless they are already paid for or are to be paid for within six months and in a manner appropriate to the country of import.  It empowers the Minister to specify foreign currencies which must be sold to a bank.  It also provides for the compulsory deposit of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities.  It has not been found necessary to bring these latter powers into operation since 1954, but it is desirable that they should be retained lest the need for them should again arise in the general context of exchange control.</P>
    <P>General exemptions and permissions are given by way of Ministerial Regulations under the Act.  By 1958, control had already been considerably relaxed and authority delegated to banks, stockbrokers, solicitors and authorised travel agents to deal with many classes of applications.  Since then the procedure has been further considerably modified and wider authority has been delegated to banks, etc.  At present foreign exchange facilities are available in full for all <Col N="706" /> current, as distinct from capital, payments. Such supervision as is applied to non-capital transactions is directed towards ensuring that they are not used as a cover for unauthorised capital transfers and for this purpose there is in some cases a limit on the amount of foreign exchange facilities a bank or travel agent may make available, without reference to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>For instance, the limit on the foreign exchange facilities that can be made available for holiday travel outside the sterling area is £250 per journey over and above the cost of travel tickets and of any reservation of hotel accommodation.  If in any case this liberal allowance is considered to be inadequate, facilities in excess of that amount will be granted where there is no reason to suspect that an unauthorised transfer of capital is involved.</P>
    <P>In effect, the only restrictions still maintained are those on capital transfers outside the sterling area.  In general foreign exchange for investment purposes is made available only for direct, as distinct from portfolio, investment in approved projects such as those which are calculated to assist materially our export trade or otherwise improve our foreign earnings. Subject to this over-riding restriction, dealings in securities are freely permitted subject to compliance with certain rules of procedure.</P>
    <P>There is no immediate prospect that sterling will become convertible on capital account.  It is, therefore, necessary that the Act should be retained in full for an additional period.  The Bill proposes a further period of four years, but I can assure Deputies and, I hope, with a better prospect of realisation than on the last occasion, that if sterling should become fully convertible at any time earlier, steps will be taken to abolish exchange control without delay.  Membership of the European Economic Community would entail modification of the restriction applied to capital transactions. Any modifications necessary could, however, be effected within the framework of the Act which it is now proposed to continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is purely an extending Bill in point of time to carry on exchange control for four years more and, though all of us would like to see exchange control terminated, at the same time, in present circumstances, we do not oppose this Bill.  I should like to have heard the Minister for the purpose of enabling Deputies to appreciate what we are discussing, give us a dissertation explaining succinctly the difference between hard and soft dollars on capital account, because it seems to me that therein lies the real kernel of the problem of exchange control in so far as it is really maintained at the moment.</P>
      <P>Sterling is not, of course, as the Minister has said, freely convertible, and may not be for some time, but it is possible to convert sterling into dollars through the medium of the soft dollar, though why the soft dollar should be a better medium of exchange than the hard dollar is something that the Minister could, perhaps, explain to the House.  It seems to me incomprehensible why, as long as one is permitted to convert to dollars through the medium of buying soft dollars&mdash;I stress that there is nothing wrong or shady in making such conversions&mdash;you will not retain exchange control as such? It is accepted anyone can get, and has been able to get for a considerable time, any foreign currencies he needs on current account.  It is equally a fact that by means of certain changes and by means of transactions called &ldquo;wash transactions&rdquo; sterling can be changed equally into dollars, and then become freely exchangeable throughout the world.  Perhaps the Minister would explain to us why these wash transactions are necessary and why it is necessary to have conversions from hard dollars into soft dollars in order that capital dealings can take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Without moving into the more abstract aspects of this problem, I should like to ask the Minister a practical question in regard to everyday trading.  There has been&mdash;I am not altogether sure that it still exists&mdash; a differential in the exchange rate for dollars remitted from the United States of America to this country, according <Col N="708" /> to whether they were deemed to be a gift&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a soft dollar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or a trading transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hard dollar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The net effect of that in rural Ireland is that, at Christmas time, a customer comes into your shop with a cheque from America; if the cheque is changed in the shop and deposited in the bank by the trading concern, the bank allows 6/11½ for the dollar.  If the recipient, however, presents himself, or herself, at the bank and changes the cheque himself, or herself, at the counter, he or she gets 7/- for the dollar.  If you are standing in a country shop at Christmas time, trying to explain to your customer the operations of exchange control, and he gives you a 20-dollar bill to change for him, he goes away muttering: &ldquo;Well, we have been stuck for 10d, whoever stuck us&rdquo; and the implication always is, of course, that you stuck him.  The mortifying part of the transaction is that, when you present this 20 dollars in your lodgement the following day in the bank, all you get is 6/11½, so you have neither your share nor your credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now these are considerations.  They are not familiar to the residents of Dublin but they are familiar to the residents of Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, west of the Shannon, west Cork, Kerry and Clare, and you would be surprised at how much misunderstanding they give rise to.  I should be glad to know from the Minister whether anything can be done to eliminate this differential.  I think it is a survival of a period when it was desired to limit, or restrict, trading transactions which involved the use of what used to be called &ldquo;hard currency&rdquo;.  Whereas the dollar is no longer hard currency, I cannot see what the reason is for the retention of this differential, at least in the internal banking practice of the Republic of Ireland.  I suggest to the <Col N="709" /> Minister that it would now be reasonable to suggest to the joint stock banks that the reason for maintaining this differential no longer exists and that there should be a current exchange rate for dollars, whether presented in the form of dollar bills or dollar cheques, and whether tendered for exchange by the recipient or by a third party.</P>
    <P>There is the further complication in this domestic problem that some cheques come from America expressed in dollars: &ldquo;Pay Mary Tommy 10 dollars,&rdquo; and you work that out at 6/11½d. a dollar.  The next customer turns up with: &ldquo;Pay Mary Regan £3 10s.&rdquo;.  She gets her £3 10s. whereas the woman who got the 10 dollars gets only £3 9s. 7d.  All that could be eliminated if the joint stock Banks paid all and sundry 7/- for a dollar, or whatever the appropriate rate of interest is for the day.  I do not ask that business people should be exempted from the ordinary exchange fluctuations.  That is one of the hazards of trade and it can happen that the dollar is worth 7/- today, and tomorrow it is worth 6/11½d. or 6/11d.  All I am concerned to ensure is that the differential between the rate of exchange provided for the recipient of a remittance from America and that given to a third party who exchanges the cheque, should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should say for the information of Deputies who are not familiar with rural Ireland that the banks close at 3 o'clock in the afternoons in rural Ireland and at 1 o'clock, as a rule, on Saturdays in most towns. Particularly around Christmas, the bulk of the business is transacted on Saturday afternoons and it is a substantial inconvenience for country people to have either to bring their cheques home or forego the 5d. or 10d. or 1/8d. which falls to be deducted, if they change their remittances in a shop rather than in a bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of dollars is a rather difficult subject, for me, anyway.  The proceeds of American securities sold in dollars are regarded as capital dollars, and I think they are also regarded as hard dollars, but <Col N="710" /> I am not so sure of that point.  They are regarded as capital dollars and are usually re-invested for capital gain. If they are not re-invested for capital gain, they may be sold.  They are, if you like, rather scarce and they are sometimes sold at a slight premium. I do not think there is much difference between soft and hard dollars, apart from that.  That is the only respect in which I can find any slight variation.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Dillon's point, I wonder is he talking about some time back or about the present?  I think for some short time back there has been one rate of interest.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress last night, I was talking about the condition of the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal which flow through the city of Dublin.  The Minister should use his influence with CIE to see that sections of those canals are completely filled in, or if possible, converted into swimming pools.  I do not know what difficulties might arise in this matter because I do not know to what extent the canals supply a draining system to the parts of the country through which they go.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte make a considerable amount of money available for improvement of hotels and I might add that I think we have reached our peak in the construction of hotels.  We are now producing millionaire hotels whereas tourism really needs good-class guest-houses, and good, homely, comfortable, small hotels rather than the big emporiums which are now being erected in every corner of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that loans free of interest should be made available to rural publichouses.  They should be used for the improvement of toilet accommodation and other essentials.  The majority of tourists like to sample the atmosphere of rural licensed houses and avail of whatever else they have to offer.  The amenities in these licensed houses are so appalling that they require assistance from a body such as Bord Fáilte to enable <Col N="712" /> the necessary improvements to be made.</P>
    <P>I want to raise one point concerning the ESB.  In Dublin city, and I am sure all over the country, the man with the scissors comes out at very short notice to the private houses and cuts off the light.  I know the ESB must do their business and collect their accounts, but I suggest the Minister should use his influence with them to ensure that current is not cut off in any private house after 1 o'clock in the day.  People are apt to be forgetful and the account may not be paid on the dot.  In places where there are children or sick people and the current is cut off after 1 o'clock, the head of the house has no opportunity to pay the bill and have it reconnected. A few years ago, when I was a member of Dublin Corporation, I went on a deputation to the ESB, and I understood agreement was reached between the Corporation and the ESB that the current would not be cut off in any house after 1 o'clock.  I think the Minister should raise this matter with the ESB with a view to achieving a more satisfactory solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>Some 18 months ago, I asked the Minister a question in relation to pensions of CIE workers and he told me he had no function in the matter. Subsequently, I contacted CIE.  Deputy T. O'Donnell mentioned last night that, because of alterations in the system at the workshops in Limerick, he feared there might be a lot of redundancy.  If there is redundancy throughout the country, due to curtailment of rail services, many of these workmen will be put on pension. Will they be put in the same category as the present CIE pensioners, where 1,315 pensioners are getting less than 12/- a week?  There are 431 pensioners getting between 12/- and 22/-a week and 30 pensioners getting between 22/- and 40/- a week.  In all, there are 2,076 pensioners.</P>
    <P>We have all had representations made to us in relation to Civil Service pensioners, Garda pensioners, pensioned teachers and various other pensioners.  We have all sympathised with them and we have done our little <Col N="713" /> bit to raise the level of their pensions. I think these CIE people are the worst treated pensioners in the country.  The Minister, even at this late stage, should use his influence with the Board of CIE to get the position of these men improved.  In the case of the men getting 12/- a week pension, I know many of them have to pay 1/2 a week to go into the city centre to collect their pensions.  The position is ridiculous, and I appeal to the Minister to see if anything can be done for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a question which, I think, calls for review by the Oireachtas.  There has been very hard criticism of the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann from many quarters.  The House ought to recall to its mind that we are the ultimate authority.  The Chairman of CIE could have sat comfortably in his job as Chairman of Bord na Móna, where he was perfectly happy and where he was generally credited with a very large measure of success and prestige.  He was asked by the present Government to relinquish that position and take over the chairmanship of CIE at a very difficult time and to carry out Government policy in regard to CIE. Yet, strangely enough, I detect a tendency to direct the main volume of criticism against the Chairman of CIE who is carrying out the policy laid down by the Government chosen by Dáil Éireann.  I suggest to the House that the Minister for Transport and Power is the person who must answer for the policy decisions which are being given effect to by the Chairman of CIE and the chairmen of the other State bodies for which the Minister is responsible to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister is himself in a considerable degree responsible for drawing on the Chairman of CIE a volume of criticism which I think he ought himself to face and bear, by perennially coming into this House and saying he will not answer this or that question and that it ought to be addressed to the Board of CIE.  The natural consequence of that is that Deputies, who find themselves frustrated and <Col N="714" /> aggrieved by developments in connection with the public transport system, associate them with the Chairman of the company, when in fact a more patient examination of the problem would convince them of the fact that the Minister is the responsible person and that it is he who should be brought to account.</P>
    <P>I deprecate generally the practice of discussing people who are not members of this House.  I think it requires to be said, however, that the Chairman of CIE has undertaken a very difficult job, when he could have remained in a very comfortable job.  I believe him to be an irreconcilable supporter of the present Government in politics: but that, in my respectful submission, is nobody's business but his own.  Provided he does his job, he is entitled to be an ardent supporter of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, or Fianna Fáil.  He is an extremely able man.  I believe he is doing his job in a very difficult situation.  I believe many of the things he is doing, and to which I am about to refer, are misguided and wrong.</P>
    <P>I believe he is doing them as part of a policy which has been laid down for him by the Minister for Transport and Power who is authorised to do this by the Government of the day.  I believe his position requires him to give effect to the general lines of policy laid down for him by the Government of which he is indirectly the servant.  Therefore, any remonstrance I have to make, I should address to the Minister for Transport and Power.  If I have any comment to make on the Chairman of the company in regard to malfeasance on his part&mdash;I know of no malfeasance on his part&mdash;it is that I believe he is carrying out a policy which in many respects I believe to be misguided, but there it is.</P>
    <P>It seems perfectly clear that the Minister has now made up his mind to tear up a great part of the rail system of this country.  I believe that process is being carried too far, and I think it is being done without that kind of consultation with local people which would be calculated in some measure to reassure them as to the development which has taken place. <Col N="715" /> I have a personal interest in the branch line which is situated where I live and transact business.  It is right that my colleagues should know that, quite apart from my public interest in that branch line, I have a private interest in it.  It serves my business; I have business relations with it.</P>
    <P>They say they are going to save £9,000 odd a year by closing it down. Maybe they are.  I do not know and no steps have been taken to bring home to the mind of the people in that area how that saving is arrived at.  I often wonder if the Minister considered what it means to a country town to be informed that the railways are closing down.  It does not only mean that the train comes in no more. It means that five, six, seven or eight households, represented by railway employees, are now out of work.</P>
    <P>I admit that the railway company try to help the employees but we should not, in this House, be indifferent to the problem of the man of 50 years of age who is suddenly told that he must translate himself and his family to the other ends of the country or else go out on a very small pension. I have seen this happen very widely in my constituency in County Monaghan where the Minister, preparatory to his arrival, succeeded in tearing up every mile of the railway line in the whole county.  County Monaghan has the distinction of being represented in this House by one of the most junior members, the Minister for Transport and Power, who has taken up every mile of railway in the county.</P>
    <P>Apart from the commercial dislocation that gave rise to ever since it was done, I have been in practically continuous correspondence with Córas Iompair Éireann about the cases of individual men who were either required to travel daily between Ballybay and Dundalk in order to carry on their work or who had to retire on very small pensions at a time when they anticipated being allowed to work for another ten or 15 years in the railway service or who were transferred to such distant parts of the country in the railway service that it was no longer possible for them to <Col N="716" /> maintain the homes which they built and established in County Monaghan. I often wonder whether these kinds of considerations weigh sufficiently when the decisions are being taken to wind up a particular branch line. I doubt it.  I think they ought to be considered.</P>
    <P>We speak casually of saving £9,000 a year on the branch line between Ballaghadereen and Kilfree Junction. Yet that will result in the unemployment of probably seven or eight men in that area.  I do not know what their wages come to but they must come to some pretty substantial sum.  The bulk of that saving, I should say, is represented by the wages earned by those people who will all disappear out of that district or else their incomes will be very substantially reduced and they will have to take small pensions in lieu of the permanent employment they had. I am not satisfied that due regard is being had to that element of the situation prior to the decision being taken.</P>
    <P>Again, there is some talk of closing down the branch line from Ardee, on the main Dublin-Belfast line.  I think there is only one station on that line, Ardee, and then straight down to the main line.  If that spur&mdash;I will not call it a branch line&mdash;from the main line to Ardee closes down, the amount of disruption, inconvenience and annoyance caused in the area will be out of all proportion to any economy that can reasonably be estimated by such a closure.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate a complaint which I mentioned here before.  Public representatives and local people, when there is a rumour of a line closing down, go to Córas Iompair Éireann and ask them: &ldquo;What receipts do you get on goods and passenger traffic on this line which you now propose to close down?&rdquo; The reply of Córas Iompair Éireann is that they will not tell you.  If the people want to know why, CIE reply: &ldquo;Because if we told you, the information would be irrelevant to the argument which induced us to close the branch line.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is all wrong.  CIE are quite entitled to say: &ldquo;There are the figures.&rdquo;  When the local people base their argument on them.  CIE are quite <Col N="717" /> entitled, in subsequent discussions or conversations, to produce their auditors or accountants and say: &ldquo;Here is Mr. Robinson, or whoever the accountant may be, and he will explain to you that what looks quite simple really is not relevant at all.  You asked us to tell you what moneys were received at the stations on this branch line. Those are the figures.  We have them now and you are basing all your case on these figures.  In fact, these figures are wholly irrelevant to the argument by which we justify the closing of the branch line.&rdquo;  It is all right to make that argument but what is all wrong is to say to the local people: &ldquo;You want the information.  We will not give it to you because it would be no use.&rdquo;  That is causing infinite annoyance.  It is rotten public relations and it is creating a mountain of misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>The local people can argue that the figures are relevant.  At least they feel their case is being heard and they have been given reasonable opportunity to argue its merits but, so long as the vital facts concerning the receipts pertaining to any branch line it is proposed to close down are withheld from the people, they will continue to feel that CIE are not giving them the information to which they are entitled and which, by implication, they were promised when the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, said that no branch line would be closed without full and adequate prior discussion with the local people.</P>
    <P>Governments can trample on public opinion in restricted areas and get away with it but it is not a good thing to do.  I remind the Minister that, even though the Chairman of CIE comes to him and says: &ldquo;I do not want to give these figures because they would only mislead the local people,&rdquo; the Minister ought to say to the Chairman of CIE: &ldquo;Listen: you have never held elective office in your life. What you may know about turf and about railways may be worthy of great praise but your experience of politics, or public relations such as a politician is required to have, is not worth a halfpenny.  Surrounded by your accountants and officials, you may <Col N="718" /> think that if a figure is not relevant, it is a waste of time to provide it but you are quite wrong.  Go and provide that figure and, having done that, go ahead and make any argument you like to the people but do not take up the `hoity-toity' attitude of saying that it is not good for them to know that figure and because you think it is not good for them, you will not give it to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A wider issue arises to which I want to direct the attention of the Oireachtas.  In 1958, we passed a Transport Act which was a very radical measure because it relieved CIE for the first time of its obligations as a common carrier.  Those obligations were pretty onerous and had been borne by the transport companies of Great Britain and this country ever since the first Railways Acts had been passed.</P>
    <P>We also, by implication, in the 1958 legislation delegated to CIE the authority to determine what branch lines should be closed and what should be kept open.  We relieved them of the obligation they had borne up to then to maintain the existing railway network because, prior to 1958, if they wanted to close down a line, there was a most elaborate procedure laid down by the legislature calling for public inquiries and notices and a whole paraphernalia of procedure, designed to restrict their right to close lines, so that, in effect, by the 1958 Act, we relieved them of two very heavy responsibilities which they had accepted and discharged up to then.</P>
    <P>Since then, we have gone on to provide them with substantial additional capital to complete their dieselisation programme.  It is true that, as of today, steam engines are no longer used on our railway system, except in shunting yards and in minor work of that kind and in the foreseeable future, their use will be no longer necessary at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as it was possible for the Oireachtas, we have put within reach of CIE the means to modernise their equipment fully.  Has the time <Col N="719" /> not come when there is a corresponding obligation on Oireachtas Éireann to ask itself: &ldquo;Should we not now review what is the appropriate status of CIE?  Should they still have the kind of monopoly in public transport they enjoyed so long as they continued to bear the burden of common carrier and the maintenance of the then existing rail network, economic or uneconomic, and of the relatively antiquated equipment of which they then disposed for the want of capital to replace it? I think the time has come when we should at least inquire into this <i>de novo</i> as to whether, in their new status, CIE, at least in respect of freight, should not be asked to face free competition.</P>

      <P>I ask the House to note that I am deliberately using language of restraint and moderation in this matter.  I am not prepared to go the length of saying the time has come, because I admit the matter would have to be very closely examined, but I am induced to say that I want to see it examined by the knowledge that there is in existence powerful evidence to suggest that the time has come to make the change.  The evidence is that side by side with the CIE service at present operating, there is a restricted number of persons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who have plates which entitle them to engage in freight transport.  Some have full licences to engage in all freight transport over the whole country; others have restricted areas; while others have restricted categories of merchandise.  One man who had four lorries plated, and who was licensed, I think, to trade over the whole country for a whole range of merchandise, recently offered his plates for sale.  He was offered £12,000 for them, presumably for the four lorries as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, only for the plates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Only for the plates. These would not constitute a very large <Col N="720" /> figure as they were used lorries in any case, but in fact, the offer was for the plates.  For the right to operate four lorries, a man was prepared to put down £12,000.  That man could have put that money into the National Loan and drawn £720 a year on it without raising a finger, so that he was prepared either to forgo an income of £720 a year or borrow the money from the bank and pay £720 a year before he earned a penny.  But he thought it was a good bargain.</P>
      <P>We have to ask ourselves for whose benefit is transport provided in the community.  Surely it must be, in the last analysis, for the consuming public and if it transpired that we could get freight transport to the consuming public on very much cheaper terms by letting it be operated freely on ordinary commercial terms, leaving CIE, with all the advantages we have bestowed on them through the provision of capital, the existence of goodwill they have on the railway system and so forth, to operate freely in competition with anybody else who wanted to engage in trade, if in these circumstances we could get for the public a better and cheaper service, what is the argument against doing that?</P>
      <P>I should like to have that examined. I am quite prepared, if it is adequately inquired into and if fair attention is given to the arguments of all, to be convinced that there is some flaw in my reasoning but I have certainly reached the stage at which I think in regard to those who are transporting livestock, agricultural produce, industrial produce, raw materials and finished articles throughout the country and to ports of export, that we ought realise how substantial a part of their expenses is the cost of transport and how great a benefit it might be to our fundamental industries if that traffic were made available at a lower cost as a result of competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will always be argued that there will not be any reduction, that competition never does reduce prices for anybody.  That argument held the field for a long time until Mr. Monnet thought up the Common Market. Now everybody is trying to scramble into the Common Market. <Col N="721" /> Why?  Because it provides free trade, no more than that.  When you listen to all the ballyhoo and brouhaha that is going on about the Common Market, it must be remembered that we are simply going back to free trade competition.  When you hear people talking about the Common Market, you would think we were in the presence of the eighth wonder of the world but it is simply going back to the situation which I remember in 1922 when there was absolutely free trade in this country.</P>
    <P>I suppose there are some young Deputies sitting up there who think the Common Market is the greatest miracle since Moses struck the rock and that nobody but their great champion, Seán Lemass, could lead us into it.  We were all sitting comfortably in it 40 years ago and we never knew it was there.  I wonder if a little of the atmosphere of the Common Market were brought into our domestic transport would it not give us better results?  How does the Minister explain that in Europe he is a passionate advocate of free trade but that in Ireland he is a passionate advocate of restriction?  I do not understand. Mind you, I can advance an argument for the limitation of the transport industry in passenger traffic to a public authority and I make no apology for that dichotomy of thought.  I think there is a distinction between passenger traffic and freight traffic.  On another occasion, I should be prepared to argue it.  All I am arguing now is that the time is ripe for a re-examination of national policy in regard to freight traffic.</P>
    <P>I am not persuaded that such an examination is yet required in relation to passenger traffic, which I believe for a variety of reasons must, for the time being at any rate, be left in the hands of a nationally-controlled monopoly.  I listened to Deputy Belton's down-to-earth commonsense.  I always have the most profound regard for what he says but I must confess that my blood momentarily ran cold when he asked the Minister to examine the question of the canals in Dublin and to recommend to CIE that some of them should be filled in.  I exhort the Minister not <Col N="722" /> to fill in the canals.  They have a very great amenity value in any city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He could stop them from being filled in the way they are being filled in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, if they are not being used by the public transport company, that it is not fair to insist that CIE should bear the full cost of their maintenance.  I suggest the Minister should consult with the Minister for Local Government, with the Minister for Education and of course with the Minister for Finance, to see that appropriate steps are taken to preserve the canals for their amenity value, as a feature of the city, because canals can be an added beauty to the city, but over and above that, I want them maintained because they could be of great benefit if they were appropriately maintained as public swimming places for children who cannot afford regularly to go to Blackrock Baths, or any of the other baths on the perimeter of the city.  The plain fact is that so long as children are children and so long as the canals are there, the children will swim in them.  It would be well worth while to make them safe and sanitary for that purpose.  I do not believe the cost would be prohibitive and I do not believe that the consequence of doing it would be anything but beneficial to the city as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over and above the amenity value of the canals in Dublin, and it was to them that Deputy Belton primarily referred, I want to point out&mdash;and I hope that in this the Minister does not require conviction&mdash;the tourist value of the canals in rural Ireland is incalculable.  Provided the Inland Fisheries Trust are helped to maintain the stocks of coarse fish in these canals, they would be a most fruitful source of revenue, with the peculiar advantage that they will bring tourists to a part of the country which has very little else in the way of tourist traffic and bring a type of tourist to whom the accommodation available in these areas is singularly attractive. They are the type of tourists who do not want luxury hotels.  They are the type of tourists who do not want the <Col N="723" /> impersonal atmosphere of a hotel. They are the type of tourists who seek a guest house and who want, if possible, to be received into a home.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience in the constituency I represent, in Monaghan, that since we built up, through the Inland Fisheries Trust, the coarse fishing resources of the county, there is not a town in the county which is not drawing in annually a very substantial tourist revenue.  The money is not going into luxury hotels; it is going into the homes of the people in these towns who have adapted their homes for the reception of guests.  There are some small hotels catering for the trade also and they are doing very well out of it but the more we can develop that kind of tourist trade, the more the income of the tourist trade will be spread over the country and not concentrated in Dublin, Cork, Killarney and certain other traditional tourist centres.</P>
    <P>One of the most valuable means to that end is the maintenance and development of our canals.  We are all charged from time to time with having a King Charles' head, and perhaps this is mine, but these things have to be repeated because people do not understand them and one must keep on repeating them, if one wishes people to understand them.  I make no apology for reminding the House that the canals have a peculiar value and appeal to the tourist population most readily available to us, the people of the north and midlands of England. Anybody who has been through the Manchester Ship Canal or through any of the smaller canals across the Black Belt of England is amazed to see the banks of these canals lined every Saturday afternoon with middleaged men, solemnly fishing, taking out perch and other coarse fish, admiring them, taking them off the hook, putting them back into the canal and in 10 minutes or so doing the same thing all over again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They are there to catch fish.  The interesting thing is that if one of them put a fish into his fishing <Col N="724" /> bag and brought it home, he would be regarded as a public enemy by the others.  They would regard it as a most unsportsmanlike thing to do because it would be reducing the number of fish in the canal.  What they want is the sport of catching fish.  People do not eat foxes but they ride all over the country in red coats, silk hats and high boots to run them down.  Is it not more reasonable to go out and catch a fish and put it back in the water than to hunt a fox and tear it to bits at the end of the day?  I am all for the man who will catch a fish and put it back with loving care, in the hope that it will turn up again on the following Saturday and make the cork bob again.</P>
      <P>I have fished sufficiently to be able to renew my enthusiasm at the sight of the cork bobbing and slowly disappearing and then the crucial strike coming.</P>

      <P>That is fishing and I wish I could arouse the House to the realisation of how valuable a potential tourist asset it is.  If I could do that, I would have done a good day's work.  The Minister has flirted with the idea of suffering the canals to be closed up.</P>

      <P>I only said you flirted with the idea and silent flirtation can be as alarming as vocal adulation.  All I am asking the Minister to say is that it is not the policy of the Government to close down the canals and, if the company regards their maintenance as an unreasonable charge, that adequate measures will be taken to transfer their responsibilities to some other authority; <Col N="725" /> but it must not remain within the discretion of the company to close them down as being no longer necessary for public transport.  If we do not require them for that purpose, they are necessary for other purposes and it is the Minister's responsibility to see that they are kept going and that they are not closed up.</P>
      <P>This desire of living a lie is a kind of disease of Fianna Fáil.  They always want to present a kind of fraudulent euphoria to our people.  I remember well the days of the paper republic. We were not a republic but we were one.  We were prepared to do everything about the republic but to declare it.  They never can come down to state the hard facts and then to ask the people, having presented the facts to them, to act accordingly.  There has appeared in the terminology of the Minister's Department in recent years another typically Fianna Fáil euphemism, the &ldquo;operating surplus.&rdquo; They will not ask us to face the fact that every single company over which the Minister presides, with the exception of the ESB, is operating at a loss. I think the nation is strong enough to face the facts and to determine on the merit of the fact what is best to be done.  And there is no use attempting the alibi that the accounts reveal an operating surplus.  That means nothing at all.  You can either say that we keep no accounts or that we keep true accounts but it is deplorable to say that we keep fraudulent accounts and then expect the public to accept them.  The phrase &ldquo;operating surplus&rdquo; is entirely venal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is true, well and good.  Let us analyse that.  I do not know if the Minister's attention has been drawn to an article of 1st August, 1962.  The article sets out, to the best of the writer's ability, from the published reports of the Electricity Supply Board, to ascertain what it costs the ESB per annum to generate electricity from turf and the conclusion reached is:</P>
      <P>...the Ringsend (coal/oil), Ferbane (milled peat) and Lanesborough (sod peat) power stations were all commissioned during 1957 and 1958; they all consist of 20 or 30 units, and last year they all operated at load factors between 48 per cent. and 56 per cent. so that their performance can fairly be compared. Whereas the total cost per unit sent out from Ringsend was only .854d, the figures for Ferbane and Lanesborough were respectively 1.107d and 1.031d&mdash;Ferbane having had a slightly lower load factor than Ringsend, and Lanesborough a slightly higher load factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This suggests that the cost of producing electricity from peat is at present 20 per cent. greater than the <Col N="727" /> cost of production in power stations using oil or imported coal under comparable conditions.  The cost of production in the Arigna station using native coal would appear to be about 50 per cent. higher at comparable load factors&mdash;the price paid for Arigna coal being almost £4 per ton last year, as against about £2 12s. to £2 15s. per ton for imported coal.  In the small 5 mw. power stations in western coastal areas which use sod peat, production costs would seem to be about twice as high, as in the case of the larger stations using oil or imported coal.  If these cost relationships are followed for the whole range of peat-fired power stations already built, or currently planned, it would mean our overall electricity production costs during most of the 1950s has been artificially increased by about 10 per cent. as a result of the social decision to employ peat for electricity production. </P>
    <P>If you turn to the report of the Electricity Supply Board, you find the revenue from sales for the year ending 31st March, 1962, was £17.7 millions.  If it is true that the use of peat generally operated to increase their costs by 10 per cent., it is not unreasonable to say that it represents an annual charge of about £1.7 million.  Bord na Móna in the year in question showed a loss of £94,000, owing to adverse weather conditions, but, in fact, the loss in that year could, I think, fairly be described as a loss of £1,794,000 because what they do is to ascertain their production costs, that is, what they charge the ESB for the peat used in the station and the ESB pass on the increased cost referred to in the article to the consumer in the form of increased charges which, it is estimated, represent about 10 per cent. of the total cost.</P>
    <P>You may say perfectly legitimately that, against that, Bord na Móna employ a great many people; that they relieve the balance of payments in that we use a native product in lieu of importing oil or coal, or something else, and, taking one year with another, they sometimes make a profit <Col N="728" /> and sometimes make a loss, but ordinarily the profit and loss account shows a surplus.  I think their profit has sometimes gone up to some hundreds of thousands of pounds.</P>

      <P>They sometimes show a profit.  Sometimes they show a loss. Add to that the £1.7 million and we are losing £1,000,000 a year on the use of turf, but, as against that, we are giving the employment, saving the imports, using up a raw material which otherwise might not be used at all and, in any case, part of that loss is used in draining and developing the bog which, otherwise, would not be drained or developed.  I do not think the country requires to be sheltered from the knowledge of those facts.</P>

      <P>That is all very well, but I suggest that Deputies, as to 90 per cent. of them sitting behind the Minister at the moment, never heard the calculation based on the proposition that the probable annual cost of generating electricity from turf is in the order of £1.7 million.  That is a substantial sum, and one would have to be able to show some value for it before one could justify it.</P>
      <P>Remember the way this is collected. It is not collected from the taxpayer. That particular levy is collected from the users of power and, mark you, there are some industrialists who have considered coming to this country and, having examined the cost of power, have said to themselves: &ldquo;No; on that basis of cost, we could not operate&rdquo;.  Others have found they could carry that cost and have established their industries here.  But it has operated to exclude certain industrial enterprises from this country where it was felt by the promoters that the cost appeared to be too heavy an overhead charge; and we ought to have that person before our minds when we take a decision of this kind.</P>
      <P>Now I come to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte and Aer Rianta.  There is a forest of interlocking companies through which it is extremely difficult to tread one's way.  I think it is quite a revelation to quite a number of Deputies here that we lose annually on the airports something like £500,000.  We lose that on the operation of the airports. Now I want to be as clear as crystal on this.  I have always thought Aer Lingus give a first-class service.  I have always believed we should have a service like Aer Lingus under our own control, in the day and age in which we live, giving us air contact with the outside world.  If it has to be subsidised, I believe we must pay a subsidy to keep it going, and I think for the subsidy we are paying to Aer Lingus, we are getting very good value, and a service of which this country has every right to be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never forborne from saying <Col N="730" /> that in this House and outside it.  I have never hesitated to comment on the admirable organisation, and so forth, represented by Aer Lingus, the astonishingly high standard maintained by the personnel who man Aer Lingus, the admirable quality of the service, and last but not least, the unique ability of Aer Lingus pilots to set down an aeroplane here or abroad without shaking the back teeth out of your jaws.  It is an art not shared by pilots on many airlines in the world, and I have travelled on a good many in my day.</P>
    <P>Every service is, I suppose, susceptible of improvement but, comparing Aer Lingus with other great services operating in Europe and the United States of America, I cannot readily recall any service I would consider to be superior to Aer Lingus, but I have one slight criticism to make. It very often happens that when we work out a system for ourselves which is the envy of our competitors, we are inclined to be fascinated by some foreign practice and feel a kind of <i>malaise</i> until we have adopted it, just to be up to date.  I draw the Minister's attention to this, although it is something which could be more appropriately dealt with by the directors of Aer Lingus.  I have mentioned it to them but it is relevant to our consideration of general policy.</P>
    <P>It may be that with the development and growth of air transport, it is no longer possible to preserve the air of informality which was one of the great attractions of Aer Lingus.  When you went to the air terminal at Dublin, you did not feel absorbed as you did at Orly, or London, or Washington, or New York, into an immense machine in which one became a mere digit passing through a vast calculating machine that disgorged you into an aeroplane which landed you on the streets of Paris, New York, Washington, London or wherever it happened to be.  Perhaps that was intended for a more expeditious handling of passengers.</P>
    <P>I found myself at the airport in Dublin walking up stairs&mdash;I do not know if Deputies have had this experience&mdash;but unconsciously you <Col N="731" /> move through a series of tubular rays and end up in a pen and, by a strange coincidence, everyone else in the pen is destined for the same aeroplane. You then go down a stairs with the contents of the pen; you are led by a charming lady, and you land in the aeroplane.  That may be very efficient and indeed I have no doubt that it is.  There may be others who prefer that system to the more casual atmosphere which obtained heretofore.</P>
    <P>I am bound to say an impression was created in my mind as I stood in the pen and asked myself: &ldquo;Where did I feel this before?&rdquo; The only place I had felt like that before was in the stockyards of Chicago.  When the cattle are being brought to the slaughter house, there is a long narrow ramp up which the cattle pass.  It is very difficult to get the cattle along the ramps and so they have a goat, an experienced goat.  The goat marches up the ramp and the cattle follow. The goat gets to the door of the slaughter house, steps briskly aside on to a platform prepared for him, the cattle pass into the slaughter house, and the goat goes down and takes up his stance again and leads up another block of cattle.</P>
    <P>I asked myself is this atmosphere congenial to air transport.  At Orly, they have given up that system and restored the old system.  I recently read that so well-versed a man as the Chairman of BOAC, Sir Matthew Slattery, said that some of the big English air companies are reaching the stage in air transport where they are treating passengers as if they were cattle.  Why is it that we do not require rail companies or shipping companies to reach that stage?  The air companies are now so efficient that they have ceased to recognise people by whose traffic they live as humans and assert the right to treat them as ciphers.  Aer Lingus should preserve that which Air France abandoned at Le Bourget and that which has been reinstituted at Orly, that is, the recognition that people should not be treated like cattle, even in the sacred cause of efficiency.</P>
    <P>I want to make this clear: let there <Col N="732" /> be no suggestion that passengers at Dublin Airport are treated with any incivility, because the very reverse is the case.  It would be hard to find a staff more gracious, courteous and considerate of passengers, but using this device for the expedition of traffic creates a problem which requires consideration.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that in determining whether a company is making a profit or a loss, it is quite legitimate to say that you do not demand that a company should pay a dividend, if it is a public company, but it is quite illusory to say that if the Government borrow money at an average interest rate of five per cent. and invest it in the ordinary shares of the company, the company can be said to be making a profit, if it does not pay back that investment.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to say that a public company paying no dividend is involving the State in no loss because the State did not get the money out of the air. It borrowed it and the Exchequer is paying £500,000 a year for it.  Unless the company is able to pay the State £500,000 a year to meet that charge, that company is, in effect, losing £500,000 a year.</P>

I think that is a mistake.  We should say plainly and frankly that the company is making a loss and that, on the whole, we can justify that loss, balancing the advantages against the disadvantages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said yesterday, the 1936 Act put a floor under agricultural workers' wages and the Agricultural Wages Board was set up in that year.  The idea was originally introduced by the British Government in 1917 in the Corn Laws.  The 1936 Act was almost an exact copy of the 1917 Act and gave the agricultural worker a basic rate of wages.  With the adoption of that Act, the country had an enlightened method of providing wage-fixing machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the Wages Board in 1936 was undoubtedly a good idea, but more than a quarter of a century has since passed.  We feel that the Wages Board is now an anachronism and that it has outlived its usefulness.  Under the Labour Court, there has been devised a system of fixing wages and working conditions&mdash;joint labour committees, as they are called&mdash;which has been working very well in all phases of industry. It is rather too bad that in the year 1962 farm workers should be made to feel that the law for fixing their wages and conditions is this: the wages for the first-class type of worker are fixed by these committees and the wages for the second-class type of worker, the agricultural worker, are fixed by a different body and under a different system.  In view of the fact that we expect to go into the Common Market, where the rate of wages and conditions <Col N="734" /> for agricultural workers bear a close resemblance to those of the industrial worker, we feel the Government must find at this stage a better way of dealing with the agricultural worker than the Agricultural Wages Board, and we suggest that better way is a joint labour committee.</P>
    <P>An agricultural joint labour committee operating under the auspices of an impartial and independent body like the Labour Court would be completely free and removed from any circumstances which might tend to influence the decisions of an agricultural wage fixing body.  The same cannot be said of the present Agricultural Wages Board.  The present chairman of the Board is a former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture; retired inspectors of the Department are appointed as &ldquo;neutral members&rdquo;; and the administrative staff of the Agricultural Wages Board are traditionally officers of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>One group of people I have always admired are the inspectors of the Wages Board.  They do with a great deal of tact a job not considered a very nice one.  The fact that agricultural employers who break the law by paying less than the minimum of wages rarely appear in court is proof of the tact shown by these inspectors.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the extraordinary powers vested in the chairman of the Board&mdash;virtually dictatorial powers&mdash; there are good grounds to doubt the wisdom of placing the control and administration of the agricultural wage-fixing authority in the hands of the Department of Agriculture, as the Department is a substantial employer of agricultural employees who are seeking improved conditions of employment.  The Department has resisted the claims of its own employees by taking refuge behind the Agricultural Wages Board, notwithstanding the fact that the Board's powers do not extend to the regulation of conditions of employment.  They quote the hours laid down by the Wages Board, 50 hours per week.  They talk about the fact that they cannot get away from that, even though they know that according to the terms of the Act, the fixing of hours of work is <Col N="735" /> apparently not the function of the Wages Board.</P>
    <P>The annual reports of the Agricultural Wages Board, which are laid on the Table of the House, strongly suggest that some hidden hand in the Department of Agriculture not only influenced the Board on one occasion but went so far as to usurp the privileges of the members of the Board, namely the initiation of wage fixing proposals.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware the members of the Board are appointed for a period of three years by the Minister for Agriculture and the new members of the Board take office on 1st January.  An interesting story is told about the proceedings of the first meeting of a newly-appointed Board held during the first week of January some years ago.  The outgoing members of the Board whose term of office expired on 31st December had made a wages order coming into operation on 3rd January&mdash;a few days later.  When the new members sat down to transact the business of their first meeting there on the table lay a draft amending order, obviously prepared by a parliamentary draftsman&mdash;a closely-typed document of 15 pages, containing 11 tables of wages and four tables of perquisites, which has not yet been equalled in legal ingenuity.  Now, the big question is: how did that draft amending order get to the Board meeting on 13th January ahead of the newly-appointed members of the Board?  In fact, the Board were the only people entitled to initiate the amending order and they did not come into existence until 1st January.</P>
    <P>Normally a proposed wages order or an amending order is drafted following the passing of a resolution of the Board to give effect to the resolution or a series of resolutions.  The mystery of where this document came from has never been cleared up.  To this day it is not known who ordered the preparation of this complicated draft amending order which was not prepared pursuant to a resolution of the Board and which was placed before newly appointed members of the Board at their first meeting.  However, two assertions can be made: the document <Col N="736" /> was drafted by a parliamentary draftsman and the present Minister for Agriculture was in no way responsible. The obvious conclusion is that somebody in the Department was responsible.</P>
    <P>So much for the independence of the Agricultural Wages Board under the surveillance of the Department of Agriculture.  So long as the agricultural wage fixing body is virtually part of the Department of Agriculture, despite its outward appearance of independence and separate identity, this unsavoury pressure could be exercised again&mdash;if people in high places in the Department do not agree with the Board's policy.  This kind of pressure could be exercised through the chairman who holds office during the pleasure of the Minister for Agriculture. No such pressure or influence could be brought to bear on an agricultural joint labour committee operating under the auspices of the Labour Court, by the Department of Agriculture or anyone else.  There is no point in the Minister denying that improper influences were brought to bear on the Agricultural Wages Board in the past and the best guarantee of fair play that can be given for the future is the transfer of the agricultural wage-fixing authority to the impartial atmosphere of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>It is desirable and important that the agricultural wage fixing authority should be an independent body and should be seen to be independent. The vast majority of farmers and farm workers believe that agricultural wages are fixed by the Government, and members of the Government have claimed credit for increases in wages granted by the Agricultural Wages Board.  We are all aware that if a wage increase is granted in close proximity to an election and if it suits the Government in power, they occasionally claim credit for that increase. Fortunately, this undesirable state of affairs does not apply to the various occupations and thousands of workers covered by the joint labour committees which function under the auspices of the Labour Court, and it should not be tolerated in agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> Hitherto we have criticised only the defects or shortcomings of the Agricultural Wages Acts, and the technical aspect of the wage fixing machinery set up under them.  The Agricultural Wages Board also merit severe criticism because they have failed to carry out their obligations properly and have persisted in perpetuating an inadequate wage structure for farm workers which no one, not even the Board themselves, can understand.  At present the minimum wage for adult farm workers aged 20 years and over which operates in 22 counties is £6 per week of 50 hours. This is the highest wage which, in the Board's opinion, the smallest and poorest farm in the Group C area can afford to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the highest wage they think the smallest and poorest farmer can afford to pay.  It is the lowest wage which any farmer will be allowed to pay by law but it is also the highest wage which the Board think the poorest farmer should be asked to pay.  That is where the difficulty comes in.  That is correct.  This starvation wage applies to no less than 80 per cent. of the agricultural workers.  The position about it is that the Agricultural Wages Board fix a minimum rate of wages.  In fixing that rate of wages, they state that they fix a rate of wages which, in their opinion, the smallest and poorest farmer in the country will be able to pay the worst man he employs.  That is freely stated by Agricultural Wages Board officials but the trouble about it is that the small or poor farmer does not employ farm labour.  As a matter of fact, most of the people who operate small farms do the work themselves and, in fact, look for jobs with bigger farmers, with Bord na Móna, with the local authorities and other bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know quite well that that is the situation and has been the situation <Col N="738" /> for quite a long time.  Therefore, we consider it very unfair that, when the Agricultural Wages Board are fixing a minimum rate of wages, they should take into account the income of this smaller farmer.  Statistics will prove it is a fact that the people who employ farm workers in the State are the people with the large farms. Obviously, the Board have been obsessed by the conditions of the small farmers and have ignored the large farmers who employ full-time hired labour.</P>
    <P>Recently, in a discussion, a representative of one of the farming organisations attempted to prove that farmers would not be able to pay a higher rate of wages to farm workers because of the fact that they themselves, from the small farms, were getting an income of only approximately £300 to £400.  It is quite obvious to anybody who stops to think that somebody who is getting a gross income of from £300 to £400 a year is in no position to pay £300 per year to anybody else but he does not have to.  If such people do not do the work themselves, they do not employ hired labour.</P>
    <P>The argument we are making in the Labour Party&mdash;it is an argument with which anybody with a sense of fair play in this House will have to agree&mdash;is that if only the 100 acre farmer and upwards is giving employment for 52 weeks of the year, the basis of wage-fixing should be what that man is able to afford and not what the man who does not employ any labour is able to afford.  That is a fair and genuine argument.  The only way we can suggest we can get around to that is to remove the wage-fixing machinery completely from the control of the Agricultural Wages Board and give the farm workers the same right as every other manual worker who is working for hire.  He should be given the right to have his wages fixed by a joint labour committee, representative of the organised farmers and the organised workers, and to have that the deciding body on wages and working conditions.</P>
    <P>There are three groups, A, B and C.  Most of the country was in group <Col N="739" /> C.  Up to now, group C included such counties as the Model County&mdash;Wexford&mdash;Carlow and Kilkenny.  They were grouped with Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and West Cork.  The Agricultural Wages Board apparently considered that the people in the Model County were not in any better position to pay wages than the people who farm in Mayo, Leitrim, Clare or West Cork.</P>
    <P>I think that in itself shows where the thinking of the Agricultural Wages Board has been all wrong.  Very recently, the Agricultural Wages Board met and solemnly decided they would move some of those counties, or portions of those counties, into group B.  From the next wage adjustment order, if such a thing does occur, those counties will automatically be moved into the second group and instead of having the wage which they have at present, £6 per week, they will automatically have an extra 7/-, giving them £6-7-6.</P>
    <P>Let me go further into the question. When the last wage adjustment took place, another example of muddled thinking was very evident.  While the people in group A, which consists of Dublin county and borough and the urban district of Bray, got from the lofty heights of £6-5-0 per week an increase of 10/-, people in group B who constitute all Clare, a big portion of Cork, around the city, Kildare, portion of Kilkenny, Limerick county borough and County Limerick, the whole of Louth and Meath, Waterford county borough and County Waterford and the remainder of County Wicklow, on their wage of £5-19-0, got 8/- a week as male adult workers.</P>
    <P>Then they came down to group C. Those are the people who are described as &ldquo;the remainder of the country&rdquo;.  They include Wexford, Carlow, North Kilkenny, with Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and West Cork.  They were getting £5-14-0 a week&mdash;a 50-hour week applies in all three areas&mdash; and they got 6/- a week.  Apparently, the people who fix wages on the Agricultural Wages Board were not <Col N="740" /> aware that in Cork, Wexford and Mayo, the same price has to be paid for bread, butter, tea, sugar and everything else as in the rest of the country.  The new rate has been fixed and possibly we can do nothing about it, now.</P>
    <P>A week later, the Wages Board met again to deal with counties that have a female labour rate fixed.  Why that is not the case for the whole country. I do not know.  Those people who had agreed that a 6s. a week increase was the most that could be offered to the agricultural workers in the greater part of the country&mdash;apart from the 10s. to a select few&mdash;decided that the female workers of Dublin and Kildare were entitled to an increase of 8s. a day.  I do not know how they arrived at that.  Certainly I do not begrudge the female workers of Kildare or Dublin their 8s. increase; but I ask the House to consider why a body responsible for taking such a decision should decide also that the general body of farm workers were to get only 6s., bearing in mind that in this country, thank God, the man is still wage-earner and the person who takes responsibility for looking after the family, while his sister, who happens to be working across the border in Kildare, will get 8s. increase.  I do not know how that worked out.</P>
    <P>The reply may be made that these rates compare favourably with wages paid elsewhere.  I should like to point out that in the Six Counties, for instance, in the Belfast area, male workers get eight guineas per week of 47 hours; female workers get six guines which is the same rate as is paid to adult males in the greater part of the Republic.  In Antrim and Down, male workers get £8 5s.; female workers, £6 4s.  In Derry, the figures are £8 3s. and £6 2s. 6d. respectively. In Armagh and Tyrone, just across the Border, the rates are £8 2s. and £6 16s.  In Fermanagh, again only across the Border, the figures are £8 1s. and £6 1s. respectively.  In Britain, for a working week of 46 hours in England and Wales the rates are £8 15s. and £6 11s. 6d.  This is proof enough that the wages being paid to farm workers here are far below what <Col N="741" /> is being paid either across the Border or across the water.  We must conclude that the fault lies, not, perhaps, with the Government or anybody else, but with the wage-fixing machinery, the Agricultural Wages Board which, I suggest, has outlived its usefulness.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear&mdash;and it cannot be repeated too often&mdash;that we agree that the small farmer here at present and for some time past has not been doing well but we also claim that there is evidence to show that the big farmers, those who employ farm-labour, are doing well and should pay the worker a fair wage.</P>
    <P>Farm labour has been growing scarce in some areas and is it any wonder, considering the miserly wage offered, that farm labourers should leave their jobs to get alternative work either here or across the water?  Is it any wonder that we find, over the past 12 months according to the latest statistics, that the number of hired hands who left the country was over 5,000?  It is rather significant that over 3,000 members of farmers' families returned to the land&mdash;proof that there must be some money there.</P>
    <P>In addition to the faults I have described, and which I claim the Agricultural Wages Board are responsible for, there is also the question on which the Minister and I crossed swords a few days ago, the question of boys between 14 and 16 years of age and the Agricultural Wages Board having rates of wages for them, from 16 and under 17; 17 and under 18; 18 and under 19; 19 and under 20.  According to the Agricultural Wages Board, you do not become an adult until you are 20 years of age.</P>
    <P>In reply to my question, the Minister said that in 1936 there were 2,652 boys, under 16, employed in agriculture; in 1946, the figure was 3,962 and in 1951, 3,694.</P>
    <P>If we had up-to-date figures, I think we would find that the number has grown, possibly considerably, because while there was very little machinery on Irish farms in 1936, it was beginning to appear in 1946 and in 1951, it was well established.  Any of us who go to the country find boys of 14, 15 or 16 driving tractors in the <Col N="742" /> fields.  With powered machinery, if the boy is able to manipulate it&mdash;and many of them are&mdash;it is true that there is a type of work which possibly a boy of that age can do as well as an adult. The unfortunate thing is that, as the law stands, no minimum wage is laid down for that boy and he can be employed for 10/- a week.  In fact, there are cases where people have been employed for very little more than that. This is hard work, skilled work and it is too bad that the law of this country allows that practice to continue.  I suggest that the Wages Board could have stopped it to some extent by introducing a system of fixing wages for those aged 14 to 16, but they did not do that and the job should now be handed over to those who will.</P>
    <P>There is another problem in regard to which the Wages Board have very little to be proud and in which their record is as bad as, or worse than, that of any other similar body in this country, that is, the very vexed question of the amount which it costs to feed a man on a farm.  Those of us who have been reared in the country are aware that unless it is a very big farm, the man who is working on it gets the same type of food as the family.  He may not eat at the same table if the farm is big enough and if there is some snobbery there, but by and large, he gets the same sort of food as the family.  The extraordinary thing about it is that if a man is receiving food and is getting £6 a week and is working for six days of the week, his board per day will cost him 6/6d., or 39/- a week.  If he gets lodgings as well, then it will be over the 50/- mark.  If that man has a wife and if, as many workers have, he has a large young family, it is suggested by the Wages Board&mdash;it must be, because they make the regulations&mdash;that out of the £6 he must pay for his insurance stamps and deductions for meals of, say, 39/-.  With the £4 which he has left, he is supposed to be able to pay for food for his wife and family, for rent, for clothing, lighting and all the other things he and his family may require.</P>
    <P>If there is any evidence needed to prove that the Agricultural Wages <Col N="743" /> Board have no conception whatever of the proper treatment of the people who are so important in the agricultural industry, that is the evidence which will go further than anything else to prove it.  It is a fact that these perquisites as they call them, were altered a few years ago but they were not altered, or altered in a downward direction, until the matter was raised in this House.  It required a debate in this House to bring to the notice of the Agricultural Wages Board that they had a responsibility in regard to fixing proper rates for perquisities. Even when they did do that, they still did not go the whole way by putting the thing in order.</P>
    <P>Up to 1959, the Board appear to have ignored the distribution of agricultural employment as revealed in the national farm survey and Government statistics.  If we are at all interested in what everybody likes to call the primary industry, agriculture, when it suits them, those engaged in it for their livelihood must get more consideration. I believe there is not a hope that consideration can be given to them by the Agricultural Wages Board.  I believe they are trying to mess around with that Board and improve it, even as it is, as we attempted to do with an earlier Bill which we withdrew. That cannot be done.  I pointed out previously that one of the qualifications which seem to be necessary to become a neutral member of the Board is to be a Fianna Fáil member of a county council.  There of the present neutral people are such members.  I am not saying that those people are not very decent in their own way but I am saying that they are not people who might understand the interests of farm workers.  The evidence is before us that they do not understand, or if they do, they are deliberately preventing the Wages Board from giving proper decisions in these matters.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier how decisions of the Wages Board are arrived at. There are four workers' representatives and four farmers' representatives and there are three neutral members.  If there is a deadlock, those three can sway it one way or another, or two <Col N="744" /> of the three, and it is rather remarkable from the records of the Board that in 99 cases out of 100, those people, and the people who went before them, have always voted with the farmers' representatives. It may be said that the workers' representatives put up unreasonable proposals but it is true that the decisions have been as I have described.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which more than anything else must be taken into consideration, that is, the fact that in the event of a division of opinion amongst the members of the Board, if four farmers and four workers and two neutrals, or any proportion you like, vote one way and one member of the Board disagrees, the chairman has the right to veto not alone the proposal of the majority but even the proposal of the minority and can bring in a separate order and that order must be carried out.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me if he knows of any wage-fixing machinery in this country or in any other civilised country which makes provision for that sort of thing.  It is too bad that that should be still operating. It does of course put the onus on the chairman as being the person who fixes the wages of farm workers.  I also mentioned before that if a meeting of the Board is convened and nobody except the chairman turns up, because of bad weather or some other reason, the chairman constitutes a quorum and he can make an order which is binding on the farm workers.  The matter became so bad that the trade union which I represent, and which represents farm workers, sent a deputation some months ago to the Department of the Taoiseach to complain about what they considered a gross abuse of the position of the neutral members.  As long as you have the situation where that can recur, you will have an impossible situation where farm workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny were in group C but that they will be changed, soon, we hope, into group B.  Wexford is a good dairying centre where cereals and fruit are grown widely and it is one of the best market centres.  There is no comparison <Col N="745" /> between the position obtaining in Wexford and in Mayo and is it not rather ridiculous when you hear people who are responsible for fixing wages referring to the condition of the small Wexford farmers as a reason why agricultural wages in group C should not be raised over £6?</P>
    <P>It is stated that the proof is that the people on the western farms are getting it very hard to live.  Of course they are, but they do not employ paid labour and what they are doing or not doing has no influence, or should have no influence whatever on the question of what the Wages Board do about minimum rates for farm workers. Minimum rates are laid down but it is not true to say that they are regarded as minimum rates by either farmers or workers.  They are regarded as the standard rates.  They are the rates the farmers try to get away with, and do get away with paying.  Any country that allows an industry to pay its key men £6 a week needs a reshuffle and the only way that can be done is by appointing a joint industrial council.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of perquisites and that the agricultural worker's board is fixed at 6/6d. a day. That is for his meals.  If we accept that, we must also accept it that it costs the farm worker's wife 6/6d. a day to feed her husband.  If we accept that to be the rate to be deducted from the farm worker's pay for his meals, what would it cost the average farm worker, say, a married man with five children, to feed and clothe his family?  That is a good question which the Wages Board have not so far attempted to answer.  We need not ask them to answer it because they will not do it but somebody will have to find the answer to it.  It is quite clear that £6 a week is sufficient to buy only the minimum amount of food.</P>
    <P>When the rate of wages was being fixed this year, an attempt was made to change the age of the adult worker, but without success.  We still have a boy of 19 years of age working over most of the country for £5 5s. for a week of 50 hours.  A boy who is under 19 but over 18 gets £4 10s. and a boy under 18 but over 17 gets £4.  A boy <Col N="746" /> under 17 years of age but over 16 is paid £3 5s. a week.  I continually think about the fact that even a chap who is getting only £3 5s. a week can have a deduction made from his wages of 4/6d. a day for his meals.  If he pays that for his meals, he does not have very much to take home, whether he has a dependent mother or is trying to assist in the rearing of a large family.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked to explain how the Board arrived at the value of meals given to farm workers but apparently the Board refused to get the costs from the Central Statistics Office.  The Board usually allocates about 40 per cent. of the wage increases of the employees to cover meals, even though food prices may not have increased at all.</P>
    <P>We honestly believe that the argument in favour of making a first-class revision of the method of fixing farm workers' wages is overwhelming.  We believe the Government should and, I hope, will adopt the Bill and allow the wages of agricultural workers to be fixed in the very same way as the wages of all other manual workers in the State are fixed.  This will probably have the result of causing a very substantial increase in farm workers' wages the first time it is put into operation. The Minister should not fear that because I am sure he will agree with me that the people who employ these workers are well able to pay these wages.</P>
    <P>I think he will also agree with me that throughout the country the majority of the small farmers are themselves looking for employment to subsidise what they can make from their own farms and, in fact, practically every farmer with a valuation under £50 and £60 and perhaps the people with valuations up to £100 have their sons employed at varying types of work throughout the country, including work on the farms of more prosperous neighbouring farmers.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has a very responsible task and that he realises, no matter what other people may say, particularly city Deputies who may fear that an increase in agricultural wages may cause an increase in the price of foodstuffs, that agriculture <Col N="747" /> is the most important industry in this country.  The interests of the agriculturists must be looked after but I suggest to the Minister and to the House that the interests of the agriculturist are synonymous with the interests of the farm worker because he is the person who keeps the wheels turning in agriculture.  If he is not properly treated, the industry as a whole cannot be expected to prosper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully has spoken at length and has outlined in very great detail the proposals contained in this Bill.  He has done so in such a very factual way that it is difficult to elaborate upon what he has said.  This Bill is a reasonable one.  It is very necessary and long overdue, though I expect the Minister will not agree with that opinion.  The main purpose of our Bill is to bring agricultural wages within the scope of the Industrial Relations Act of 1946, to abolish the present system and to transfer the wage-fixing function of the Agricultural Wages Board to a Labour Court joint committee representative of agricultural employees and employers and appointed by the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>We say that is reasonable.  We believe that the present Agricultural Wages Board is undemocratic in every sense of that word.  It is autocratic and dictatorial.  It is operated from the top, through the Minister's powers, rather than from the bottom upwards as it should be.  It has so-called neutral representatives on it who invariably vote with the employers.  They cannot be said to be neutral, in any sense of the word.  We believe there can be no such thing as neutrals in a matter such as the fixation of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The set-up in the Agricultural Wages Board is absurd inasmuch as the powers and functions of that Board under Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, are confined to fixing minimum rates of wages, overtime rates and the value of perquisites. That is the sole and only function of the Board.  The Minister has stated on many occasions here that the Board have no power to prescribe conditions of employment. <Col N="748" /> We have then the ridiculous situation in which the Board, purporting to represent the workers in the most important industry in the country, are restricted to the mere fixation of wages and have no say at all in the important matter of conditions of work.</P>
    <P>We are asking that that autonomous, dictatorial Board, which have lost the confidence of not merely the workers dependent upon it for fairplay but also the confidence of all fair-minded people in the country, be forthwith suspended.  It is a spent force, suspect in every sense of the word.  It is a negation of democracy. We know of no good reason why agricultural workers should be regarded as second-rate citizens, confined to this particular Board and denied the right of a separate body under the Labour Court.  In asking that this joint labour committee be set up, we are merely asking for something which has been done in most other industries. We envisage a joint industrial council &mdash;I think the Minister's wish would be for such a body&mdash;to deal with this very important industry, a council representing the workers and farmers and all facets of agriculture.  In that way, we should give to agriculture the impetus it needs to stimulate production.</P>
    <P>Production in this most important industry has been stagnant for a long number of years.  We believe one of the primary reasons for that is that labour engaged in agriculture has not been given its rightful place.  It has never been given its fair share of the wealth it creates for the nation.  It is only right and proper that the man who helps to produce the wealth should, in justice and equity, receive a share in it.  We seek in this Bill a new chapter for the agricultural worker, conferring on him a new dignity and status, and putting him on the same plane as general workers. The stigma attaching to this particular group must be eliminated.  If it is not, there will never be any real interest taken in agriculture and there will never be any upsurge in production. Unless fair wages are paid to this important category of workers, the right type of man will not offer <Col N="749" /> for agricultural employment.  Deputy Tully has shown quite clearly that wages here are lower than those that obtain in most progressive countries in Europe, in Great Britain, and even in Northern Ireland.  That situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I have commented upon the powers of the Agricultural Wages Board.  It is strange that this Board should have no say in conditions.  I appreciate there is a body appointed to examine into conditions and to improve conditions and ensure that justice is done. That Board should have been given authority to examine into disputes.  It should be a board of conciliation and arbitration in the real sense.  It is not that.  It does not perform any worthwhile function.  If the conditions of employment made under the Board are not adhered to, the worker has a right to appeal and have his case investigated. The Minister and the House will appreciate that the wise agricultural worker is slow to appeal for investigation into unfair treatment, bad conditions, or too low wages, because, if he does so, he runs the risk of victimisation, not merely by his employer but by the other farmers in the area within a radius of 40 to 50 miles.  Not only is he likely to be dismissed but he is even more likely to be blackballed, completely ostracised in the locality, and his chances of securing work in the area are very slim indeed. He might as well pack his bag, as many have had to do, and go to England.</P>
    <P>The officials do a good job.  Whenever they are called upon to investigate, they do so.  They have won justice for many workers and I compliment them on that, but I also know that the repercussions of such investigations are pretty serious.  The worker must get out of that area because his chances of employment are negligible. It would be far better to have the type of body we suggest, a committee of inquiry which would go down the country, drop in here and there on farmers, and satisfy themselves that conditions as to wages and work are being observed, rather than that a request should have to be made for an investigation.  The worker who is <Col N="750" /> retained at the moment after such an investigation is a very fortunate man. He is one of the few.  Consequently there must be very many cases where the conditions, hours of work and wages paid are not right because the men are in fear and trembling of mentioning it to any public representative, to their union or to anyone else.</P>
    <P>The average wages of an agricultural worker are £6 for a 50 hour week, while the average wages of an industrial worker are £9 10s. for an average 44 hour week.  The comparison there is self-evident.  Apart from that extremely low wage rate, other concealed demands are made upon the agricultural worker, about which the House should know.</P>
    <P>If a worker resides in the farmer's house, he pays 7/3 per day for board and lodging, and one can see that he can pay upwards of £2 10s. out of £6, leaving him £3 10s. to maintain himself, not to mention his wife and family.  That is not enough.  There is also a charge for a cottage.  If a worker lives in a cottage owned by the farmer, he pays 3/- per week.  There is a charge for a plot of ground, with, perhaps, potatoes, of upwards of 3/1 per week.  There is even a charge&mdash; and it was quite recently that I learned this kind of charges could be made in a Christian country; I understood that these perquisites were given, free, gratis and for nothing, to the agricultural worker&mdash;for fresh milk.  That charge is laid down in this document at 1/10 per gallon.  If the worker gets the grass of a cow, he has to pay 2/9 per week for it.</P>
    <P>Obviously somebody in the Department has gone through the conditions appertaining to the agricultural worker with a magnifying glass and a fine tooth comb to extract the last half-penny from him.  I visited many farmers in recent times and I was pleased to see the growth of modernisation, the rearing of hundreds of pigs, the rearing of cattle, all domiciled in most modern buildings with central heating, light and air conditioning. They are fed from granaries on a conveyor system and the refuse is removed by mechanical means.  Nothing was <Col N="751" /> spared to provide for the utmost comfort and health of the animals.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, I have seen a farm worker, his wife and large family, living in a dilapidated house, sometimes in the middle of a farmyard among the animals and the manure, with no sanitation, no light, no heat and no ventilation.  How one is expected to rear a family in such an atmosphere is a nightmare to the worker's wife.  There is the anomaly of this kind of preference being given to the beasts of the field while the utmost disregard is shown for human beings. In those circumstances why should the Minister not ordain that any authority or body he sets up will have power to investigate such conditions?</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the Minister, and the House also, will see the wisdom of adopting this Bill because, as was said earlier, it is a reasonable and practical measure and long overdue. It will give the agricultural worker a new sense of status, well-being and security, and of necessity, it is bound to have a very healthy effect on the agricultural economy as a whole.  We cannot ignore the flight from the land.  We cannot ignore the fact that agricultural work is something that one would wish to escape from, if at all possible.  It is only as a last resort that men go into agricultural work, not to mention women. To have to say that for our major industry is no indication of prosperity in the future.  That is a set of circumstances that must be changed.</P>
    <P>We want to arrive at the happy day when the worker who goes into agricultural employment will feel that he is getting a fair wage and decent conditions of work, that he will have some sense of security and that he will share as he should, in equity and justice, in the wealth which he helps to create. That is our claim for him.  With those sentiments, I recommend this measure to the House.  I sincerely hope the Minister, progressive-minded as he is, no doubt, will have regard to the very excellent speech made by Deputy Tully and the cogent facts which he gave.  Deputy Tully is fully conversant with this problem.  He represents the <Col N="752" /> union which caters for the agricultural workers.  It is to be deplored that more of them do not see the wisdom of joining that union in which they could band together and assert themselves, lift themselves from their knees, give themselves status, manhood and dignity, and claim their rightful share in the wealth of the community to which they are entitled in equity and justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recommend the rejection of the Bill on two main grounds.  In the first place, I believe that the existing machinery for fixing agricultural wages has proved adequate.  It has stood the test of time.  It has benefited the agricultural worker very considerably and, because it is fair to both sides, it is accepted by employer and worker alike.  The existing Acts have effectively put a floor to agricultural wages and no legislation of the kind proposed in the Bill is going to put the genuine agricultural worker in a better position.  Secondly, the Bill is objectionable on a number of points of principle, as I shall show, I hope, later.</P>
      <P>The Bill, in brief, aims at the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board and the transfer of its functions to the Labour Court.  In effect, it seeks to transfer to the Minister for Industry and Commerce functions in relation to agricultural employment which are properly functions of the Minister for Agriculture.  A disposal of functions as between these two Ministers in the way proposed would, I hold, be completely unsound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, the Labour Court and the Industrial Relations Acts were designed primarily to deal with industrial disputes.  They have worked very well in industry but it is extremely doubtful if they would be so successful in agriculture.  Workers and employers in industry are, in general, very fully organised.  It would be difficult, however, to say which of the many rural organisations in the country could be accepted as representative of agricultural employers in questions dealing with labour and wages.  My understanding is that most rural organisations have usually given a <Col N="753" /> wide berth to such matters.  Again, what organisation can be said to be fully representative of agricultural workers?  So far as I know, the only trade union catering for agricultural workers is the Federation of Rural workers, whose permanent membership, according to my information, is only some hundreds, whereas the number of full-time agricultural workers in this country, excluding relatives of farmers, is about 50,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In industry, within any particular trade, there is a great deal of specialisation and of uniformity in regard to materials, methods and standards of work and products.  The same cannot be said of agriculture which can vary from county to county, from district to district and even from farm to farm.  There are also hazards such as weather, crop and livestock diseases of which industry is largely independent.</P>
      <P>Industrialists can as a rule pass on wage increases to consumers in the form of increased prices.  They can also usually accelerate or retard production to take advantage of price variations.  These conditions do not apply to agriculture except perhaps to a very limited extent.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the relations which exist between employer and worker on a farm are not of the same nature as those which exist between employer and worker in other spheres. Farmers normally work alongside their men and the relationship is, therefore, a very personal one.  All these fundamental differences are reflected in the separate legislation dealing with each type of employment, not alone here but in other countries as well.</P>
      <P>In view of the great variety of conditions in agriculture as compared with industry I think it would be true to say that a recommendation of the Labour Court would not have the same effect on those farmers and workers who were not a party to the hearing as it would have in industry and would therefore tend to be ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, wage agreements <Col N="754" /> between employers and workers, when registered by the Labour Court, become legally binding on all workers, and employers of the same classes whether they are parties thereto or not.  In any particular area certain farmers might well be able and willing to enter into a registrable agreement but many others&mdash;and it could be up to 50 per cent. of the whole&mdash; might find such an agreement an unbearable imposition.</P>
    <P>Proposals made by joint labour committees, when adopted by the Labour Court, have statutory effect. These committees consist of employers' members, workers' members and independent members with an independent chairman.  The composition of the Agricultural Wages Board is, of course, similar and there is no reason to suppose that just because the rates of agricultural wages were being determined under the aegis of the Labour Court such rates would be different from those prescribed by a separate board, as at present.  It might be argued that it would be desirable to have all wages determined by the same authority, which would have detailed information as to the wage rates payable in all sectors.  Such an argument would not be valid, in my opinion, since ultimately the wages of agricultural workers are determined by the capacity of farmers to pay.  In any event, information is always available to the Agricultural Wages Board, if they need it, regarding the wages paid in comparable fields of employment.  In addition the Board has available to it, through the area committees, the views of farmers and workers over the entire country.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims in Section 4 to transfer from the Agricultural Wages Board to the Labour Court responsibility for the administration of the legislation dealing with agricultural workers' holidays.  The Labour Court does not administer the legislation dealing with holidays for industrial workers.  This is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  To make the Labour Court responsible for the administration of agricultural workers' holiday legislation would, therefore, be inconsistent with the position relating <Col N="755" /> to the administration of holiday legislation for other types of workers.</P>
    <P>The expressions &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;, &ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; are at present defined in precisely the same manner in both the Agricultural Wages Acts and the Agricultural Workers' Holidays Acts.  It is proposed in the Bill that the Agricultural Wages Acts be repealed and that the Labour Court would, in future, be responsible under the Industrial Relations Acts for the fixing of agricultural workers' wages. It is not proposed to repeal the holidays legislation.  The definitions of the expressions I have referred to would, therefore, have no legal validity in regard to the fixing of agricultural wages but would have legal validity with respect to agricultural workers' holidays.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes in Section 5 that the Labour Court shall establish a joint labour committee to operate in respect of agricultural workers.  This provision would appear to tie the hands of the Labour Court as regards the establishment of the proposed committee.  The 1946 Act, on the other hand, provides that the Labour Court may by Order establish such a committee and lays down a fairly elaborate procedure to be followed before such an Order can be made.  Section 5 of the Bill, accordingly, seeks to deprive the Labour Court of the independence and discretion it now has in the matter of establishing joint labour committees.</P>
    <P>The composition and operation of the Agricultural Wages Board have been criticised and I feel that a useful purpose might be served if I were to put on record how the Board is constituted and how it has discharged its functions over the years.  The Board consists of a chairman and eleven ordinary members, that is, three neutral members, four employers' members and four workers' members. A point has been made of the fact that the present chairman is a retired Secretary of the Department of Agriculture but there is nothing unusual in this, seeing that the Labour Court has frequently been presided over by an <Col N="756" /> official of the State and is, in fact, at present under the chairmanship of a State official.</P>
    <P>The present neutral members of the Board are a university lecturer, a national teacher and an industrialist. They are all people whose integrity is above reproach and none of them has any direct interest in the issues which come before the Board.  The four workers' members who were appointed to the Board were suggested to me by the Federation of Rural Workers, which, as I have already stated is, I believe, the only trade union catering for agricultural workers.  The members representing employers include a person suggested by the Agricultural Association of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the discharge of its functions by the Board, I think I should say that since the Agricultural Wages Act came into operation the agricultural wage rates have been increased on 20 occasions. In the past 20 years, they have been increased 18 times and in the past five years, they have been increased five times.</P>
    <P>All in all, the Bill contains nothing of merit and much that is objectionable. The sponsors must realise that measures on the lines of those proposed are not going to force farmers to pay wages which are beyond their capacity to pay.  In my opinion, it is quite wrong to think that any permanent betterment of the lot of agricultural workers can be achieved merely by transferring from one body to another the functions regulating minimum wage rates, holiday pay and so forth.  For over a quarter of a century, the Agricultural Wages Board has performed its functions satisfactorily and I see no adequate reason for its abolition.  Accordingly, I cannot agree that the Bill should be granted a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this Bill.  I was Minister for Agriculture for six years and if I thought the present machinery could have been improved, I would have introduced the necessary amendment.  I am not contending for a moment that the Agricultural Wages Board machinery <Col N="757" /> is perfect, but having examined this question most diligently during my period of office, I could not find better machinery than the machinery at present operating.  One of the principal purposes I had in mind when I achieved the ambition I set myself when I entered public life, that of becoming Minister for Agriculture, was to see that agricultural workers in this country would attain to a standard of living approximating that enjoyed by industrial workers.  One of the reasons why I want this country to enter the Common Market is that I believe conditions will be created in which it will be possible to get for agricultural workers in this country wages and conditions approximately equal to those enjoyed by skilled industrial workers.</P>
      <P>It is to be borne in mind that the function of the Agricultural Wages Board is not to fix rates of wages. Their function is to fix minimum rates of wages.  The purpose of the Agricultural Wages Board is to lay down a rate of wages below which it is a criminal offence for any employer to pay his worker.  It would be quite a different cup of tea if we were dealing with a body who were charged by the Oireachtas with the responsibility of fixing wage rates in every contract of employment.  Does Deputy Tully suggest it is remarkable that the Fianna Fáil Party and I find ourselves in agreement about this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then let the Deputy go on regretting.  The inter-Party Government did not change this law.  We did not change this law.  It was not because we did not wish the conditions of agricultural workers improved.  The whole purpose of that Government's agricultural policy was to ensure that the position of agricultural workers would steadily improve.  I do not believe <Col N="758" /> in codology or fraud, whether it emanates from Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party.  The whole basis of Deputy Tully's speech here today was that this board were fixing rates of wages to be paid to agricultural workers in this country.  That is not the fact.  It never was.</P>
      <P>It is right that these things should be fully ventilated, lest some people are misled.  We all know perfectly well that in the United States of America, there is a federal minimum wage law. Up to recently, the federal minimum wage was a dollar an hour.  During the present administration, it was raised to 1.25 dollars.  How many people in the United States were working for 48 dollars a week?  Not one per cent. of the population.  The purpose of the federal minimum wage was to ensure that it would be a criminal offence to pay anybody with whom you had a contract of employment less than that figure.  Nobody suggested that that would be the common figure, the universal figure or the ruling rate of wages for the people.</P>
      <P>I feel and the Party whom I lead would feel a grave responsibility if we agreed with the proposals contained in the Bill submitted by the Labour Party and had not given effect to them when we had the chance.  The only reason we did not change this legislation when we were in office was that I, as Minister for Agriculture, advised the Government&mdash;and the Government agreed&mdash;that we could not find a more effective way of protecting the agricultural workers from exploitation by anybody who wished to exploit them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appointed the present chairman of the Board and a better man could not have been got and could not now be got than the man at present presiding over the Board.  He is a past Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, a man with vast administrative experience, a man who spent his whole life in contact with agriculture in this country, utterly divorced from vested interests either on the employers' side or on the employees' side.  In fact, his whole life has been spent trying to advise Ministers of the objective view to be taken by the various vested interests which continually press upon the Minister for Agriculture.  So far as <Col N="759" /> I can see, nobody would have discharged the duties imposed upon him by the legislation passed by this House more scrupulously, effectively or more fearlessly than the present chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board. Certain it is that only a fool of a Minister for Agriculture would seek to coerce the present chairman of the Board to do anything other than what he believed it his duty to do.</P>
    <P>I think it is important that the House should fully grasp the significant fact in regard to the matter laid before us now.  The purpose of this Board is not to fix rates of wages; the purpose of the board is to fix minimum rates of wages.  I do not believe that ten per cent. of the agricultural workers in this country are working at these rates of wages at the present time, for the simple reason that you could not keep a man and pay him this rate of wages He would not stay with you.  There are plenty of people prepared to pay more. Accordingly, the agricultural workers will go, sensibly, and get the highest rate of wages they can for the work they do.</P>
    <P>The only effective way to increase the rates of agricultural wages in this country to a level comparable with those in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is to get for the agricultural industry prices comparable with the prices obtainable in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  These prices are not available to us at the present time. I hope that, when we get into the Common Market on the basis of equality with the other countries, the required machinery will be provided to ensure that our producers will get for their produce as equitable a price as the people get in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  The Board will then be justified in stipulating minimum rates substantially higher than those laid down and the farmers, who will enjoy the better prices available in the Common Market, will conform to the regulations laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board.  One of the deadly sins is to deny the labourer his hire and when farmers are able to afford to pay more without regard to the rulings of the Board, they will feel it incumbent on their consciences <Col N="760" /> to pay them what they are entitled to get, that is, the maximum wage the employer can afford.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that every employer will do that.  I concede that it is a legitimate and even desirable function for the trade unions to organise agricultural workers to ensure that substantial justice will be done by the agricultural workers and those who employ them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fitting during a discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Justice that we should make passing reference to the father of this House, Deputy Everett, as he, for some years, held the portfolio of Justice and any members who appreciate the value of Parliamentary democracy, appreciate the sterling services he has given to the nation. Apart from serving his Party and his constituency, he has served the Irish people well over many years and during that long and honourable service he spent a number of years in the Department of Justice.  During his time in that Department, he brought about many laudable reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion when I reported progress, the Minister was saved by the bell.  I had been drawing attention to the fact that, unfortunately, there existed in the Department, in the Garda Síochána and in the law enforcement department of this State, a virtual reign of terror in which the heads of the Departments have created an atmosphere of fear among the rank and file.  You do not get the best out of any servants, public or private, where there is an atmosphere of dictation, fear, intimidation and a bad <Col N="762" /> spirit generally.  That, unfortunately, is the situation.  In the whole history of the State, I think, the legal arm has never been so bedevilled with fear and intimidation that should be absent from the organ of State which is there to see that justice is done.  I hope there will be a substantial improvement and that the reign of terror will give way to a reign of co-operation.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Minister if he would consider the introduction of a system whereby solicitors on record in court cases would be notified direct from the court offices as soon as the cases in which they are concerned are put in the list.  The Minister said he was satisfied that the system of the <i>Legal Diary</i> which has been operating for many years was adequate and that there was no need to supplement it by direct notice to solicitors on record.  I appeal to him to reconsider the matter. Members of the House, who are not members of the legal profession, may not know of the <i>Legal Diary.</i> It is a document which is printed daily in Dublin during the law terms and it contains, on average, 400 cases listed according to the courts in which they are to be heard.  I know for a fact that not infrequently solicitors, or counsel advised by them, fail to notice cases which are put into the <i>Legal Diary</i> and not infrequently adjournments are sought on the eve of a court case or on the very day of the court case because, due to pressure of work, solicitors and counsel have not noticed the case come into the list.</P>
    <P>I have heard lawyers accused of negligence for failing to know when cases appear on the list but I ask members of the House as human beings to realise the problem that lawyers have to face.  They may take the steps necessary to bring a case for trial in the circuit court or high court and four or five months may elapse before that case appears in the <i>Legal Diary.</i> In order to ensure that the case is not overlooked, the lawyer on record is supposed to apply his mind and eye daily to that list to watch out for the case.  I wonder if each of us were put on oath to say what Statutory Instruments or Orders or other items appeared on the back of our Order Papers, how many of us could honestly <Col N="763" /> say we read through those from beginning to end?  Yet, if we were fulfilling our duties here as members of the House, we should do that to know everything that is going on.  Likewise, the average lawyer has more than sufficient to do to try to keep up-to-date with urgent work, without having laboriously to pore over a list of 400 cases daily of which he may have an interest in only one or two or three.</P>
    <P>The pressure and the strain in the practice of the legal profession is daily becoming worse and with the shorter working week which is being generally introduced it will become even more acute in the years ahead.  At the same time, it is becoming more difficult to get experienced, competent law clerks. There was a time when law clerks were regarded as the poorest-paid members of the community, and I think that was true, certainly in relation to the responsibility they had.  The result of that is a new trend and young men will not go into the law clerk's avocation.</P>
    <P>It is a common experience of solicitors, I think, that unless they personally peruse the <i>Legal Diary</i> cases are frequently overlooked.  Even though they might try to go through it they themselves have often overlooked some very important case.</P>
    <P>Even though it might mean that the Minister would look to the profession to pay a contribution towards the service, I believe that most members of the profession in Dublin would willingly provide the necessary funds to ensure that in future when a case is put into the <i>Legal Diary</i> a notice to that effect would go out from the court office to the solicitor on record.  I should explain, perhaps, that not only is a case put in the <i>Diary</i> for a particular day but once it is listed in the <i>Diary,</i> it may move according as cases before it are adjourned or settled or otherwise disposed of.  But, at least if a solicitor gets a warning that the case is listed, he is alerted and he can watch the <i>Diary</i> and from then on, it would be his own responsibility.</P>
    <P>I think there is a case for giving initial notice to solicitors on record. This is not a matter just for the convenience <Col N="764" /> of solicitors: it is equally important to all the parties and witnesses involved in court cases, in order to ensure they will get the fullest possible notice.  It might be that the system operating is more suited to a time when there was less litigation in this city and county, but it certainly is not suited to this day and age and the result is that witnesses and litigants get only a matter of a few days' notice, whereas, if my proposal were adopted, they would get ten to 14 days' notice.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the Gardaí on traffic duty in this city.  I said last week that since they became armed with batons, their signs are becoming less intelligible to motorists and pedestrians.  I discovered last Saturday to my surprise that one member of the Garda Síochána who, I had thought, was a particularly bad pointsman was a first-class pointsman when he had not got a baton.  I did not recognise him as one and the same man.  Last Saturday, when for some reason or another he had not the baton, he had his arms outstretched to the full and was giving indications in accordance with the bye-laws and regulations and there could be no room for any doubt as to what he meant.</P>
    <P>I have seen the same person before and since giving indications with the baton which were certainly not intelligible to the average motorist.  I would therefore appeal either for the immediate permanent withdrawal of the batons or else that Gardaí on traffic duty should get an intensive course in their proper use for traffic control. The batons should supplement the other gestures and signs and not replace them.  Unfortunately what is happening is that the baton is solely used.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the men on point duty.  Obviously, this wand is having some effect on them, but it has occurred to me that perhaps the period they have to remain on traffic duty is too long.  It might be better to have shorter runs of duty.  It might have been all right when our streets had only a quarter of the traffic they now have, but it takes a high degree of alertness now to get traffic moving <Col N="765" /> and that should be the purpose of our pointsmen.  I am afraid some of them are so tired and so indifferent from long hours of duty that they tend to choke traffic rather than keep it moving. There should not be a delay of more than five seconds between the passing of traffic one way and the passing of traffic at right angles to it.  Long delays in the movement of traffic lanes are not good enough in this day and age when our streets are becoming choked with traffic.  I would hope for a vast improvement in that field in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that we are not permitted to discuss legislation on the Estimate but I should like to express some appreciation of the increasing amount of law reform that is coming from the Department of Justice.  I would urge that the legislation which we are told is under consideration in connection with the wills of husbands be not too long delayed because unfortunately, under our present system, there are frequent cases of wives and their families being deprived of their fair share of the husbands' estate because the husbands did not provide for them in their wills.  While on that matter it strikes me that the time has come to increase the amount which a district justice can allow to a wife and children who have been deserted by the husband.  I am not sure when the figure was reviewed but certainly the figure of £2 10s. a week fixed in respect of a wife has no relation to modern monetary requirements.</P>
    <P>A final point I would make is to endorse what Deputy Donegan said about the provision of some funds for boys' and girls' clubs.  We need a positive approach in this country to the prevention of crime.  I do appreciate the great work which has been done in the treatment of young boys in what used to be called Borstal, but is now recognised as St. Patrick's. Positive work is being done there to reform these boys and make good citizens of them but I think we need to prevent our youth drifting into ways of crime.</P>
    <P>The high precentage of young people in our prisons today is rather shocking and disturbing.  The way to <Col N="766" /> cut down on that is to encourage youth movements, boys' and girls' clubs.  I know the Department of Education have done something but I do not think their work is sufficient in that field.  There are many youth clubs and organisations in this city struggling to keep going and it would be a very sensible step if the State were to give a substantial contribution to these clubs.  I believe that, in the long run, it would save money because it would reduce the number of juveniles who appear before our courts and who are ultimately imprisoned.  It would also help, of course, to reduce the amount of malicious damage, theft and burglary.  While I may be a severe critic of the Minister, I do feel he has a progressive approach to such matters and I would suggest that he endeavour to get from the Minister for Finance the necessary money for more positive steps towards the prevention of juvenile crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate, the question of safety on the roads has been frequently raised but I think this year this problem has assumed proportions which call for special attention. I have not been able to assemble the most recent statistics but the answer I got to a recent Parliamentary Question was disturbing enough.  It seems that as the density of traffic grows on our roads, the threat to life and limb for members of the community grows also and before this problem assumes really dangerous proportions&mdash;it is dangerous enough as it is&mdash;the time has come for a concerted attack to check the trend in road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I say this, I do so to draw attention to the seriousness of the problem at the moment and if one compares the answers to Questions here over a period of years, one finds that the upward trend is frightening. I should like also to say that it is obvious the Ministers for Justice and Local Government are addressing themselves to the problem.  I am glad to see that on the Local Government side the necessary code of regulations would appear to be on the way.  From the point of view of the Department of Justice, there then arises the question <Col N="767" /> of implementing that code; in other words, the question of policing the roads.  Admittedly, the policing of the roads and the control of traffic will have to be directed by the Department of Justice and by the Gardaí, but a great deal will depend on the co-operation of the public.  The success of any drive to make the roads safer and to reduce road casualties to reasonable proportions will depend, in the first instance, on the efficiency with which the roads are policed but no less, in the second instance, on the co-operation of all road users whether they be drivers, cyclists or pedestrians.</P>
    <P>In other discussions, it has been common to attribute road accidents to certain causes.  One hears about drink; one hears about speed.  These may or may not be very important factors. Personally, I think we are probably bringing the drink danger under control. The question of the risks of speeding cannot be discussed just in a vacuum: it depends on the circumstances. I should like to express the view that other factors are involved as well.  It is not so much the actual speed of a vehicle that is the danger. It is driving at excessive speed with reference to the circumstances, with reference to the place and the density of traffic where the speeding occurs. That is what matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, general road conditions, certainly.  In that regard, I understand that we shall have speed limits.  I know this has been a matter of dispute but personally I am very much in favour of speed limits in built-up areas.  Anybody, for instance, who goes down some of our surburban arteries&mdash;you meet them on the south side of the city and on the north side of the city: arteries that are feeding the main trunk arteries&mdash; say, at 9 o'clock in the morning, at one o'clock in the day or at 5 to 6 o'clock in the evening will note that the density and speed of the traffic in these places is often frightening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that children are going to or coming from <Col N="768" /> school&mdash;in the morning period, anyway&mdash;I think there are very few people who have any imagination at all who will not shiver at the way cars pass down these roads, taking risks which fortunately they mostly get away with but which can very easily result in a fatal accident if some young child miscalculates the time of crossing.  That type of problem, to my mind, can only be controlled by a built-up area speed limit.  I think these are to be introduced and I think, on balance, they are the best solution to this problem. I should like to say to the Minister that if such speed limits are introduced, they should be realistic.  They should be fixed at a realistic level, and they must be enforced.  There could be nothing more dangerous than having speed limits and then laxity in enforcing them.</P>
    <P>Another attendant problem in built-up areas which will be minimised if we adopt the solution of speed limits but which will remain a very serious problem until speed limits are introduced is the hazard of parked cars on narrow roads, particularly the sort of road I have been talking about in the suburbs of Dublin.  Parked cars not only restrict the area of road surface available to the vehicles travelling on it but they also obscure a driver's view.  Again, say, at the peak hours in the morning, from 9 to 10 a.m., or at the lunch hour, if the pedestrian&mdash; particularly a child&mdash;comes out from behind a parked car, there is little a driver can do about it, having regard to the customary speeds at the moment and the narrowness of many of these roads.  However, if a speed limit is introduced, it will minimise that hazard.</P>
    <P>I shall not go so far as to suggest an extension of the &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; regulations but there is one thing I should like to urge on the Minister as a matter which I think needs a little closer policing, that is, the observance of road signs.  I know of one &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; sign in the suburbs: it is not very far from where I live.  I have purposely observed it.  I am not exaggerating when I say that hardly any vehicle observes it.  Hardly any vehicle stops <Col N="769" /> there, unless an oncoming vehicle actually causes it to stop in the ordinary way.  It is practically ignored, except on the odd occasion when a Garda is there.  However, if he is there, he usually parks himself in a position for all to see and then the traffic is exemplary.  I am not drawing on my imagination.  I have gone to the trouble of personally observing that &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; sign, particularly at the morning time, and I have seen as many as five cars in a stream pass it by at what seemed to me a considerable speed.  If the Minister wants particulars, I shall invite his attention to the particular sign.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I grant you that it is one of these signs in respect of which you might ask yourself whether it is right to have it there at all.  My point is that if you erect a statutory sign and if you have statutory sanctions and then if you let everyone play merry hell with it, not only are you bringing the whole code into disrespect but actually you are contributing to disorder on the road rather than helping; that is the point.</P>
      <P>I know the Garda cannot be everywhere. To a lesser degree, traffic lights occasionally need watching.  I blame the drivers for this.  You cannot expect a Garda to be parked at every traffic light, which is there to leave the Gardaí mobile.  I am afraid that far too many drivers will take a risk at traffic lights rather than wait for the lights to change.  Unfortunately, the drivers who do that are usually people who just will not wait.  They are not in a hurry.  Very often, the road is clear when they do it.  It is just a lack of discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every driver should realise that when the light is red, whether or not he is in a hurry, whether or not he is irritated, whether or not the road <Col N="770" /> is clear, he must wait until the light turns to green.  Every driver must realise that, when the light is orange, it is his duty to stop before it turns to red.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister will deal with these problems.  In the case of, say, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs and occasional checks at traffic lights, and with mobile police, he can do a great deal to enforce the law.  By making examples of people who flagrantly break the law, a lot can be done.  However, the Minister cannot solve the whole problem on that basis.  Therefore, it is essential that all drivers should be made aware and conscious in some way of their responsibilities on the road and of the need to be disciplined, even when the circumstances seem to suggest that they can break the regulations with impunity.</P>
    <P>Drivers should realise that they should not have discreation in this matter.  They should realise that, in the interests of themselves and other travellers, in the long term, they must be disciplined at all times and, if the lights are red, must never pass.  If there are signs like &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs, they must observe them.  If a sign says &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;, let them stop.  Above all, there should be courtesy on the roads.</P>
    <P>All of that sounds, I suppose, very commonplace and perhaps like a string of platitudes because it has been repeated so often.  But until we get discipline among road users, among drivers and pedestrians, nothing the Minister, or the Minister for Local Government in concert with him, can do will solve the safety problems on the road.  It will require the wholehearted co-operation of all road users.</P>
    <P>Coming more narrowly to Dublin city, I disagree throughly with Deputy Ryan in his attitude to the Gardaí in Dublin.  I have the opportunities of observing them as closely as the Deputy and I think I can say the problem in Dublin is not that the Gardaí are indifferent.  I took down the words the Deputy used.  He accused the Gardaí of indifference in the performance of duty.  That is not the problem.  The unfortunate Gardaí in Dublin city are overworked at the main crossings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> The problems in Dublin city are the problems of the road users.  If there is traffic congestion, it is largely the fault of the users of the road, vehicle drivers and pedestrians.  There are certain types of drivers who are doing their best and, by and large, in fairness to them, the bus drivers, in recent times anyway, have been trying to conform to the pattern of traffic in the city as have drivers of heavy lorries.  The trouble comes from cars cutting in and cutting out, from cyclists weaving this way and that way and pedestrians who will insist on crossing at the wrong places or at the wrong times. Deputy McQuillan is smiling but I would invite him to O'Connell Bridge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The solution of it lies in the hands of the public.  The public must be got to co-operate with the police.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be the police will have to take action to make them do so at particular points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows what happened in regard to the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  That is what we want to get over.  The licensing laws were one thing but they were not the hazard to life that this business is.  Take O'Connell Bridge.  I do not know whether the Minister for Local Government, in particular, would consider the cost worth it but personally I am coming around to the opinion that it is essential, costly and all as it would be, to provide subways at O'Connell Bridge.  The trouble is&mdash; I shall answer the Deputy in his own coin&mdash;that possibly people will not want to use them.  That would be one problem to overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make about O'Connell Bridge is that at 5 o'clock I have watched two Gardaí on point duty and two Gardaí at crossings, one at Bachelor's Walk and the other at <Col N="772" /> the far side.  Nobody can say that four Gardaí are not enough at the crossings there but I have seen four Gardaí unable to cope with the pedestrians running all around them and traffic weaving in and out.  I have seen young Gardaí most courteous with pedestrians and getting nowhere and I have seen at least one Garda almost losing his temper and getting nowhere either.  There must be some way to convince people that if they would only co-operate in obeying traffic signals, they would get home quicker or get wherever they are going quicker than under the present system.  Pedestrians, particularly at busy crossings, are the cause of the trouble and of their own delays.</P>
    <P>In regard to the traffic itself &mdash; I think the Minister mentioned this on another occasion&mdash;it is true that in regard to Dublin traffic, half the road is very often empty because cars occupy the middle between two lanes, thus taking up the room of two.  If some system could be devised of having the traffic in proper channels or lanes in the centre of the city, many of the complaints Deputy Ryan speaks about would be obviated.  In any event, I do think it is very unfair to blame the Garda for this.</P>
    <P>I know of no point in the city where the Garda are not dealing with this matter as expeditiously as they should. In fact, it is a miracle how they manage sometimes.  There is one Garda on duty at College Green where there is a crossing.  There is a confluence of a number of streams of traffic.  It is remarkable that the flow there is so good; perhaps it is because there is only one point where the pedestrians and the cyclists can intrude upon him.</P>
    <P>The time has come for a serious assault on this problem of road safety. A great deal of good work has already been done.  The Road Safety Association and the Minister himself since he took over have promoted thinking and action in this regard.  The density of traffic has greatly increased and, incidentally, the small cars, mini-cars, that are on the road seem to be putting up the speed.  They are faster than the bigger type of vehicles that went before them and they are able <Col N="773" /> to weave in and out more easily from one lane to another.  All these things are tending to make traffic conditions more dangerous and more chaotic, and this is the time to tackle that.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into that in any further detail but it is only fair to the Minister to say that it is not exclusively a problem for the Garda.  The Garda have a vital role, but, as Deputy McQuillan said, unless they get co-operation, we cannot hope for any improvement.  In a sense, when tragedy happens on the road, it is not so much the fault of the individuals involved in the accident as the fault of all of us road users who have allowed a haphazard and reckless attitude to road using to develop.  As responsible members of the community, we must regard discipline on the road as a matter of public morality and I do not think I go too far when I say that.  When the licensing laws were before the House, that aspect of them was frequently stressed.  Here we are dealing with the danger to the lives and the possible maiming of members of the community.  Therefore the question of safety on the roads should be treated by both the State and the individual as seriously as any other question of public morality.</P>
    <P>That was all I intended to say on this Estimate but having read what Deputy Ryan said on the last occasion, I must turn to another matter, that is, what he said about a judge.  Deputy Ryan is very young.  Perhaps he does not appreciate what is involved in such a type of charge in the House, but I for one, as somebody who formerly had some dealings with the administration of law in the courts but who now has no interest, should like to say to Deputy Ryan that it is not in the best interests of either the law or the community to raise the matter as he did.  It is not just a question of putting a judge in a privileged position.  If we are to administer justice in the community and if the ordinary citizen is to have an impartial system of justice administered, judges must be people for whom, by common consent, we have respect and regard and whom we do put on a <Col N="774" /> pedestal, not for their sake but for our own.  They must be treated as the Constitution provides they should be treated and I think therefore that it is, in principle, a bad thing and, in the long run, a dangerous thing, to deal with any complaint as Deputy Ryan dealt with the complaint which he said he had.</P>
    <P>A judge is selected&mdash;no matter what the cynics say&mdash;by every Government to fill an important job and every effort is made to put the best people, the people who are best suited, into these jobs as judges.  They are not just jobs but high positions of trust for the community and I think that in fairness to all Governments, selections have been made primarily with regard to the standing and integrity of the Bench and of course also to technical knowledge and experience in legal matters.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Ryan had a complaint with the Bench, there were a number of courses open to him.  If, for instance, in his professional capacity, he had a complaint against the Bench, this certainly was not the place to raise it.  If he personally was involved in the case or a solicitor had made representations about a single instance, the Incorporated Law Society is there to protect the interests of solicitors.  There was the time-honoured way of making his protest in court.  I have been in court and I know it can be made.  If there is something wrong, a protest can be made there.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if it were a matter of public duty, if the situation were such as to require intervention in this House, I should like to ask Deputy Ryan this question: If his complaint were serious enough to justify what was said in the House, why was it not brought up in the way envisaged by the Constitution?  If a judge should misbehave himself to the extent that a Deputy is warranted or has a duty to raise it, then he has misbehaved himself to the extent that the matter should be formally dealt with in this House.  On the other hand, if the charges were not serious enough for that, having regard to the position of the judiciary, they should <Col N="775" /> not be mentioned at all in the House. Judges cannot answer back.  They should not be brought down to the level of that kind of criticism, or if they are, if there is something of which this House should take cognisance, let the House take cognisance of it properly and the Constitution provides that we have authority to deal with such a matter by resolution here. I think it only right that we should have that respect for the judiciary and that respect for ourselves.</P>
    <P>This Dáil should not be a place where complaints can be aired under the cloak of privilege.  Deputies should not abuse their position by using their privilege here to say things they dare not say outside, either for fear of an action for defamation or, if it concerns a judge, for fear of contempt.  If they dare not say it outside, it is a shabby and hardly a brave thing to air it in here where we have the absolute protection, as we should, of privilege.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the point in privilege?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point in privilege is this: it is important that you and I and everybody else here should have absolute privilege to say what we consider to be our duty to say, but that privilege was given to us to protect us in doing our duty and we should have a sense of duty in using it.  If we are to avail of the protection of that privilege, we should be careful to do it in a way we can stand over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Ryan had come in and proposed a motion in the proper form for the removal of some judge whom he did not name for alleged misconduct or anything else, I would have no complaint about him, but if Deputy Ryan or any other Deputy&mdash;I do not want to be unfair to Deputy Ryan and I do not suggest he is the only one who abuses privilege&mdash;says these things, makes charges which cannot be debated easily, which cannot be answered and which also are in their nature <i>ex parte</i> statements&mdash;after all, we do not know how much substance is in the complaint or the basis of the <Col N="776" /> charges made and that is not good enough&mdash;it is an abuse of privilege and I think it is less than what is due to the dignity of this House.  I think it is a derogation of the dignity of this House and very damaging to the prestige of the Bench also and of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Let us all be frank and admit it, all of us, including the judges, are human beings, and there is not one of us who will not be shorter than he might be sometimes or less courteous than he might be; let us take that as a fact of human nature, but if that happens in some courts, there is always an answer to it, and, as far as I have had any knowledge of these things&mdash;and I have had a few years of experience of them&mdash;I have never known yet of a case where a solicitor or a barrister, having had right on his side and stood up to it, that the balance of equity was not restored.</P>

      <P>Witnesses must of course be protected.  Very often, the witness is protected by his own barrister or solicitor and very often, too, by the Bench.</P>
      <P>I have in my own time picked up my papers and walked out of court in protest.  I have done it and I know what I am talking about in this.  I have seen these problems resolved, but I did not come into this House to complain about it, and I have never known any other lawyer to use the House in that way, and that is why I stress this incident so strongly. I want to check something, and I think the Deputy will agree with me because I do not want to brand the Deputy or Deputy Dillon, who has been absolutely correct in this, with the behaviour of other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was an unfortunate thing that the precedent for this performance was set on the debate on the judges in a way that was not relevant to the matter in issue, namely, their salaries, but which was the type of thing calculated to bring the judiciary, in the first place, into disrespect and, of course, in the process of dragging somebody else in <Col N="777" /> the mud this House was dragging itself into the mud.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is all right.  I think Deputy McQuillan will agree with me in the principle of this.  I will be as strong as Deputy McQuillan in defence of the right of privilege and the right of a Deputy to say what he should say but, when questions of this nature arise here, I think we ought to raise them in proper form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to my point, I think that the judiciary, in the interests of the community, in the spirit of the Constitution and having regard to their function and ours, should be treated with the respect that their office should command in this House; and that demands that they are not dragged into ordinary controversial debate, that they should be honoured <Col N="778" /> by silence more than anything else in these matters, and that we ought not to trespass in their domain unless our duty demands it.  If our duty demands it, we have a way of doing it by formal act in this House, whether by a motion in respect of an individual or by legislation subject to the Constitution in respect of the courts as a whole.  That is the principle I want to establish here, and I therefore deprecate very much the attitude of Deputy Ryan in this matter.  We should see an end to that kind of tendency.</P>
    <P>Flowing from that perhaps, Deputy Ryan has inadvertently brought up another point.  I should like to see the Benchers of the King's Inns, the Bar Council, and the Incorporated Law Society in their respective spheres strengthened and encouraged to be, shall I say, the disciplinary bodies in their own professions, but also the defenders of their own professions, so that if there are matters to be dealt with, complaints by members of those professions, all those bodies will be in a position to make themselves felt. That is a thought I commend to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is much better that complaints of the nature made by Deputy Ryan, if they have to be dealt with not by formal motions, should be dealt with in the impartial way that old-established bodies such as any of the three I have mentioned should deal with them rather than they should be brought in as individual issues.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would like to make this comment from my own experience.  I have seen a certain amount of shortness from the Bench in my time, and looking back, I may have felt aggrieved on more than one occasion, but I find it very hard indeed to think of a case where a judge had not right on his side, whether technically or whether there was something wrong with the documents or so forth.  I think that impartial analysis will reveal no more than this&mdash;that perhaps in the case of individuals, there might be a certain amount of peremptoriness but you will find it very difficult indeed to find any evidence of positive injustice.  If that is the situation, it underlines more than ever what I said at the outset, that if Deputy Ryan's complaint was <Col N="779" /> serious enough to air here, it was serious enough to be dealt with in the formal manner that befits this House and befits the dignity of the Bench. If it was not serious enough for that, it should not have been dealt with here at all.</P>
    <P>Lastly, if I may lecture again, as the Deputy called it, all of us should think of the responsibilities that privilege brings with it as well as the amenities it gives.  Perhaps for that reason it is a lecture, if you like, that has come from me, but not the things that I would have said and might have said about Deputy Ryan, if I did not feel constrained to practise my own preaching.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend speaking on this at all.  I have great respect for the courts of my country, and I have always been in favour of law and order.  I am not a newcomer, we will say, to that line of country.  I am not concerned with what Deputy Ryan said.  I do not know who the judge is, nor do I care.  I am not concerned so much with the judges or with counsel.  I am concerned with the ordinary people who go into a court, and I would say this to the Minister&mdash; that may be one of the reasons why people are slow to come forward to help the Garda is that they dread the thought of facing into court as ordinary witnesses.</P>
      <P>I would say to the Minister and to the judges and counsel, with the greatest of respect, that judges should always show the greatest patience to witnesses.  I do not put the onus of that on counsel, because counsel have a job to do and are faced with their own difficulties, one way or another.  But the ordinary citizen will look upon the judge as his protector, and it is a great disappointment to him if he goes into court and has to suffer a shock when the judge or the justice shouts him down.  That is no disrespect to the courts.  I have the privilege of saying that here.  In reply to Deputy de Valera's statement that the people on the Bench are not able to reply, I say that the people on the Bench can reply, that they are not without political influence, and that they do reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> The fact that our people are so slow to help the Garda is a matter of concern to all of us.  Many people are terrified to appear as witnesses in court, especially if they have had previous experience of being called as witnesses and being treated in any way contemptuously by the court.  Take the position of the Garda when they are investigating criminal cases and endeavouring to get information.  The average Irish citizen closes up like a clam and will not tell the Garda anything. One reason for that is that the Gardaí are strangers to the citizens. They are persons in uniform whom they have seen passing in a squad car. I would suggest that the Minister should reconsider the policy at present in operation of the centralisation of Garda stations and the closing of the small stations in the country and the city.  I suggest that it is more desirable to have the Gardaí living close to the people, in constant touch with them, as they could be in local barracks.  A little more neighbourliness is required.  In such circumstances, the people would know the Gardaí who would be making inquiries.  They would be on Christian name terms.  That is the atmosphere that the Minister should try to create. It would be the best possible deterrent to crime.</P>
    <P>I speak on the subjects of crime and police work as an ordinary citizen.  The Minister is responsible for law and order.  It is vitally important that order should be maintained. Order will not be maintained if in many areas the Garda stations are closed and there is centralisation.  I would point out that the London police are seeking decentralisation of police stations.  In the large centres of population in Great Britain, it is the policy to have a mobile police force, using cars, motor cycles or bicycles, radio cars, and so on, but that is for the purpose of supporting the small stations in outlying areas and the men on the beat.  Centralisation is not good; it is a failure.</P>
    <P>There is one Garda barracks in Waterford.  It is badly placed, as the Minister and his advisers admit.  Even if it were located in a central position, the people living on the perimeter of <Col N="781" /> the city would not have a Garda station within easy reach of them.  I suggest that, instead of having one large central station, there should be one station and four small stations. It may be suggested that the Garda may be sitting there all day doing nothing.  That is fallacious.  The presence of the Garda is a deterrent. The ordinary citizen can invoke his aid.  It is not quite the same thing if the citizen has to contact a station which may be a mile and a half away, is told that there is no car available and that it is impossible to say when the Garda can come to his aid.</P>
    <P>In regard to the investigation of criminal cases, it would be highly desirable if, when the senior officers went to the scene of a crime, the local sergeant were there with his five or six men who would know everybody in the district.  The local Gardaí can make the inquiries because they are going to people who regard them as neighbours.</P>
    <P>It was the custom at one time that the Garda delivered old age pension books.  Some genius thought that the Garda should be relieved of that work and the books were sent by post.  That had the effect of putting the Garda out of touch with the people.  It was a very nice thing that the guardians of the peace should have that contact with the people.  The recipients of the pension books became close friends of the Garda.  Centralisation is doing away with that kind of thing.  It has the effect of making the Garda remote from the people.</P>
    <P>The record for the detection of crime, including murder, is not good. Taken over a long period, the figures are good but the record for the recent past is not good.  I do not blame the Gardaí for that.  They are not getting co-operation.  I suggest that that lack of co-operation is due to the fact that the Gardaí who are making the inquiries are strangers to the people. That brings me back to the point I made at the outset, that if local Gardaí took part in the inquiries, they would meet with greater success.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the preservation of law and order, decentralisation and <Col N="782" /> the investigation of criminal cases, including murder.  I will leave out murder and deal with criminal cases. The Minister's attention should be drawn to what is happening all over the country.  I read my evening newspapers and I am often appalled when I see criminal cases being brought into court, proved to the hilt and then the Guard who brought the case into court, instead of being commended, nearly put in the position of the guilty person when it comes to the judge or the justice administering the law, who should be protecting the people, often letting these criminals off or giving them trivial sentences.  That is very serious and there can be nothing more discouraging for the man in uniform than to be constantly going into court with, as he thinks, successful cases and then finding the people he has brought into court walking out scot free.  We must look into this problem.</P>
    <P>There is something else, the question of people coming to the assistance of the Guards.  It is not a case of anybody giving to the Guards the information they need or agreeing to go into court. There have been cases where Guards have been attacked violently and cases where Guards went to make an arrest and members of the public on whom they called for assistance did not assist them and afterwards the courts reprimanded the public for not doing their duty.  The courts should do their own duty.</P>
    <P>I know of a case of which I will remind the Minister where a man named Maurice Ryan, an unemployed labourer of Glin, County Carlow, died as a result of injuries received in a brawl, a fracas, or whatever you like to call it, when he went to the assistance of Guard Bartholomew Foley. His action is to be commended but he lost his life.  He had a wife and family and I often wonder if we compensated that man's wife and family, or did we do anything for them.  I often wonder if people who go to the aid of Guards to help them out and who receive injuries are compensated by the State. I do not know whether they are or not but I wish to draw the Minister's attention to it.  It is something that concerns us all.  We want to encourage <Col N="783" /> our people to come forward and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important point.  I just want to intervene for a moment.  We do in fact compensate these people.  I will deal with it fully later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear it and I thank the Minister.  It should be made known widely that such compensation is available and that the State, as the protector of the people, is prepared to come forward and do the right thing.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister or his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, is to do about traffic and road accidents.  I do not know what the Guards can do.  People just do not care; pedestrians do not care.  You have only to go into Kildare Street to see pedestrians walking out in front of the speeding traffic, without looking to the right or to the left.  It is a miracle that more people are not killed.  Neither do I know what the Guards can do about parking in Dublin. The Guards are getting a bit sharp when they come along to ask a man about parking his car.  I know a Guard and I have said to him: &ldquo;You were a bit too sharp with that man&rdquo; and he replied: &ldquo;If you heard how sharp everybody is to me, you would understand. Before I can say `I beg your pardon', they have me chopped up before I know where I am.&rdquo;  This is a frightful problem and appeals will have to be made through all possible channels to drivers and to the ordinary people using the roads and to cyclists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On numerous occasions, people in my constituency have come to me to complain about rowdyism after dark in certain portions of my constituency and there is a scare in various areas. The Minister was asked a Parliamentary Question about this and he truthfully said that it appeared to be exaggerated and that the Guards had not received many complaints about it.  Since then, I am sorry to say, the Guards have received plenty of complaints. The reason the Guards did not get complaints is that the people do not want to do anything about it. If a girl is accosted at night and <Col N="784" /> reaches home in a state of hysterics, her father or mother do not want to go to the Guards.  They probably come to their Deputy and say: &ldquo;will you do something about this?&rdquo; He will say: &ldquo;come along to the Guards&rdquo;, and they will reply that they do not want to go to the Guards.  I have the newspaper cutting here in which no name or address is given but I could give the Minister the name and address of that girl.  I would not lightly lend myself to creating a scare.  It was said in this House that a scare had been created.  That is, or was, the position.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that the cause of this is the centralisation of the Garda station.  Now we are told that the station is to be put right up on the hill at Ballybricken in Waterford and the people will have to go uphill to it.  I submit to the Minister that the case put to him by the Mayor and Corporation of Waterford is well worth consideration, that we should not have only one central barracks in Waterford but should have Garda stations in the various new housing schemes.  It acts as a deterrent.  I do not want people arrested or pushed about but the fact that the barracks is there is a protection in itself.</P>
    <P>I also want to say, on behalf of the smaller country villages, that a number of Garda stations which have been taken from them should be put back again.  I have not the figures on this particular matter but I am told that there are about 60 officers and men in the Civic Guards in Waterford city. I wonder how many were there 30 years ago?  I should be inclined to say that there were as many, even though there was a much smaller area to be covered.  I put it to the Minister that even if there are the same number of Guards in the city as there were 30 years ago, the men now have to have much more time off.  We would need to have more Guards to do the ordinary beat work and the ordinary work of the protection of the people. I would ask the Minister to consider these points that I have made very carefully.</P>
    <P>In the matter of traffic, there are some matters to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  I am not sure <Col N="785" /> whether this matter is in his bailiwick or in that of the Minister for Local Government but it has to do with the enormous loads we see on the main roads at the present time.  Many of these vehicles are not loaded very carefully.  One sees gas containers piled up very high on lorries and trailers and I often wonder what might happen if one of them fell out and exploded.  More care should be taken with regard to dangerous loads on the road, particularly at the present time when traffic is moving so fast.  I remember reading of a dreadful accident where a truck ran down a hill in an American city and crashed into an oil tanker.  Many people were killed and burned in the explosion that followed.  We should take a little more care in these matters.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the state of the law is about noxious fumes but I am sure the Minister has some method of dealing with them.  There are a great number of heavy trucks blasting out clouds of black smoke along the roads and through the streets of this city.  This is something we will have to take notice of.</P>
    <P>The traffic situation will cause a great headache for the Minister.  I have the idea that he is trying to cope with it but I should like particularly to draw his attention to the points I have raised about the carrying of large numbers of gas cylinders and also other heavy loads such as logs with only a thin rope to hold them.  The Minister should issue some order about traffic such as that.</P>
    <P>A problem came before us in Waterford city some time ago in connection with the installation of more traffic lights.  We were asked to put in three more and we did so.  We will get a grant of 50 per cent. towards the cost.  I know this is a matter for the Minister for Local Government, but I think that where a local authority puts in such lights, the Minister should give more in the way of grants.  The Road Fund is increasing every year and it could easily afford the extra subvention to the local authorities.  If they did that, the local authorities would be far more inclined to instal these traffic lights which <Col N="786" /> would have the effect of freeing more Guards for ordinary duties.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck, and he will need it, in his effort to cope with the traffic problem.  If he needs the help of the local authorities or any of the Deputies in the matter of propaganda, I have no doubt that he will get it.</P>

Tá na buntáistí a bhainfidh lena chuid oibre i bhfad níos mó ná na mí-bhuntáistí a bhainfidh leis na tuathail sin.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal primarily with the question of law reform but before I get to that subject, there is one matter I should ask the Minister to consider.  It has been suggested to me that in areas of the country where major crimes have remained unsolved, one of the contributory reasons has been that the Garda have not got the co-operation of the local population and that the reason they have failed to get that is that prior to the commission of the major crime, the Garda have been too strict in enforcing the law and in connection with minor offences.  I do not know if there is any substance in that but it has been suggested to me by someone who might be thought to have some knowledge of the subject.  The Minister might investigate the matter and see if there is any substance in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of law reform, the first thing I should like to do, as a solicitor, is to congratulate the Minister <Col N="787" /> most heartily on putting an end to the annual tribute which has been exacted here by the barristers' profession from the solicitors' profession.  I refer to the sum of £14 payable by every solicitor's apprentice on entering into his indentures to the King's Inns.  I congratulate the Minister on his forward-thinking in abolishing that anachronistic exaction and tribute.</P>
    <P>One hears frequent complaints about the slowness and high cost of the law, but it is not generally realised, I think, by critics that this slowness and this high cost are due primarily to the system within which lawyers are compelled to work.  This system was designed for a social fabric which existed many hundreds of years ago. That social fabric has long since passed into history and the system of law left to us is hopelessly inadequate for the 20th century in Ireland.  I am very glad to see that the Minister is tackling this whole problem, vast and complex as it is, in an orderly and rational manner.  The rationalisation and simplification of the whole legal system and procedure could mean a tremendous saving to litigants, to the country as a whole, and could, indeed, put an end to a great deal of frustration from which both the general public and the members of the legal profession suffer in the practice of law.</P>
    <P>There is one particular target which I would recommend to the Minister's attention for reform.  I cannot quite remember whether one of these committees set up is dealing with this problem, but, whether or not it is, I should like to draw the Minister's particular attention to the problem that exists in regard to the law of property, and particularly to the existing method of conveyancing.  For members of the House, who are not lawyers, I might perhaps explain briefly what happens.  The solicitor for the vendor of the property submits copies of the documents relating to title to the solicitor for the purchaser. These documents may comprise a very large bundle indeed.  The solicitor for the purchaser investigates each of these documents thoroughly and draws up a list of queries known as &ldquo;Requisitions <Col N="788" /> on Title&rdquo;.  Eventually, the solicitor for the vendor replies to that and the solicitor for the purchaser is satisfied as to title; a deed is drawn up transferring the property to the purchaser and, in due course, that deed is added to the other bundle of documents. That purchaser comes along subsequently to sell the property. Exactly the same procedure is followed, except that there is now an additional document to be examined.  This procedure goes on almost <i>ad infinitum.</i> Quite clearly, there is an appalling amount of unproductive effort involved in this method of conveyancing.</P>
    <P>People complain about the high fees in conveyancing.  As a solicitor, I believe they are justified in saying the fees are too high in relation to what people should expect to be called on to pay, but the fees are not too high in relation to the work solicitors have to do.  It is my contention that solicitors should not have to do that work.  The system should be simplified and costs should be reduced.  It may be asked: what can be done?  My suggestion is that the Minister should examine the possibility of making the registration of title in the Land Registry compulsory for all property, thereby ensuring that one has one final document in which all changes in ownership are recorded.  There will then be no bundle to be examined every time property changes hands.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Land Registry at present is not noted for its speed and it may be said that, if you overload it with all the titles in the country, it will probably break down.  However, I believe this is an administration problem which can be overcome.  The basic features of the Land Registry system are those which are required for an efficient system of conveyancing, provided the Land Registry can be made to work efficiently and cope with the volume of work involved.  There are other problems involved, but some solution on the lines I suggest is the only possible approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister on his efforts to get rid of old and inoperative statutes which have been cluttering up the Statute Book.  I commend him on his efforts to achieve a consolidation of statute law <Col N="789" /> in relation to various subjects, in so far as that is possible.  The Minister has told us that his aim is ultimately to have a complete index&mdash;there will be two indexes&mdash;of statutes.  That is a most laudable aim and one very much appreciated by the legal profession.  It is of importance, too, to the general public, inasmuch as it will make for much greater efficiency and do away with the ridiculous situation which can arise at present whereby, if one wishes to find out what the statute law is on some relatively unimportant matter, one may find oneself involved in a quite prodigious research to ascertain the position.  The reform the Minister has set on foot is most welcome and, if I say of it &ldquo;Más maith, is mithid&rdquo; it is not in criticism of the Minister.</P>
    <P>One of the committees which the Minister has appointed includes in its terms of reference consideration of the simplification of pleadings.  It will probably, I think, include allowing pleadings to be served in the Long Vacation.  There is a vast field for reform in this matter and I think we could achieve a much more efficient system of pleadings, without losing any of the advantages of the present system.  A very considerable amount of time, trouble and money could be saved, if sensible recommendations are made on this matter and are accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It seems to be fairly widely agreed that civil juries should be abolished.  If that is accepted, it will almost certainly lead to a speeding up of civil actions in the High Court, with a consequent reduction in the cost of litigation.  It will also help to relieve Dublin householders on whom the burden of jury service is becoming intolerable.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also examine the rules of evidence to see if it would not be possible to encourage the submission of agreed statements&mdash;that is, statements agreed by both parties to an action, in so far as the parties do agree on the facts.  Most lawyers will agree that in the average High Court action before a jury the preponderance of the time spent on the case is spent in proving facts agreed between the parties.  Expert evidence, in particular, could be dealt with much more expeditiously <Col N="790" /> by having agreed reports between the experts, letting them give their evidence solely on the points on which they disagree.  The time and money which could be saved in this way would be enormous and would redound to the general economy of the country.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention is the subject of law reporting.  It may seem that this is purely a matter that concerns lawyers, but ultimately it concerns the general public.  Anything which tends to increase the efficiency of lawyers in their work is of benefit to the general public and to the economy as a whole.  Within the system which operates at present in regard to law reform, reporting is fairly well done, but I presume it is because of the present system that it can happen that the report of a very important case may not be published for years after the case has been decided, and in the meantime, one could have a succession of reports of cases of relatively small importance appearing in the reports.</P>
    <P>I know of an instance where the report of a particularly important case was required for another case which was coming on.  Counsel wished to cite the previous case in the case he was in, and the report of that case could be obtained only by paying a special fee to the barrister who reported it. I know of one case in which that went on for a number of years before the report was published.  I know the barrister who reported it had to go to the trouble of reporting it, editing it, and so on, but there seems to me to be something wrong when it can happen that years after an important case is heard, the official report is not available except on payment of a special fee.</P>
    <P>Another matter in this connection which I can never understand is that when a judge delivers judgment from a written judgment, it appears, under the present system, that the copyright in that judgment is vested in the barrister who reports the case.  One would think, on the face of it, that a judgment given by a judge was a document on public record, but in fact it is <Col N="791" /> not.  I know of cases where judgment could not be obtained for a long time afterwards, and in some cases, on payment of a special fee, bearing in mind that publication sometimes does not take place for some years after the case has been decided.  I know there would be a number of difficulties in dealing with that matter.  I recommend to the Minister that he should consider the possibility of dealing with it, bearing in mind that under our system of law ready availability of reports on decided cases is vital.</P>
    <P>Another matter which leads to tremendous waste of time and money, and a tremendous amount of frustration on the part of legal men, litigants and witnesses, is this business of a case coming in, in the High Court, which may appear in the list for Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday but no one knows until the last minute when it will appear.  I know of a case&mdash;perhaps it is not usual but it did happen&mdash;where a large number of witnesses on both sides arrived in Dublin from the country to give evidence because they expected to be in the list on Monday.  For one reason or another, it went on and on for the whole week and the case was never reached.  It went on over the weekend and people had to wait until the following week to be heard.</P>
    <P>If the expenditure involved in that type of thing were examined, it would be found to be enormous.  There is the time of witnesses, the litigants, the solicitors and, to some extent, the barristers who all the time have to be waiting ready to go into court, if their case comes on.  They find it difficult to devote their time to anything else. I know there are difficulties in this but I think one of the basic contributory causes to the difficulty is the approach to the question of fixing the list.  It seems to be based on the idea that the judge must at all times be convenienced.  By &ldquo;convenienced&rdquo; I mean that he must never be left waiting. That seems to me to be the basic misconception, because if you examine the position, you find that the judge is probably the one person of all those concerned who can afford <Col N="792" /> to be kept waiting.  It would be more efficient in the long run&mdash;I do not say this would work with 100 per cent. efficiency, but it would go a long way towards it&mdash;if you could fix a case to come on, say, on a Monday and establish the length of time it would take and then fix the next case for a day not before the day on which you think that case will conclude.  As I say, that would not work 100 per cent. but it would go a long way towards getting over this terrible waiting around which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The system I recommend to the Minister operates in a small way at present in respect of the list of cases to be taxed by the county registrar. Perhaps it will be said that that is a more simple matter but it works very satisfactorily.  It would be well worth the Minister's while to examine this closely because the amount of money involved that goes astray because of this waiting around for a case to come in, if added up every year, must be fabulous.</P>
    <P>The legal profession is an ancient and honourable one, but, by reason of its very age and honour, I think it tends at times to get too much involved in its own traditions, and is not sufficiently conscious of the requirements of this country in the 20th century.  It seems to me that anyone who takes a long, hard look at the legal profession will come to the conclusion that there is no good reason why we should have the division in the profession which we have at present, except the existence of the tradition for this division and, I rather suspect, a foolish idea on the part of one branch of the profession that it is superior to another branch, and an unwillingness to give up this position of imagined superiority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of practical importance.  The average High Court action involves four lawyers on each side, solicitor, junior counsel and two seniors in the average case.  There are four lawyers on each side, and the loser pays eight lawyers. The matter I referred to of the difficulty of fixing the list and not knowing <Col N="793" /> when a case is coming on, contributes to this question of having to have two seniors.  I know of no other excuse for engaging eight lawyers in one case. Any rational approach to this would involve the admission that ultimately there must be an amalgamation of the two branches of the profession.  What would happen would be that a certain man would do the work the barrister is now doing and another man would do the work the solicitor is now doing. Firms would become larger.  They would operate in offices and some of them would do the court work and others the office work.  That would mean that there would not be all this duplication there is at present and it would ensure that the man dealing with the case in court had very close contact with the client and witnesses.  It would be more efficient from that point of view.</P>
      <P>It has been proved in many countries in the world that this system can operate satisfactorily.  It may be said that while it operates in the United States, legal costs are very high there. That is true, but there is another reason for it.  There is a different approach to costs there and it is not the uniformity in the legal profession which causes the high costs.  I know I am asking the Minister to take major and revolutionary steps, so far as the legal profession is concerned, when I ask him to do what I am recommending, but I can assure the House that, sooner or later, that will happen, and from my point of view, the sooner, the better.  It is in the interest of the legal profession that this amalgamation should take place.  It will make for greater efficiency, lower costs and much better public relations for the legal profession.  But the final arbiter, the final test, in this matter must be the public interest and I submit the public interest demands the amalgamation of the legal profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow everything Deputy Colley has said.  I was interested in his concluding remarks in which he said that inevitably the legal profession as we know it here would be amalgamated. I remember reading remarks similar to that contained in the <Col N="794" /> Reports of the Irish Parliament that sat in this city prior to the Repeal.  At that time, that view was expressed. What was inevitable then in the view of the expressor still is something to be achieved.</P>
      <P>As far as the Bar of Ireland are concerned&mdash;and I do not speak for them in this regard&mdash;certainly, if the members of Deputy Colley's profession wish to engage in the tournament, they are entitled to do so.  I do not know who would be the winner or the loser, but I am quite certain that as far as the litigants and clients are concerned, eventually the system would settle back much as it is now&mdash;with this drawback, of course, that the profession as we know it in Ireland would have lost a certain association in history.</P>
      <P>It is worth recalling in this Parliament that the Bar of Ireland has played a very important part in the history of Ireland.  It is in no way associated, or never has been, with the Bar in other countries.  In fact, Irish history from Daniel O'Connell and before him, John Philpott Curran and onwards, has been part and parcel of the history of the Bar of Ireland.  If those who are concerned for change in order to secure temporary notoriety want to interfere with that system, they may be interfering with something the extent of which they do not fully appreciate.  However, I do not believe it will occur in the next 250 years at least; but Deputy Colley may be right and I may be wrong.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said something, however, on which I wish to join issue with him because I am concerned in relation to his source of information. He said it is widely agreed that civil juries should be abolished in this country.  Who said that?</P>

      <P>Well, to Deputy Colley.  That is a perfectly permissible expression of opinion.  I <Col N="795" /> hope it will never so seem to this Parliament, to the Government for the time being or to the country itself, because, in my view, if civil juries disappear from this country, the ordinary plain people, for whom we should have concern, will certainly find their rights are very much in jeopardy.  I say that deliberately.  Irksome though the jury system here may be to those who for three weeks or so may have to serve on a jury panel&mdash;though I do not subscribe to the view that it is, in fact, such a burden&mdash;that system is, in my view, a very essential part of our legal machinery.  I do not know who suggests it should be abolished. I largely suspect it is an insurance company rap.  I want so to suggest here.</P>

      <P>It certainly surprises me to hear the Minister say it.  I appreciate the Minister is speaking off the cuff at the moment.  My information is to the contrary.  I should like to say, through you, Sir, to Deputy Colley that it would be a very serious and very harmful change. We in this country regard ourselves at times as the &ldquo;bee's knees&rdquo;.  We regard ourselves as acting independently in relation to a whole lot of things.  The plain fact is that we look over our shoulders to see what they are doing in England.  Inevitably, we are tempted here&mdash;be it with a delay of a year or two, or even ten years&mdash; to do here what they have done in England, merely because they have done it in England.  There are so many parts of our political and economic life in regard to which that is true that it is not necessary and would not be in order for me to refer to them here.  They modified the jury system in England some years ago. <Col N="796" /> They did not abolish the juries. Because it was done there, then inevitably some fellow with a bright idea proceeds to suggest it should be done here.</P>
      <P>What are the facts?  In England, they have a High Court Bench of some&mdash;the Minister may have the figures; I am hazarding a guess&mdash;45 to 60 judges.  Here in this country trying <i>nisi prius</i> and ordinary common law cases, we have ordinarily four&mdash;four men who are doing these cases day after day.  I would think it not unreasonable to suggest that in any set of facts inevitably&mdash;and I am not referring to the present holders of the offices&mdash;their individual reactions would be known, would be expected, could be plotted and could be charted. I should like to ask Deputy Colley&mdash; perhaps I might take it up with him at a later stage and outside this House&mdash; what he thinks is likely to happen if cases were treated by judges alone in this country, with the individual reactions to every set of facts being pretty well plotted and known by reason of the habitual views of a particular judge in relation to a particular set of facts.</P>
      <P>Our High Court Bench is too small for that, far too small.  It may be possible elsewhere; it is certainly not possible here.  Deputy Colley has said, in relation to the view he expressed, that it seems to be widely agreed the abolition of civil juries would lead to a speeding up of trials.  That is, in my view, a very popular fallacy.  I invite Deputy Colley to go through the legal cases in this country&mdash;he can go back 20 years, if he wishes&mdash;over the past five years.  I could name in the past five years five cases that took an extreme length of time to hear.  One of these took in court days 27 days. That was tried by a judge alone. Another case took an entire legal term.  That was tried by a judge alone. Another case took four weeks.  That was tried by a judge alone.  In the past five years of the five longest trials, only one happened to be a jury trial and that was one that concluded in recent months&mdash;the Mallow case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much shorter.  The one that took 27 days took that length of time because, in fact, upon one man devolved the responsibility of deciding, in effect, the entire future of these two litigants. Though he was a very experienced judge, he was concerned particularly that every single item of evidence should be minutely examined.  If it were a jury, it would be different. Certain facts would be distilled among 12 minds and worked out by the jury. There is no doubt that in relation to that particular trial its length was due to the very fearful responsibility in relation to fact placed on one individual who happened to be a judge.  I do not believe this is really a matter for debate or decision here, but, since it was raised by Deputy Colley, I find that often when these things are raised and not replied to, people come to accept them as established.</P>
      <P>I want to assert that, in my view, the abolition of civil juries, if it ever should take place, would in no way lead to a speeding up of trials.  It might in some respects, but, largely speaking, it will not.  In my view, in many cases, the resulting responsibility should lead to a careful examination of the elements and perhaps to longer trials.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley also said that the abolition of civil juries might lead to a reduction in the cost of litigation. Presumably, he said that because he felt it might lead to a speeding up of trials.  Since I disagreed with him on that, it follows that I disagree with him in relation to any consequential reductions in the cost of litigation.  I think Deputy Colley would appreciate and most of us realise you have to deal with these things and that the reals cost of litigation lies in other fields in relation to other matters that can in fact be controlled without interfering with the system of trial which is there at the moment.  Deputy Colley mentioned some of them.  In another place and at another time, I would have certain views also in that regard.  I do not believe it arises from the civil jury system; I do not believe it is in any way associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a very bad day for this country if our civil jury system disappeared. <Col N="798" /> I do not think we can do without it.  In fact, if it disappeared and there were no consequential changes in our legal system, we would be in the very absurd situation that a person who happened to have an insignificant or trivial injury would be entitled to have his case tried before a particular judge, if he wanted it.  If he were dissatisfied with this judge's decision, he would be entitled to appeal to another judge and have his case reheard on fresh evidence, because he would have started his case in the circuit court and would be appealing to a judge of the high court.  If in fact he had a more serious injury, and injury which affected him permanently, affected his life and future outlook in a very definite way, he would find himself in the absurd situation that his future and also perhaps the future of his family would be decided by one judge.  One of the four would decide everything in relation to his case and there would be no appeal, except on a matter of law.</P>
    <P>That would be such a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> that even those who wanted to abolish civil juries would be driven to say that is so bad that they would have to provide a system whereby there would be a re-hearing on appeal. Consequently, you would have to have in justice a form of re-hearing of the case from one judge to another or, as probably would be suggested, to a number of judges.  You would find in the end that in order to be just and reasonable, having abolished or sought to abolish a system that has stood the test of time, you were improvising and putting in its place something that will not be just as good but which, in order to be effective, will be at least as long and perhaps as onerous as the jury system is suggested to be.</P>
    <P>May I say one final word regarding civil juries?  Again, I must relate my remarks to what Deputy Colley said.  I refer to the dislocation and difficulty people find in serving on juries.  Again, I wonder what is his source of his information?</P>

      <P>Every day, I meet a considerable number of people serving on civil juries and most of them like it.  They may not like the notice when it comes but in fact, when serving, they rather like the work they are doing, realising it is part of a very precious right and duty of citizenship which they are discharging.  Most of them like the sharing they do in the obligation to see that justice is done.  I have never heard, apart from people who make mountains out of molehills, anyone who has done a stint of service on civil juries in the Four Courts genuinely saying he regretted it.  It may be that Deputy Colley and many of those people who complain about the jury system have, as the real gravamen of their complaint, service on criminal juries.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps in relation to criminal jury service that much of the complaint &mdash;and it is not very large, thanks to the public-spirited nature of our citizens&mdash;arises.  So far as there are complaints, and so far as I understand them, they seem to relate to the criminal juries in Green Street.  That is something that not even the most avid or enthusiastic jury-abolitionist would say could be abolished.  Criminal juries must remain and so long as they do, those who must serve in due course and in turn at Green Street will find the situation arising when, quite suddenly and without notice, and without proper arrangements in regard to their business or their homes, they may be locked up for a week or two, or, as has happened, for three weeks.</P>
      <P>There is the real burden of criticism there and there the real discontent lies. Let us not confuse that expression of discontent with service on the civil juries in the Four Courts.  I believe they are quite dissimilar and neither has anything to do with the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley mentioned other matters but I do not propose to follow him, not out of any disrespect for his views, but because I feel that in regard to the manner in which arrangements are made in the courts for the hearing of cases, I should resent very strongly, <Col N="800" /> the Minister for Justice having any responsibility.  I hope he never will, and if he has no responsibility, in my view, these matters are not proper for discussion here.  They fall to be dealt with otherwise, I think, and in another place.</P>
    <P>May I raise another matter?  This is a matter I have raised from time to time, both on the Health Estimate and on the Estimate of the Department of Justice.  I have never been satisfied as to who is responsible but I hope that either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Justice will eventually accept responsibility for it.  Perhaps it has been referred to already in this debate and, if so, I am sorry for the repetition.  Each day in our courts, from the district court to the high court, as the result of road collisions, we hear of a variety of medical and hospital expenses incurred by the injured person.  Each day, in dealing with these cases, the courts, by reason of the operation of the Health Act, are told that these charges cannot be recovered from the wrong-doing defendant. That means, through the operation of our law, the charge goes on to the rates.  The burden of rates is increased by some of the damage caused by a person committing a wrong or a tort.</P>
    <P>I know that, in the Road Traffic Act, an effort was made to rectify this but it did not succeed.  The matter still arises every day in the courts and the effect is that hospital maintenance charges and medical service fees continue to be borne by the health authority concerned and, in effect, go on the rates.  While this may not be strictly a matter for the Minister for Justice, I raise it here, as I have done on other Estimates, in the hope that it may continue to engage the attention of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to raise an entirely different matter and perhaps a more acrimonious one.  I did not hear the Minister's introductory remarks but I understand the Minister said that in his view, the spirit in the Garda at the moment gave him satisfaction and was excellent.  I do not subscribe to that view.  I think at present the spirit in the Garda leaves a great deal to be <Col N="801" /> desired.  There are many reasons for that.  I do not propose to go into them now, but in fact, in my view, there is considerable dissatisfaction in the Garda throughout the country.  I have in mind certain Garda officers who, prior to 1954&mdash;and in this regard the responsibility may not be directly that of the present Minister&mdash;were encouraged to take part in a promotion examination, to work and study for it and to enter for it.  These men were led to believe that their promotion depended on the measure of success they achieved in that examination. Quite a number entered&mdash;I am referring to the examinations held in 1954. It is a fact that a number of decent officers who attained very high places in that examination find themselves now, eight years later, in the same rank and in precisely the same place as they were in prior to the examinations.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why?  I am told that the scheme was altered and that now promotion suddenly descends upon a person like a ray of sunlight through darkness.  One does not know anything about it until one is suddenly picked out for promotion.  If that is the system of promotion in the Garda at present, it cannot be expected that it will lead to any general satisfaction. Certainly, men who entered for this examination prior to 1954, sat for it and secured&mdash;I shall not specify particular places because I do not want to pinpoint any individual&mdash;out of a large number of candidates a place, putting it mildly, within the first 12, and who see now men who took 56th or 57th place being promoted ahead of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about sergeants.  I should like to know <Col N="802" /> why what was felt by these men to be, in effect, an understanding with them was not honoured and why it is that, in the case of at least one man&mdash;there may be many others&mdash;who felt and understood in relation to his success in that examination or otherwise, his reasonable and proper standing and service in the Garda, he would be entitled to expect due promotion, it has never come to pass.</P>
      <P>The men I am talking about cannot be promoted properly now because it is eight years later and they are now perhaps beyond the age.  It may not therefore be possible to remedy the wrong done to them.  However, I would point very strongly to the injustice of the fact that that promotion scheme should have been pretty well abolished without regard to some of the men who sat for that examination. It was not, of course, the result of any action by the Minister, but insofar as it appears to me that an injustice has been done, I am raising it on this Estimate.</P>
      <P>That is about all I have to say on the Estimate but may I just revert to this question of civil juries?  I know the Minister has expressed no view in that respect, that he has established a committee who are considering the matter and who will advise him and the Government on that question and on other matters.  Therefore I suppose it is wiser at the moment to keep one's powder dry, because the deliberations of that committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House with my remarks on this Estimate. First of all, I wish to associate myself with the tribute paid to Mr. Oscar Traynor and to wish him very <Col N="803" /> many years of happy retirement after so many years of distinguished service to the nation.  I also wish to pay a tribute to the Minister on the comprehensive nature of his report on the working of his Department during the year.</P>
      <P>One point in particular I should like to refer to, relates to the problem of juvenile delinquency.  The Minister referred to it in the course of his statement and pointed out that over 3,300 young people under the age of 17 years had been convicted during the 12 months under review.  That gives food for serious thought.  It is the highest figure since the foundation of the State, according to the Minister. I am therefore pleased to note that he has set up an inter-Departmental committee to deal with this and other kindred matters.</P>
      <P>As most members of the House will be aware, the problem of the incidence of juvenile delinquency in this city is a serious one.  It is reflected in the annual claims for malicious injury made against the Dublin Corporation who have had in recent years to ear-mark about £30,000 annually.  That is a considerable sum of money and it struck the Corporation so deeply that some years ago they set up a special committee at the instance of the then Lord Mayor, Deputy Briscoe.</P>
      <P>That was in 1957.  The committee was very representative; the members sat for 18 months and produced a report which contained recommendations aimed at finding a solution. That report was then regarded as a blueprint for future action and I hope the inter-Departmental committee now set up will have regard to the recommendations of that body.  One of their suggestions was that there should be a permanent voluntary body set up in the city to co-ordinate the work of all the voluntary organisations in a comprehensive study of juvenile delinquency and vandalism and to make recommendations to the Government and the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is intensely interested in this problem.  I had the pleasure recently of being present at a meeting of the Civics Institute at <Col N="804" /> which he gave a very informed address and I feel sure he will bend his energies towards finding a solution to this problem.  A first step would be to study the recommendations of the Dublin Corporation committee.  Like many other Deputies who have spoken, I should like to pay a tribute to the work of the existing voluntary organisations in this field.  They are doing their best, despite serious lack of funds and regrettable public apathy.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the inter-Departmental committee have recommended that consideration be given to securing alternative premises for St. Patrick's. Apart from its lack of proper facilities for the re-education and rehabilitation of young offenders, there is the drawback that the premises have that grey grimness associated with Mountjoy Prison.  It should be possible to secure suitable premises on the outskirts of the city where there would be an environment more conducive to the re-education of the unfortunate young people who must populate that institution for a time.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister on the point he made in respect of the desirability of achieving a system of uniform penalties in district courts so as to avoid disparities in identical cases dealt with by different district justices.  I suggest he should go even further and bring about a uniform application of the Probation of Offenders Act throughout the country.  This is a matter that causes public comment from time to time. I know the Minister is a great believer in the probation system and I would accordingly urge him to have that aspect looked into.</P>
    <P>That would call for the appointment of extra probation officers.  The small number of such officers we have are doing great work but they are overworked and badly remunerated.  The existence of a more comprehensive probation system could not but yield good results.  Probation officers not only do valuable work in assisting the courts but they also give wonderful help in advising and rehabilitating the young people who come to their notice.</P>
    <P>A small number of men who were set up as a temporary force during the <Col N="805" /> Emergency, known as the Taca Síochána, volunteered for duties of that kind and performed them very efficiently.  A number of them have been absorbed into the Garda Síochána. However, I understand that the period of service as a temporary officer does not count for pension purposes.  I think that, having regard to the manner in which they discharged their duties in those difficult days and the excellent way in which they have discharged their duties as police officers since, it is matter that calls for examination.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Dublin traffic problem.  I would make just one comment relating to the provision of pointsmen at various complex junctions in our city.  We have a system whereby pointsmen are on duty from early morning until they leave off duty about 6.30 or sometimes 7 p.m. I would urge the Minister to look into the question of extending the hours of duty.  Anyone who has experience of trying to cross Butt Bridge, O'Connell Bridge, College Green or Parnell Street will understand the necessity for some form of control even after 6.30 p.m. or 7 p.m., having regard to the volume of traffic passing through our city.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would make a point in regard to the general question of police control in our city.  I feel that the mind of the Department is turning more to mobility and mechanisation. A point has been made to me, and I agree with it, that the more uniformed men seen in the city and particularly in our growing suburban districts the better people will feel.  They will feel a better sense of security when they see uniformed men in control of districts.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, once again I should like to congratulate the Minister on his introductory speech on this Estimate and to wish him very well in the future.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a few words in relation to the question of civil juries.  I understand that Deputy Colley expressed some views earlier tonight.  I heard Deputy T.F.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that it is the experience of a good many Deputies that when the notices go out to these people, calling them in to act on a jury, they immediately land into the local Deputy pointing out that there are domestic difficulties, that there are difficulties in the business, that they are busy on their farms, that they have other matters to attend to and that they cannot possibly afford the loss of time to serve on these juries and asking if they can possibly be excused.  Some of them have to produce medical certificates showing possibly that they are deaf and could not hear the evidence properly in order to make a decision indicating that, physically, they are not in a condition to attend and serve on a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> The arguments I wanted to put up tonight are the arguments against civil juries in cases which are not criminal cases.  I am fully in favour of civil juries in all criminal cases but in other cases I do not consider that they are absolutely essential and I feel an alternative could be chosen. Take as an example the amount of compensation and damages awarded in some cases in the courts, as decided by juries.  What calculations have these juries to depend on and what experience have they?  May be it is the first time they ever served on a jury and the last time they ever will serve on one.  What calculations, experience and knowledge have they of case law and of the various considerations that arise when compensation and damages are being calculated and assessed?  I think it must be agreed that frequently it is a hit and miss assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy now is going out of order on this debate.  He is criticising the decision of a court, which is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What I really wanted to say was that in my view it is not necessary to have civil juries in cases which are not criminal cases and that a panel of judges might be a more appropriate system for awarding compensation and damages instead of the present system of sending out notices perhaps to 250 people or maybe 500 people to come in and to answer the roll call.  If they are not present, they will be marked down and fined £3 for not being there to answer the call and to serve on the jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that the jury system is a very fair system from the point of view of giving a fair trial and justice where they are engaged to hear a case and to make a decision.  I think you could not expect anything fairer than you could get from a jury.  However, I feel that a panel of judges could be more effective in many civil cases.  I understand that that view was expressed by Deputy Colley.  I did not <Col N="808" /> hear him speak but he appears to be of the same view.  He suggests that, with the huge amount of work going through the courts at present, in the absence of a jury, many cases could be decided more quickly and in a satisfactory manner, and that the administration of the law would be streamlined by a change from the present civil jury system.</P>
    <P>The cost of litigation is another side to this matter.  Of course the legal man is the best judge but under the present system, persons who are fighting a case have found it is more satisfactory to settle out of court rather than to face a jury.  I believe it is because they feel the sympathy of the jury will be won by oratory and that the jury will not make a practical calculation of what the damages or compensation should be and what the loss really is.  These people are not accustomed to considerations of points of law as a panel of judges would be and I believe that would be a more satisfactory method of administration than we have at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the people serving on these civil juries wish to be called and to attend for the purpose of making these decisions.  They would be well satisfied to leave it to the experienced legal men, the men who will make the case and who will make the decision, the judges and solicitors or whoever acts on behalf of the plaintiff in these cases.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I want to mention is the chaotic condition of traffic in Dublin city.  It could be improved to a very great extent if road users would be made aware of their responsibilities and made to realise that each person is only entitled to his own share of the road and should not monopolise it.  That refers to the pedestrian, the cyclist, the motorist, the man who pushes a hand-cart or uses a horse and cart.  As regards cyclists in Dublin, they have no consideration for pedestrians, motorists or any other vehicle users.  It should be considered whether cyclists should be diverted through various streets still reaching the same destination rather than have them colliding with each other coming out of junction streets on <Col N="809" /> to the main streets and turning off the main streets.</P>
    <P>The Garda make suggestions regarding traffic signs, road painting and different street regulations in relation to traffic.  They have made many valuable suggestions which have relieved traffic congestion and, I am sure, will continue to do so.  It is the regulation of traffic which will make things easier in Dublin city.  In our coutry areas, for instance, the Garda suggest places where continuous white lines should be painted and also where the intermittent lines are to be painted. Experience has shown that these white lines on the roads have cut down the number of bad accidents.  The existence of either a continuous white line or an intermittent white line is an immediate suggestion to the road user to keep to the proper side.  Far more of this road painting should be carried out in areas where there is fairly heavy traffic.  If that were done in Dublin city, it would encourage people to keep along a straight line in the traffic instead of zig-zagging as many of them do.</P>
    <P>I cannot say much more about the traffic side of the Estimate without going into the problems of the Minister for Local Government but what I have to say was in relation to the actual regulation of traffic and the conduct of people using our roads and streets. If anything can be done by the Minister through the Gardaí in order to make people more traffic conscious I believe many lives will be saved and that there will be a freer flow of traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the present Minister for Justice on the efficient way he has carried out his work since he took office.  His task must certainly be one of the most difficult in the Government.  One hears criticism from the opposite side of the House but, in fairness, one must say that he has done a very good job to date and I feel sure he intends to continue the good work he has started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise a point on the conveying of messages when people from this country are killed in England in accidents or otherwise.  Messages pass between the Garda Síochána and the police in England and are conveyed <Col N="810" /> to the father, mother, brothers or sisters of the person who has met his death, perhaps in a road accident.  I am open to correction by the Minister, but my information is that if an accident occurs in England, a message comes from the English police to the Garda and one message passes back, but if it is within post office working hours, further messages must be sent from the post office by the relatives to the police in England.  That should be altered. These people would be prepared to pay the cost of the phone call through the Garda barracks.  In a country area, people may not be accustomed to using a phone and carrying on a conversation across the water and it may be difficult for them.  I would ask the Minister to look into it and, if it is the case at present, to alter the situation and let the Garda in this little country of ours convey the messages.  It often takes quite a while, maybe a week, where a person is killed in a motor accident or a building accident, for his remains to arrive and several phone calls must be made and the best way is to have the Garda phone the police in England.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney has left the House. A white line on roads may seem all right to him and to Deputies like him from the eastern counties where roads have an 18 or 20 foot carriageway, but in the country where roads may be 14 feet or less it is different. Perhaps a lorry and bus may meet at a very dangerous corner.  The front of the bus or lorry may be well inside the white line and the end of the vehicle slightly over it.  I have heard this discussed at local authority meetings.  Are the Garda going to take the white line as the dead centre of the road?  Perhaps the authority who painted the line might be out. It is a point that should be looked into before a prosecution is started. The person driving the vehicle may have slightly over half the road and when he is inside the white line thinks he is O.K., but there may not be room for vehicles to meet without a slight accident.</P>
    <P>I welcome any speed limits which may be introduced in the near future. I happened to visit a few small towns <Col N="811" /> in the past few months and I thought the speed of high-powered cars travelling through them uncalled for.  You cannot avoid accidents in small towns, unless limits are introduced.  I am thinking of places like Moycullen, west of Galway or Oranmore on the main trunk road from Galway to Limerick, Cork and Dublin.  The speed through these areas is uncalled for and I hope that whatever arrangements must be made for the introduction of a speed limit will be made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity of commenting favourably on the manner in which the Minister is discharging his duty.  The Minister can be described as a man who has a very active interest in his Department, and not alone that, but, I believe, a keen personal interest in every section of his Department, and I may say he is noted for his courtesy to all who have had dealings with him. His job is an extremely difficult one and one which certainly merits the support and co-operation of all Deputies. The Department of Justice is one of the most important Departments as it affects the very life of all of us.  When one considers the necessity for maintaining law and order, it cannot be described as anything but one of the most essential Departments in that it <Col N="812" /> safeguards the activities of daily life of all our citizens.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána for whom he is responsible have to discharge a very difficult job.  The time has come when we in this country should realise that the Garda are there as friends to safeguard the lives and property of the people.  Surely we have grown up in the past 40 years?  Surely we are sufficiently broadminded to know at this stage the difference between right and wrong?  Our people, at this stage of our country's history, should realise that it is necessary in any State to have the lives and property of the people safeguarded and that that is why the Garda are charged with the responsibility of being the people's protectors, defenders and friends.</P>
      <P>I want to express my appreciation of the manner in which the Minister has time and again directed the attention of the public to the importance of co-operating with the authorities, particularly with the Garda, in the discharge of their duties.  We have had in the past the most regrettable spectacle of Garda endeavouring to maintain law and order while not getting the full co-operation of the public.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, December 6th, 1962.</P>

    <P>NOTE 1.&mdash;The grants at <i>(a)</i> and <i>(h)</i> represent 50% recoupment of approved provisions by the local authorities concerned for main road upkeep.  In previous years recoupment was 40%.  The figures marked with an asterisk are provisional.</P>
    <P>NOTE 2.&mdash;The grants at <i>(b)</i> and <i>(c)</i> are allocated on a mileage basis.  In a number of cases transfers as between the two classes of grants were effected in accordance with general conditions laid down by the Department, during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>NOTE 3.&mdash;The grants at <i>(d)</i> are confined to counties in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.</P>
    <P>NOTE 4.&mdash;The grants at <i>(e)</i> are made available for selected works on main roads, such as the replacement of dangerous bridges, which cannot be dealt with under the main road improvement grant <i>(b).</i> In addition to the allocations listed there are provisional commitments in respect of certain bridges where increases in cost, etc., are likely to arise.</P>
    <P>NOTE 5.&mdash;The grants at <i>(f)</i> arose following the passing of the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959, and the Road Fund (Grants) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1962, and are given to certain road authorities to enable them to deal with road problems created by railway closings and the establishment of certain major industrial undertakings.</P>
    <P>NOTE 6.&mdash;The grants at <i>(g)</i> which were introduced this year are for necessary improvement works on selected sections of arterial routes, which are the major through-traffic routes.</P>
    <P>NOTE 7.&mdash;The grants at <i>(i)</i> totalling £550,000 are determined having regard to the relative needs of each area.</P>
    <P>NOTE 8.&mdash;The urban road improvement grant <i>(j)</i> was introduced for the first time in 1960/61.  The distribution is related to the mileage of urban roads in each town.  The total allocation (£55,155) is 10% in excess of the amount allocated in previous years.</P>
    <P>NOTE 9.&mdash;The Estate Duties Grant was terminated from 1st April, 1962.  The amounts at <i>(k)</i> are equal to the Estate Duties grant payments to the authorities concerned in 1961/62.</P>
