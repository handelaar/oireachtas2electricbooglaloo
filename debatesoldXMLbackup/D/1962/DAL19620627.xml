      <Col N="894" /> Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>4.  In paragraph (a), line 21, to delete all words after &ldquo;hours&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;of three o'clock and four o'clock in the afternoon or&rdquo;.&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the time of the midday break which under the Bill will apply only to Dublin and Cork.  I am suggesting that instead of the present hour's break from half-past two until half-past three there should be a break from 3 o'clock until 4 o'clock. This amendment is not being moved in any controversial way.  It is put down because we believe it is a matter which should be discussed and considered by the House, having regard to the fact that the Minister's withdrawal of Section 15 of the Bill was done in an atmosphere of threatening the publicans that unless they got into the catering business in a big way within the next year or two something similar to his proposals under Section 15 of the Bill would be reintroduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made to us, and this is what we should like the House to consider, that those publicans who are making a serious effort to cater for meals find themselves in a difficult position because of the timing of the midday break.  The person who goes in for a meal from a quarter-to-two onwards would find it very difficult to have an adequate meal or to be adequately served by the publicans before half-past two.  At half-past two he would have to leave because the public house must close.  Consideration should be given to that problem which exists at the moment and which will become even more widespread if the publicans have serious regard to the Minister's words in relation to going into the catering business.  If the hour were changed to operate between three o'clock and four o'clock the same interruption would not apply to those who wish to have their meal in public houses.  If it is thought desirable not to make any change in the timing of the hour at the moment it is <Col N="895" /> certainly a matter which should come up for review again if there is any widespread increase in the number of public houses that go in for the catering business.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly conscious of the fact that there are arguments against making a change at the present time. I know that, apart from one-man concerns, the publicans who employ staff in the cities of Dublin and Cork have become accustomed to the present pattern of things.  They have their staff rota arranged so as to allow meals to be taken by the staff or time off for the staff during this closing hour and an alteration would create some problems for them.  Not that I think the half-hour alteration would create any insuperable problems for the publicans but this is a matter which must be considered seriously and we should like to ascertain the views of the House on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I put my name to this amendment because I feel that publicans who are fulfilling the desire of the Minister as expressed in his speech on the Second Stage for the supplying of food and substantial meals to the public find that 2.30 o'clock is too early in the afternoon to close.  It is quite usual for a customer to come in at 2 o'clock, or five or ten minutes past 2 o'clock and it is quite impossible for him to have consumed his meal at 2.30 when he must be put out of the place and out on the sidewalk.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when he expressed the desire that the owners of licensed premises should examine the question of supplying substantial meals to the public.  I do not agree with all the speakers who said you are infringing on the rights of trade unions by abolishing or altering what is called the midday closing.  I do not think there is a publican left in this city who avails of that hour for lunch time.  Lunch time commences at 12.30 in all the licensed premises.  If there is a big staff half of them go to lunch at 12.30 and come back at 2 o'clock when the other half go to lunch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a great help if the Minister <Col N="896" /> would have the midday closing from 3 to 4 o'clock rather than from 2.30 to 3.30 o'clock, but I certainly would prefer if the Minister would consider, instead of that, leaving the midday closing as it is and permitting diners who are having a substantial meal to remain on the premises partaking of that meal with or without the serving of intoxicating liquor as the Minister and the Department may desire.  I think that would completely fulfil the suggestion made by the Minister in his opening statement on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not see why licensed premises serving substantial or adequate meals should not have the same facilities as a neighbouring hotel or restaurant. You have good class licensed premises in the city centre providing good substantial meals to the public and they have to put their customers out on the sidewalk at 2.30 p.m. while, right across the street or next door, and possibly selling as much or more intoxicating liquor, may be a restaurant or hotel which, because the owner has a restaurant licence, can keep its customers on the premises.  The Minister would be doing a good job of work if he could embody in the Bill a provision to permit diners to remain on licensed premises during the midday closing with or without the service of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a very contentious matter but I think the midday closing should be left as it is.  I do not drink but when I did drink, the boys and myself used to go to some club or other where we drank during the midday closing.  My objection to this matter is that, whereas at present a man will leave the pub at 2.30 p.m. and go home and find his dinner will be hot in the oven, if you leave the midday closing later, he possibly will not go home at all and that means that his missus will be kept in and cannot go out when she wants to go out.  At present the session drinkers are put out of the pub.  They go home and the missus is waiting with the dinner and then out she goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which it is spaced at the moment also enables the worker <Col N="897" /> to go home at 2.30 p.m. and he does not have to wait until 3 o'clock for his dinner.  He can also get out between 7 o'clock and 8 o'clock for his tea but if you put the hour back until 4 o'clock it would be too early for him to go home for his tea at 7 o'clock.  Many functions also start at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.  The cinemas start their programmes about that time and everybody likes to be out of a cinema at 6 or 6.30 p.m.  To do that they have to go in at 3 or 3.30 o'clock.  There is not much time if a man gets home at 3.30 for him to get his dinner and let his wife out to the pictures so that she will be home in time for tea.  As I see it, the hour we have at the moment is as good as any.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to the degradation of the Irish people since the introduction of this Bill.  I fail to see why the intelligence of the Irish people should be brought to such a low level as to say that because a man goes into a public-house, he degrades himself and his family and has to be hunted home out of it at 2.30 or 3.30 o'clock.  What about the men who do not go into a publichouse at all?  They can go into a betting office and remain there.  I know what I am talking about; I have experience of both.  They can go into the betting office at 11 in the morning and remain there until 5 in the evening.  They can stay there with their wages in their pockets, backing winners or losers as the case may be, until they are put out.</P>
      <P>Are we going to underestimate the intelligence of the people we represent and say that they are so degraded that we have to put the whip on them, and lock the door on them and say that they must go home at 2.30 o'clock?  I do not agree that we have reached that low level where men go out and squander everything they have in their pockets.  That may have been the case generations ago when we were an uneducated people, but surely, in 1962, we have reached a situation in which we look after our families first and then look after our own satisfaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must accept the fact that the <Col N="898" /> Minister has faced up to the position of the man who wants a drink.  I congratulate the Minister on his approach.  His predecessor simply did not know what the people needed. The present Minister knows what the people want.  We are here to legislate for the people.  Knowing both sides of the trade, I know what the people want.  All this talk about men going out and spending their wages, and then coming home and wrecking their homes, is just so much hot air.  That situation just does not obtain today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a great many of them still.  Do not worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>One finds home wreckers in every section of the community, and drink is not the cause. The hours of trading make no difference. The general situation is that a man has a certain amount of money to spend.  He wants to spend that to the best advantage.  If there is a race meeting, a football match, or a hurling match on TV, he will go in and meet his friends, enjoy the amenities offered, and watch whatever programme he happens to be interested in.  Any man is entitled to at least that in a free country.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the restrictions. A man who is engaged all morning unloading a cargo of slag, coal, or cement down at the docks will be very glad of a drink after his morning's work.  He is entitled to a drink any time he needs it, whether it be Good Friday or Christmas morning.  He deserves a drink.  Trade unionism, and all the other &ldquo;isms&rdquo;, are well catered for by the publican and by the employer in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken a courageous step in this matter.  He has had the views of the different sections concerned. I agree with Deputy Belton that, if a man wants a meal, be it a sandwich or anything else, he is entitled to have that meal, whether it is between 2 p.m., 2.30 p.m. or 3.30 p.m. and 4 p.m.  A man might finish his work at 2.15 p.m.  If he wants to go in and have something then, surely he is entitled to have it.  All these restrictions clearly show how out of touch some people are with the <Col N="899" /> facts.  I agree with the Minister there should be no restriction.  The less restriction there is, the less drinking there will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand this amendment applies to the cities of Dublin and Cork.  Having heard what Deputy Belton had to say in relation to this amendment, I am convinced it should not be passed.  I do not see why the publicans in Dublin should be given any advantage over the rest of the citizens in Dublin.  There was an outcry against Section 15 and it was withdrawn as a result of that outcry.  It was said that if people were serving food, they should not be allowed to serve drink.  Now, apparently, the publicans in Dublin want to have it both ways. The Minister urged publicans to do something about serving food in their establishments.  I do not think we have yet reached the stage at which we should encourage publicans to serve food.  There are a few public houses which do serve food, and serve it very well.  A large number of public houses attempt to serve food, but do not serve it very well.  A number of matters would need to be attended to before many of them could qualify as establishments suitable for the service of food.  One very prominent public house in the city centre serves food, but affords no amenities for people to wash their hands afterwards.  Unless every aspect in relation to the service and consumption of food is considered, we should not encourage the serving of food in city public houses.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that there is no great demand for a change in the afternoon hour of closing in Dublin.  I know no demand has come from the workers.  I am not quite sure if there has been a unanimous demand from the employers.  I think the Minister's suggestion in this connection should be accepted.  As I interpret it, it means leaving the afternoon closing as it is in both Dublin and Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would be inclined to think, listening to the debate <Col N="900" /> so far, that we are a nation of morons doing nothing else but drinking.  Nothing could be further from the facts. Even more remarkable is the fact that practically all the most profound speakers prefaced their remarks with the statement that they themselves do not drink.  If a man does not drink, I fail to see what interest he can have in a Liquor Bill.  Surely he should permit those who do drink to introduce a Bill which will meet the requirements of people who drink and not the requirements of those who have no interest at all in drink.  This is just one other example of the man on the fence always being the best hurler.  If a Liquor Bill is introduced based on the suggestions of the tee-totallers amongst us, God help he public and the publicans!</P>
      <P>It is all very well to talk about the need for publicans letting their staffs off.  The population of Dublin today must be in the region of 800,000.  Are we to stand idly by and see hundreds of people put out on the streets for an hour, people who merely use the public houses for simple enjoyment? These people may just have had a meal.  No one has raised that point so far.  The normal custom is to have some sort of meal before 2.30 p.m. They may then want a drink, over which to chat with friends.  It is rather extraordinary, considering how interested we profess to be in tourism, to find people anxious to close the public houses for an hour in the middle of the day.  The suggestion is absurd.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should regard the requirements of the public as paramount rather than the convenience of the publicans.  Public houses should be allowed to remain open.  There should be no law to compel them to remain open.  Any man who wants to close, let him close, if he wishes.  That would be the fairest way.</P>
      <P>With regard to food, to turn every public house into a restaurant is, I think, carrying things a bit too far.  I would remind some gentlemen who are now coming forward with this idea that they were the people who opposed the idea of giving an intoxicating liquor licence to a restaurant.  They are now going completely in reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the question of giving <Col N="901" /> food in a public house should arise at all.  There are many places where food can be made available for consumption on the premises.  With regard to the 2.30 to 3.30 p.m. closing, be it in Dublin, Cork, Waterford or any other place in the country, it should be possible for the public house to remain open for the benefit of the public rather than for the publican and the employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the maintenance of the midday closing is important. A number of publicans have experience of people coming into them after a wedding party or some other celebration in the morning.  When these people come into the ordinary public house, they have probably had nearly enough to drink at that stage. Unless there is an opportunity for the publican to break up that group or party, it is quite likely that these people will stay on in the public house for a long period of time and the publican will then find himself in difficulties in trying to remove them.  Also, on top of that, we have the question of the barmen.  The barmen should have a definite break and should know the time of the break.</P>
      <P>Rather than support the amendment we are now discussing, I should be inclined to move the midday closing forward instead of backwards half an hour.  I think that from 2 to 3 p.m. would be better, if there were to be any change.  Again, the Minister has shown his ability to find a happy compromise between the people who want to drink after lunch and the people who want to keep drinking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The compromise was arrived at in the 1927 Act.  I do not think the Minister was much interested in it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Unfortunately, there is no amendment to Section 14 of the 1927 Act which prohibits people from drinking in the diningroom of an holtel during the prohibited hours, even if they are residents of the hotel.  I mentioned that point on the Second Stage.  I hope we shall see some amendments in regard to it on Report Stage.  Possibly I shall put one down myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> As I was saying we have in this country a habit of what I might describe as drinking against the clock.  You occasionally have the man who knocks off at 1 o'clock for his lunchtime break.  He meets a friend or business associate and they decide to discuss some business problems over a drink.  They go into the public house at, say, 1.10 p.m. and invariably it will be 1.40 or 1.45 p.m. when they finish two drinks.  At that stage, one of them will look at the clock and say: &ldquo;Let us have another couple.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to bring the hour forward.  You are drinking against the clock more so, then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but you will not drink as much.  On the other hand, for the man who goes home to his lunch and who may in the course of business require a drink in the afternoon then 3.30 p.m. is a reasonable hour for him to get back.  He may even get back in plenty of time for 3 o'clock if he has to meet somebody and bring him to a public house for a drink.</P>
      <P>I think that what one publican said to me in connection with drinking against the clock was very good.  He said, in effect: &ldquo;If I could open for two hours, with an hour break, continually all day I could do a lot of business.  It is always in my last 15 minutes that I do the most business.&rdquo; He said that as soon as he calls out &ldquo;Last drinks, gentlemen, please; we are closing in 15 minutes,&rdquo; everyone wants to buy a drink immediately.  In my view that should be avoided.  At the same time, particularly from the point of view of the lunch hour break for publicans and their employees, and also to break up parties coming from some other function who probably have enough when they go into the public house, I think this midday closing should be maintained.  In my view, the hours we have at the moment are generally acceptable.  To change them in any way would be a mistake and would involve changing the habits which our people have formed over the years since 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can <Col N="903" /> see, we are discussing a lot of hypothetical amendments as to whether we should give certain latitudes to publicans who serve meals during the midday closing.  That is not the amendment we are discussing.  We are discussing a specific amendment.  If we confine our discussion to that, possibly we might get over it.  I understand that the late Kevin O'Higgins, in introducing the 1927 Act, suggested for the first time the midday closing and, with the approval of the Dáil, it was fixed at 2.30 to 3.30 p.m.&mdash;and that has been the midday closing down through the years.</P>
      <P>Now, this amendment suggests that we should change the time by half an hour and make the closing from 3 to 4 p.m.  It is a matter for discussion merely on that specific point, whether it should be changed or otherwise.  I shall give the House one reason.  People coming into town for the afternoon generally get in somewhere between 2 and 3 p.m., after their lunch in the country.  They want a drink when they come into town.  They find the public houses closed and they remain closed until 3.30 p.m.  If they get into town for a Soccer, Gaelic or Rugby match they have to go to the game without any refreshment at all.  Games such as these generally start between 3 and 3.30 p.m.  They cannot get any refreshment until the match is over.</P>
      <P>I have a completely open mind on the matter but I think it is well worth considering a change from 3 to 4 p.m. Deputy Mullen is right.  People just do not rush into a public house and spend the entire afternoon drinking. I agree with Deputy N. Lemass that the more restrictions we have, the more drinking we shall have or, rather, the worse the manner of drinking.</P>

      <P>Deputy N. Lemass described it as &ldquo;beating the clock.&rdquo;  I have said that many times. We are discussing an <i>ad hoc</i> amendment. There is not much point in going over our views.  I think there is something in this experiment of the <Col N="904" /> hour between 3 to 4 p.m.  Let it be. I know a number of people who arrive in the city and who are disappointed when they cannot get a drink between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. What happens?  They find themselves taking advantage of an hotel and get the drink there.  There is no public bar in the hotel.  There is an old saying that whenever you go to Mass, you always see the priest.  Personally, when I want a drink, I always like to see the bottle.</P>

      <P>And the measure.  I am never too fond of a drink in a hotel lounge.  I would rather see the bottle and see the measure, as Deputy Coughlan pointed out.  What I have been saying is what happens when people arrive in town.  They drift into the lounges of the hotels and the restaurants because it is an appropriate time to go there to get a drink. I think that if the break were between 3 and 4 p.m. it might prove to be a more suitable time.  We might try it as an experiment and if the experiment is not successful, then on some future occasion we can revert to the hours fixed in 1927.</P>

      <P>I must say I am totally against this midday break, judging by the arguments I have heard here to-day.  I do not like the approach that our people have to be marshalled around.  Times have changed since 1927.  I do not like this insinuation that John Murphy or Bill Kelly will go into a public house and the midday closing hour has to be there to get them out. Surely we have changed over the years?  I do not agree with that attitude at all.  While I have been approached by various interested parties in Dublin, I do not know the views of the trade unions or the licensed trade as a whole.  I was not going to speak on this amendment but I do object to the trend of the debate, that our people have to be marshalled and that we have not changed our attitude to drink over the years.  I feel we have changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take my own constituency.  One finds that there is a public house in the city <Col N="905" /> area observing the midday closing hour while another public house about 200 yards outside the city boundary, remains open.  I do not see the difference&mdash;it is a built-up area.  But I strongly object to the idea that this has to be done to curb our people in drinking.  That is not the position at all today.  I am not concerned whether it is 2.30 p.m. or 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. but I would like to see the midday closing abolished.</P>

      <P>I think the speakers today have taken their cue from last night's debate on amendment No. 2. They have a wrong conception of the whole idea.  We have before us this amendment in the names of Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Belton, Deputy Byrne and Deputy O'Keeffe, to have the midday closing hour in Dublin and Cork from 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock.  They are justified in putting down that amendment and I think the Minister would be justified in agreeing to it.  I am going to say what appears to be an unforgivable thing.  Prominent people in the licensed trade have got a prominent member, one of their number, who is a member of the Dáil to put down this amendment.  That seems an unpopular thing to say, that when the publicans are being brushed aside during the debate, nobody should be concerned about them at all.</P>
      <P>The House and the Minister must be concerned with that trade.  If a small group of organised workers were upset in their industry, we would have protests here and nobody would say a word against the people endeavouring to look after their conditions.  I must say I am disappointed as I thought we were starting off on the right foot last night.  I am disappointed with the Minister's attitude in this Bill so far.  He is not going to get this Bill as easily as I thought.  This is a reasonable amendment and I hope he is not going to treat it as he treated the reasonable amendment put to him last night.</P>

      <P>Maybe he was tired <Col N="906" /> after the marathon on the Official Secrets Bill and the Judges Bill but he should consider the licensed trade.  As I said last night, I keep on asking myself who inspired this Bill?  Who wanted this Bill?  Why should we have had this Bill at all?  There was no demand for it.  I am not a teetotaller and I can speak with some knowledge about the inside of a public house. I do not think anybody in this House painted the picture that the Irish people were degraded and would remain in public houses drinking until they became insensible.  What was said was that there would be a great number of people who would do that. It is important that we should legislate to suit a large and representative group of people like the Dublin publicans. They are big ratepayers and taxpayers and they&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think I have been misinterpreted a bit.  Amendment No. 4 proposes a change in the midday closing hour&mdash;not that it should be done away with entirely but that the time should be changed.  I am inclined to agree with Deputies P. O'Donnell and P.J. Burke that the more restrictions you have, the worse type of drinking you will have.  To my mind, the fewer restrictions you have, the less drunkenness there will be.  If we must have a closing hour it would be better to move it back to 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be reasonable about this amendment.  I think it is something on which we all will have our views.  I would not have the slightest hesitation in accepting the amendment if there was a prospect of getting general agreement on the desirable thing to do.  It seems to me that all we are really concerned with here is the convenience of the Dublin and Cork publicans and their staffs. It does not seem to me that the general public will be inconvenienced one way or another.  In that situation we might leave over any further discussion until the Report Stage and I shall very sincerely consider the amendment and the additional suggestions which have been made by Deputy Belton to the effect that persons <Col N="909" /> should be allowed to remain on licensed premises during the prohibited period provided they are having a substantial meal.</P>
      <P>I shall undertake to consider these two matters very seriously between now and the Report Stage and I would also like to have further discussions with the publicans concerned because my information about the situation is that the Dublin publicans are fairly well divided on this issue.  I do not think Deputy M.J. O'Higgins is right when he thinks trade union difficulties are of paramount importance.  My understanding of the situation is that in Dublin the larger publicans, who employ in the main trade union labour, are in favour of a total abolition of the midday closing hour, but that the smaller publicans who man their own premises are in favour of its retention because it provides them with an opportunity of having their mid-day meal and of tidying up their premises.</P>
      <P>My own personal inclination would be to abolish the midday closing hour altogether for various reasons, some of which I gave last night, but as I do not feel that the public interest is vitally involved in this matter one way or another, I think it is one of the situations in which we should have regard to the interests and the convenience of the publicans and their staffs.  We can afford in this case to have special regard to them because there is no great public interest involved either way.  If that is agreeable to Deputies I would suggest the amendment be withdrawn for the moment on the understanding that I shall look into it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, since it was originally introduced in 1927.  I think we can now consider abolishing this midday closing hour with an easy mind and that we can be satisfied that to do so would not have any socially undesirable consequences. That is true from what I know of Dublin and Cork.  There is one aspect of this matter of which I am particularly aware.  Many of the licensed premises to-day have installed television sets for the convenience and the entertainment of customers and they have at the moment a problem, particularly on Saturdays, with customers who want to stay on for the purpose of seeing a big race or some such event.  These are human factors, things to which we must have regard, and if people get into the habit of staying on illegally then we are starting all over again the whole business of ignoring the law.  It is much better to meet the reasonable convenience of the people than to have provisions that will only result in the commission of illegal acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The 16s. 6d. rate of disability benefit is a special rate paid to persons in receipt of full Army disability pension who have not requalified for the ordinary rates of disability <Col N="935" /> benefit under the Social Welfare Acts by payment of a required minimum number of contributions in respect of insurable employment after discharge and who immediately prior to the 5th January, 1953, were in receipt of benefit at that rate under the former National Health Insurance Acts.  The Social Welfare Acts and Regulations preclude persons in receipt of full Army disability pension from receiving disability benefit until they have paid the required number of requalifying contributions after discharge.  In order to avoid hardship to persons in this category who were already in receipt of sickness or disablement benefit immediately prior to the 5th January, 1953, it was decided to make provision for the continuation of such benefit. There has been no increase in this rate since 1953.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will introduce legislation (a) to empower him to make land available locally, whenever possible, to workers who are landless men but who can prove that they have an aptitude for the proper use and good husbandry of such land, and (b) to extend the mile limit to two miles in the case of smallholders who qualify otherwise for allotments of estates to be divided by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of introducing legislation in relation to the matters referred to does not arise.</P>
      <P>As regards (a), nothing in the Land Acts precludes such persons from qualifying for allotments: provision is, in fact, made for them on the division of lands wherever circumstances permit.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to my remarks of 7th and 13th instant, when opening and replying to the debate on the Lands Estimate for the current financial year&mdash;Volume 195, Columns 2206-2227 and 2328-2338 and Volume 196, Columns 165-175.</P>
      <P>As regards (b), for the economic and proper working of an enlargement, it is desirable that it should be within a reasonable distance of the allottee's residence.  Such distance has been accepted as about one mile and it is not proposed to extend it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands what programme is envisaged by the Land Commission for the acquisition and division of land, and the migration of suitable tenants to relieve congestion, in the constituency of East Galway for the year ending 31st March 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As the land settlement programme each year necessarily depends on a variety of circumstances including such factors as the duration of acquisition proceedings, delays in getting possession of acquired lands, co-operation by tenants in migration and rearrangement proposals, etc., it is virtually impossible to forecast the outcome of any particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> Land Commission activities are not planned in relation to constituency areas.  For County Galway as a whole, however, as far as can be visualised at this early stage, it is anticipated that land settlement in the current year will be approximately at the same level as last year, provisional returns for which are as follows:</P>
    <P>An aggregate area of 4,300 acres was taken over for division while a total area of about 7,300 acres was distributed in some 400 allotments, including the migration of nine tenants and the rearrangement of upwards of 180 intermixed holdings.  Expenditure on estate improvements amounted to approximately £110,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Land Commission have made an offer for the purchase of this 259 acre property which is currently on the market and that they are awaiting the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a purchaser has stepped in in the meantime and in view of this altered situation, will he request the Land Commission, in view of the desirability of building up a reserve of land to implement Government policy in regard to the relief of congestion in the West, to ensure that this holding will not pass into hands other than those of the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the estate is on the market.  I am not aware that another purchaser has stepped in.</P>

      <P>Oh, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a case in which the Land Commission, if they are to succeed, will have to succeed on the basis of voluntary sale.  It is not a case, from the information at my disposal, <Col N="943" /> in respect of which compulsory proceedings would be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that if an individual who already has a substantial amount of land should purchase this land, the Land Commission, in the interests of small holders, could then compulsorily acquire the land and have the matter dealt with in the Land Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is under a misapprehension, as far as the law is concerned.  Where the &ldquo;adequates&rdquo; sections apply, that is, where land is properly worked and appropriate employment given, the Land Commission cannot exercise compulsory powers.  If a sale takes place before the Land Commission take steps for compulsory proceedings on the grounds to which I have referred, there is nothing the Land Commission can do, unless the new owner fails to operate the lands successfully.  That is my understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to clarify the point.  I appreciate that the land was being worked excellently, and so forth, and difficulty might arise, but where a new purchaser stepped in, is it not possible for the Land Commission to issue an acquisition notice in such a case where new ownership could be established?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not, until the law is amended, unless the new owner proves unsatisfactory.  If he satisfies what we call the &ldquo;adequates&rdquo; sections, he must get a chance.  If he fails, of course, that is another matter.</P>

The final date for the receipt in the Department from the markers of the returns of the marks varies in accordance with the subject concerned and in 1961 the period within which such final dates fell extended from the 17th to the 28th July in the case of the Leaving Certificate Examination and from the 7th July to the 18th August in the case of the Intermediate Certificate Examination.  It is anticipated that the corresponding periods this year will be the 16th to the 28th July in the case of the Leaving Certificate and the 6th July to the 18th August in the case of the Intermediate Certificate Examination.  The provisional results of the Leaving Certificate Examination were issued to the schools on the 9th August in 1961 and of the Intermediate Certificate Examination on the 7th September.  It is hoped that the Leaving Certificate Examination provisional results will be available for issue this year not later than the 10th August and the Intermediate Certificate Examination provisional results not later than the 7th September.</P>

      <P>The information requested in the first part of the Deputy's question is confidential and I am not prepared to make it available to him.  In regard to the second and third parts of the Deputy's question there is no obligation on the convening authority or higher authority to accept the findings of a Court of Inquiry or to submit any fresh evidence to the Court.  I have fully considered the facts of the case and I propose, subject to any representations that the officer concerned may wish to make, to require him to pay a sum of £72 towards the deficiencies of stores.  He has been advised of the reasons for this decision and is being afforded an opportunity to show cause why this course should not be taken.  Meanwhile, the balance of his gratuity under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, less the above-mentioned sum, has been released.</P>

      <P>The officer's staff consisted of five company quartermaster-sergeants, one sergeant and five privates.  Four of the company quartermaster-sergeants had completed appropriate Army courses, and the other two non-commissioned officers had suitable experience over a number of years.</P>

The amount of the increase to be granted to the different categories has not yet been determined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent an area which has more public houses than any other area of its size in the country.  Dublin North Central includes O'Connell Street, the cattle market, the fish market, the vegetable market, the docks.  In the docks, the public houses are clustered together. Summerhill is part of Dublin North Central.  It is one of the most densely populated areas in the country.  I suppose there are more public houses there than anywhere else in this city. There are also more fellows who &ldquo;beer&rdquo; in that area.  I have even greater experience than that.  I was in the dance game for 30 years.  I know the effect drink has on people. In 99 cases out of 100, drink is the cause of all the trouble that arises.  I speak as an authority.</P>
      <P>The proposal in the Bill is that public houses should open from four o'clock until ten o'clock.  These hours are opposed.  It is said that six hours' opening is too long an opening on Sunday.  It is too long particularly for the workers.  Now Dublin must be considered by itself.  It is in a special category because it can be said that we represent in Dublin one-quarter of the population of Ireland. Thousands of people who work in public houses&mdash;I mean thousands literally; there are barmen, and doormen, and all the others&mdash;want a few hours' leisure on Sunday afternoon. Getting off at two o'clock and coming back again at four o'clock gives them only two hours.  All they can do in that time is have their dinner.  They cannot go to a football match or attend a sports meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This view has been put forward by the Grocers Assistants Organisation in <Col N="968" /> Parnell Square.  These people like their game.  They may even like to play in a game.  With these hours on Sunday they are deprived of their game.  I suggest 5.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. would be the ideal from every point of view.  To begin with, the pioneers would be satisfied because that would reduce the hours by one hour and a half and lessen the period in which people could drink.  The workers would be satisfied because they would have a reasonable break.  With three and a half hours' break, they could go home, have their dinner, go to a match, and be down in nice time for the reopening at 5.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The publicans themselves would like to get off on Sunday afternoon.  They would like to take a drive down the country and come back in time for the 5.30 p.m. opening.  Sunday afternoon is recognised as a time for sport and games.  We ought to encourage athletics.  If the public houses open at 4 p.m. games and sports may run the risk of being deprived of patrons. Many might not bother to go.  It should be our ambition to encourage sports and athletics.  If the public houses opened at 5.30, 5 o'clock would be a little early for the assistants who might want to go to some amusement, the cinema or a match.  If they have to get back to work at 5 o'clock, they would have to leave the cinema before they saw the full picture.  That would not be fair.  They would have to leave the playing pitch before the actual finish of a match and it is the last part that is the best part, as you know, of anything.  Therefore, I have worked it out as well as I could to suit everyone. In my view, 5.30 p.m. would allow those people to go to a cinema or to go to a match and to be able to get the bus and be back nicely in time to suit the people coming out of the picture houses and out of the matches.</P>
    <P>As you know, matches are over about 5 p.m.  After a walk down town, they would not have long to wait.  Therefore, the people who, say, come from the country, especially for the big matches which have been referred to and which are held in the city, could get a drink or two before leaving for their trains.  Six o'clock <Col N="969" /> would be a bit too late.  Those people would be hanging around for the best part of an hour.  They might have to get their train at 6 or 6.30 p.m.  This would be a bit too late.  Furthermore, the cinema crowd would be out at 5.30 p.m. and they would have gone home.  There would be too much of a wait until 6 o'clock.  If it were 7 o'clock, people coming home from the matches would not be able to get a drink at all.</P>
    <P>I have worked it out and I am trying to meet the Minister.  In my view, 5.30 p.m. would give reasonable time to the workers playing a game or seeing a game to get back.  It would give reasonable time to allow the pubs to be opened to cater for the crowds coming from the cinemas and the matches.  It would reduce the period to 4½ hours and, again, it would give the workers a break rather than have them on duty for a long period.</P>
    <P>I cannot say much more than that but I should like to say a word or two in reference to the closing at 9 or 10 p.m.  Some Deputies think that the pubs should close at 9 p.m.  I am against it.  I am accepting the 10 p.m. closing.  I do not like 9 p.m., because at 9 p.m. your night is ruined.  The night is too young at 9 p.m.  At the same time, you can go nowhere at 9 p.m.  All amusements proper start at 8 p.m.  The concert, everything you can think of, starts at 8 p.m.  Therefore, there would be no point in going for public entertainment at 9 p.m.  Anyway, you could not get in or the show would be partly over.  Nine o'clock is not a suitable hour.</P>
    <P>To have to come out at 9 o'clock means that you are only encouraging fellows to go off on the batter or to do something they should not do. Furthermore, most of the religious bodies commence their ceremonies at 8 p.m. and they are usually over at 9 p.m.  The Rosary is over.  It is not well, either, to have one crowd coming out of the church and another crowd coming out of the pub at the same time.  It is too early to go home at 9 o'clock but at 10 o'clock the night is nearly over.  You can walk home and be there in nice time, in reasonable time.  It suits the wife; it suits everyone. Ten o'clock would be nice time. <Col N="970" /> Nine o'clock is a bad time.  That is my point.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister in this regard.  I do not want to press my amendment.  I want the Minister to consider the points.  You will hear the arguments here that the pubs should be shut at 8 or 9 p.m.  They are not reasonable arguments.  You will get the points that they are open between 6 and 7 p.m.&mdash;but the crowds coming from the matches will not be catered for then.  The Minister has the reputation of being a sticker to his guns.  I know he probably will not agree to any radical amendments at all.  But my amendment meets his proposal and therefore it is something which he ought to consider.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to hundreds of barmen, to the public and to publicans.  I was out in Malahide only last week.  A new lounge was opened and there were about six publicans there.  It was a sort of a family business.  I spoke to them and I spoke to the attendants about this matter.  They all agreed that what I am proposing would meet them and they would be satisfied with it.  I have been in a lot of bars.  I have been on the Quays.  I have asked all the assistants about this matter.  I know them all.  As I said, I have more pubs in my area than any other member of this House.</P>
    <P>I drank at one time and I did all the pubs.  I know what I am talking about.  I used to drink up to closing hours.  I did not go home.  There is a case made here that you are different. We are not a bit different.  That is a lot of &ldquo;hooey&rdquo;.  We do not enact laws here for the majority but for a minority.  Actually, we enact laws here to protect ourselves.  All the laws are really enacted here to guard against the wild actions of minorities.  Not everyone goes around killing his mother or father but a few do and that is why we have a penalty such as hanging.  Not everyone robs or abuses females.  Actually, it is a minority who do those things.  It is a minority who do all the depredations.  It is a minority who compel us to come in here and to pass certain legislation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when people say: &ldquo;Oh, the Irish people are all changing&rdquo; I <Col N="971" /> say that that is all &ldquo;my granny&rdquo;. Twenty per cent. of them have not changed and it is about the 20 per cent. that we are worried.  It is the 20 per cent. who will hang around the pub until it closes at 2.30 p.m.  They are the people we should be thinking about and let us give over this business of trying to play to the gallery that they are all grand people.  Yes, 80 or 90 per cent. of them are grand people.  It is the other 10 or five per cent for whom we must legislate in order to control them.  They are the people who can go out and knock down people and even kill them with their motor cars.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to be misled.  I appeal to him to make sure to fix reasonable hours.  That is why I want the midday break.  I know it all from experience.  Here is a funny thing.  The last day I drank, I drank hooch.  I never drank it before.  A fellow said to me: &ldquo;Here, taste this.&rdquo; I did so and it tasted like water.  I said: &ldquo;That is nothing.&rdquo;&ldquo;Have another sup,&rdquo; he said.  I again said: &ldquo;That is nothing.&rdquo;  Then I walked out into the air and fell on my face on the street.  That is what I mean.</P>
    <P>Those people in pubs who hang on do not always stop drinking in time.  It is only when they go out in the air that they get drunk.  It is dangerous.  The midday break would make them realise that they should not go too far.  The break is good.  I have experience of all those things.  I do not want to be told that I do not know what I am talking about.  I am not speaking for the publican.  I am not speaking as one who is perhaps thinking of his own interests.  I am not speaking as a member of the House who is thinking about the local vote. I am not thinking of anything local&mdash; anything &mdash; in that line.  I am thinking of all the people.  I am thinking of the wives of the people who drink, as well as the publicans.  Little has been said about them.  Let them drink.  They know what they are doing but the wives are at home in their thousands worrying and complaining.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister seriously <Col N="972" /> to consider my amendment.  It meets his proposal in the Bill.  I am accepting 10 p.m. I am saying 5.30 p.m.  Why I am not saying 5 p.m. is because I want the fellows to have time to go to a match and to get back.  If it is 5 p.m. they will have to race and lose part of a show.  Give them reasonable time.  The case has been made to me that there is no business between 4 and 5 p.m.  What is the use of opening them if there is no business?</P>
    <P>We should cultivate athletic sports. We should go to fellows who would like a break and say to them: &ldquo;There is a chance for you.  Organise your forces.  You will have a good show. The boys will have to attend.  The pubs will not be open.&rdquo;  The counterattraction of 4 p.m. would be bad.  My amendment suits everyone.  I am not concerned about any vested interests. I am not trying to curry favour with any one of the 27 persons who wrote to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most Deputies will feel that Deputy Sherwin has approached this matter in an effort to find a solution for what is a difficult problem, no matter what side of the House may be involved, namely, the question of opening and closing hours.  We on this side of the House have approached this measure in an effort to try to arrive at a solution which will suit the majority of the people.  We are convinced that the Minister's proposals in the Bill, namely, all the year round opening from 4 o'clock to 10 o'clock on a Sunday, is not the answer and does not suit everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which it is necessary for the Minister to clarify in the course of this discussion because the Minister's attitude, and the attitude of his Party, is of paramount importance.  The belief is held in a number of quarters and the impression has been created by the Minister's reply on the Second Reading that so far as he and the Government are concerned, they are quite prepared to abandon the principle of uniformity which was introduced into the licensing code by the 1960 Act.  The first thing it is necessary to clarify, and the Minister should do it, is whether <Col N="973" /> that is a fact or not, whether the Minister's attitude is that he wants to preserve the principle of uniformity so far as closing hours are concerned, or whether his attitude is that he is not concerned one way or another and that he and the Government are prepared to abandon that policy or principle.</P>
    <P>In our approach to this, we have assumed from the Minister's attitude on the Second Reading that he stands over the principle of uniformity and that he recommends its acceptance by the House.  We feel, and I said this on Second Reading, that the principle of uniformity is an excellent one, if it works and if it is practicable, but that experience of the working of the 1960 Act certainly calls into question whether or not, taking the country as a whole, cities and rural areas, the principle of uniformity is workable. We see the advantages and we accept the advantages of having uniformity so far as the closing hour is concerned, just as Deputy Sherwin did in relation to his amendment.  But we feel that the working of the 1960 Act in regard to Sunday opening in rural areas has shown that the hours which have operated up to this, that is, 5 o'clock to 9 o'clock for portion of the year and from 5 o'clock to 8 o'clock for the other portion of the year, have not been suitable and that there has been a demand, and a justifiable demand, in rural areas for a later opening than 9 o'clock, certainly in the summer months.</P>
    <P>We feel that that demand is justified and one which must be catered for. That brings us to the problem, and it is a problem for the Minister as well as everyone else here, that later Sunday opening hours which are required and certainly are sought in country areas are not sought in the city area.  I am talking now mainly about Dublin.  A later opening than 9 o'clock is not regarded as necessary or desirable in the Dublin city area.  If the Minister were to legislate in such a way as to have the Dublin publicans closing at 9 o'clock, and have publicans in the rural areas closing on Sundays at 10 o'clock, obviously you would immediately create for the duration of that <Col N="974" /> hour's differential the danger of a <i>bona fide</i> trade.  The experience of all Deputies was that the undesirable feature and the evil arising from the <i>bona fide</i> traffic were due to the closing differential.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 8, we are suggesting that there should be a differential as between the city and country areas, so far as opening hours are concerned, but that the differential should not exist, as far as closing hours are concerned. No matter what hours are fixed for rural opening, they are not going to suit everywhere.  You have, first of all, the conflict as between larger urban areas such as the cities and country districts and you again have the further conflict as between different zones or areas in the rural areas as a whole.  You have holiday resorts, many of which would regard even a 10 o'clock closing hour as being quite inadequate.  You have other rural areas where a 10 o'clock closing hour might not only be sufficient but regarded by many people as being too late.</P>
    <P>By and large, it is true to say that 10 o'clock closing in the country is necessary, is sought and is required by the people, but there is still the question of the holiday resorts, No. 1, where 10 o'clock closing is not sufficient&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the lot discussed together.  The Minister is quite right and our proposal in amendment No. 12 is not limited to Sundays. That is the proposal with regard to area exemptions for holiday resorts. The case I was making was that whatever hours are fixed for closing in <Col N="975" /> rural areas, it still leaves outstanding the question of holiday resorts.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy who spoke earlier today that it would be quite wrong for us to legislate against our own interests and to do that on the plea that it was necessary to cater for tourists' interests, that we should allow tourists' interests to predominate over the interests of our own people. That would be quite wrong.  But it is not only proper but necessary that we should have regard to areas in the country which either attract tourists or which are holiday resorts in the sense that they attract our own people for the holiday period.  We recognise that a difficulty does exist and we feel the only reasonable way of meeting that difficulty is to empower some authority in the country&mdash;and we suggest the district court, as it was empowered before the 1960 Act&mdash;to grant exemptions from whatever hours are fixed if the justice is satisfied the area is a holiday resort and likely to attract a number of visitors.</P>
      <P>Even that does not end the difficulties which arise.  Even if you do cater generally for rural areas and cater in a particular way for holiday resorts, there is still the section of the people who are left uncatered for at a time when it is necessary to cater for them, that is, the people in the rural area on the occasion of a special event.  There might be a GAA or a soccer match or a game of rugby in a town on a Sunday.  It might be found&mdash;in fact, I think it has been found&mdash;that the existing hours are quite unsuitable to cater for the needs of such functions, and even the new hours submitted by us, and by the Minister in the Bill, would still be unsuitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly we realise that if our suggestions for Sunday opening hours in rural areas&mdash;from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. during the winter and from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. during the summer&mdash;are accepted, the problem of the town or area which holds a special function must still be catered for.  In that respect, our suggestion is that there is no reason in the world why the district court should not be vested with <Col N="976" /> authority to grant special hours of opening to cater for such events on Sundays.  We are putting forward a three-pronged proposal to the Minister which is outlined in amendments Nos. 8, 12 and 20.  In amendment No. 8, we are suggesting hours of from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. for Sunday opening in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I believe it to be a fact that it has been represented very strongly by a number of sources that the hour of 10 p.m. might be too late in Dublin. I was interested to hear what Deputy Sherwin, an Independent Deputy, who no doubt has been in touch with his constituents in this matter, had to say on it and he believes 10 o'clock will be all right.  On the other hand, it has been represented very strongly to me that the city publicans and the drinking public in Dublin would be quite satisfied with 9 p.m.  However, if that were permitted it would create the differential at the wrong end and, consequently, having given the matter very careful and exhaustive consideration, our proposal is that the Dublin hours should be 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.</P>
    <P>As far as the rural areas are concerned, we are suggesting that during the summer months&mdash;I am talking now about the season, June, July, August and September, rather than the summer time laid down by Ministerial Order &mdash;the opening hours on Sunday evenings should be 6 to 10 and that for the remainder of the year they should be 7 to 10.  Those proposals are being put forward in conjunction with the other two proposals I have referred to&mdash;area exemption orders for holiday resorts and special exemptions for particular areas for particular events.  I should like to recommend all three to the Minister and to the House in the belief that they will be accepted by him and the House as suitable to the country as a whole. They will not satisfy everyone&mdash;that would be quite impossible&mdash;but they will satisfy most of the people most of the time.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise again that I regard it as very important the Minister should clear up any ambiguity which exists with respect to his own intentions. I am not suggesting the Minister <Col N="977" /> deliberately intended to be ambiguous in his references but I have reason to know that his reply on the Second Reading of the Bill has created the impression that he is quite prepared to abandon the principle of uniformity. It has been suggested that that interpretation has been given to certain remarks made by the Minister on the Second Reading and that has been accepted as the true interpretation.  I have read very carefully the Minister's Second Reading speech and his reply and I cannot find any justification for such an interpretation or such an impression being created, but I do invite the Minister now to state his position clearly on this.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy Sherwin, I must confess that it is a long time since I heard a more confused submission.  On the one hand, he expressed concern for the workers and worried also about the customers. At the same time, I find him advocating longer hours for the workers.  He said that the closing of public houses at 9 p.m. did not allow either workers or customers an opportunity of going anywhere afterwards.  I suggest it would be a good time for the barmen to go home and rest after a hard day's work.  Deputy Sherwin was also concerned about the wives of those who consume drink.  Would it be such a bad thing if those who drink were urged to go home at 9 o'clock?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin has indicated that he has made a canvass of people who work in public houses and of their employers.  I want it to be perfectly understood that the trade unions which represent the bar workers in Dublin have already submitted to the Minister on behalf of their members that they do not want any change in the Sunday hours of opening.  I understand that the organised employers have adopted the same attitude.  There is no denying that.  Through the office of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the unions met the Minister on this matter.  Anyone who wants to can at any time go <Col N="978" /> into any of the public houses in Dublin and ask a simple question: &ldquo;What do you think of the proposed new Sunday hours,&rdquo; and the reply will be: &ldquo;We do not want them.  They are not necessary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is also my view and I am more than anxious that the Minister would indicate what is the case for these proposed new hours.  I am talking now about Dublin and Cork and in support of the amendment put down by Deputy Casey and myself.  I can well understand there is a necessity for an alteration of hours outside Dublin and Cork and we have no objection to that.  In fact, we think it is a good idea.  That would mean that Dublin would be left as it is and that there would be lack of uniformity.  But what price uniformity?  We have already found it necessary to disregard uniformity in relation to the midday closing times.  I want it clearly understood that a combination of employers and trade union members in Dublin are 100 per cent. behind this.  People who frequent public houses have expressed similar views to me.  They regard these new hours as a bit much.</P>
      <P>In instituting such hours, we are worsening the conditions of the employees and forcing the employers to worsen their conditions.  Deputies know there is a great deal of difficulty in getting people to work in the bar trade because of the present hours of work.  If we worsen that situation, we will get fewer people in future and that will be bad for all of us, both the tourists and the ordinary man in the street.  We know that the bar business postulates that employees must attune themselves to the idea of working when most others are enjoying themselves, but let us not push that too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us picture the situation in unorganised, family houses.  The Minister said earlier today that family houses used the hour in order to have a break.  There are a number of houses where they put people to work and give no thought to a break.  The only thing that forces them to do so are trade union regulations.  If we had the proposed new hours&mdash;the opening at 12.30&mdash;the situation in Dublin would be something like this.  A man <Col N="979" /> would have to leave his home at 12 o'clock to get to his work at a quarter past and prepare to open.  The premises would close at two but by the time he had cleared up and was out, it would be a quarter past.  He would then go home to see his wife and family and have a meal.  Barmen, too, would like to have their Sundays off, but, because of the nature of their job, they have to work.  He then goes home, has a meal and must be back in the shop in order to open up again at 4 o'clock in preparation for customers.</P>
    <P>The barman knows there will be no customers.  As Deputy Sherwin said, the customers will be in the picture houses or, if it is a fine day, at football matches, up in the Park or at the seaside.  I cannot understand where this idea for an opening at 4 p.m. came from.  There is no public demand for it.  I do not believe it was the Minister's idea.  I think the Minister was badly advised in this regard.  I should like an explanation as to how it came about.  It has been said that people who play our national games will no longer have an opportunity of playing them.  I am referring to the barmen who formed very good hurling teams in this city and played no small part in building up the national games here.  Now they will be divorced from all this.  For what purpose?</P>
    <P>I have indicated already the feelings of the trade union movement.  I should like to ask the Minister to give further consideration to the proposed four o'clock opening.  Deputy Casey and I have put down an amendment asking that things be left as they are. In view of the Minister's conciliatory approach commencing the Committee Stage, we recognise that we cannot have it all our own way.  I know the views of the different unions representing the barmen in Dublin.  I do not purport to speak for people outside Dublin.  The views of the barmen are: if you cannot leave the position as it is, give us a break in the afternoon in Dublin city and have the hours seven to ten.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mullen <Col N="980" /> said barmen would like to have some Sundays off.

      <P>That demonstrates that, regardless of what hours are prescribed by the Minister, the trade unions are well able to look after the welfare of their members.  The whole thing rests on whether or not the principle of uniformity will be maintained. I had correspondence with the Rev. Fr. Dargan, S.J., of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, in which he indicated to me that their representatives on the Intoxicating Liquor Commission signed a majority report in favour of the later opening hours in the cities because they believed if they did not go along with the proposed hours in the 1960 Bill the most objectionable feature of the licensing laws, the <i>bona fide</i> trade, would not be done away with.</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage of the 1960 Bill, I quoted this letter from Fr. Dargan at column 1017, volume 180 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>However, most of the main principles which we advocated were adopted in the Majority Report, and while our representative never wanted the prolonged hours advocated by other commissioners and pressed to have the hours shortened, he signed the report, taking into account the fact that unless he did so, there was a danger that another and less desirable report would be adopted as the Majority Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the principle of uniformity is not to be maintained, perhaps some better provisions than those contained here may be thought up.  I think it was this principle of uniformity that restored order to our drinking habits.  There was no real order until the 1960 Bill was introduced.  The amendment in the names of Deputies Casey and Mullen proposes the hours of 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. during the tourist season and <Col N="981" /> 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. for the rest of the year in the City of Dublin and 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. for the remainder of the country.  I supported Deputy Burke in 1960 in urging that there should be a half-hour differential between city and county on the ground that half an hour was such a short period that there would be no mad rush out of Dublin to the county by people looking for drink.  But if there is a two hour differential at the closing end and a one hour differential at the opening end, we might again see a rush out from Dublin by people wishing to avail themselves of the extended drinking hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael have been consistent in their attitude to the 1960 Bill.  On the Fifth Stage of the 1960 Bill, Deputy Belton said he thought that 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock would be better than 5 o'clock to 9 o'clock.  Deputy Lindsay said he thought 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. or 7.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. would be better.  Deputy Sherwin said he thought that 10 o'clock was apparently the best closing hour during the summer months.</P>
      <P>I can see Deputy O'Higgins's point in his proposal about the Sunday opening hour.  What inspired the 4 o'clock proposal is very clear.  I go with my family for my summer holidays to Skerries.  The publicans in Skerries take the view that their profit is made on Sundays in particular. They find that after a fine morning and a damp afternoon, rather than staying out in inclement weather, people want to go into a public house at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock.  Before the 1960 Act, they were open continuously all day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objection to Deputy Mullen's amendment is that the differential is too great.  It is getting away from the principle of uniformity.  If we are to maintain the principle of uniformity, which, to my mind, the ecclesiastics of all denominations want, a provision such as this Bill is the only one we can bring in.  There is nothing in this Bill which says that the public houses <Col N="982" /> in Dublin must open.  There is nothing to prevent them from staying closed, if it suits them.  There is nothing to prevent the trade unions telling their members not to work between 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock.  I understand that when a man works for four hours, he is entitled to a break of an hour.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has had time for a cup of tea for the past two weeks.  I know of a trade union house which is owned by two brothers.  Their attitude is that they will work on alternate Sundays and that they will not bring in the staff until 6 p.m.  They maintain there is not sufficient trade to warrant bringing in and paying the staff until 6 p.m.  One of the brothers told me that if he could get agreement with all the publicans in the area that they would all stay closed, it would be much better.  If the associations which are making representations to us are as strong as they say they are, there should be no trouble in enforcing such an agreement.  Unfortunately I am afraid no association speaks for all the publicans, or even for a large majority of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The publican I have in mind believes that even if such an agreement were arrived at between the publicans, many of them would keep their front doors closed and their back doors open.  That would mean that eventually all would open because if one man broke the agreement, he would be drawing customers away from the man who kept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Either we maintain uniformity or we do not.  If we maintain it, we cannot satisfy the people about whom Deputy O'Higgins is concerned in amendment No. 20.  We cannot cater for the <Col N="983" /> holiday resorts and for the various Dublin people who go to those holiday resorts with their families in the summer.  By the time the children are put to bed, and so on, it will be 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. before they can get a drink if they want one.  Furthermore if the weather becomes inclement, on Sunday afternoons in particular, they will be inclined to go for alcoholic refreshment and bring the children into a public house&mdash;which they are not supposed to do.  The children can look at television, eat a bag of crisps, and drink a bottle of lemonade.  We have all seen that happen at the various tourist resorts&mdash;&mdash;or I had better call them holiday resorts because when we speak of &ldquo;tourists&rdquo; here now, apparently it is misinterpreted to mean only overseas tourists, not tourists who go from Dublin to Bray but tourists who come from America and go to Killarney.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown some ingenuity in this subsection because if we are to maintain uniformity, I cannot see any alternative to satisfying the majority.  If the public houses in the holiday resorts are kept closed during the summer months, hardship will be caused to the publicans in those areas. Whether the way Fine Gael think it should be approached is the right or the best way, I am not prepared to judge, but I believe it is the wish of all the ecclesiastical authorities that the principle of uniformity should be maintained.</P>

      <P>If one were to take this debate seriously, apart from what has been said by Deputy Lemass, it would be difficult to understand whether we were legislating for republicans or publicans, or for some imaginary people who do not exist on this earth at all.  Anyone with any commonsense knows that the public and the publicans must concede that no hours can arranged which will suit everyone.  They never have been and they never will be, but I think we should strike a good average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to commend the Minister on being both liberal and reasonable in his approach to the hours in the Bill. <Col N="984" /> Let us go back to pre-1960 when there were no hours and when people came and went whensoever they wished without, so far as I am aware, any restriction.</P>

The people who are now allegedly so solicitous for the welfare of the people should have second thoughts because, as I said earlier today, the people who have pontificated most strongly on this matter and given the most advice do not drink and do not know what they are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been reasonable in his approach to the hours.  I want to make a suggestion to him in regard to the people who want restricted hours.  As long as I remember, people have been able to go into the courts and get longer hours and exemptions.  Why should the Minister not pass a Bill making a provision for people who do not want longer hours which would enable them to go into court and get shorter hours?  We would then see how many would go to look for it and we would see how genuine all the talk is.  No one would go in and well we know it. I expect there is nothing to prevent the Minister from providing such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has yet categorically stated that he is going to stick to uniformity of hours.  Of course, if he deviates in any way from <Col N="985" /> uniformity of hours as regards city and country, most of the problems will be solved, but on the other hand, if he deviates, it will create a position in which at night-time there will again be a rush from the city to the country. That should certainly be allowed for a very restricted period only.</P>
    <P>We must consider the seaside resorts.  There is no use in anyone coming in here and trying to give the impression that the people who go to the seaside are people who have returned from America, Europe or somewhere else.  They are not.  The vast majority of those who go to ordinary holiday resorts are our own people who are now much better off than they were a few years ago and can afford to amuse themselves.  It is well that day has arrived.  When they go to the seaside, they expect to be able to get refreshments at reasonable hours.  Some people who come here and condemn the Minister for giving the hours would be the first to condemn him also for not providing such hours if they found themselves at the seaside perhaps on a wet day.  There is no obligation on anybody to open.</P>
    <P>The trade unionists come in here and talk glibly about the position of the workers, but they should not forget that it is not very long since they were complaining about the big number of unemployed.  If the hours are to be extended, would the trade unions not consider this a very good way of providing further employment for those they allege are unemployed?  I can see no harm in the extension of hours.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned in my part of the country, I am more interested in the number of days than the number of hours.  In the West of Ireland, most of the publicans have a six-day licence. As I did previously, I now ask the Minister to consider very carefully this aspect of the licensed business in the West of Ireland.  No matter what hours the Minister introduces, some people cannot avail themselves of them on account of the six-day licence.  I am not grumbling about that, but there are in the West of Ireland many who at this stage, because of family, financial or other reasons do not wish immediately <Col N="986" /> to change their six-day to a seven-day licence.  I ask the Minister to be broadminded enough, in view of his liberal tendency, to give a further limited extension of the time during which they may change the six-day to seven-day licences.  I leave the time limit to himself.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of the new hours, no matter what has been said on this point to the Minister he must realise that if he leaves the opportunity open for some further period, it will be a big benefit to the seven-day licensed premises also because competition will not be so keen.  If the present limit is enforced, these people will have to beg, borrow or steal the money to change their licences.  I ask him not to allow that to happen and to give these people a further reasonable extension.</P>

      <P>I must first congratulate the Minister on his approach to this Bill generally and his very wise approach to the Sunday opening hours, in particular.  I realise that he was faced with a very complex problem as conditions throughout the country are not uniform.  What will suit the city of Dublin may not suit the small town in the country and what will suit the small town may not suit the village and what would suit the village may not suit the public house at the crossroads.  I come from a rural constituency which has not many large towns but borders a little on the second city in the State and also caters in one small corner for a number of tourists.</P>
      <P>We must be very broadminded if we want to be fair.  Listening to some of the speakers here during the debate, one would think that Ireland was confined to Dublin city.  We from the country are proud of Dublin as the capital of the Republic, but we ask the Dublin people to realise that they would have no Dublin and no capital, were it not for the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>Yes, Cork did its share definitely.  It was always in the <Col N="987" /> forefront of every movement for the advancement of the nation.  Nobody could deny that.  Somebody said there was no public demand for this.  Do we not represent the public?  Is public demand the demand made by some pressure group that springs up occasionally, people who go in for big scale propaganda, use all and every means to gain their ends by various systems of pressure?</P>
      <P>The Minister has been very fair.  In the rural areas which are my first concern, although I must have regard to the other areas also, there was great complaint with regard to the opening hours on Sunday under the 1960 Act. The extraordinary thing is that now you will find some who tell you how fine those hours were because somebody gave them a rub of the political brush.  Let us have commonsense.  We are here to legislate in the best interests of the people.  To my mind, the hours arranged by the Minister are as good as any human being could devise.  There is no compulsion on anybody to open his licensed premises during those hours, but if the amendment is accepted, there is compulsion to close which would be a great hardship, particularly on the rural community.</P>
      <P>If we give special concessions to any city, what will happen?  Where shall we draw the line?  There are some bounds to every city or town and you will have a public house open on one side of the street from 4 o'clock to 10 o'clock and the public house on the opposite side closed for a few hours which means a general upset as regards the convenience of the public. If there were a differential for Dublin, Cork, or the other cities, everybody who could afford it would go out to the areas where there was no restriction on the sale of drink and the people who now think they will lose under the Minister's arrangement would lose far more if their customers left them and went out eight, ten or 12 miles, as the case might be.  They would lose their customers because they would go out into the country and would be sure to stay there for the evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent publicans, <Col N="988" /> who are fairly well organised in Dublin, from coming together and making their own arrangements, but what about the unorganised publicans, those out on the cross-roads, those under the shadow of a mountain, those under the McGillicuddy Reeks, where the rural people toil hard all the week and whose one and only chance of getting a drink is on Sunday?  They are not as a rule given to heavy drinking. There might be a local hurling or football match, or a score of bowls, or, in fine weather, an athletics meeting, or a draghunt.  Would the people attending these functions not need some refreshment?</P>
    <P>I should like the urban people to have some realisation of what the rural people have to contend with and try to facilitate them, give them a chance; if they want a drink after their hard week, give them a chance to have it.  What is the position in the ordinary creamery district, the dairying district, in particular, where the cows are milked early in the morning, where the staff may attend a local function and have to come back to milk the cows in the evening?  They have not a chance of a drink either before or after milking the cows.  Are they not equally as entitled to a chance to have some refreshment as the richest or the poorest person in Cork, Dublin or any other city?  That is an aspect that must be considered.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why I compliment the Minister.  I compliment him on his foresight, judgment and broadmindedness and I would say, regardless of what has been said to the contrary, that you could not have a better Bill under all the circumstances. I would suggest to the Minister that he should adhere firmly to it and I would ask the others to have a bit of common sense and broadmindedness and help the people who will be denied their drink, if the amendment goes through.</P>

      <P>I find myself at a disadvantage in trying to correlate amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 20. I am mainly interested in amendment No. 7, not because it is my amendment, but because it is the amendment of a colleague of mine who is unable to be here, owing to illness.  In trying to put <Col N="989" /> forward my views, I think I will be able to interpret his views also.  I refer to Deputy Seán Dunne.  His problem is something similar to mine.  It relates to the question of uniformity.</P>
      <P>I am here by the votes of the people of the city and of the county of Waterford. I am here to try to interpret and to put before this House the views of my constituents so that the Minister, in his wisdom, can administer the law to suit them, if he thinks fit.  How am I to make two parts of myself?  In Waterford city, the organised publicans through their organisation and the people who work in public houses, through their labour unions, are satisfied and keen that the hours should remain as they are.  Failing that, they wrote to me to make the best case I can of it by having the hours reduced to as narrow a period as possible.  On the other hand, the people of Tramore, Dungarvan, Ardmore, and the rest of the constituency, say to me that they welcome the Minister's increase of hours, as I do myself, being from the urban area of Dungarvan, or being a consumer in that area.  They welcome the Minister's hours and all they regret is that he has not gone further in regard to the hours of Sunday opening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult for me to make a case and yet hold with the Minister on uniformity, but should the Minister agree to depart from the principle of uniformity, then it would be easy to suit all the people.  The duty of the Government here, or of any Government, is to meet the wishes of the people.  The Minister might quite rightly say to me, and has said to me on the occasion of a deputation: &ldquo;What about the consumer's point of view?  How did I get that?&rdquo;  I have a suggestion to make to the Minister. Would he not agree that the county boroughs should get a fixed hour, as the proposers of the various amendments apparently favour, a different hour from that fixed for the rest of the country, and would he not let each corporation elect to adopt that hour or not?  You would then get the views of the representatives of the county boroughs.  Let Waterford or Limerick opt to go in with Dublin or Cork.  That is an unusual suggestion. <Col N="990" /> It would be a unique way of dealing with it but it may be worthwhile to try it because the people of Waterford county borough do not really want the &ldquo;holy hour,&rdquo; as somebody called it, disrespectfully, I am afraid.  If they do not want a 2.30&mdash;3.30 closing hour, say, on weekdays, if they want shorter hours on Sundays, and if we in the county Waterford, because of the fact that we live mainly on the tourist trade during the tourist season, want extended hours from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. for the county borough, we should be able to opt for that.  The only people who can speak on behalf of the county borough are the people elected for the city of Waterford, or the corporation.</P>
    <P>That is only a suggestion.  My colleague, Deputy Mullen, asked why did the Minister make the Sunday second opening hour 4 p.m.; why did he not leave it at 5 p.m. as at present in Dublin?  I want to suggest to the Minister that there is very good reason why he should change it to 4 p.m.  In local small rural areas, there are mystery trains sent in by CIE, which usually arrive about 3.30, and bring 500 people into the little town of Dungarvan that has a population of 5,000.  Should it rain&mdash;and it does sometimes rain in Ireland&mdash;where will these people go unless the public houses are open?  There are not even toilet facilities available for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very wise in opening at 4 p.m.  I regret he has not made it 3 p.m. but I realise there must be a break.  A break is good between 2 or 3 or 3.30 p.m. but the Minister has made it 4 p.m. and I think he had done a very good job.  Because of the fact that he is trying to get uniformity, he has to make it 4 p.m. because the public houses must be open in Dublin at 4 p.m. to cater for people attending Dalymount Park, Croke Park and the other sports functions and 10 o'clock on Sunday is quite reasonable for rural people.  They are working with cattle and doing various other jobs and do not finish until half-past seven or eight o'clock.  They are entitled to go into the local public house which is nothing more or worse than the local club of the urban man.  They go there to talk <Col N="991" /> about the events of the week and to have a drink or two.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that longer opening hours means more drinking.  Unless people are different from the type of people I know, the amount of drink they consume is limited by the amount of money they have in their pockets. I do not know any publicans who are giving it out free.  The type of man who has money and who has the will to drink will find a way to drink.  He can book into a hotel.  He does not have to sleep in the bed he orders but he can drink all day and all night.  I am talking about the ordinary man.  The ordinary man needs certain hours.  The Minister has done an excellent job and if I appear to be pressing him, I am only doing so for two reasons.  My constituents in Waterford city want one thing and I would like to give them what they want as far as possible. I also want to give the county what they want.  I believe that if it were a choice between the city and the country, I would vote for the Bill as it is, if the Minister cannot see his way to amend it.  However, he should consider this matter of uniformity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass spoke about some representative of the pioneers at some commission and about the dreadful effects of the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  What particular qualifications had that representative other than I?  Was it that he was a pioneer or that he was their representative?  I do not know that anybody has any special qualification because he is a pioneer or their representative.  I suggest he was just a man who had a view and I do not accept the arguments about the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  In fact since the Act was passed in 1960&mdash;and I think the Minister has admitted this&mdash;there has been an increasing death toll on the roads. The fact is that there are more cars on the road and the <i>bona fide</i> trade had nothing to do with the numbers killed.  People can go to dancehalls and drink.  There is a lot of nonsense talked about the drunken driver.  The careless driver and the young driver have more on their conscience than the drunken driver.  If I know the drunken driver, he usually knows he is drunk <Col N="992" /> and he will drive slowly and carefully because he knows there are uniformed people looking at him.  There is the exception, the man who will get into a car and who is so drunk that he is a danger to everybody.  It is only right that he should be put off the road. However all the accidents which occur cannot be attributed to drunken driving. How many people, drunk and sober, have been convicted of killing people?  I think you will find the balance is against the sober man.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister, who is a very reasonable Minister, that he should examine the feasibility of some differential between the county boroughs and the rest of Ireland and then allow the county boroughs to opt in or out as they wish.</P>

      <P>I have yet to be convinced that the Minister is a reasonable man, but, like Deputy Kyne, I have been sent here to reflect the views of my constituents.  I have no objection to make to the public houses in the rural districts of the County of Waterford being opened from four o'clock in the afternoon until 10 o'clock because the people in these areas want it and the publicans want it.  That is what I would be guided by.  I protested a few times in the House that some Deputies are brushed aside, in fact even the Minister did it in his reply last night, as if they had not the right to their opinion and as if they were not worthy of being listened to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, just as he shot the publicans down the last time.  The people in the rural areas are being talked about here as if they were all in isolation like Robinson Crusoe, that <Col N="993" /> when they finish their work on a Sunday evening, they are only able to stagger out to the local public house, that they have no ambition to go anywhere else.  Thank goodness, I see young farmers and young farm labourers going further afield.  They have the transport to do it.  They will go to the local seaside place, or to the dancehall, or into the towns.  I have heard country publicans making the complaint that their customers have too much transport and are going away into the towns.</P>
      <P>As I say, I have yet to be convinced the Minister is a reasonable man.  I have seen the Minister's colleagues trample on the opinions of the people of my constituency, the constituency of Waterford, on many occasions in this House.  I had expected that this Minister would listen to a representative body of men such as the licensed trade in Waterford when they signed the petition which I, accompanied by my colleagues, Deputy Kyne and Deputy Ormonde, handed to him.  Last night, he brushed us out of the position we were in in regard to the midday closing hour.  I would hope the Minister would indicate that, as he considered an amendment from his colleagues here in Dublin regarding the midday closing hour, he will indicate to me that he will re-enact this closing time as far as Waterford is concerned when we would come to the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 says:</P>
      <P>(i)  if the premises are situate outside the county borough of Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford, four o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of ten o'clock in the evening,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hours that would suit Waterford city on a Sunday night are from 7 until 10 o'clock.  Some of them would like from 7 until 9 o'clock but we would settle for 7 until 10 o'clock. There are some big holiday resorts in Waterford to which a great number of our own people go, usually on Sundays.  A great number of farmers, farmers' sons and daughters and farm labourers make for the coast.  If they have not got the transport themselves, people are generous enough to give <Col N="994" /> them a lift.  A large measure of agreement has been reached in the speeches from all sides of the House and most people seem to think that 10 o'clock at night is late enough.  I suggest to the Minister that he should throw the idea of uniformity overboard and that amendment No. 20 is well worthy of consideration.  That is the amendment which deals with the holiday and tourist resorts and deals with inland towns which ordinarily would not be considered as holiday or tourist resorts, but which have special occasions, towns like Thurles that bring 50,000 or 60,000 people for a Munster final.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister will be reasonable about such occasions and that he will allow these amendments to stand.  When people go out for a holiday or for an evening, 10 o'clock at night is very early to have to stop if you meet your friends and are in a public house or hotel in a seaside place.  To have the whole place shut down at 10 o'clock is not good enough for the tourist trade and is not good enough for our own people who are entitled to a long evening's enjoyment.  The most of them are over 21 and the idea of having to be in at 10 o'clock should not be revived for them.</P>
    <P>Some speakers mentioned that where there is a differential in the hours, there might be a rush from one place to the other.  That is all nonsense. The people will be in seaside resorts and holiday places and they might have the facility of the extra hours during the season.  Deputies speak with holy horror about the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  They speak of it as if it were a dreadful thing and as if to have it stamped out under the 1960 Act was a wonderful thing.  I never saw anything wrong in it.  When there were trams in Dublin, there was great enjoyment in getting on a tram and going a few miles out to where you could get an extra drink.  Decent publicans had put up decent houses in these places.</P>

      <P>I was just commenting on what several people had said but I am grateful to you for bringing me back to the amendments.  The line that sticks in my mind and that, I suppose, will be found on my heart when I die is the line that includes my own constituency of Waterford.  I return again to it and I am still hoping that the Minister will give me an indication that he is prepared to meet the Waterford licensed trade and the Waterford people in this matter.  If he did that, he would save himself, and me, and the House a lot of trouble. It was a very responsible move for a body of men who are in a competitive trade to come together.  It is hard to get them together but they did come together, and more than 80 per cent. of the publicans of Waterford signed a petition to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that this is good enough for Dublin and Cork but not good enough for Waterford.  The Minister said that he would have to listen to the views of the persons concerned and that there were a great number of people who wanted the retention of the midday closing in Dublin.  The Minister pushed Waterford out of this altogether.  I am endeavouring to point out to him that he should not do with amendment No. 7 what he did with the amendment last night.  What he did last night means that Dublin and Cork stand in the Bill but that Limerick and Waterford are chopped off.  I am not concerned with Dublin, Cork or Limerick but only with Waterford and I am asking the Minister not to do what he did last night. The same thing applies in this amendment as applied in last night's amendment and the Minister has another petition about this one from the licensed trade in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told Deputy Belton today regarding amendment No. 4 that he would consider it.  He said that the reason he would have to consider it was that there was a large section of the Dublin publicans who wanted it. There was also a large section in the centre of the city who did not want it.  This was a case where you had division of opinion and the Minister said that he would leave it the way <Col N="996" /> it was.  I have yet to be convinced that the Minister is a reasonable man.</P>
    <P>When the Minister looks at Waterford, he will have to realise that it is not the same thing as looking at Dublin.  In Dublin, forces are, shall we say, divided.  In the licensed trade in Waterford, over 80 per cent. want this hour.  A small number do not care one way or the other.  But the Minister was not prepared to consider this 80 per cent. at all; he would not look in our direction at all.  I suggest to him that it is quite reasonable for him to look in our direction, remembering that such an enormous majority are in favour of this hour.  I suggest to him also that he should be as consistent in his treatment of Waterford as he is in his treatment of Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney said that a great many people thought we were only legislating here for Dublin and he wanted the Minister to legislate for Cork.  I come along now and I suggest that he should legislate for the third county borough, Waterford.  It is interesting to note that Waterford is not just the third county borough when it comes to the spending power of the population.  The Taoiseach informed me last week that the largest retail sales per head of the population take place in Dublin city and county.  Then, over the whole of the remainder of the country, Waterford is next.  Surely people of such great potential are entitled to be listened to and considered?</P>
    <P>I am glad that my colleague, Deputy Kyne, addressed the Minister in similar terms.  I said last night that, if I could be convinced that the Minister would give way and accept this amendment, I would be satisfied; in other words, declare Cork, Limerick and Waterford were in.  I do not know what more convincing the Minister can want than to be told what the situation really is by two Deputies of this House.  Indeed, I am sure that, if the Deputy representing the constituency in his own Party is asked, he will agree with what I am saying now and with what Deputy Kyne said earlier in relation to these amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 deals with <Col N="997" /> expected incursions of large numbers of people into licensing areas for a special event.  In the city of Waterford every year there is a very special event indeed and, from that point of view, I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting amendment No. 20.  I refer to the festival which lasts for over three weeks.  Enormous crowds come in from all parts of Ireland, from South Wales and from the English Midlands. They fill the city for three solid weeks. As far as attendance is concerned, this is the greatest festival in the country. It may not cost as much as other festivals, the outlay may not be as big, but it certainly brings in the tourists. The Minister must consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>I mentioned people visiting holiday resorts in my constituency and in other constituencies.  I want to refer now to an aspect of this matter to which the Minister should give consideration. Many of the people who own public houses in holiday resorts would not sell a dozen drinks in the week during the winter months.  The great majority do all their business in the summer season.  That is one reason why the Minister will have to give up this idea of uniformity.  For the sake of the tourist resorts, rigid uniformity must go.  The people who own these public houses have their livelihoods to earn. Standards are rising and the majority of these people, to give them their due, have advanced with the times. They should be given the opportunity of having extended hours of business during the months of June, July, August and September.  In my constituency, we have many tourist resorts and holiday centres.  There is Tramore, a famous and splendid seaside resort. We have Dunmore; we have Dungarvan; we have Clonea; and we have Ardmore.  All these places are very busy during the season.  They do very little business in the winter months. Their only chance is to make hay while the sun shines, if the sun shines at all, or irrespective of whether or not it does shine.  The Minister will have to accept this amendment in the name of Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>We are considering a number of amendments together.  I have been told by the Chair&mdash;I know it is a rule <Col N="998" /> of the House&mdash;that Deputies should avoid repetition.  I would beg the indulgence of the Chair now to permit me to repeat myself and ask the Minister would he give an indication of a change of mind with regard to the hour in Waterford County Borough? I and the people of Waterford will be very grateful to him if he meets us in this.  I had an idea last night that the Minister was, as the saying goes, coming my way.  However, he did not come.  Had I realised that he did not intend to come my way, I would not have allowed the debate to close so early.  He met his colleagues today in an almost identical matter relating to Dublin.  I appeal to him again to accord the same consideration to Waterford.  There is no reason; there is no demand; I do not know who would want the Minister to do what he intends doing in this Act.</P>
    <P>I have not very much to say about whether or not the restaurant people would have an advantage.  I will give the Minister this credit.  I was glad he took out Section 15&mdash;and so was the whole House.  I thought he was giving us a kind of an earnest that he would be more flexible.</P>

      <P>I have been approached in regard to this matter by both the trade union representing the men and by the trade in the city of Dublin.  There is one point I want to make very definite here.  Take a public house that would close in the city at 2 p.m.  If a barman lives out in any of the suburban areas he will hardly have time just to get out and to get back again at 4 p.m., if he is going to go home for his mid-day meal.</P>
      <P>I have also been approached by sports clubs run by the barmens' trade union.  They have stated that it definitely will cut across their activities. They play games in the morning. Nevertheless, 12.30 p.m. is not very long in coming along.  The barmen are in the difficulty that if they have to return to work at 4 p.m. it will be very hard on them.  Furthermore, it is stated that it will cut across family life as far as both the workers and the owners of public houses in the city are concerned.  They do not want the 4 p.m. opening in the city.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister.  I look upon him as one of the most democratic Ministers we have had for years.  He has tried to meet the wishes of every section of our people.  He has listened to every Deputy and has tried to be as reasonable as he can.  I suppose no man has met as many deputations as the Minister has met during the Second Reading of this Bill and when the Bill was published and since the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The one point we are all hinging on here is uniformity.  May I suggest to the House that we have not uniformity as it is?  We have the mid-day break in the city.  One has only just to go outside the city boundary and he can drink during that mid-day break.  I am sick of listening to all the hypocrisy over the years about the <i>bona fide</i> trade being responsible for all the ills in the County of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that the <i>bona fide</i> trade was not responsible.  As Deputy Kyne rightly stated here, there have been more fatal <Col N="1000" /> accidents due to hesitant and bad sober drivers than to drunken drivers. A man may be very anxious for a drink but he should be able to conduct himself without having to be put out of a public house.  That brings me back to a point that I made here earlier.  I do not like these regulations where there is a yardstick so that a man must do this, that or the other.  I should like to approach the matter from the national point of view that our people have grown up, that they can be trusted to do certain things, that we are citizens and that we have not to have a yardstick to measure what we should or should not do.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to meet every section of the people in this Bill with the 4 to 10 p.m. opening&mdash;which my constituents in County Dublin want. Now, the city of Dublin, a good part of which I also have the honour to represent, has another problem.  What this House is faced with is the fact that while there are very strong pressure groups outside, representing different sections, urging that we should have uniformity our job is not to accept a push from any pressure group outside but to do what we think is fair.  We are sent here by the people to stand on our own feet and to express our views as honestly and as conscientiously as we can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not wish to press the Minister too hard on this matter but I just want to point out to him that a big section of our people in the city of Dublin&mdash;that is, employers and employees in the trade&mdash;have come to me individually and have asked me if I could say that they would be satisfied with 5 to 9 p.m.  Deputy Sherwin <Col N="1001" /> made a suggestion here today about 5.30 to 10 p.m.  Some people even went as far as to say that a 6 p.m. opening was early enough for them in the city.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that 4 o'clock seems to be very unpopular in the city of Dublin.  I am speaking for the city of Dublin, on one hand and, on the other hand, I am all out for the concession the Minister has given the seaside resorts in County Dublin and the rural part of County Dublin of 4 to 10 p.m., which the people there want very badly.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not like to give the differential at the end of the evening, surely he could leave the differential at the beginning, at the opening?</P>

      <P>The pollution of rivers is one of the biggest problems the boards of conservators have and while Bord na Móna are blamed as being one of the greatest offenders in this regard, they at least are attempting to undo whatever damage they are causing because they have contributed a considerable sum of money towards the solution of the problem caused by bog silt and they will, I am sure, do anything which is suggested to remedy the situation.  However, we have other people causing pollution of the rivers and streams who apparently are not prepared to take any part in preventing the <Col N="1002" /> pollution.  As a matter of fact, many of them will blatantly deny they are polluting the rivers in any way and even when it is pointed out to them, and when they are asked for their co-operation and when they have, in fact, promised co-operation, it very often turns out that a few days later the same type of material is poured into the river, with consequent danger not alone to fish life but to the nets of the fishermen fishing the stream.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of those concerns have had the fact pointed out to them that they are polluting the rivers and yet they continue to pollute them.  I am afraid on that score I must administer a rap over the knuckles to the Fisheries Division which the Parliamentary Secretary represents because when a board of conservators takes an analysis of the water and sends it to the Department, two things happen: one is that the result of the analysis is usually not returned for many months and the other is that, when the result is returned, it is difficult to know how the Division expects ordinary people to be able to interpret the report.  I mentioned earlier that the board of which I am a member had to hire a private person to carry out an analysis of the water.  The result was that, without any difficulty, we were able to establish that certain firms were polluting the rivers.  Another trouble is that even though the water seems to be polluted by a particular firm, there is what the Fisheries Division refers to as a build-up which occurs when four, five or six firms around an industrial town are pouring even a small amount of material or liquid into the river and the combined effect causes death to fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pretty difficult problem to solve.  I should be very grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary if he would indicate whether or not he intends to try to deal with that problem in the new Bill which he is to bring before the House.  It is one of the most important problems we have to deal with. From time to time there have been <Col N="1003" /> complaints about creameries.  Surely in an agricultural country, where we have so many creameries, there should be some solution to the problem of the water used to rinse the cans going into the rivers?  Surely it should be possible for somebody to find a way of preventing this from killing fish?</P>
    <P>There is another serious matter and I am afraid successive Governments and local authorities do not seem to be very interested in remedying it.  It is the question of town sewage.  We have, all over the country, towns which have no sewage disposal system except to pump it into the rivers.  I can only raise the matter on this Estimate because of the effect it has on fish life. The effect it has is bad.  The effect it has on human life when unfortunate people go swimming in the river is too horrifying even to discuss.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use his power to solve this problem and, when this new Bill is introduced, ensure that some effort will be made to force towns, which show so little regard for public health that they pump untreated sewage into rivers, to do something about the problem.</P>
    <P>The question of the length of the season for fishing has been discussed and I was intrigued to hear one Government Deputy suggest that it might be a good idea to close down salmon fishing altogether for a couple of years as a solution towards the problem of what he called the shortage of fish.  Either he must not have been very serious about it or he must not be aware that there are people who earn their living on the inland fisheries and people who earn their living by catching and selling salmon.  I am not referring to the people who use the rod and line, the angler who usually is somebody on holidays or doing it for sport.  I am referring to the people who use nets and boats usually at the estuary of the river or on the tidal portion of the river and who depend entirely for their livelihood on the amount of fish they catch.  It would be most unreasonable to suggest that that type of fishing should be closed down.  As a matter of fact, there is a strong case for lengthening this season in respect of some of these people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> I have in mind my own constituency in particular and the fishing at the mouth of the Boyne.  The fishing there, like everywhere else, must close for the weekend period.  That has been the practice for a long time and it is still the practice.  I assume it is for the purpose of allowing a number of fish to go through unimpeded.  The closing of the salmon fishing over the weekends reduces the season which, in theory, lasts from 14th of February until 14th of August but which, in fact, lasts a very much shorter period because you must take the two weekend days, or the 48 hour period each weekend, out of that.  That seriously interferes with the length of time these people are allowed fish.</P>
    <P>In Mornington village, there are about 40 families who earn their livelihood from fishing.  They are the most independent people I have met in this country.  They never ask anything of anybody.  They fish for salmon and, when the season finishes, they pick mussels and then, when the season reopens, they fish for salmon again. They do not make a very good livelihood but they do live without any assistance from the State.  A few years ago, there was a catastrophe when the mussels were practically all swept away and the Fishery Division came to the people's aid and gave them fairly substantial grants.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary should now consider the whole question of extending the salmon fishing season for net fishermen and, when doing so, take into account that those men depend entirely on what they catch.</P>
    <P>Reverting to mussels, because sewage is pumped into the Boyne the mussels caught there are supposed to be unsafe for human consumption without being processed in the proper manner.  However, practically everybody there takes mussels and eats them in their raw state and it does not seem to kill anybody.  Possibly the people there are immune from whatever effects these mussels would otherwise have.  When processed, the mussels can be sold at pretty high prices.</P>
    <P>Something extraordinary happens in this respect, because certain firms have <Col N="1005" /> been buying them for sale either as bait or for processing at very low prices&mdash;anything from 8s. to 12s. per cwt.  I do not know what these firms realise on the mussels they sell for bait, but I know that in any English city you can buy the processed mussels from Mornington in jars at anything from 3s. per dozen mussels.  It does not make sense that the people of Mornington, who have gone to all the trouble of picking and bagging the mussels and of having them marketed, should have to sell them at a fraction of a penny per dozen.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, there was great agitation, in which my predecessor and later myself were involved, with the Department in an attempt to have a purification tank for mussels put up in that area, and while at one time hope was held out, it came to pass eventually that it was knocked on the head and the purification tank was never put up.  Since that time, a number of local people have got together and quite recently they attempted to have a small industry established for the processing of mussels. Two of them started in a small way, but then, because of lack of capital and other factors, they were unable to continue.</P>
    <P>I understand the Parliamentary Secretary recently received a deputation introduced by somebody who did not know the first thing about it but who apparently wished to make an impression. The Parliamentary Secretary, obviously knowing the facts were not being presented to him in a sensible way, did not give much heed to the deputation, the members of which went away very dissatisfied.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary, being a reasonable man, and who, unlike other Parliamentary Secretaries, paid visits to Drogheda and attended meetings of the Fishery Board to hear their arguments, will be prepared to receive a responsible deputation from Mornington who will put to him the facts of the mussel industry.  Having heard them, he will, I believe, give every assistance possible to ensure that these people get the price to which they are entitled for their mussels.  I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1006" /> would indicate, either in reply to this Estimate or to me personally, whether he is prepared to agree to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of salmon fishing, I should like to emphasise that the levy still being collected is something of a burden and should be wiped out because people are getting it hard enough to live on salmon fishing without having to pay a levy.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to get his Department to forget about the levy.  The man who gets only one fish in a week looks very sadly at this levy.  There is no doubt that salmon fishing on practically every river, but particularly the Boyne, has been affected very much by foreign trawlers.  In this connection we had a statement made by a Deputy when we last discussed this Estimate which was absolutely ridiculous.  It was too ridiculous to bother about really, if it were not for the fact that it got widespread publicity.</P>
    <P>The statement was made by somebody who should have known the charge he was making was not alone wrong but completely and utterly impossible. Anybody who lives inland might possibly imagine a boat pulling up to a lighthouse, the crew getting on to the lighthouse, leaving bottles of brandy as bribes and getting back into their boat, but anybody who lives near the sea knows that it is impossible.  This was a definite charge made against certain people.  In this evening's <i>Evening Mail</i> the matter received more publicity.  Under the heading &ldquo;Spy-Brandy&mdash;T.D.'s Charge,&rdquo; the newspaper says this Deputy declared that lighthouse keepers accept brandy bribes from masters of foreign trawlers. It also says that the Deputy alleges a letter posted to him from Dáil Éireann had been opened and that it arrived to him five days late.  He also said that he would demand an investigation to find out who had opened the letter.  His charge was that lighthouse keepers were being given bottles of brandy for the purpose of having messages flashed to foreign trawlers in order to assist them in stealing salmon within Irish coastal waters.  Unless he is prepared to have that charge investigated, he <Col N="1007" /> should be asked by the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw it.  A suggestion of that kind should not be allowed to pass by this House.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there are some foreign trawlers coming inshore.  Up to a few years ago they had extreme difficulty in doing this because of the type of net they were then using, but now they can use a nylon net, leave it and come back again and, occasionally, get away with it.  Sometimes it is wrecked by a vessel going in or out.  In connection with this kind of illegal salmon fishing, I should like to point out that a few years ago an official of the Fisheries Division did a very good job in preparing a history of fish life with particular reference to salmon&mdash;their period of spawning, their habits when they went up river and the pattern the salmon took through the sea.</P>
    <P>It was shown very clearly that salmon usually follow a set pattern. It could not be possible that this history would not have fallen into the hands of other people and that, as a result of a very fine piece of work by an official of the Fishery Division, people over the past year or so have found it possible to know where and when the fish are coming in and how to collect them outside our waters.  I am not casting any slur on the official who produced this document but merely saying that someone is always able to turn things like that into good account for himself.  These are the stories we hear about the shortage of salmon in our waters.  We are told the number of salmon is dwindling.  I do not see why not if it is possible to get salmon on their way in to our rivers, if the people who take them do not have to come near our rivers at all.  I know the counterpart in Scotland of the Fisheries Division have taken the necessary steps to prevent that sort of thing happening. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to include in the new legislation measures to ensure it cannot be carried on here.</P>
    <P>I would point out one instance.  On one day, when a foreign trawler had broken down off the Meath-Louth <Col N="1008" /> coast, during those 24 hours the local fishermen caught more salmon than they had in the previous months.  That was surely more than a coincidence.  It was at least evidence to them that the salmon are not allowed come into the river and that the salmon the local fishermen get are the odd ones which slip through.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the corvettes in relation to this matter of fishery protection. I was very interested to hear the Minister for Defence say there is another ten years' left in them.  If they are to be our only defence for the next ten years, then the lighthouse men will get very little brandy.  It will not be necessary to give it to them because by the time the corvette gets there, the foreign trawlers will be able to limp away without having to get any warning.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible even at this stage to consider the purchase of one or two helicopters?  They could be used for many purposes, including sea rescue.  Surely the question of cost, which has been mentioned here, should not prevent the Department in this day and age from purchasing what is an absolute necessity?  Two helicopters would be able to do more than a dozen corvettes.  If that is not possible, would the Department consider buying a number of smaller boats, which could be spread around the coast, and training the sons of fishermen who would be prepared to man them?  If that were done there might be some hope of giving some protection to the fisheries.  But if it cannot be done, then we might as well say here and now that we can offer no protection and that the foreign trawlers can come in here and take any fish they want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred the other day to the question of fishing rights in the country.  It is a fact that fishing rights have been retained by landlords on lands taken from them by the Land Commission.  Subsequently, the Land Commission made a new scheme and held on to the fishing rights when they divided land.  Certain people then got <Col N="1009" /> possession of these rights who were as alien to the local people, though they might be Irish-born, as the people who held them originally.  If somebody gets land they should also get the fishing and game rights attaching to it.  It seems ridiculous that the owners of land have not the right to fish or shoot game on the land.</P>
      <P>The biggest snag is that there are many rivers on which the local people are not allowed to fish.  While the law lays down that the owners of fisheries are entitled to restrict the use of those fisheries to themselves and to those to whom they give permission to fish, at the same time some system should be devised whereby people in the local towns and villages would be able to have a certain amount of fishing. Apart altogether from catching fish, fishing provides relaxation and brings people out into the fresh air.  It is, therefore, something that should be encouraged.  Children particularly should be encouraged to fish and every facility should be given to them.</P>
      <P>Recently some of our canals have been closed and drained of hundreds of fish.  An effort should be made to preserve them in order to provide free fishing for people unable to fish in the other places.  Our small lakes should also, as far as possible, be made available for fishing.  Some of the lakes have coarse fish only and others are so situated that it is almost impossible to gain access to them.  Deserved tribute was paid to the Inland Fisheries Trust here last week but I believe in some cases they are not doing exactly what they set out to do.  I am referring particularly to a lake in Monaghan known locally as the Emmy Lake.  The Inland Fisheries Trust cleaned that lake and put a lot of trout into it, but for the past two years, they have not gone near it.  About a fortnight ago, there was a &ldquo;trial shot&rdquo;, as the local people call it, with the net across the lake and not one trout was taken.  That proves that, because the Trust did not continue the good work they began, the lake is back in the position it was a few years ago and there is nothing in it now except coarse fish.  That should not be allowed to continue and every effort should be made, once a lake is cleared and stocked, to keep it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> The only other matter I would refer to is the question of the fishery protection staff.  I understand the Department have under consideration the whole question of fishery protection. Some time ago they suggested they would like to see an improvement in the protection service.  The Board in Drogheda recently decided the wages they were paying their employees were too low.  They were based on the agricultural wages.  While the agricultural worker is required to work 50 hours a week, it can be shown that the fishery protection staff are required to work up to 12 hours per day or night seven days a week.  It was decided something would have to be done about it.  It was estimated that in order to pay them properly, it would be necessary to give them a wage of something around £10 per week.  Knowing that the amount of money available out of which they were to be paid was pretty small, and not seeking to put a big burden on the Department, they compromised by agreeing to a rate of £7 per week, a rate which, in my opinion, was very low.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was present at the meeting at which this decision was taken, as was one of his officials.  To be fair to the Parliamentary Secretary, he did not take any part in the discussions because, as he said, the matter would subsequently come before him.  We understood that following discussions with the Board which had suggested that fair wage, it would be considered in the same way by the Department, and we were horrified to find that the Department did not sanction that rate but, in fact, reduced it by 10/- per week. There was no justification for that.  I ask the Department not to continue that practice and to see that the fishery protection staff are adequately remunerated.</P>
    <P>The questions of giving them uniforms, protective clothing and proper time off must also be taken into consideration. I know quite well that the Parliamentary Secretary can say it is a matter for the boards of fishery conservators whether or not they get proper time off, days off or weeks off, <Col N="1011" /> or whatever they get.  I do not think that is the way it should be done.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary should see to it that uniforms are supplied, and also that arrangements are made to ensure that those people get what they are entitled to by law. They should not be required to work more than a 48-hour week and if they work more than 48 hours in a week, they should be paid overtime.</P>
    <P>They should be allowed at least one day off per week.  I do not know whether the House is aware that these people are required to work Sunday and Monday, bank holiday and Church holiday and, until very recently, 365 days in the year.  The law does not allow that now, but some boards still continue that practice.  They are entitled to 21 days holiday and they should get those holidays.  The Parliamentary Secretary should issue a regulation to each board of conservators telling them that their employees, under the present law, cannot be made to work seven days of the week.  That is what they are doing at present.</P>
    <P>I shall finish as I started by saying that the Parliamentary Secretary has proved, so far as I know, to be a very reasonable man.  He has made great efforts to try to help fishing in many ways.  Possibly his approach may not be the approach we would all desire, but I know he intends to do the right thing.  I hope he will take the advice I have given him this evening as being intended to help him in his job.</P>

      <P>This is a very important Estimate indeed.  We are an island country, with the sea around our 32 Counties.  In the 26 Counties over which we have jurisdiction, the fishing industry is, in my opinion, second to agriculture.  Yet, when we examine the facts, we find that it is one of the most neglected industries in the entire State.  This year, the Estimate amounts to approximately £380,000 and the total catch of fish last year was worth £1,357,000.</P>

      <P>In other words, last year the worth of the total catch of fish exceeded this year's Estimate by £1,000,000.  We have to spend £380,000 to get a profit of £1,000,000 from fish.  It is a most peculiar thing that out of that £1,357,000 worth of fish, we exported £744,000, but as against that, we imported £600,000 worth last year.  That information has been procured by me in reply to a question.  The actual figure is that £596,536 worth of fish was imported into the State last year.  There is something wrong there when we have to import practically as much fish as we export.  I fear we must lay the blame on Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to prove it.  Up to about 1932, the fishing industry was one of the most prosperous in the country and our biggest catch was herring.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary knows very much about herring, but in winter time we had four or five different types of herring, large full herring, full herring, turnbellies, smalls and spents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell you what sheered off.  We had this very valuable industry and we had fishcurers from all over the British Isles coming here, buying the fish, curing and processing it here, putting it into barrels and exporting it to Hamburg. Irish herring held the Hamburg market when herring from no other country could compete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This prosperous industry continued up to 1934 and in that year the Fianna Fáil Government introduced the Control of Manufactures Act, under which no firm could set up in business here, unless it had 51 per cent.  Irish capital.  All the herring curers, the Jenkins and the Leslies, all the big Scottish and <Col N="1013" /> English curers were driven out by that Act of 1934, with the result that there has been a slump in the herring industry ever since.  I have seen thousands of pounds worth of herring dumped over the pier because there was no buyer for them.</P>
      <P>The Government of the day saw their blunder and instead of issuing licences to those firms to come back here and process the herrings, they set up An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, as it was then known, and put them into the market to purchase and cure herring. This body was staffed by civil servants who knew nothing about the industry.  If the Parliamentary Secretary looks up his files and sees the hundreds of thousands of pounds lost by the Sea Fisheries Association, it will open his eyes.  These people were supposed to buy herring when there was a glut and process them.  How many times have they done it and then dumped them, and not only the cured herring but the salt and the barrels also?  I have seen them lying rotting at the backs of sheds.  They were trying to compete against men who knew the business from A to Z. That is what depressed the herring industry, one of the things that ruined the trade, until the war years.</P>
      <P>For many years, we have been preaching that there is only one method by which we could revive the herring industry, that is, by inviting back the gentlemen with the knowhow and permitting them to operate here.  Competition is good for trade and this would raise the price of fish to fishermen.</P>
      <P>In 1948, when the first inter-Party Government came into power, they issued licences to these English firms to come back and endeavour to revive the herring industry.  They brought back Marinco and various other curers from England and Scotland, with the result that from 1948 on the fishing industry was being restored to the position it held before the Control of Manufactures Act of 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explain the type of fishing we had in this country prior to that Act. I do not want to be controversial but I <Col N="1014" /> think we will all agree, that while there was a big fishing industry in Waterford and Wexford, we had herring off the Donegal coast for practically eight months of the year.  We started in the month of May with matje herring, probably the best fish of the species. We had large full herring, harvest herring, right up to the beginning of October and from early November up to St. Patrick's Day, we had winter herring.</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have cited the various classes of herring caught off our coast, but because of the Control of Manufactures Act, the fishing for matje herring was completely stopped because a different type of net, the large-mesh net was necessary for it. Very few Irish boats were engaged in it.  It was done mostly by Scottish and English steam drifters and they were refused permission to land their catches here.  That finished matje herring fishing and it has never been revived from that day and instead of the selection of herring that I mentioned, no selection was made but the surplus was dumped, whether good or bad, and the industry was completely depressed.</P>
      <P>I have told of our attempts to revive it in 1948.  We found in that year when we came into office that one of our boatyards at Meevagh had just been closed by the Fianna Fáil Minister.  We found the policy of inshore fishing had been completely abandoned and a new policy established by Fianna Fáil.  The Fianna Fáil Minister said: &ldquo;We will engage in deep water fishing.  We will buy deepsea trawlers and three or four of them will supply the country.  That is all that is required.&rdquo;  To implement his policy, he purchased the three famous second-hand German trawlers at a cost of about £160,000 and abandoned inshore fisheries completely.  We pointed out that by doing this, he would ruin the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, when the inter-Party Government came to power, the first thing they did was to reopen Meevagh boatyard and begin a building programme <Col N="1015" /> of seine-net fishing boats, mid-water boats, and they endeavoured to encourage fishermen to go back to their traditional industry.  We had to go further.  If there are lacuna periods in the industry, people are not encouraged to eat fish.  We saw that if there was a stormy week, fortnight or month, the fish merchant could not guarantee continuity of supplies and that it was necessary to build up supplies. To do that, deep freeze was essential.  Deputy Dillon, the Minister of the day, had Bord Iascaigh Mhara erect at Killybegs a pilot deep freeze plant.  If it was a success, then, that would be passed on to any private enterprise that wished to instal deep freeze plants.  The intention was that frigidaire vans should circulate throughout rural Ireland and deliver fresh fish daily or at least twice or three times a week.  Deputy Dillon insisted on the purchase of those frigidaire vans.  The deep freeze plant was erected at Killybegs.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we saw that the cost of transport made fish uneconomic to the housewife.  We saw that if the offal of the fish, the bone, could be used for, say, fishmeal, the fillets only need be transported and the fisherman would still get the same price and the housewife would not pay for the inedible part of the fish.  Therefore, we established at Killybegs a pilot fishmeal plant.  Again, there was a change of Government and not one of those frigidare vans purchased by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara was ever put on the road.  They were allowed to lie in the yard of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara until such time as they had to be sold at approximately 50 per cent, of what they cost.</P>
    <P>That is why year after year Bord Iascaigh Mhara have lost money.  They have no experience whatsoever in the fishing industry.  Their staff had no experience.  They were mere civil servants. They were excellent in their own job&mdash;excellent.  I am not making any charge against them there.  But, they were inexperienced and that is what is wrong with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and it is still going on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> Only two weeks ago, the fishermen of Tory Island caught 12 cran of matje herring.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara bought them sight unseen.  Matje herring are a very fat fish.  They have to be attended to immediately.  They take a very light cure of salt.  Having bought them, they found they had no salt and had to hunt around the entire north-west of Donegal looking for 10 cwt. of salt to salt these 12 cran of matje herring.  By the time they got it, of course, the herring were gone, the weather was so good; you could not possibly cure them.  I should like to know what has happened to them since.  If Bord Iascaigh Mhara were proper business people, surely they would have a supply of salt in anticipation of such a catch?</P>
    <P>I was anxious to see this prosperous fishing, matje herring fishing, revived. I have asked the Minister several times here about the <i>Cú Feasa.</i> In case the House does not know it, Sir, the <i>Cú Feasa</i> is a vessel built, not in this country, but in Holland, on the direction of the Minister, to explore Irish fishing waters.  I have asked him when was this boat going to Donegal to search for matje herring and I got the reply to my question that she had gone on 25th May, when the matje herring season was over.  Where had she gone?&mdash;to Killybegs.</P>
    <P>Any person who knows anything about the herring industry knows that matje herring are caught somewhere in the neighbourhood of 10 to 12 miles off the coast.  They know that it requires a herring net with a 29-row mesh and we know there is no such herring net in this country at the moment.  We are aware that some short time ago the Scotch herring curers association did offer for sale 29-row herring nets.  We are further aware that the Minister's Department was informed and the advertisement was sent to him.  He was advised to purchase these nets and to distribute them to the fishermen in the hope that this prosperous industry might be revived.  They did not purchase them but they sent a boat up to search for the fish in a place where matje herring have never been seen and where no boat could possibly fish them.  They <Col N="1017" /> are difficult to fish.  They are a surface fish.  They live on plankton.  Plankton is got only in certain parts of the sea and where they have been searching for them is a place known to fishermen as the jungle, north-west of the Stags of Broadhill.  That is where they have been searching for them, simply because a few cran were picked up in a seine or drift net and that is where the <i>Cú Feasa</i> has spent her time.  We have never seen her in the traditional herring ground as yet.  Of course, it is now too late.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was in Donegal with his Minister quite recently.  I do not know what he was doing unless visiting Fianna Fáil cumainn.  I thought he would at least have met the fishermen, the people interested in the industry.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will confine his activity to the milch cow and leave the fishing to me, we will get on much better.  In his Estimate this year, the Minister refers to the fish which are most common.  He tells us that one of the fish most commonly landed during the year was whiting.  He says there was little change in landings of demersal or white fish, the most important varieties in order of value being whiting, etc.  At the same time as he tells us that whiting is the most important and valuable class of fish landed, his colleague, the Minister for Defence, is advertising for fish for the diet of the Army but one of the classes of fish struck off the tender was whiting.  Whiting of any description will not be received by the Minister for Defence for the Army. What happens?  The Minister seeks another class of fish which is not procurable and a licence is issued to some person or other to import and sell it to the Army.  Is that the type of co-operation and co-ordination one would expect from a Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> I quote from the Minister's statement as published at column 177, Volume 196 of the Official Report of 13th June of this year:</P>
    <P>There was little change in landing of demersal or white fish, the most important varieties in order of value being whiting...</P>
    <P>The most important being the very fish the Army will not eat.</P>

      <P>As I said before I reported progress, the demand from the people of Ireland, from the seaside resorts and from the Deputies representing these areas was for the hours of 4 to 10 o'clock.  The Minister brought in this amending Bill in order to meet the wishes of the people as a democratic Minister should.  He had already met quite a number of organisations representing the licensed trade.  He listened to their grievances and their suggestions and tried to formulate a Bill which would be acceptable to all sides of the House. In doing that, the Minister took on a very hard task because it is impossible to please every section of our people. However, in his democratic way, he wanted to hear the views of every section as he said on the Second Reading of the Bill.  While representing County Dublin, I also represent a section of the city of Dublin where there are about 15,000 voters.  In that area, the representatives of the licensed trade and the representatives of the union approached me with a view to having this Bill amended.  In 1960, uniformity was the watchword.  I tried to resist it as much as possible.</P>

      <P>It is nice to know that I have a few friends in the Opposition who are anxious to help me with the debate.  In 1960 the cure for all ills was uniformity.  Now one part of my constituency wants 4 o'clock to 10 o'clock and more if they could get it, plus exemptions in seaside resorts.  Then I am told in another part of the constituency that the hours are too long, that 4 o'clock is too early and 10 o'clock is too late. I have great sympathy with the Minister who has to deal with the various demands from the city of Dublin constituency. However, I shall be grateful to the Minister if he will consider the wishes of the majority of the people of the city of Dublin, that is, the barmen's union and the union of the licensed trade.  They feel that 4 o'clock in the afternoon is too early. I would back Deputy Sherwin in his suggestion that the opening be 5 o'clock or 5.30 and leave County Dublin and the rest of Ireland with the 4 to 10 o'clock opening which they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This suggestion of people rushing out of the city to have a drink when the public houses are closed in the city is all eyewash.  I have been living in Dublin 40 years and I have proved that is all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  We were told that every accident that ever happened was caused by fellows rushing out of the city to the <i>bona fide</i> houses.  That is not true because the percentage of people who left Dublin even at the height of the <i>bona fide</i> trade was very small but it was big enough to give a living to people living in the isolated and non-populous areas of County Dublin.  The city of Dublin public <Col N="1022" /> houses do not want to open at 4 o'clock.  It would upset the trade unions; it would upset the young people who play games and, it would upset family life.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister should have another look at it.  I am sorry to be embarrassing one of the most loyal colleagues I have in the House but we are a very democratic Party and we are allowed to express our opinions openly.  However, here we are faced with the position that the traders do not want it and the unions do not want it and for that reason the only thing I can do is to support Deputy Sherwin's amendment.  The Minister has gone a great distance to meet everybody.  I am very grateful to him for what he did when I led a big deputation to him from all over Ireland to ask him to remove Section 15 from the Bill.  There was not a single Fine Gael man in that deputation. They were all Fianna Fáil and I want to pay a tribute to the Minister for his action in that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was circulated by the Minister in the only few days of summer that we have experienced over the past year.  Because of that, I was prepared to excuse it as a bout of summer madness on the part of the Minister and the Government, since, to suggest for one moment that Dáil Éireann should pass a Bill which would have the direct effect of increasing the price of the workingman's drink in Dublin at a time when the price of liquor has increased tremendously over the past few years, is an indication, I think, of a certain amount of mental disorder.</P>
      <P>If we adopt the hours the Minister says we should accept, we will deliberately increase the price of stout, beer, lager, whiskey, gin, and every other drink normally consumed in Dublin public houses.  Fine Gael are not prepared to do that.  If the Government had not begun to tinker with the liquor laws two years ago, and again now, the price of a bottle of stout would be about 3d. cheaper than it is, or than it will be if this Bill goes through.  The price of the pint, by reason of the gyrations of this Fianna Fáil Government, is about 5d. dearer than it need be.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil may say that the effect of increasing the price is to reduce consumption and they are not, therefore, to be condemned.  But consumption trends have been increasing rather than falling and, if that be so, then people are spending a great deal more on drink.  I do not think it is fair that the people of Dublin who, in the main, do not want the hours the Minister is now forcing upon them, just as they did not want the hours forced upon them in 1959, should have to pay these increased prices in order to provide excessive drinking facilities for a limited portion of the year in some parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> I am getting a bit tired of having our habits and our behaviour, in play and in work, dictated by what the foreigner would like to have here while he is boozing for two or three weeks out of the 52.  It is about time we legislated here for our own people and for the manner in which reasonable people behave from one end of the year to the other.  In order to achieve a reasonable arrangement for the Irish people there is certainly no need to compel public houses in seaside resorts to open for the long hours the Minister is making available to them when, for eight months of the year, they have little other company but the spray of the waves.  To base a line of defence on the argument that the hours are not obligatory but simply permissive is to adopt, of course, a very weak line of defence because, so long as one licence holder avails of the hours the law may give him, or her, then all licensed holders must open if they are not to see their trade going to their rivals.  I believe the Minister has made the worst of all possible bad jobs in the proposals he is now asking the House to accept.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why a man of such undoubted experience and charm as Deputy P.J. Burke was not made a Minister of State many years ago.  The great moment of truth arrived tonight when we realised that it is his incapacity to take a decision, or to come down on one side or the other, which rendered him unsuitable for ministerial office.  Decisions have to be taken.  The Minister has taken them and he has, of course, taken the wrong decisions.  The Fine Gael amendments endeavour to achieve a degree of compromise which I believe the Minister should seriously consider. Two years ago, this House indicated support for a degree of uniformity&mdash; certainly for the abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  Deputy P.J. Burke preached for the maintenance of the <i>bona fide</i> trade and did the most effective thing he could to kill it by voting against it.  It does not seem to have affected his capacity to please everybody but at the same time in fact he has pleased nobody.  What we <Col N="1028" /> did very quickly forget is that the <i>bona fide</i> trade, as we knew it, would never have been the prosperous thing it was if it respected the law.  However, its success and prosperity depended entirely upon breaches of the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir; I have not drifted.  If we again adopt an arrangement such as we had before, it can only prove prosperous to any section of the community if the law is broken. The alternative is to have an enforcement of the law which would be almost impracticable and which certainly would be too costly.  An effort has to be made, then, to have a degree of uniformity or opening hours which would not lead to the exodus to which we had become accustomed from large centres of population to public houses on the fringe of cities which had longer hours.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael amendment to this Bill would provide a uniform closing hour between the city and rural public houses on Sundays.  Therefore, I think it is worthy of acceptance because it does to some extent meet the objections which consumers and publicans alike have in Dublin to the proposed hours.  Dublin does not want six hours of continuous drinking from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 10 o'clock at night all the year round on Sundays.  I defy any member of the Fianna Fáil Party, representing a Dublin constituency, to say that he is convinced the people of Dublin want those hours.  I do not believe they do.</P>
      <P>Many of us believe three hours would be sufficient and that the best are from 7 to 10 p.m.  Against that, it was argued in some centres which had sport fixtures and a large number of people congregating for football matches, and so on, that you require facilities from 5 p.m. or thereabouts. Therefore, the Fine Gael amendment is admittedly a compromise.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise of conflicting interests.  If Deputy Burke had been able to achieve the same compromise between those pulling him in different directions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I trust we shall not have a repetition of his performance in 1959 of preaching one thing and doing another thing.  I think it is a pity that the Minister has sought to extend to 11.30 p.m. the summer hours.  At present, since the last Act, the 11.30 p.m. opening operates only during the months from June to September.  If there should be any desire for drinking until 11.30 p.m.  I thought it was to facilitate those people whom we are all supposed to consider, the tourists. There are very few tourists around this country in March, April, May or in October.  Therefore, I think it is unnecessary to extend the drinking hours from 11 p.m. until 11.30 p.m. for the full period of the artificial summer time which we have&mdash;and that is what the Minister is proposing.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister personally is not opposed to late night drinking and I have no doubt the extension may personally facilitate him: that is common knowledge.  I do not think, again, that the ordinary people of Dublin should be compelled to pay increased prices in order to provide a facility which only a small minority demands.  Even at present, with the 11.30 p.m. opening since the beginning of June, it is quite normal thing to see people begin to leave premises shortly after 11 p.m. or even earlier. It is not uncommon to find the houses half empty before 11.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  However, it is undesirable that those who are prepared to keep reasonable hours for drinking should have to pay to keep these premises open.  I am very concerned about the artificial increases in the prices of the workingman's drink in Dublin which this legislation will <Col N="1030" /> cause, just as the last Act caused two years ago.</P>
      <P>I have discussed the position from the consumers' point of view, which is very important and a point of view which the Minister cannot ignore, although his predecessor seemed to think it was unimportant if the price of the workingman's drink in Dublin became excessive.  However, the public houses in Dublin would not be run if there were not available a pool of labour.  That is, fortunately, well organised trade union labour.</P>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his speech on the Second Reading argued that those who are in the publican's business had to accept that they were in the catering business and had to accommodate themselves accordingly to the demands of their consumers.  It is a fair argument, to a degree.  However, if we apply it as the Minister would wish to apply it, we find that in Dublin the consumers do not want the hours which the Minister wants to force upon them.  Yet those who run this catering business are being compelled, because the Minister says they must, to operate hours which their own consumers do not want.  The result is, of course, that the employees of publicans will very rightly demand increased wages and improved conditions. If they are to be asked to work for an extra half hour for a long period of the year, if they are to be asked to work for six hours on Sundays, and thus lose altogether opportunities of being with their families or friends on Sundays, they will demand a considerable improvement in their income and that can only be paid for by the consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see in what way the existing price structure in the Dublin public houses can carry the extra charge which will lie on all public houses because of the hours the Minister is forcing upon the public houses in Dublin.  That being so, there are only three things the publican can do.  He can try to carry on his business with a smaller staff or with non-union staff or he can pass on the price to the consumer.  There have been indications in Dublin in recent years that some publicans at least are anxious to find a way of relieving their labour <Col N="1031" /> costs by changing the nature of the business and by changing their staffs. I think that would be bad.</P>
    <P>If the public house business in Dublin or in any large centre in this country were to fall into the hands of disorganised, competing groups without any standards of employment and of pay, I believe the whole licensed trade would suffer and we would end up in chaos and that it is the consumer in the end who would be at the loss.  That being so, I would ask the Minister seriously to reconsider the imposition of unwanted hours which he has inflicted upon this city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of conducting this debate as some Deputies opposite might wish it to be conducted, in the manner of a barroom. If they wish to interrupt a contribution by a Deputy who is endeavouring to persuade the Minister who stubbornly insists on imposing hours that Dublin does not want, then they will pay the price for it.  The Fine Gael Party made it clear when the last Bill was going through the House and during the general election campaign that they were anxious for a review of the licensing laws in order to provide the facilities which tourist resorts wanted.  The amendment put down in the name of Deputy Michael O'Higgins achieved these things without imposing upon large centres of population which have not the same problem, the hours which the Minister is imposing on them.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael amendments provide that if publicans in any area can establish a reasonable need for special drinking facilities, these facilities can be given for the occasion and at the time a case is made for them.  That surely is what our liquor laws should achieve &mdash;so much and no more.  In order to facilitate a small number of people for a short period of the year, you do not have to discommode the whole community for the remainder of the year. That is what the Minister is doing.  He is discommoding, on the one hand, the employees and the employers in the licensed trade to a degree that is not necessary, and on the other hand he is going to increase substantially the cost structure of the whole licensing trade.  The amendments which Fine Gael have put down deserve consideration and if the Minister is unable to consider the merits and the proposals simply because he takes personal exception to some people who may support them, then he is showing himself completely unsuited to the office which he holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need dwell any further on the matter.  I could say a great deal more but I have put the main arguments in favour of not imposing these six hours of continuous drinking on Sundays.  There are many other arguments.  The opposition to the <Col N="1033" /> variation in hours arises at the termination of trading periods and not at the beginning.  As the Fine Gael amendment suggests, if public houses in Dublin remain open for an hour later than those in other places, they are not going to have a large influx of people to avail of that hour.  As I said on the last occasion, I believe that if there were a variation of only half an hour between the night closing time in Dublin and other parts of the country, it would not lead to any large exodus such as we had during the time of the old <i>bona fide</i> trade.  The Minister should seriously consider it.</P>
    <P>If the public houses in the rest of the country closed at 11.30, I should like to see them closing in Dublin at 11 o'clock, and if it is to be at 11 o'clock during the other times of the year in the country, I should like to see a closing hour of 10.30 in Dublin.  That half hour in Dublin is vital so far as the consumers are concerned, as public transport ceases at 11.30.  It is important also to employees of licensed premises because they can get away in time to get home before midnight.  As things are at present, there are many employees of licensed premises who during the summer months do not arrive home until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. because they have to work until public transport has gone off the streets.  If the Minister, without feeling personally involved, would consider the remarks from this side of the House, we might get a much better measure than the Bill he has put before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have addressed the House four times on this Stage of the Bill and if I am to believe everything I heard from Deputy Burke, it looks as if I was addressing my remarks, through you, Sir, to the wrong person when I addressed the Minister. It appears that my exhortations to the Minister last night and today were useless.  They should have been made to Deputy Burke and I could have got him to lead a deputation to the Minister and the Minister would probably have met me on the amendment I had down earlier.  With reference to amendment No. 7, I would again exhort the Minister not to forget to leave Waterford in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> The Minister on amendment No. 3 said that he had to be guided by a demand and he was reported in the national newspapers as saying he had a strong demand from Waterford.  As I reminded him on a previous occasion, when I handed him a petition signed by more than 80 per cent. of the licensed trade in Waterford, they should get these hours mentioned here</P>
    <P>if the premises are situate in the county borough of Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford and during the months of June, July and August and September six o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of ten o'clock in the evening, and during any other month seven o'clock in the afternoon and ten o'clock in the evening.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I have no argument to make about the hours 4 o'clock to 10 o'clock in rural areas.  They are welcomed in the rural areas.  My constituents in the rural areas in Waterford and the members of the licensed trade all want those hours.  The licensed trade in the city want the hours I have mentioned and which are provided for in the amendment.  It is very easy to get away from the suggestion that we should have uniformity in this respect, but I would urge the Minister to look again at this and not make an exception of Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear Deputy Ryan's contribution, but surely we do not have to humour the Minister. I said last night we would approach this Bill in a calm manner. I have not gone outside that, despite the provocation from the benches behind the Minister and for which I do not blame him.  I would point out to him, though, that many of his staunch supporters, in a telegram to me today, expressed themselves as aghast at his conduct in this matter. As I said earlier, it would be good politics for me to taunt him on this&mdash; it would, as Deputy P.J. Burke said, be only democracy at work.  Surely it is only right to give way to pressure <Col N="1035" /> from people in an area who are, after all, entitled to their rights as citizens of the Republic?</P>
      <P>To get back to where we were before the Minister's interruption, I am at a loss to know where the demand is for the provisions the Minister has put into this section.  I have asked the Minister five or six times to reconsider this matter, and I can assure him he will be asked again, away from this House.  I have been asked by people who are not licensees, people who like to take a drink, why the Minister is so adamant and why he proposes opening hours on Sunday afternoons from 4 to 10 o'clock.  It has been bandied about here that licensees are a pressure group.  I can answer that by saying that this Sunday afternoon opening period was the result of the pressure group represented by members of golf clubs who do not care what happens away from their clubs so long as they can drink in their clubs up to 10 p.m.</P>
      <P>I would again return to something which has been lost in the tide of Dublin protestations&mdash;the question of seaside resorts.  In this connection, I deliberately do not use the word &ldquo;tourist&rdquo;&mdash;I am endeavouring to cater for our own people, let them be from inland towns or trippers who go to the seaside on Sunday afternoons. I disagree with the people who say that the proposed 4 to 10 o'clock opening is ample to cover such resorts during the season.  I would exhort the Minister to take cognisance of the amendment No. 20 in the name of Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.  Outside the seaside resorts, there are the big inland towns such as Thurles where you might have a Munster GAA final on a Sunday afternoon with an influx of from 50,000 to 60,000 people.  Special concessions should be written into the Bill for extensions for such functions. When it comes to my constituency, I always fear Fianna Fáil Ministers.

I know from experience that certain very wise people wait until the discussion is nearly over so that they can misrepresent earlier speakers without the risk of their being misrepresented themselves.  I have no reason to change my mind because it now seems there is general agreement that the Sunday evening closing hour should be 10 p.m.  The least that can be said on this is that there is agreement to compromise.  There is, however, a rather violent conflict of views in respect of the opening time.  There appear to be three viewpoints&mdash;in respect of Dublin city, the seaside resorts and the rural areas.  We have to decide what is the best arrangement for those three areas.  One quarter of the population of the country is concentrated in Dublin and that cannot be ignored.  There is no point in saying: &ldquo;We are always talking about Dublin.&rdquo; It is the capital city with a population of 700,000.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the two points of view held by Deputy Burke. He is entitled to have two points of view.

      <P>Deputy P.J. Burke was justified in asking for special consideration for the seaside resorts and, at the same time, asking that something be done for Dublin city, where six hours in the afternoon are not wanted.  Deputy P.J. Burke was, therefore, correct in having two points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter. He has responsibilities to both areas. It would not do for him to shout &ldquo;4 p.m. to 10 p.m. everywhere&rdquo;.  The people in O'Connell Street would say &ldquo;That is not our view.&rdquo;  Deputy P. J. Burke is entitled to say &ldquo;All right&rdquo; and look for some other hours for Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's problem is to decide what the opening hours should be. Some have expressed the view that it should be from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.  I accept that that would be satisfactory from the trade union point of view but that it would not be acceptable to the Minister.  Therefore, I shall deal only with proposals the Minister is prepared to meet.  I shall deal with the question of whether the opening hour should be 4 p.m., 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m.  Deputy P.J. Burke said the people of Dublin do not want the hours of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Deputy Ryan said so and I say so, too.  The Minister will have to recognise that fact.  Then we are left with the question of whether the opening hours should be 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m.  Deputy O'Higgins advocated 5 p.m. and I advocate 5.30 p.m.  The Dublin publicans do not wish to lose the huge trade of 17,000 or 18,000 visitors from the country, which they would lose if they opened only at 7 p.m.  My point in favour of the 5.30 opening is this. We must consider the right of the thousands of workers involved to have a session off.  Take the family publican, the fellow who has to be always there, at what time does he get off? If the licensed premises closed at 2 o'clock and opened at 5.30, he would have a reasonable time to go to a match, run out to the seaside or go <Col N="1038" /> to the cinema.  But if he has to open again at 5 o'clock, he cannot very well go to a match or the cinema and be back in time.  He would miss the principal parts of the cinema shows or matches, which are not over until after 5 o'clock.  He would have to get an aeroplane back.</P>
    <P>That half-hour is vital.  It gives thousands of workers, and even the publicans themselves, a chance of going somewhere and being able to get back without having heart failure.  It is also time enough for the fellow coming out of a match or picture house to have a drink or two.  The opening hour of 5 p.m. would not suit the fellow who wants an evening off.  I leave to the Minister the question of to what extent there should be a differential between city and seaside.  I am not concerned with you people in the country.  I am talking about the opening hour of 5.30 p.m. in Dublin only. The Minister should recognise there is general opposition to a six-hour opening in Dublin.  That comes from Deputy P.J. Burke who &ldquo;knocks about&rdquo; the public houses and knows the position.  I do not mean any offence by that.  He is an active man and he &ldquo;knocks around&rdquo; if only for a chat. He knows the feeling of the people and he represents the Party here.  He said he would be agreeable to the hours I have in my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are a lot of sanctimonious hypocrites.  Every person standing up here to speak opens by saying &ldquo;I do not drink&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a reformed gentleman&rdquo;.  Let me go on record as saying here and now that I speak for the man who takes a drink, as I do myself.  Let me try and give the Minister the point of view of the man who takes a drink.  I am not speaking from the point of view of the publicans or of the employees.  I am speaking from the customers' point of view.  I should like to remind Deputy Sherwin that the customer does not rush into the public house every minute of every hour it is open.  He goes for the half-hour or hour that suits him. Sometimes it may be late in the night when he is free to go.  The longer he is able to spend in it, the less likelihood <Col N="1039" /> there is of his getting drunk.  The strictest policeman we have is a man's own pocket.  Your pocket governs the amount of money you will spend in the public house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing whatever. The longer you have to spend it, the less effect it is going to have on you.  It stands to reason.  Deputy Lemass, I think, talked about rush drinking.  You have rush drinking only when it comes near closing time. The sooner you realise that, the better. I am afraid I am not in a position to deal as I would like to with amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, because they deal with the cities of Dublin and Cork.  Thanks be to heaven, during my sojourns in the city of Dublin I have never found difficulty in getting a drink any time I wanted it and, please God, it will continue that way.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would bear with me I would deal with the other two amendments, amendments Nos. 12 and 20.  I have heard several people congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  I wonder, if his predecessor had listened to the speeches from this side of the House, would there be any necessity for this Bill?  None whatever.  When that Bill was first introduced in 1959 and became law in 1960, we were told it would be the last of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  We made appeals to the Minister and, mind you, all the appeals did not come from this side of the House.  Some came from the Fianna Fáil benches.  I remember Deputies from my own county supporting my point of view that we were doing a considerable amount of damage to the tourist industry by the hours which we were inserting in the 1960 Act. Remember we have lost thousands of pounds as a result of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now trying to mend our hands and I think that is a good thing. I remember saying on one occasion dealing with this Bill that we down in the south&mdash;I was referring to the 26 Counties&mdash;were known and famed <Col N="1040" /> for our liberalism, whereas in the six north-eastern counties they were known and famed for their conservatism. Things have changed.  We have now become the conservatives and the Six Counties have become the liberals. One may walk into a hotel or even a public house in any tourist resort in the Six Counties on a Sunday and have a drink at any reasonable hour, but down here we have become more conservative with the result that the law is strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>As I say, as they are the only ones I know anything about, I support amendments Nos. 12 and 20.  Amendment No. 12 deals with what we might describe as the holiday period from 1st June to 30th September.  As the law stands at the moment, from 1st June to 30th September on Sunday evenings, the public houses close at 9 o'clock and on week nights, they close at 11.30 p.m.  I cannot take very much exception to the 11.30 p.m. closing.  I think it is a reasonable hour except on very special occasions.  Those special occasions are covered by amendment No. 20.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 is designed to give a certain discretion to the district justices during that period from 1st June to 30th September, which is the peak period for the tourist industry. In my county at the moment, it is not dark until about 12.25 a.m. or 12.30 a.m.  As a matter of fact, there are parts of my county where we have only approximately two and half hours of twilight.  We depend mostly on the Six Counties for our tourists.  Very often they come across for week-ends or, very often again, they are day trippers by car.  That is a contradiction in terms but they are day trippers who come over in their own cars.</P>
    <P>Since the passing of the 1960 Act, they have to finish their golf, their fishing, or whatever is their pastime or leisure early because if they want an intoxicating drink, they must get into a public house before 9 o'clock.  When they come out at 9 o'clock, there is nothing for them but to get back across the Border.  Prior to this&mdash;let us admit it and face up to it&mdash;the Garda shut their eyes to breaches of the licensing laws, and after their golf or <Col N="1041" /> fishing, the tourists adjourned to some hotel or public house where&mdash;I would not say they consumed large quantities of drink &mdash; they had a singsong and drank at their leisure, the Nelson eye having been turned towards that particular resort for the time being.</P>
    <P>That is what we are seeking in amendment No. 12.  We are asking the Minister to accept the amendment giving discretion to a district justice, if he is satisfied that a particular locality is a holiday resort.  We do not say a seaside resort but a holiday resort.  We know Killarney is a holiday resort, not a seaside, and there are others such as Lisdoonvarna&mdash;I think people go there mostly for the water. There are number of other holiday resorts&mdash;and each of us could think of them in our own constituencies&mdash;where we will have an influx of visitors during the period 1st June to 30th September.  We do not ask the Minister to give these resorts extended hours on Sunday nights.  All we say is: &ldquo;Look, we will leave it to the man who knows best, the district justice who resides in the locality and who should know whether they are genuine holiday resorts or otherwise.  If he is satisfied that an application is genuine, having heard the Garda, he may give extended hours to those holiday resorts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have Fahan, Buncrana, Portnablagh, Downings, Bundoran and all the various other seaside resorts in my county and I know the financial advantage it would be to the people of that county if visitors could remain for those three or four extra hours on Sunday evenings.  I do not think there would be any abuse if the Minister gave that discretion to the justices.  I do not believe there would be.  As I say, the justice must be satisfied that it is a genuine holiday resort.  That is something that was done in the 1927 Act, the 1943 Act and abolished in the 1960 Act.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter.  We have not put down this amendment for political reasons. I know that opposite me there are Deputies who genuinely hold the same views as we do on this amendment to <Col N="1042" /> grant exemptions to holiday resorts during the summer period only.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 deals with area exemption orders for certain days and days only.  If the Minister gives Sunday hours of from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. or 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. or whatever it might be, there may be a Sunday in the constituency of any one of us on which there is a football match, or a pattern as it is called in the south and a feis as we call it in the north, or a fleadh ceoil, which are now becoming very popular and common.  There can be an exceptional day in any locality with a hurling match, a football match, an athletics meeting, or possibly a cock fight.</P>

      <P>I do not know if it is a popular practice in the south but in my part of the country soccer or Gaelic tournaments are sometimes run throughout the summer based on one town. Nobody knows in advance how many Sundays they will run.  It may be three or four or five or six.  On occasions such as that, we ask the Minister to allow the justice, having heard the Garda superintendent and the publicans or their representatives, to grant exemptions for those Sundays.  I cannot visualise the exemptions being later than 10 o'clock&mdash;they may be.  I am thinking of the influx if, say, a special train arrives at two o'clock and the match begins at three and the people want some refreshments.  We had an example in Swinford, County Mayo, where there was a fleadh ceoil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We gave them an assurance before the last general election, each one of us, that we would endeavour to amend the law.  We are now trying to carry out that assurance.

I do not know if he can get a consensus of opinion from the House as a result which will enable him to come to a firm decision on the matter, but what I recognise in the discussion is an intolerance of the views expressed by the other fellow.  From some remarks made it would seem that one should own a publichouse or be a veteran drinker to be qualified to speak on this legislation, but if one does not drink or drinks but moderately, according to many people in the House, he should not take part in this discussion.  I think that is a wrong view.  One might as well say that unless one is in receipt of a social welfare benefit one should not take part in a debate on social welfare or a debate on industry unless one participates in industry.  I want to express my views on some of these amendments and I do not care who likes them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they will have any effect on the Minister but I want to put what I say on record because I have pretty confirmed views, views with which many of my colleagues in my own Party do not agree. <Col N="1046" /> I would say the majority do not agree with them.  I believe that people like Deputy O'Donnell and some members of my Party should be campaigning in this House to have the public houses open 24 hours a day.  That is the strain in which they are talking, even though they may not mean it in that way.  They do not seem to want restrictions of any kind, whilst, on the other hand, they have accepted the principle that we must have fixed hours.  Therefore, I believe the opinion of every Deputy should be respected when he talks about the hours during which he believes public houses should be open.</P>
      <P>I am not intolerant of people who drink and often mix with them and encourage them to drink but frankly I think that 11.30 p.m. is too late to have public houses open.  If 11.30 p.m. is late enough and suits many Deputies or suits the Minister, why not 12 midnight? What is the difference between 11.30 p.m. and 12 midnight, and what is the difference between midnight and 12.30 or 1 a.m.?  There does not seem to be anything sacred about any hour, as far as some Deputies are concerned.</P>
      <P>Once we accept the principle that the Government and the Dáil have the right to fix hours, we should aim at something which we believe is acceptable to all the people.  The views of people who wear the Pioneer badge in this House have been to some extent sneered at because they do not seem to have any interest in drink.  I do not think that should be so.  They have a point of view.  Whether people drink or not, they have an interest&mdash;not a vested interest&mdash;in the drinking habits of the people.</P>
      <P>I do not know anything about the Taoiseach's drinking habits.  I do not know whether he drinks or not&mdash;I have no idea whether he does or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>He is the most important man in this House as far as his rank goes and he expressed the opinion that there was too much drinking in the country.  I think it is stupid to say that if we lengthen the hours, we will not have more drinking. Of course we will.  It is ridiculous to think otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> If, as I say, we accept the principle that we should control drinking to the extent that we control the hours, all of us should try to fix the hours in accordance with the traditions of the people.  I said on Second Reading, and now repeat, that I believe that Sunday should be treated differently from the other six days of the week.  I honestly believe that.  The proposals in this Bill will allow&mdash;if that is the right expression&mdash;those who want to drink something like seven and a half hours. Frankly, I think seven and a half hours is too long to have the public houses open on a Sunday.  In the normal course of events, on a week day, a man who wants to go to a public house to drink, when one remembers that he finishes work at 6 p.m. and is not ready to go out again until about 7 p.m. or 7.30 p.m., has but three or four hours in which to drink.  I put it to the Minister: does he believe that we should give facilities to the extent of allowing&mdash;and that is the right word in this case&mdash;twice as long for drinking on Sunday as on a week day?</P>
    <P>Many people may sneer at that sort of comment.  I do not want to attempt to preach to people or to tell them how they should run their lives; but, to the extent that we are controlling drinking hours at all, we have the right, and I think we have the responsibility, to ensure that there will be moderate drinking on Sundays.  Frankly, I believe there will not be if we extend the hours.</P>
    <P>Deputies have spoken of how the Guards turned the Nelson eye prior to the 1960 Act.  Many of us have been at seaside resorts in this country and have witnessed scandalous behaviour on the part of people who took too much drink.  That will happen again, I am firmly convinced, under this legislation which will allow them to drink in the afternoon from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.  I do not think it is good enough.</P>

      <P>That is two hours. Many of the arguments are made in the name of tourism.  I do not say the Minister has made these arguments. Deputy O'Donnell made them.  Again at the risk of repeating what I said last night, I may say that we commit too many sins in the name of tourism.  We are not doing too badly in tourism. The tourist figures have gone up rapidly year after year.  I cannot claim that my part of the country is the best tourist area but it has its quota&mdash;a pretty good quota&mdash;especially because Rosslare is one of the main ports of entry and I suppose we have many more seaside resorts than most other maritime counties.</P>
      <P>I have not heard complaints from tourists about inability to get drink.  I knock around with as regular a crowd as anybody within my own Party and within my own circle of friends in Wexford.  There was not anybody who suggested to me that there should be extra hours of drinking on Sundays.  I could not say that in a plainer or more forthright fashion.  There was not anybody in Wexford town or county who ever suggested to me in the past two years that the hours for drinking on Sunday were too short. The only complaint made was, believe it or not, that the hours were too long and that they would be satisfied with opening hours say from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. or from 6 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. or 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.  That is the time the Irish people want to drink.</P>
      <P>If we are to be in any way different, we should be prepared to have our own set hours for drinking in this country, especially on Sundays, hours that are peculiar to the Irish people, and not be jealous of the drinking hours in the Six Counties if, as they were described, they are more liberal than the hours here, and not be jealous of the fact that on the Continent one can get a drink at any hour and in practically any place, public house, café, snack bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is making a grave mistake in extending the hours, especially on Sundays.  I believe also the point of view of the trade union members who are engaged in this business should be listened to.  Deputy <Col N="1049" /> Mullen, who has a particular knowledge of the interests of the trade unionists of the city of Dublin, has put forward their point of view.  It has been said of course by others that if they are in the trade, they are being paid and that irrespective of what the hours may be, they should be prepared to work.  They have a point of view and they should be considered. They are considered in other legislation and they should be considered in regard to this relatively unimportant matter of drinking.  I do not think it is good enough that we should condemn them, so to speak, to have to work at such awkward periods on Sundays.  They have contributed quite an amount, not only to the business life but to the sporting life of this city. The Dublin barman is renowned for his support of all type of sport.  Now he is to be put into the position that he will have to forego the pleasure of attending Dalymount, Lansdowne Road or Croke Park.</P>

I do not think there would be much difference if the hours were changed to say, 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.  Any time there is a big match in Croke Park I venture to say the spectators are not out until 5.30 p.m. and by the time they get to a public house, it is certainly 6 p.m. or very near it.</P>

      <P>There is too much importance attached to drinking. Deputies here asked if a crowd of day trippers go down to Tramore, Rosslare or Bray on a Sunday and it starts to rain: What are they to do?  Where are they to go?  The public house is not open, as if the public house were a Mecca for these people on whom it rained.  I do not suggest they should all flock into the churches, but if there is no public house open in the place, their day is ruined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think many of us would go into the toilets in some of the public houses.  There is far too much importance being attached to this whole matter of drink and our drinking habits.  I concede that the Minister is trying to make improvements. I concede that there was nothing political in the motives of the former Minister for Justice.  He wanted to obviate what he believed was an abuse in regard to drinking after hours.</P>
      <P>Because people were dissatisfied and showed their dissatisfaction in certain areas in the last general election the Minister wants to tidy up the legislation. Again I give him credit for trying to do the right thing but I am merely making this appeal&mdash;and it seems to be an appeal in the wilderness &mdash;for the curtailment of drinking, especially on a Sunday.  The interests of trade unionists may be important. The interests of the man who owns a public house may be important and the interests of the consumer may be important but our Irish traditions and our Irish way of life are much more important and if we are to cater for the people who must get into a public house if it rains, who must get a drink after a football match, who must have the same facilities as they would have on the Continent, then it is a bad day for us.  While I disagreed all along with the opening of public houses on a Sunday, I would suggest that, if they must be open, they should be open at some reasonable hour as has been proposed, from six or seven until ten o'clock on a Sunday night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not doing it deliberately but this measure will be responsible for the breaking up of many homes.  There are some people who, if they get into a public house at four o'clock on a Sunday afternoon, will not be shifted until 10 o'clock.  This idea that they will spend only what they have set out for drink that day is nonsense.  There are people all over the country who would beg, borrow or steal in order to drink until 10 o'clock and the wives and children&mdash;and I do not want to exaggerate&mdash;will suffer in that process.  Sunday should be a day <Col N="1051" /> apart.  Again, let me remind the Minister that even though the Sunday opening hours will be shorter than for the week-day, there will be twice as much time available on a Sunday for the ordinary working man to drink than on other days of the week.</P>

      <P>I know Deputy Corish has very definite views on the whole drinking position.  Some years ago, Deputy Corish was one of the few Deputies who had the courage of his convictions here.  When this House decided that only people in certain parts of the country inside the &ldquo;Pale&rdquo; were to be allowed to take a drink on Sunday, Deputy Corish voted with the majority against the opening of any rural public houses except for the gentlemen who travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>After that, I brought in a Bill here to suit everybody, namely, to close all public houses on a Sunday, to close the city public house as well as the country public house and the self-same tribe that voted here in favour of closing the door of the countryman on a Sunday voted to keep the city man's door open.  Let us be clear on this: there were no licensing laws for 30 or 40 years before the last licensing Bill was brought in.  The question is now whether we are to legislate for Dublin and Cork, the two cities again, or for the country at large. The publicans of Dublin have put up the prices so high now that they can afford to open for only a couple of hours and then make a profit to keep them going, and public houses are selling for £20,000 and higher.  That will show what they are worth.  Any man who can afford to pay £20,000 to £40,000 for licensed premises could afford to pay extra staff to cover the extra hours.  There is a lot of talk about trade unionists.  I was talking to Cork city people coming up in the train about three weeks ago and they were saying: &ldquo;We are good trade unionists.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Very well; a good trade unionist at present is looking for a five-day week.  We will give <Col N="1052" /> them a five-day week and close the premises altogether on Saturday and Sunday.&rdquo;  That should satisfy them. They will be good trade unionists then. I do not know whether the public houses will sell as well on that basis.</P>
      <P>This Dáil appointed a commission to go into all this.  That commission brought in its findings and on those findings the last Bill was based.  There was the difficulty of ordinary country people who had to feed their cattle and milk them on Sunday morning and go down to 11 o'clock or 11.30 Mass in the local church.  When they came out after their morning's work and walked past the public house, they dare not look at it but a city person who drove up in his car would have the door open for him.  That was the position for long enough in this country.  It has taken long enough for the rural people to become alive to what has gone on.</P>
      <P>Up to the time I came into this House, there was a fair observance of the law.  The law was fairly well observed at that time; but from that time, the observance of the law deteriorated from day to day and from month to month until there was no closing of any public house anywhere except by the trade union people in the city.  I have complaints from the rural areas in connection with all this. I have complaints of people going to a funeral in the country on a Sunday where you have 200 or 300 mourners trying to get a drink after a funeral and they have to go away without having a chat with their neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the condition of affairs here and when I wanted to remedy that in this House, I was told by Deputy MacEoin, who was Minister for Justice at the time, to leave it to him and that he would fix it.  He did not fix it and it was eight years before it was fixed.  The Guards for whom Deputy MacEoin was responsible did not enforce the law as far as any licensed premises were concerned and the law became a joke.  There are funerals in rural areas on a Sunday and the people attending them have no opportunity of getting a drink. There is still a problem in the country districts because no matter what trade union regulations there are, the <Col N="1053" /> cow must be milked morning and evening.  The usual time for the farmer to finish up is about 7 o'clock in the evening and then he goes and has a drink.  Now he has until 10 o'clock to have it and I hope that in a couple of years it will be 12 o'clock.</P>

Two of them were in favour of closing at 10 o'clock and the remainder were in favour of closing at 9 o'clock.  How could any Minister please an organisation like that?  After all, there is nothing in the Bill to compel any one of these city people to remain open, if they do not want to.  The law is there.  They can open, if they wish to open and close, if they wish to close. All they have to do to keep their licence is to open one day in the 12 <Col N="1054" /> months.  They have plenty of time to close if they want to and surely they can get agreement amongst themselves and close at 9 o'clock, if they want to do so.  There is nothing to stop them.</P>

I think we have wasted enough time on this.  I speak here as one who believes in Sunday opening for the whole country.  I endeavoured to get that through and I would like now to congratulate my converts to Sunday opening.  Sometimes I go to the Library and have a look at the division lists and it is worth while to see all the &ldquo;goody-goody&rdquo; boys who though the country boys should not have a drink on a Sunday and that they would go mad if they did now voting so that the city boys can get a drink on Sundays.</P>
      <P>Since the last Bill was brought in here, the Guards have had a very difficult task and I should like to congratulate them on the way they carried it out.  They had a difficult task in enforcing a licensing law where none had been enforced for 20 or 30 years. They did a good job and I think we can now go a little further in this matter to meet the needs of the people. That is all we are doing in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, I should like to point out that there are three sections of the people to be satisfied. There are the publicans, the employees and the consumers.  Having listened to the various speakers, I am now quite satisfied that they are not fully conversant with the position in the city of Dublin.  I cannot speak for the city of Cork but, one city being somewhat similar to another, I would suggest that the same position obtains there.  The licensed trade in Dublin, both employees and employers, are anxious to have a 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. opening for the second period.  I can <Col N="1055" /> state, without fear of contradiction, that 75 per cent. of the consumers would also prefer these hours.</P>
      <P>Now, if these are the opening hours for the second session on Sunday, I am quite satisfied that the Government will have to induce a differential.  This country, being the type of country it is, with the varied types of holiday resorts, fishing, scenic and seaside, and remembering the calling of the bulk of our rural workers, farmers and farm labourers, I believe there will have to be a differential to satisfy the majority of the people in the rural areas.  I suggest that such a differential should be before opening hours.  To my knowledge there has never been an abuse of opening before the normal opening hours.  Abuses occur after normal closing hours.</P>
      <P>With regard to employees in licensed premises, I want to point out to the Minister that, under trade union regulations, employees cannot go to their tea on Sunday until, at the earliest, six o'clock.  They are entitled to an hour and a half for their tea. That means that only half the Sunday staff will be working from six to nine o'clock, making it practically impossible for any house to carry on reasonable trading and fulfil the requirements of the customers.  The four o'clock to ten o'clock opening in my opinion, and I can safely say in the opinion of the majority of the publicans in this city, and in the opinion of practically all the employees, and of 75 per cent. of the consumers, is not suitable; seven o'clock to ten o'clock would be more suitable hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate they have a problem in the rural areas.  I also appreciate that a problem can be created with the seven o'clock to ten o'clock opening in the city of Dublin and the city of Cork. But the problem that arises arises, at the very most, on half a dozen to eight occasions in the year.  It arises in the Croke Park area in connection with the All-Ireland semi-finals and finals in Gaelic football, the Leinster final, on four occasions where hurling is concerned. It also arises in connection with the soccer final in Dalymount <Col N="1056" /> Park.  They are the only occasions to my knowledge on which an area or special exemption order would be required.  I suggest to the Minister that he makes provision in this Bill to make these facilities available to the licensed trade and to the public when they are required, having accepted the seven o'clock to ten o'clock opening for the second period on Sunday.  Such a provision would be well received in both Dublin city and Cork city.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to various speakers here that the hours operating in England at the moment on Sunday are twelve-thirty to two o'clock and seven to ten o'clock in the evening. Those hours are most acceptable in a country where they have a far bigger tourist trade than we have here.  In Scotland&mdash;I admit I am wrong in making these comparisons&mdash;the public houses do not open at all on Sunday.  I should like to point out to the House that Section 15, which, I am glad to say, was withdrawn by the Minister, was a section in a Fianna Fáil Bill. Deputy Burke said he headed a deputation to the Minister and, through his good offices and the offices of Fianna Fáil Deputies, this section was withdrawn. But this section was introduced by Fianna Fáil and surely it was up to Fianna Fáil to withdraw it.  May I point out that the <i>bona fide</i> trade was abolished by the efforts of Fianna Fáil in the 1942 and 1960 Intoxicating Liquor Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been discussing here a licensing Bill introduced, it seems to me, for the benefit of the city of Dublin.  Before the 1960 Act was passed, we were accustomed to the &ldquo;back door&rdquo; and the &ldquo;front door&rdquo; and, as often as not, the local sergeant or the local garda told us where to go. It was not a bad arrangement because those who transgressed seriously were faced with the full penalty of the law; the local sergeant or the local garda knew all about it.  There was really nothing wrong in that arrangement. There were no brawls.  There was no over-drinking.  There were no greatly extended hours, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural Ireland should be our first consideration if we want to keep the <Col N="1057" /> people in rural Ireland.  I want to give these people better facilities than the people in Grafton Street.  I want the worker after his hard day's work, piking hay, saving hay, drawing hay, threshing, milking his cows on a Sunday afternoon, to be able to get a drink.  When it is seven o'clock for the man in Grafton Street, it is only six o'clock for the farmer and his worker.  Surely these men are entitled, after their hard day's work, to go to the nearest pub to have a drink, and not merely to have a drink but also to have a talk with farmer friends, neighbours and others?  The &ldquo;local&rdquo; is the parliament of the countryman. There he can discuss the mart last week, what the white-faced bull calf or heifer made, what the three year old bullock fetched, or what the creamery manager will deduct from the gallon of milk, or give back with the penny on the cigarettes and tobacco, to pay the £3,500 salary of the secretary to An Bord Bainne.  But the farmer must work all day.  He must attend to the cows in the morning. Good Friday and Christmas Day included.  Then, in the month of July, when milk is plentiful, he has to look after his cows and he has to save his hay.</P>
    <P>We are hearing all about Dublin since the debate started.  As far as I am concerned, I would not give you a thraneen for Dublin.  Dublin is well able to look after itself.  I am thinking of the small publican in the small village and in the small town.  By an act of Providence or good grace, he will get a hurling match maybe three times a year on a Sunday, or a sports meeting or a gymkhana organised for the local parish building fund or whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>Surely to heavens that man is entitled, as a publican, to make the best use of the people who come in?  They are tourists as far as he is concerned, although they might only come from the next parish.  They are coming in to spend a £ and he is entitled to get the benefit of that £.  In the city of Limerick we have Munster finals or Munster Championships.  We have trains arriving in the city of Limerick at 10.30 in the morning right up to the <Col N="1058" /> time of the sporting event.  We had an arrangement locally whereby a publican could take the latch off his door.  They came in the front and back doors at 11.30 in the morning. What was wrong with it?  We were saving hay.  The hay had to be saved. You go to the town of Puck.  You all know Puck, I hope.  Puck Fair goes on for three days and three nights. But, when the third night is over, the rate collector is around the following morning and the rate collector gets his rates that morning for the 12 months.</P>

When anybody goes on his holidays and takes his wife to the seaside&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle knows this as well as I do&mdash;we see the licensing laws torn to smithereens as we saw the 1960 Act torn below in a town in the Ceann Comhairle's own county.</P>
      <P>A man and his wife went down for a week or a fortnight or a month or for as long as it pleased him for his holidays.  His children are out playing on the beach until maybe 9 o'clock. Then they have to be put to bed and it is 10 o'clock.  Let me say what I know.  You go down the street and you look for a drink and the public houses are closed at 10 o'clock.  You have put your family to bed.  It is 10 o'clock.  You take your wife down the street with you, which is normal. Thanks be to God, we have come to the stage in 1962 where a man and his wife will go into a hotel or public house and have a drink.  We had not that in the 1927 Act, you know.  That was not there then but it is there now, thank God.  A man and his wife are admitted into a public house or into an hotel.  What had we with the 1960 Act?  We went into an hotel last summer. The place was as full as this is, or fuller, and the Guards came and knocked at the door.</P>

The piano was going and somebody was singing a song.  The Guards came in. We were on the premises.  We were entitled to be on the premises.  We were not residents but we were entitled to be on the premises.</P>

    <P>This is the stupidity of the 1960 Act because, as I said last night, the man who introduced it was not threatened with what the whole thing meant&mdash;and that is what this man is <Col N="1060" /> trying to rectify and let us give him credit for that.  The trays were cleared off the tables.  The Guard and the Sergeant came in.  They looked around and asked us: &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; The answer would be: &ldquo;I am singing a song.&rdquo;  The minute they went out, all the trays came out again. That was the 1960 Act and let any man stand up and tell me that I am not describing it as it happened.  That is the stupidity of what was introduced here in 1960.</P>
    <P>Now let us move along and let us consider what the people want and let us think of the people of Ireland, particularly of rural Ireland where we want to keep our people and where we want to give them more facilities than Grafton Street or O'Connell Street or wherever Deputy Sherwin comes from, where all the public houses are.</P>

      <P>In your youth, I hope.  It has all gone out of the Deputy's head, I suppose.  Unfortunately, however, we had these beach parties.  The next morning the young local lads would go down and collect their bottles.  They would receive 4d. each for empty cider flagons.  There was twopence on the empty stout bottles and something else on the Baby Power bottle.  They were collecting these and getting cash for them the next morning from the publicans. All that was done on the beach at night time and nobody can get up and tell me I am not telling the truth because I know it is the truth.</P>
      <P>I want to be fair about this Bill. I want to congratulate the Minister for taking his courage in his hands, which was more than his predecessors did because I have gone to many Ministers to try, as chairman of the Limerick licensed trade, to get things amended.  I congratulate the Minister on not allowing himself to be bulldozed or goaded by any section of the community.  What do the people want?  Do a man and his wife want to drink at the seaside on Sunday nights?  Does a man who travels 15 or 20 miles to a hurling match which is over at five o'clock and finds himself in a village or town not want a drink after the match?  We came to Dublin for All-Ireland Finals and you could drink in Dublin up to seven o'clock or eight o'clock.  We stayed in Dublin and drank until closing time and went home half drunk.  Under the old law, that did not happen.  We left Dublin as quickly as we could and we knew that we could get into a local public house at any time of the night or day and that if we did not find one, then, the local sergeant would tell us where to go, which was a good thing.  I have spoken for rural Ireland.  I have spoken against Dublin where the licensing laws are concerned.  I have spoken on behalf of the working man and the man who has some money to spend on Saturday or Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we are faced with another difficulty in the 1960 Act because in rural Ireland we have the mixed trader. I have seen, and I am sure all the other Deputies have seen, local <Col N="1062" /> publicans who sold newspapers, or the pound of tea or the stone of sugar and that man could not open after Mass.  I saw these people at seaside resorts standing outside their own doors selling newspapers, selling the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;not so many of them fortunately &mdash;and the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the other newspapers and they could not allow a person on their premises to buy a newspaper.  That was the stupidity of the 1960 Act.  We are faced with another difficulty which I want the Minister to consider seriously &mdash;this relinquishing of two licences to create one.  Through an historical movement, over which we had no control in 1962, Ireland was over-licensed.</P>

      <P>Dáil Éireann in its wisdom has decided to discuss all these amendments together and possibly that has resulted in the amendments not getting the detailed examination one would expect on a Committee Stage.  I should like to raise a few points about them.  The first is that the Minister and the Government seem determined to legislate on the basis of complete and absolute uniformity. Everything has to be sacrificed in the interests of uniformity and there cannot be exceptions for anybody anywhere. That perhaps is typical of Fianna Fáil.  They want to show their power.  It is a bit of the big stick and the heel in the neck.  There is no such thing as resilience, no such thing as having somebody who can make changes like the district justice.  The Minister is to be the arbiter and if we do not like his decision, then we can &ldquo;lump it&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is quite impossible to satisfy everybody on the basis of a Bill which is completely uniform all over the country, a Bill which has no exceptions.  We on this side of the House have put down amendments which tend to disturb that principle of <Col N="1063" /> uniformity.  For instance, we have put down an amendment to insert a new section before Section 9 providing for area exemptions.  I want to tell the Minister that he is going to close up the small seaside resorts of Carlingford, to the north, and from that right down through Blackrock&mdash;where the Minister for Local Government opened the new swimming pool today, a job which cost about £50,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we had a swim but the Minister did not.  He will also close Annagassan and Baltray&mdash; but it has a golf club and may survive &mdash;and Bettystown and then down to some of the bigger resorts like Skerries which may survive.  These people live just for Sundays in the summer.  In the course of my business, on most days I go to the village of Annagassan and on the way home to luncheon, I can go in and have a bottle of stout.  That has often been the only bottle of stout served during a winter day and perhaps no more than two dozen bottles would be served until the following day.  These are the places where the countryman, for whom Deputy Coughlan was speaking, may be on holidays or perhaps he cannot afford a holiday and goes there on a Sunday with his wife and family.  He may be a middle-aged man who is not interested in having a swim.  He may have his wife and perhaps neighbours with him or perhaps he has his children with him and he leaves them on the beach and walks up to have a bottle of stout. This man will be going home to milk his cows, to look after his cattle and to do more work about the time the public houses are opening.  One might say it was only a few hours and that in fact it was not a grave interference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My suggestion is that the public houses are closed down on a Sunday <Col N="1064" /> afternoon according to this Bill and I say that if the present hours are amended, there should be an exemption for a seaside resort.

When people are not going to football matches, that is what they do in rural Ireland.  Perhaps he has travelled 20 miles to Bettystown or to Laytown or to Annagassan or to Carlingford or any of these small seaside resorts which, mark you, are not the sort with which the Minister is too well acquainted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These people want the full day on Sunday but under this Bill&mdash;and I believe it is synonymous with a lot of Fianna Fáil legislation down through the years&mdash;there is no exemption.</P>
      <P>We should go into the amendments in more detail than perhaps we have been doing.  Because of the fact that these amendments are being taken together, all that has been said so far has been on the lines of Second Reading speeches.  Amendment No. 20 caters for special events and Deputy Coughlan is quite right in saying that these special events warrant opening throughout the day.  For instance, when they go up Croagh Patrick&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have made my plea for the seaside resorts and I shall make further pleas for other sections as the Bill goes through. However, I am sorry to say that what will obviously happen is that the Minister will try to steamroll the Bill through unamended, except for his own amendments.  He is not adopting here the resilient give and take attitude which is necessary on a measure of this sort.  No Government will rise or fall on this.  Of course, the Minister has had his moments of embarrassment. Being a young Minister, he has brought in a Bill from which he has had to remove a whole section.

      <P>The Minister is not fooling anybody.  This is a Bill on which he should accept reasonable, constructive suggestions from all sections of the House.  Deputy Kenny from Mayo, Deputy Coughlan from Limerick, and Deputy Belton could all make contributions which would ensure that the best possible measure would be enacted.  What we are getting steamrolled through the House is a <Col N="1066" /> Bill from which the Minister has had to withdraw one whole section because there was complete opposition throughout the country to that section.  It was a section which would obliterate the whole concept of the licensing laws in this country.  Having had to remove that section, the Minister now feels he was pressed too far.  He feels in fact that the public houses should provide meals&mdash;that if he cannot turn the restaurants into public houses, he should turn the public houses into restaurants.</P>
      <P>However, that is departing slightly from the amendment.  I have made my plea for the small seaside resorts the Minister says he knows so well.  He does not know them as well as I do because I have lived in them.  He is going to kill them because, as he knows, they have got only two days a week for three months of the year and if he now subtracts one day from them, he will put the final nail in their coffin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In my brief contribution, I want to make my position perfectly clear.  I am opposed to the amendments as I am to the advances proposed in the Bill itself.  I also come from a seaside resort but my remarks will not be influenced by how it will affect me or any particular constituency but how I must face up to this problem in general.  Much reference has been made to the seaside resorts.  I always believed, still do and always shall, that the greatest benefit people can gain by going to the seaside, assuming they have fine weather, is that they can enjoy the advantage of leaving a city or a big town and enjoying the fresh Atlantic breezes.  I cannot understand why we must plead for the publicans in seaside resorts, why we must sympathise with their problems during bad weather; nor can I understand why we must plead for the people who go to seaside resorts as to how they are to spend their time in the event of a day turning out wet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told time and again by some people who are in favour of the Bill and the amendments that we must move with the times, that we must become tourist-minded, that we must realise the importance of social <Col N="1067" /> life throughout the country.  In connection with the tourist resorts, I am tying my remarks to the views expressed and the observations made by me over the years.  If we are to approach this matter on the extent to which we can provide hours of drinking at these resorts, then we are not dealing with the people who may come here from abroad.  We are considering our own people and that is the kernel of the problem.  Are we to be bound by the necessity to provide for the future or by how this may affect us at election time?  Are we speaking our minds on what we think the amenities should be for public houses at seaside resorts?</P>
    <P>I believe the hours are long enough as it is.  Pleas have been made for the working people in rural areas and it has been said that some of them finish late at night.  I know the people in rural areas and I know that the amount of pocket money available to most of them would not keep them long in public houses.  It would not take them long to spend it on a few pints.  Time and again, I have seen men standing outside public house doors, making no attempt to go in until the barmaid came to close the door for the night. That is the time the local man with a few shillings in his pocket would put his foot to the door, jam it and slip in. If we are to be so considerate in this Bill as to extend the hours of opening during weekdays and Sundays, we will still find the same trick in the rural areas&mdash;the men with the few bob in their pockets waiting until the door is being closed and then taking a chance.</P>
    <P>I must say the Gardaí down our way are not as benevolent as those mentioned by Deputy Coughlan.  In my area, the Gardaí have always seen that when closing time came the public houses shut down.  I repeat that it is my opinion there is no case for extensions of the hours.  I feel bound to say that, because it is no use believing a thing without acting accordingly. When we hear of the unfortunate publicans depending on the proceeds of a few months of the summer in seaside resorts or in any other centre in connection with events like Puck Fair, <Col N="1068" /> we must also remember that we have to take the people as a whole and when we do that, we must be aware that all sections of the population are governed by economic conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is my duty to say that I want to see more money put into the pockets of the publicans by extending the hours.  I have nothing against these people.  I am not speaking as a member of any association against drinking.  I often say that the man who can take a drink and enjoy it is a lucky man.  But we have a moral obligation, which may be forgotten when we consider this only from the point of view of its political effects, a moral obligation particularly to the young people.  We are told that if we close the public houses at certain hours, the trend is for these people to buy drink and take it off in cars.  Even if we extended the hours until midnight, they would still take drink from the public houses with them into their cars.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I could not be in favour of any amendment or section in the Bill providing for extension of the drinking hours.  I believe social life is essential for our country, but may God grant that we will never reach the stage of saying that social life in Ireland must be governed by the amount of alcoholic drink offered to our young people.  I believe that if less alcoholic drink were available to them, they would enjoy life even more than at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has engendered a certain amount of heat and a certain amount of derision for people who take drink, but if people did not take drink, the revenue officers and the Government would be in a pretty mess.  In introducing a Bill of this kind, the Minister should take cognisance of the fact that the majority of people take a drink and contribute to the revenue of the State. This Bill when it becomes law, will lay down the hours of opening and closing, but it is the availability of money which will dictate the amount that will be spent on drink.  I know from my own experience and from that of friends that people are now restricting their hours of attendance at <Col N="1069" /> public houses.  They go in now only during the last hour or hour and a half or, perhaps, two hours.  It all depends on the amount of money they have to spend.</P>
      <P>Their hours of drinking are restricted because of the increase in the price of drink.  People who previously took four pints or &ldquo;half ones&rdquo; or gin now take only three. In my own home town of Castlebar and various other towns, they come to the public houses now only for the last hour, whereas previously they came for the last two hours.  If the hours are extended under this Bill and the employees are granted an increase through their trade unions, you will again have an increased price for drink.  If so, that increase will be passed on to the customers, who will have to further restrict their hours of drinking.  In rural areas such as Kiltimagh, Claremorris and Ballyhaunis, people are coming in later than previously.  They do not come in to fill themselves up with drink.  They come in for social contacts and for a chat.</P>
      <P>In the seaside resorts it is a different matter.  The Minister has tried to provide for the seaside resorts by incorporating in the Bill the hours of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.  I do not know whether it would not have been better to have an exemption for the seaside resorts or to have the hours of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.  The publicans in the rural areas of Mayo do not want the hours of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.  They will be open from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.  They then will have their lunch and they must be on the job again from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  It may be contended that they need not open.  But if one man does not open, his neighbour across the street will open.  If the hours of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. become law, we will be making the rural publicans slaves to their trade.  If there is a seaside resorts six miles away, there will be a move away from the towns on Sundays and the publicans in the towns will be deprived of business. That is one point I wanted to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I want to emphasise.  I have gone through the Bill to find out if a certain specific <Col N="1070" /> occasion is covered about which representations have been made to me and probably to the Minister.  I refer to the pilgrimage to Croagh Patrick.  I examined every section of the Bill and I have found that no provision is made for that occasion.  It is not covered, so far as I can see.</P>
    <P>The licensing trade in Westport are looking for consideration.  A trek of pilgrims comes into Westport from 3 o'clock on Saturday until at least 2 o'clock on Sunday morning.  I understand that under the 1960 Act, you cannot open from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock.  That is absolutely cancelled out.  These people know their own business and there is a multitude of 30,000 or 40,000 coming into the town during the night.  There are only about five hotels in Westport and they cannot cater for that number of people.  The only people who can cater for this crowd of pilgrims are the licensed trade.  They serve refreshments, liquor, sandwiches and things like that.  On the last occasion, they had to close and that led to chaos in the town.</P>
    <P>I suppose they made representations to the Minister and to other Deputies in the constituency for a concession on this specific occasion from 3 p.m. on Saturday to 2 a.m. on Sunday and from 8 a.m. to the normal hours on the following Sunday.  Under the 1960 Act, Killorglin got a concession.  Killorglin is a pagan festival, the original pagan festival of Puck Fair.</P>

      <P>A town with a population of 3,500 cannot possibly cater for 40,000 or 50,000 people.  A section should be introduced into the Bill to cater for this traditional pilgrimage in Westport and the surrounding areas. I am certain that the other Deputies in the Constituency will support me in saying that.  I do not know if the Minister has looked into the matter <Col N="1071" /> but it must be looked into.  If not, what happened before will happen again. The publicans are losing and the catering establishments in the town are losing.  The pilgrims have an ardous trek of seven or eight miles up a mountain and down again.  If the advertisements are true, they can give you back what you have lost in endurance in these marathons.  These pilgrims should be given a certain amount of consideration and if possible, a specific section should be introduced to cover this occasion and a few more such events which are not covered in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few points with regard to some of the things that were said during the course of this discussion.  It has been stated today that the rate of pay of a barman who works on his Sunday off in a city public house is £4 a day.  Another Deputy said it was £3.  That is absolutely incorrect.  A barman's rate for working on his Sunday off is £2 12s. 6d.  A supervisor gets £3 for working on his Sunday off.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate, I felt that it is a great pity that some people should continue to strive for uniformity because it is fairly obvious now that every person who has spoken cannot be satisfied.  Indeed, if the Bill went through as worded at present it would be seen that there is no uniformity in it in certain ways.  I have in mind the differential in relation to the midday closing hour as it applies in Cork, Dublin and the rest of the country.  I have in mind also the provision in the Bill to give the public houses in rural Ireland an opportunity to open earlier on some Sundays than the public houses in Dublin and Cork.  That is another indication that there is no uniformity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not take it on myself to advocate that Dublin should be treated as a separate entity.  Some people have given the impression that anyone who mentioned Dublin was concerned only about Dublin.  That is absolutely incorrect.  It is right and proper to say that people in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford have different habits <Col N="1072" /> brought about by their surroundings. It can be safely said that in many parts of rural Ireland the people have no other form of recreation than to go to the local public house, which is their club.  That being so, there is, if you like, a case for 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. opening on Sundays in those districts. At the same time, it cannot be said that that is the situation in Dublin where there are many amenities available.</P>
    <P>We advocate in our amendment that Dublin and Cork should be left as they are and there is a great case for the amendment particularly if you take the proprietors into consideration. They do not want a change in Dublin. The people who work in those establishments do not want a change and I am satisfied the consumers do not want a change.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to listen to all reasonable suggestions.  I noticed last evening that arrangements were made to have an amendment withdrawn for consideration, and the view was expressed that it could be put down again, on Report Stage.  I wonder could the same thing be done in this case?  In the case of Dublin, could it be arranged that Dublin Deputies would set about assessing the position? Could they arrange, perhaps, to draft a petition to which the proprietors, employees and consumers could subscribe?</P>
    <P>It is very important to bear in mind that if the hours are changed in Dublin, either for Sundays or weekdays, it will undoubtedly result in an increase in wages, the consequence of which will be an increase in the price of drink. When the 1960 Act was brought in and altered the hours of trading, barmen in Dublin received a 30/- a week increase for working longer hours.  Again, there will be an attempt to make some arrangement of a similar kind but the difficulty will be far greater this time because we have not got staff available to meet the needs of the situation.</P>
    <P>On Sundays at the moment, only half the staff are on duty as the other half are entitled to every second Sunday off.  There is a dearth of bar staff in <Col N="1073" /> Dublin at present and if we increase the hours of work, we shall be turning away a number who are working at the moment and sending them out of the business.  That merits serious consideration. Even if the new regulations came into effect and it was left to a free-for-all between representatives of the workers and the bar-owners in Dublin and Cork to argue this out, it could easily result in a serious dispute. That would not be to our credit after all the time we have spent talking about intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <P>I feel I should comment on this suggestion that the public houses in Dublin should open until 11.30 on weekdays.  I intend to speak later on at the appropriate time on the effect of that on workers.  In regard to its effect on people working in public houses, we must remember that bus services in Dublin cease at 11.30 p.m. If arrangements were made for the public houses to close at 11.30 p.m. a big number of people, no doubt, would have to walk home from their employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair and presume that I shall have an opportunity of commenting on weekday opening hours when dealing with the section.  I thought the amendments were being discussed in conjunction with the section.</P>
      <P>I feel I should make one other small observation in regard to the suggested alteration of the hours outside Dublin and Cork.  In putting down our amendment, we were anxious that Cork and Dublin be left as they are.  If that is not possible, the hours of 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. will do.  That is the information we have from those who work in the business.  I also feel that I must make clear that, personally, I have no objection to the hours of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. outside Dublin and Cork.  In many cases, these hours are necessary because I have very often met people working in the catering business who come in contact with tourists, not necessarily from abroad, who make it a point to leave Dublin and go down the country.  When they return to the city, they express dissatisfaction with what they experience under the present Act.  They have not got the opportunity of enjoying themselves that existed prior to the 1960 Act.  I think it is well that opportunity is coming back.</P>
      <P>Finally, reference was made today to the views of the Pioneers and Pioneer Associations in my area have been in touch with me and have asked me to protest against these new hours.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure I am in order, but I ask permission of the Chair to reply to a point made by Deputy Kenny a few minutes ago when he referred to the carnival at Killorglin as being a pagan event.  That <Col N="1076" /> carnival is no different from other similar events throughout the country. I feel sure the Deputy must have been reading the <i>News of the World</i> or the <i>Daily Express</i> which described it many years ago as a pagan custom.  The Bishop of Kerry is as able a churchman as there is in this country, and I do not think he would allow any pagan custom to be carried on in any part of his diocese.  That should answer Deputy Kenny.  Our people in Kerry resent very strongly any reference to that famous event as such.  I thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of comment here today about excessive drinking.  As a publican and as a man who takes a drink, I am of the opinion that people who want to drink to excess will be able to get drink, irrespective of the hours fixed by this House.  I agree with other Deputies that, certainly, the views offered to us by Pioneers should get fair consideration.</P>
      <P>The main argument here today has been in regard to Sunday evening hours of opening and closing.  I might at this stage, if I am in order, congratulate the Minister on extending the time of Sunday morning opening to 12 noon, under certain conditions. That is a great idea.  In most parts of the constituency I represent, Church services are concluded by about 11.50 a.m.  The proposed hour of opening will mean that people attending these services will be able to get a drink on their way home.  The opening time fixed by the 1960 Act meant that people, particularly the farming community, had to wait around the town or village or publichouse in order to get a drink on a Sunday.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the question of the cost of the exemption order for fair days.  There are exemption orders available under the 1960 Act, particularly in rural Ireland, for fair days. The stamp duty is £3 and the solicitor's fees bring the price up to about £4.  I would suggest that the Minister should consider reducing the cost of these exemption orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By a variation of the hours of opening, not necessarily involving longer <Col N="1077" /> hours, it might be possible to arrive at a suitable arrangement.  At the moment, hours of opening are 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.  In my opinion, 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. would be more suitable.  There is the question of people coming from football matches or other sports meetings. These people are certainly entitled to a drink.  The difficulty could easily be overcome by giving an exemption for the area where the event is taking place.</P>
    <P>There is no holiday resort in my constituency but if the people in such districts feel they want longer hours of opening on Sunday, there is no reason why district justices should not be empowered to give an exemption to these areas for whatever period of the year they are required.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made about the position in Dublin and other large cities.  I do not think it is an answer for anybody to say that there is no obligation on a publican to open. I am a publican.  I do not open my premises on Sunday for the reason that I carry on a mixed business and if I were to open on Sunday, it would mean that I would have to try to get my whole staff in to work on Sunday and they would not be prepared to do it and I would not be prepared to ask them.  As a result, I lose a certain amount of business, due to the fact that other publicans in the town open their premises on Sunday.  It is not fair, therefore, to state that this is a matter entirely for the publicans in the area and that there is no obligation on them to open.</P>
    <P>If the Minister insists on the Sunday hours of opening he has proposed, I would ask him to consider the question of closing public houses for one hour on Sunday evening.  If it is intended to provide a 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. opening on Sunday, it would be a good idea, particularly in rural areas, to provide for an hour, say, from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., during which public houses should be closed.  That would suit the customers. It would mean that those drinking in public houses in the afternoon would have to leave at 6 p.m.  They and their wives would be afforded an opportunity of attending Church services. <Col N="1078" /> It would mean that they would be home for an evening meal.  In the case of the person who cannot control his own drinking, it would mean that if he were in the public house for the first session, he certainly would not go back for the second session.  The fact of his having to go home would prevent that.  As I said at the beginning, a person who is anxious to get drink or who is addicted to drink will get drink at any time, irrespective of the hours of opening of public houses we may provide.</P>
    <P>May I repeat that the recommendations received from the Pioneer Association should be given full consideration?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the reasoned statement of Deputy Reynolds.  It is a difficult matter for the Minister to meet everybody's point of view.  Even Deputy Reynolds and I could not agree as to the hours of opening.  I have had experience on both sides of the counter and have a reasonably good knowledge of the trade for 50 years.  The Minister should be congratulated on the courageous effort he has made to make the licensing laws such that they can be respected, obeyed and enforced without apology.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds suggested a third opening and closing on Sundays.  I wonder did he, as a publican, realise the dangers attaching to that suggestion? It would mean that a publican could lose his livelihood on one Sunday. There could be three convictions and three convictions would mean that his licence would be gone.  That would be a very serious matter.  If there is one thing more than another which prompted the Minister to provide the longer hours proposed, it is the fact that the penalties for breach of the law are now so severe.  There could be a conviction for failure to close the premises exactly at 2 o'clock and there could be a conviction for like failure at 10 o'clock.  If the Minister were to provide for an interim closing for one hour it would mean that there would be in all three closing hours.  That might prove fatal for some unfortunate member of the licensed trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> The 4 o'clock opening is, in my opinion, the one that commends itself to everybody who examines the position very closely.  I am not concerned with the cities or the towns to any appreciable extent.  We must try to legislate for rural Ireland because the pint of Guinness is one of the few amenities left to the older people anyhow. The people who go home from Mass or Divine Service on a Sunday will have their lunch and then go to the local to have a drink or two to which they are entitled.  You will not see those people again on a Sunday. The people who go out on Sunday afternoon at 4 or 5 o'clock and must return before 6 will very seldom be out again at 7 or 8 o'clock.  Another point is that in many of our rural parishes people will not accept new time.  They go by old time with the result that the 9 o'clock closing would in their eyes be only 8 o'clock.  That was altogether too early and there has been great resentment about that in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Reynolds was right when he said there is no obligation on anybody to open.  There is a severe obligation on them to close.  Any publican who does not want to open from 4 to 10 o'clock need not do so and many members of the licensed trade will not take advantage of the hours.  On the whole, however, if I had any say in it I would recommend the 4 o'clock opening to the House.  The man who has to do his work at home on Sunday, who, perhaps, cannot go to a hurling or football match because he has to attend to cattle, and so on, on Sunday afternoon will find these hours convenient.  I agree with Deputy Reynolds also that the exemption orders are altogether too expensive. The early morning fairs have gone to an appreciable extent and the trading to be carried on is on a very small scale.  Therefore, with a view to accommodating people early in the morning the Minister should see that the exemption orders do not exceed £1 or 30/-.  A charge of £4 by a solicitor puts it beyond the reach of most of these members of the licensed trade because it is almost impossible for them to earn that <Col N="1080" /> amount between 7 or 8 in the morning and 10.30.</P>
    <P>I conclude by complimenting the Minister on the courageous effort he has made to meet the wishes of rural Ireland.  I have no sympathy with the city.  There the licensed traders have a large volume of trade and a big turnover.  They have greatly enhanced profits on drink which the licensed trader in rural Ireland cannot have.  On the whole, the public houses in the city are doing reasonably well as the prices which they fetch will indicate.  On the other hand, the people in rural Ireland at the crossroad public houses find it hard to make a livelihood.  We must try to preserve the crossroad public house. The day it goes from Ireland then the last amenity is gone from the people who work hard on the land. If we do no other good by this measure than to make it possible for these people to go to the crossroad and have their drink in peace and comfort without risking backdoor methods, then this Bill will be worth while.</P>

      <P>I counted the number of times Deputy Davern congratulated the Minister and I think he did so on four occasions during his short contribution.  I recall that two years ago he congratulated the then Minister even more often for having resisted the argument that Deputy Davern just made to-night, because this Bill is repairing some of the loopholes that were in the 1960 Bill.  I recall the strong criticisms that we offered of the arrangements for the opening hours in the second session on Sunday and Deputy Davern was even stronger in the measure of the congratulations he extended to the Minister at the time in support of the hours that were then proposed and that were later made the law of the land.</P>

      <P>One could hardly recognise this as the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It must be borne in mind that we have before us a group of amendments with which we have been <Col N="1081" /> dealing for some hours.  The whole purpose of a Committee Stage is to give individual Deputies an opportunity of advancing suggestions for the improvement of the Bill.  Unfortunately, however, the Tánaiste came into the House to make one observation and that was that there was no need for the Minister to make any contribution on this section of the Bill on the Committee Stage because he said: &ldquo;Our policy is clear in the Bill itself&rdquo;, that the Deputies on that side of the House would be wasting the Minister's time and the time of the House in discussing it because the policy of the Government was set out in the terms of the Bill itself.  I do not think the Minister for Justice agrees with the point of view of the Tánaiste.  Before the Tánaiste came in the Minister agreed to examine an amendment to the Bill on the Report Stage.  The Tánaiste will probably clip the ears of the Minister for having done so because it is completely contrary to the observation of the Tánaiste that the Bill is perfect and cannot be improved by amendment. We have been some hours now discussing the Bill and various contributions have been made from both sides of the House.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not intervene before now.</P>

      <P>We had no trouble until the Tánaiste came in.  Deputy Davern made a novel contribution by saying that he supported the proposal to open at 4 o'clock on Sundays. Before the Bill was introduced and since it was circulated to Deputies and since the people heard the proposals, I did not meet one person who wanted the 4 o'clock opening on Sundays until Deputy Davern spoke.  On the night before the Bill was circulated I attended a meeting of vintners in the town in which I live.  It was a meeting of all the publicans of the town and Deputy Davern will probably appreciate the purpose of the meeting.</P>
      <P>When the work before the meeting was completed, the discussion came around to the Bill and they asked me if I knew what the new proposals were. I said I had no information beyond what had appeared in the Sunday papers.  That meeting was representative of all points of view but they were unanimous that they did not want opening up to 10 o'clock on Sunday nights.  They were also unanimous that under no circumstances did they want opening before 5 o'clock on Sunday evenings.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the Bill, we have had plenty of time to consult everybody involved and the agreement everywhere is that this is an outrageous extension of the hours for drinking on Sundays.  The argument is that people will have time enough to spend what they have to spend on drink.  The majority of people have just so much to spend and they like to spend it during the last hour.  They are inclined to come in and allow that much time for their drinking and if you extended the closing time to 12 o'clock they would not come in until 11 o'clock and would get out at 12 o'clock.  That is the habit among habitual drinkers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been trying to get the Government to amend the 1960 Act and to have a rearrangement of the hours of drinking on Sundays in order to facilitate people on Sunday afternoons. It should have been apparent to the Government when they brought in the 1960 Act that the hours in it were unsuitable for the rural areas and particularly so for the dairying areas. <Col N="1084" /> Other Deputies have said that in all the Munster counties the people in the dairying areas have to get back to their farmyards and work for some hours. Some of them have to work from day-break until early Mass time and they have to get back to it again in the late afternoons and evenings.  Up to now the licensed premises were closed by the time they finished work on Sundays.</P>
    <P>We feel that 10 o'clock on a Sunday evening is a reasonable closing hour. We know that it is not reasonable in the cities.  We know that the hours stated in our amendment are still over-long in relation to the cities but we are accepting that there should be uniformity. We know that the great volume of opinion in Dublin and Cork is in favour of 9 o'clock Sunday closing but we agree to the hour later in order to have uniformity in closing hours.  But there is no argument that can be advanced in favour of earlier opening hours, or for uniformity in opening hours.  We are not a uniform people and why cannot we facilitate some people in relation to some difference in the opening hours if it suits them in particular parts of the country?</P>
    <P>The 1960 Act made a fetish of uniformity.  The Minister has said that he does not regard the principle of uniformity as divine but he has departed from that stand in the present Bill.  We welcome what he is doing in relation to some things that were in the 1960 Act.</P>

      <P>One of his own Deputies spoke here tonight and asked the Minister to do two different things. The Minister has departed from the <Col N="1085" /> principle which he expressed with regard to uniformity on the 1960 Act in relation to the provision that where Divine Service was over before 12 o'clock there should be facilities to enable people to avail of Sunday morning opening because that was the one occasion during the week on which they had an opportunity to meet their friends and neighbours.  That was the normal practice in the country and it operated before the strict enforcement of the law with regard to Sunday closing.</P>
      <P>We welcome that little easing of the situation, but there you have a surrender of the principle of uniformity in the opening hours.  Now, if you have surrendered the principle on that, why not admit there are areas in the country in which there should also be a different opening hour on Sunday? We suggest there is no demand for this provision and I invite Deputies supporting the Government to tell us whether they have had, in their own constituencies, any support whatever for the Sunday four o'clock opening.</P>

If one fails to provide the service on Sunday afternoon, one's customers will go to the man who does provide it, and they will transfer their custom to him on the other nights of the week as well.  People want to live some life of their own. They do not want to be trapped behind a counter, without relief, until 11 o'clock or 11.30 p.m. six days of the week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not here in time to put the previous Minister right in relation to the hours suitable for agricultural workers. There are areas&mdash;tourist areas and holiday areas&mdash;and there are special occasions on which the hours the Minister says are perfect would not be suitable at all.  Discretion is usually given to a district justice to extend the hours to suit these areas on particular occasions.  It is not so long since we were listening to an eloquent disquistion on the responsibilities of the gentlemen who occupy the Bench. Now that we have decided to pay them more, I think we should give them this little additional job of work.  We should give them the responsibility&mdash;I am sure they would be capable of administering it justly&mdash; of deciding when special exemptions should be given.  In that way, tourist areas and holiday resorts would be catered for with hours in conformity with the requirements in a more suitable way than the hours proposed here.</P>
      <P>We are opposed to this extension. Apart altogether from the people who will be obliged to work these hours, and apart altogether from the people who want to drink at all hours, there are other sections of the community who must be considered.  The wives, the mothers of families, and the children have certain claims.  There are people unfortunately who, while the public house door is open, will just not go home.  Here we propose to give these people extended facilities so that they may have a longer time in which to abuse the privileges given to people in general.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin made the case for the city of Dublin.  Let us hope he is wrong in the picture he painted.  He said that people wanted hours which would enable them to get from the pub to the cinema and from the cinema back again to the pub.  I wonder do these people ever do any work, but, whether they work or not, surely they spend some time in their own homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>He was talking <Col N="1089" /> about Sunday.  Is it no longer proper for an Irish father to spend an hour in his own home with his wife and children? There is no doubt that this considerable extension of the hours on Sunday will lead to the breakdown of family life in a number of homes.  I do not say a great number of homes, but we all know that unhappy circumstances are created because the head of the family is not prepared to live up to his obligations.  We also know that people come to us from time to time to secure a medical card for the head of the family.  When we investigate the income we find there are three or four sons, earning good wages, living with the parents.  Yet, the father has to make this appeal to a public representative and he will prove that, substantial as the earnings of his sons are, the sons have no intention of helping to maintain him.</P>
      <P>The more we increase the facilities to the extent proposed in this Bill, the more we shall encourage them to spend less time with their families and to spend more time in dissipating their earnings over the Sunday when they could very well spend more time with their wives and families.</P>

It is too late in the cities but, for the sake of the principle of uniformity in relation to the closing hour, we are prepared to accept the 10 o'clock closing in the cities on Sundays. Unless the Government give way in relation to the second session on the Sunday, they will be in considerable trouble.

      <P>I think I am pretty conversant with the mind of the people in the constituency.  I have spoken to publicans and others since the 1960 Act was introduced.  Every publican and the majority of the people were anxious to have the 1960 Act amended.  Now, this Bill comes in.  As far as I can see at the present moment, the only way the Minister can please every member of this House is by permitting a complete opening of public houses day after day and night after night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position in the seaside resorts in South-east Cork from the town of <Col N="1092" /> Cobh to Youghal.  In addition, we have towns such as Buttevant, Doneraile and Mallow which benefit to a great extent by hurling and football matches in the afternoons.  The 4 to 10 p.m. opening will suit the interests of the publicans in those towns.  It would be hypocrisy on my part to say otherwise, having said so much about the Licensing Act during the recent general election.  I am not denying what I said.  The Licensing Act was not what the people required.  If I did not tell that to the Minister and say that there is a demand for its amendment, then it would be hypocrisy on my part and, as far as I am concerned, I am voting the Minister in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House already knows, the Labour Party decided that they would allow a free vote of its members.  We make no apology to anybody for that.  We do not think it is a sign of having no policy.  We think it is much better to do that than have the spectacle we had here tonight when at least one member of the Government Benches attacked the Bill very strongly but proceeded to say, because of his peculiar idea of democracy, that his Party decided they would vote for it and that that was that.</P>
      <P>However, a most extraordinary variety of arguments was put up here tonight.  At one stage, it looked as if it would be a case of the Pioneers versus the publicans.  I am speaking as a Pioneer.  I was not elected to this House as a Pioneer, nor were the publicans elected as publicans.  If they claim the right to speak as individuals &mdash;as they have claimed that right&mdash;and as publicans, then I think I have the right to put my point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is very definitely an argument in favour of the late opening on Sunday, I have found only one person in my constituency&mdash;a person whose opinion I value very highly, I may say&mdash;who says he considers that there should be longer hours on Sunday. When I asked him why, he pointed out that he would be working as a farm labourer until 7 o'clock and that by the time he got home, changed his clothes and got to &ldquo;the local&rdquo; it would be after 8 o'clock, by which time the public houses would be <Col N="1093" /> closed.  Therefore, he felt they should be open until 10 o'clock, which is exactly in line with my opinion.</P>
    <P>I believe the public houses should be open until 10 o'clock.  I do not believe they should open at 4 o'clock because it would be six long hours.  I do not care what anybody says: I think it is foolish to suggest that people would be able to stay in a public house and, if they had money enough to drink, drink from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m. and be able to continue to enjoy it.</P>
    <P>The local parliament has been mentioned. The local parliament would need to be better patronised than this Parliament and would need to have a lot more sense spoken in it if people could continue for six solid hours discussing local interests there.</P>
    <P>The question of seaside resorts has been mentioned.  I think people have a wrong idea about them altogether.  I live in a seaside resort, very close to Deputy Donegan.  While I agree that the argument is made from time to time that people who go to a seaside resort on a wet Sunday find it pretty <Col N="1094" /> awful if they must go out and stand around in the rain from 2 o'clock until the public house opens again at 5 p.m. &mdash;that argument has been made&mdash;I do not think it was ever suggested that the reason people go to a seaside resort is to go into a public house at 12 noon and stay there until 2, 7 or 10 p.m., until it is closing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>They are entitled to go and have a drink, very definitely, whether it is raining or not.  However, I do not think anybody would consider that that is a substitute for a day at the seaside.  I do not know if staying in a public house from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 10 o'clock at night in a seaside resort is a substitute for a day at the seaside.</P>
      <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28th June, 1962.</P>
