    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the dissolution, I am a little perturbed about the interim period.  What exactly happens in respect of that between 1955 and 1962?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The interim does not affect the interest.  The interest is calculated on the amounts that would be paid to Chelsea if the governors had continued in office but the fact is that the governors went out of office because there was no quorum left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 deals with chattels.  Has anybody told us or is information anywhere available as to what approximately they are&mdash;furniture, fittings, fixtures, pictures, books, documents and other chattels at present in the hospital?  Is there any considerable deposit of chattels in the old hospital building?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, the furniture and there are some pictures. I think we should regard some of them, at least, as having a sentimental value and there was some question of letting them go to Chelsea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Some question of their going?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The furniture would remain, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was not going, that the Minister was paying for it and keeping it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The furniture would remain here&mdash;all furniture and fittings of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is transferred to the Minister?  All chattels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then how can it go to Chelsea if it remains the property of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure about that.  There was discussion between both parties about some of these pictures. For instance, there is one picture of a pensioner who lived to be very old.  The others are pictures principally, I think, of kings and commanders-in-chief which they might like to have at Chelsea.  Perhaps they would not bother about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose is to give the Minister power under subsection (2) of Section 3 to give them to Chelsea if he so desires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we agree on that, yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister, if he was on this side of the House, raising Cain if I were proposing to do that.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do Sections 4 and 5 represent the total outlay by the Exchequer in respect of this transfer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  First of all, the £2,400 is the agreed figure of what the interest would amount to if the interest had been invested for some years and had gone on and accumulated interest again.  The total is about £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the stock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The stock remains in the new trust.  It is only the interest that goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as clear as mud to me.  There is nothing in the Bill that declares the new trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 (b) does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not declare it.  All it says is that we are going to make a new trust.  The purpose of Section 4 (b) is to set up a new trust but you have not said anything in the Bill about it, other than that it is to be charitable in the wide sense of the new Charities Bill.  It says that it is to be for the benefit of former members of the Defence Forces.  At some stage, this House should have the matter back to it for the purpose of possible review.  At the very least, I would suggest that the scheme should be laid on the Table of the House and should be subject to annulment within 21 days, as in the case of a statutory order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts have held these funds all through the years.  They have held the two sums of £6,000 and £4,000 obtained for the sale of these lands to the old Western Railway.  We are saying here that the Attorney General may ask the court to make a new trust but I do not know if we can <Col N="1652" /> compel the court to do more than suggest the purpose of the new trust.  It might go to some charitable purpose or for the benefit of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is leaving a discretion as to whether they will remain here or go to Chelsea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the interest goes to Chelsea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The opening words of Section 4 are permissive.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in that section can be either permissive or the equivalent of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  If the Minister takes the view that the High Court may not make a new scheme at all, then also the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is permissive as regards the £2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; may be taken as permissive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is permissive on both legs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we may assume that the court will have no objection to doing this, that they will do it and, if it helps Deputies, I see no objection to this scheme being laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we may refer to Section 3 in retrospect as it is closely linked with Section 4?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any precedent being established by giving the Minister power at his absolute discretion to dispose of any or all of such chattels by sale for the benefit of the Exchequer or by gift, exchange or loan?  I think it is rather an unusual power to confer on the Minister to dispose of public property by gift.  I fully understand that from time to time the Minister has power to lend public property, such as pictures to foreign art galleries but I never yet heard of a power to give away public property at his absolute discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pretty wide power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is.  I certainly could not quote any precedent for this <Col N="1653" /> but I think I am right in saying that if these pictures had been handed over in the course of the negotiations up to the present, there would be no question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not hesitate to give the Minister the power to give away old pictures of sentimental value to the Chelsea Hospital, if they wish to have them, but to give a general power to the Minister at his absolute discretion to dispose of all or any of the chattels by gift to anybody seems to me to go beyond what is necessary.  Is it a good precedent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important legal position with which I am not in a position to deal authoritatively. The Minister has power to dispose of other property in the possession of the Government and to mention it later in the Appropriation Account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can remember when I was Minister for Agriculture the question arose as to whether I could give somebody some of the surplus plants which were being thrown out of the Botanical Gardens.  I took the view that I had no power to give them to anybody, although I thought I ought to give them rather than have them thrown away.  However, I knew of no power that authorised me to give them to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that the Deputy could have done so and put a note in the Appropriation Account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have had to get some sort of authority, either <i>ante</i> or <i>post</i>.  This is looking for prior authority to give away public property and I never heard of it before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the pictures any good?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell you, but I am prepared to say that if there are pictures up there of sentimental value to Chelsea Hospital, in settling up an old matter of this kind, I would be in favour of giving them the pictures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1654" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are of sentimental value to the Chelsea Hospital, surely the Republican Party would not be too proud of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, what I am concerned with is to avoid giving the precedent by statute of conferring on the Minister the right to dispose of public property at his discretion by gift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is there specifically because it is trust property.  If it had not been trust property, I need not have put that in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If it has to be in the Appropriation Bill, there must be statutory authority for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be practicable to provide any record somewhere of any gifts the Minister deems it expedient to make under this power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; they will be noted in the Appropriation Account, even though I have this authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with the authority here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, even so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling me that in the Appropriation Accounts there will be a note that the Minister disposed of a portrait to Lieut.-Colonel Cholmondeley-Cholmondeley and one portrait to Brig.-General Fosdyke Marmaduke?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <P>Bill reported without amendment.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Stage of the Bill, may I inquire what it is intended to do with the Royal Hospital, now that all these matters have been cleared up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on the Second Stage that it is being given to the Museum, and the part of the building that is being renovated will be ready possibly within a year, in fact by the end of this year, that is, the chapel, diningroom, and so on.  The Museum are transferring their Folklore Section there and hope to enlarge it.  The remainder of the building will take a couple of years to renovate but the Museum will get it eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, instead of handing it over to any body, restoring it to the person who originally took it over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Fourth Stage.  If the Deputy wishes to say anything protracted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just for the record.  The Minister is going to hand this building over.  I think he should consider changing the trustee to the person who took it over.  I want to remind the Minister that the British War Office handed the Royal Hospital over to me in 1927 and that I was to retain it until such time as they asked it back from me.  They never asked for it back from me from that day to this. As far as the British War Office is concerned, it is still mine and I am responsible for the full stock in it; but the Board of Works and the Minister for Finance at a later date took it over from me without my consent.  They took it over arbitrarily; if I did not hand it over, the gratuity which the State paid to me and of which Fianna <Col N="1656" /> Fáil were making great play, would not be paid to me.  It is very interesting that the Minister can now make a gift to Lieut.-Colonel Cholmondeley-Cholmondeley and to Brig.-General Marmaduke but the Irish citizen is deprived of what is his undoubted right.  I would ask the Minister to look into that to see where I come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that Deputy MacEoin has made such an ironic gesture in inquiring what his rights are, the Minister ought to give us the true story of what the situation is.  This property belonged originally to the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, or a trust similar to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Similar, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;looking after the old soldiers of the British Army in this country.  On the establishment of the State, that purpose failed and these premises remain in the hands of the trust.  They then handed them over to us, through the person of Deputy General MacEoin, and he vested them at some stage in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Has Deputy MacEoin any papers to prove it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, of course, and I have a complete inventory of the stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now proposed to transfer the buildings and the surrounding grounds to the Museum.  I take it that before we hand them to the Museum, they will be put in a state of perfect repair and will then become an annual charge on the Museum Vote. Is it intended to ask the Museum to surrender any part of their premises here in Kildare Street in exchange for the new accommodation or is this to be additional accommodation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We had hoped, when these negotiations with the Museum started, to get part of this building they had on the way out to Merrion Street but, on investigation, it was found they could not afford to surrender any part of their present premises, that this would be needed <Col N="1657" /> for a Folk Museum which is practically non-existent at the moment. Therefore, there will be no relief at all of the congestion here.  They are still considering when they will transfer part of the present Museum in a couple of years' time when they get the remainder of the building.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress yesterday, I was making the point that we could not compete with the Continent or the Mediterranean as far as seaside weather is concerned but that we have other things they have not got, largely related to sporting activities.  I was saying a great advance had been made over the past number of years in this direction.  I mentioned coarse fishing and I expressed the view that most people here would not bother with it and I think somebody then said they certainly would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another kind of coarse fishing to which I would refer, deep-sea fishing, which has over the past number of years, by reason of various angling festivals, attracted visitors from France, <Col N="1658" /> England and from every part of the Continent to points along the west, east and south coast.  This sort of activity is good because it brings a large number of people at a particular time when the town and the hoteliers know they are coming and can look forward to them with certainly.  Indeed, during these festivals, I understand that private people in towns and villages have provided extra accommodation for travellers.  If the Minister can encourage that sort of thing as a direct contrast to advertising, it will attract more people and spread out the tourist season as far as possible.</P>
    <P>There have been sorry financial stories in connection with hotels which for two months of the year got fair business but were closed for the other ten. That used to be a profitable business but, having regard to the general overheads at the moment, it appears that it will start to become unprofitable unless a very high figure is charged for accommodation during those two months.  Perhaps, hoteliers do charge a high figure.  As it is, with the general overheads, they will soon have to charge a higher figure.</P>
    <P>There are opportunities in regard to hunting.  Many people will pay a very considerable sum of money to get out for a hunt.  There are pockets in the country where people can with certainty hire a horse which will be a sound animal and take them across the country to enjoy a hunt such as they cannot have anywhere else in the world.  In England, with certain individual exceptions, they never see a good ditch.  On the Continent fox-hunting, so far as I know, is practically extinct, except in parts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Paris, they hunt in parks.  In fact, there is nothing to compare with what is available in Ireland.  There are places here where horses can be hired.  In last month's issue of <i>Fáilte</i> there is an article about the Galway Blazers and about a family who do this business well.  People have come from America to Shannon. Before they arrive, arrangements are <Col N="1659" /> made whereby they can have this sport during the period of their stay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is good. It certainly expands our tourist trade. It is the sort of thing we can do not-withstanding the weather.  The Minister might consider trying to co-operate with travel agents to see if in places where there are recognised packs it would be possible to get farmers' sons interested in keeping a horse for hire or even hiring out their own horses.  The snag about doing this in a commercial way&mdash;I have tried to do it myself&mdash;is the old problem of supply and demand.  At Christmas, if one attempts to do this sort of thing, one has ten customers for the animal being rented out.  At other times, the horse is kicking his heels in the stall.  Efforts should be made to have the sort of packet holiday which, apparently, has been organised through some travel agents in the vicinity of Shannon and in the country of the Galway Blazers.  The whole thing could redound to the profit of the farmers and the farmers' sons who might like a bit of sport themselves.  It would also contribute to the expansion of the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The highly prized Irish Derby to be run next year at the Curragh was also mentioned in this debate.  One has only to refer to the present situation in relation to the National Hunt Festival at Cheltenham to realise the attraction that can be to people.  There are many Irish people at the moment in Cheltenham or on their way back from Cheltenham who are taking their annual holiday.  We could establish a much better spectacle if we got down to it.  It appears as if some philanthropic agency has to face up to it.  I should hate to think that our votes here would be made philanthropic agencies.  As a result of the activities of the Hospitals' Trust, the Irish Derby will be a wonderful spectacle this year and will attract people and horses from all over the world.  These people will bring with them thousands of other people.  In this regard, the Minister <Col N="1660" /> has a fertile field in which to extend the tourist season and bring profit to the country and the tourist industry generally.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the statistics supplied, I do not know what are the earnings from tourism.  It is a very difficult figure to get.  One has to take into account the numbers of people coming from across the Border and, in addition, the physical figure for what they spend and consume while in the country.  We just cannot pin the figure down.  It annoys me to hear people saying there are agriculture, industry and tourism.  By and large, if you go into a lot of detail, you can get the net earnings from industry.  If you go into less detail, you can get the figure for agriculture but when it comes to tourism you get to the point where it is lies, damn lies and statistics. I do not suggest that the figures indicate a bigger amount than is earned but they are not clinically accurate. They are figures that are adjustable but are open even to the opinion of the good people in the Statistics Office. For that reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has no evidence of that whatever.  He is charging the Statistics Office with issuing a fraudulent statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not boil up.  I did not interrupt the Minister.  If the people in the Statistics Office read what I have said, they will find that I did not charge them.  I said they were of necessity in the position that they had to relate the figures for tourism to what is spent.  What they base that opinion on I do not know. I should be interested to know how they can estimate what the average tourist spends here on consumer goods, food, drink and tobacco and travel which is related to him and not to the citizens of the country.  That must be charged to the credit side of the ledger when related to tourism.  Much of it has to be a matter of opinion.  That is not criticism of the people in the Statistics Office.  In fact, it is sympathy extended to them in their dilemma. Before I was interrupted by the Minister, I was not saying that tourism <Col N="1661" /> earned less than the official figure indicated.  I indicated that I did not rely on the figures, not because of any shortcomings in the people in the Statistics Office, but because of the fact that they were working in a most difficult medium.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would say that tourism is one of the enterprises with which we should press ahead.  If we do press ahead with it, we have got to have individual and new ideas related to sporting events and to the wonderful spectacles we have here; related also to our way of life and when we say way of life, it is no good going up the blind alley of what we think is good or cultural or educational or pleasant.  It is a question of what we find the Frenchman or the Englishman wants. If we can do that and so extend the period of our tourist trade from these two months in summer, which I believe in the future just will not produce profit, we will expand and achieve a greater contribution from this industry towards our national wealth than we get at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually when comment is made on the tourist industry, one gets something like a mutual admiration society.  Everybody agrees that everybody else is doing wonderful things for tourism.  The general impression is given that everything that possibly could be done to encourage tourists is being done, and as a matter of fact, has been done for a number of years, and that for that reason, there is no doubt that the tourist industry has been firmly established with the assistance of State bodies. Further, the impression is given that therefore there is not very much more that need be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  I agree with the last speaker when he queries how the figures, not only for tourists but for the amount of money spent by tourists, are compiled.  I feel it is out of a spirit of optimism that the people who compile the figures feel that everything is grand.  They are doing so well there must have been that amount of money spent and there must have been those numbers of people as tourists over the years.  I understand there is some type <Col N="1662" /> of card system used as a check at seaports and airports and from the figures thus acquired&mdash;whether they are right or wrong&mdash;they proceed to compile a set of figures which are then handed out as being the nearest thing to gospel we can get.</P>
    <P>Everybody who goes to the trouble of thinking about it will realise that the vast majority of people who come in here annually, during the summer period, at Christmas, or Easter, or any other time, are people who, having left this country, are returning for holidays.  There can be no doubt about that.  If some people like to regard those people as tourists, they are entitled to do so, but most of us welcome them back as brothers, sisters, uncles and friends coming to enjoy a short holiday with the money they earned abroad.  It is very unfair that anybody should try to class that type of person as a tourist.  I know these people themselves feel very strongly about it.  They feel that when they have dropped into the tourist class, they cease to be Irish people and are just people coming to a strange country for a holiday.</P>
    <P>There are a number of firms, organisations and individuals doing a lot for tourism in proportion to what is being spent by the Tourist Board. There is one industry&mdash;let us call it an industry because of the employment it gives&mdash;to which I shall refer, that is, a holiday camp in my constituency. Up to last year, they had a proportion of beds representing one-sixth of the entire bed accommodation in the whole country.  They are increasing their availability of beds this year by, I think, 25 per cent.  Those people have been encouraging tourists and attracting many people to this country on holidays and they do not get any money at all from the State or any tourist body for that purpose. They have got a grant for some of the amenities they provide in the camp.</P>
    <P>As far as their publicity is concerned, they have a system which could very well be copied by the Tourist Board.  They do not try to encourage millionaires to come here.  It is notorious that when millionaires or very <Col N="1663" /> well-to-do people come here for holidays, they come on what is known as package deals and spend very little of their money, no matter how much they may have, in the locality in which they spend their holidays.</P>
    <P>The firm to which I am referring send to England, to the towns and to the factories, and encourage ordinary working-class people to come here, people who will come to spend what they saved as their holiday fund.  They are coming here every year in increasing numbers.  If other people made the same effort, the number of genuine tourists coming here would increase enormously.  I know an individual who has a small amount of accommodation for boys and girls coming in parties of 40, 50 or 60.  That man has had inquiries from England and if he could accommodate all the people who sought accommodation, the figures would run very close to 1,000 this year. He cannot do it.  The main reason he cannot is that he has been negotiating for the past six or seven years for a grant and so many strings are attached to it that by the time he gets it, if he ever does, he will be a very old man with no further interest in tourism.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Tourist Board were sincere in their efforts to attract genuine tourists, they would endeavour, without long drawn out and protracted negotiations, to assist the small hoteliers, particularly in the country towns and seaside villages and towns, who are so anxious to build up accommodation, first of all, to make a living for themselves and secondly, in doing so, to accommodate tourists who are anxious to come here.  My main point in speaking on this Supplementary Estimate is to point out that if those people to whom I have referred can find it possible in their limited way to contact not tens or hundreds but thousands of people anxious to come as tourists, then surely a body such as Bord Fáilte should be able to do very much more.</P>
    <P>There are a number of grants available for amenities at seaside resorts and I should like to ask the Minister to explain what system is adopted in <Col N="1664" /> the selection of the seaside resorts to which the grants are to be allocated. We all know there are seaside resorts throughout the country&mdash;I make particular reference to my own constituency where we have the East Meath coast, one of the safest in the country&mdash;in respect of which it is apparently impossible to get amenity grants of any kind. Perhaps there is a key of access to such grants and perhaps the Minister will let us into the secret when he is replying of how some of the large amounts of money being spent in this way could be channelled into areas such as those to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>There is a great shortage of the small type of hotels catering for the ordinary type of tourist.  The accent seems to be on the bigger, plush hotel, the one that can supply everything for very high charges.  We seem to forget that the vast majority of the tourists who come here are working-class people and we would be less than honest if we suggested that those people in their own homes were used to the amenities supplied by those plush hotels.  What those people need are clean, comfortable hotels at cheaper rates.  I think it is time Bord Fáilte realised that and made available to the smaller hotels throughout the country some assistance to help them to improve their accommodation.</P>
    <P>I remember a few years ago a hotelier in an English town succeeded in getting a very large number of people interested in coming across to Dublin to be accommodated in the same type of hotel as he was running &mdash;one of the moderate hotels where, perhaps, certain people would not like to dine.  It was a very nice little place where comfortable accommodation was provided at a reasonable charge. Bord Fáilte were asked if they would be prepared to assist in the promotion of such hotels and one of the senior officials of the board was asked to meet this gentleman in this hotel.  He did not turn up.  This man came all the way from England but there was nobody there to meet him and a phone call elicited that the board were not interested.</P>
    <P>It is too bad that Bord Fáilte, or any other State-aided body, should <Col N="1665" /> have so little regard for the plain people&mdash;for the person who is prepared to spend £50 or £100 on his holiday and who wants to get good value for that money.  I submit to the Minister that such people should be catered for, because, after all, they form the backbone of our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country during the tourist season, and occasionally during the off season, we find certain hoteliers increasing their charges.  I know Bord Fáilte do everything they can to remedy that.  To be fair to Bord Fáilte, they have made attempts to straighten this out but there are still people in cafés, hotels and souvenir shops who make every effort to extract the last halfpenny possible from the unfortunate people who have to depend on them for service.  It was said here recently that people mulcted in this way are not likely to come again after the treatment they get.  While saying this, I should like to emphasise that there are very many establishments who go out of their way and bend backwards to be decent to tourists. However, it is the duty of somebody &mdash;of the Minister and the people he controls &mdash; to make a big effort to remove these blots, to deal with the people who do such a lot of harm to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>In most of the tourist guides one picks up nowadays, one finds all the information required about such things as the all-Ireland final, or an international match at Dalymount Park, but very little about the local events which really are representative of the Irish way of life.  I have travelled a bit and when I go into a foreign country, I do not immediately rush to the capital: I am more interested in seeing how the people of the area I intend to visit live, enjoy themselves, and what national sports they participate in.  I suggest that much more publicity should be given to events at local level here.  There is not a Sunday afternoon when there is not a Gaelic match, soccer game, golf tournament or tennis match in any part of this country, but very little information about these events is <Col N="1666" /> given to tourists.  That situation should be remedied.</P>
    <P>The question of the type of tourist who comes here is a matter which must be fully analysed.  If the Minister goes to the trouble of finding out the types of persons who come here and catering for their tastes rather than for the tastes of those he would like to come, he will be doing a good job. In this respect, I should like to refer briefly to the monthly magazine issued by Bord Fáilte.  A good improvement has been made in it recently and I should like to compliment those responsible.  At one time, they seemed to be under the impression that Ireland consisted of a narrow strip from Killarney, missing the country around it, and coming down at Achill and then up to Donegal.</P>
    <P>That attitude has been changed and we now find in this magazine quite good pen pictures of places of interest in all parts of the country.  Those responsible for that magazine are doing very well.  I hope they will keep it up and see that the tourist literature generally, apart altogether from that magazine, is improved.  There should be available to prospective travellers in this country maps showing not only Killarney and the other better known places but some of the lesser known places like Tramore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the Boyne Valley. The Boyne Valley has been neglected by the Tourist Board.  One of the most historic towns in this country is Trim but it seems to be completely neglected by everybody, including C.I.E.  I suggest it is worthy of greater consideration, particularly in view of the number of ancient monuments there on which very large amounts money have been spent over the years. It would be a very good idea if detailed information were made available about such places to people visiting them for the first time.  I include in this,  course, Navan and Kells.  If people came here once, I have no doubt they would come back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Boyne Valley is beautiful, and <Col N="1667" /> much more attention should be given to it in the publications issued by the Tourist Board.  I know that people here and elsewhere will produce a single document showing a reference to Trim or Tramore and say: &ldquo;There is the evidence that we are giving publicity to those places.&rdquo;  It is a fact that in a great number of the documents that are issued places like that are not completely ignored.  As a matter of fact a document was issued to a travel agency some years ago by the Tourist Board in which there was some extraordinary geography.  Towns and villages were moved around and some places which we in the country districts are very proud of were completely ignored. I understand that document has been changed since but I am amazed at that type of document in which so many of the places which are available to the Tourist Board are completely ignored.  They moved towns like Mornington and Laytown into Louth, and other towns were moved into the neighbourhood of Dublin.  I know those are small matters but they are details which should not be allowed to pass, and whoever is responsible for editing those documents should at least ensure that they are correct.  I understand that one of them listed a ball-room which had been closed for about 20 years.  I wonder what a traveller who came 10 or 15 miles to attend a function there would say when he found that it had been turned into a fisherman's hut.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the House unduly.  The Minister should remember that (a) the majority of the people who come to this country annually are returning home on holiday and would come here anyway, and that therefore it is unfair to classify them as tourists and try to take the credit for bringing them here; and (b) the best spenders in the tourist industry are the people who have earned their money the hard way and are coming for a few weeks holidays.  Those are the two points that should be remembered, and they are the people for whom we should cater.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>All sides of <Col N="1668" /> the House will agree that one of the greatest potentials for expanding our economy is the tourist trade.  That is very evident from the fact that there is increasing demographic pressure in all countries at the moment.  The great advantage Ireland has to offer to a tourist is that he can have a holiday during which, if he brings his motor car, he will not be driving bumper to bumper along the main roads, as happens in other countries.  He can get out into the open spaces away from the crowds and enjoy himself, and have a leisurely and restful holiday here.  That is a point that should be repeated and stressed not only at home but everywhere abroad.</P>
      <P>I do not think due attention is paid to the question of advertisements abroad.  If you go into any railway station in this country you will see advertisements for practically every European country stuck up here and there.  Even countries as far away as Scandinavia and Holland have their amenities advertised on posters in every station.  It is my experience, from travelling quite a good deal abroad and in the United Kingdom, that there is not sufficient advertising of the beauty spots of Ireland.  Admittedly, one sees advertisements for Killarney and Donegal, and sometimes there is a passing reference to Connemara, but those places are well known to tourists, and have been known for a number of years, and some of those advertisements have been in existence for the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
      <P>We have something to offer to the world today that everyone is looking for, that is, a place to which they can get away to lead a peaceful life or have a restful holiday.  That is a point that should be stressed in our advertisements. We should also have more advertisements abroad.  A bigger sum of money should be voted in this House to ensure that our tourist facilities are made known to the outside world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the previous speaker said, we should cater for all sections.  We must cater for the better-off type of tourist who brings quite a lot of money here. We must have more hotels with bathroom facilities such as they have in <Col N="1669" /> other countries, because that is what the better-off type of tourist is looking for.  He is prepared to bring his family and spend money here, and he is looking for the more exotic type of facility: for hunting, race meetings and the better type of fishing available on our rivers, such as salmon fishing, apart from coarse fishing.</P>
    <P>We must also be mindful of the middle-class tourist who has not a tremendous amount of money, but has a certain amount which he is prepared to spend.  We must have good hotel accommodation available for them not only in Kerry, Donegal and Connemara and a few places like that, but everywhere. We must cater for that type of person with guest houses.  There are guest houses all over Ireland, on the west coast, the south coast and the east coast and in some of the more attractive inland places.  There are even a few in the Boyne Valley, in the Slaney Valley, and in Wexford.  The middle-class tourist should be catered for and encouraged to come here.</P>
    <P>As the previous speaker also mentioned, the working-class person is also a potential tourist and a very good spender.  The working-class tourist comes here from the United Kingdom. In fact, the bulk of our tourist traffic comes from there.  The United Kingdom is close to us and we have a common language.  Working-class tourists want to know where to go and to be advised where to go.  They must be informed that there is hotel accommodation available for them in Kerry, and in the less well-known places. When that type of person decides to go on a holiday he works out his plan of campaign beforehand.  Bord Fáilte could advise him by having data available showing where he could have a holiday which would meet his particular requirements.</P>
    <P>When I am travelling I always look in hotels for literature about Ireland and I find it very difficult to get it. When I go into a hotel I see on a table a huge accumulation of literature dealing with the tourist potential in many parts of Europe but I have never seen in a European hotel any literature dealing with Ireland.  We <Col N="1670" /> now have a tourist development agency in Wexford which was opened by the Director of Bord Fáilte.  The last time I was going abroad, I got some literature there and dumped it everywhere I could.  I dumped it in a hotel in Strasbourg, in a hotel in Paris, and in a hotel in Rome.  I left it in railway stations and depots frequented by travellers.  I had the opportunity of returning to the hotels in Strasbourg and Paris and I found that although I had given them a sizeable amount of material, it was all gone.</P>
    <P>Therefore&mdash;the idea of Germany occurs to my mind&mdash;would it not be to the advantage of Bord Fáilte to send an agent abroad, not to post up notices, but to dump literature about Irish tourism in the numerous hotels? Ireland has been on the map to a considerable extent in recent years, as we have been participating in international events and councils and the major return from that, apart from national prestige, should appear in tourism. Therefore, it is worthwhile for the Minister to consider having an official or agent, or establishing agents, in foreign countries, paying them nominal fees, to try to put out literature about Irish tourism in hotels abroad.</P>
    <P>I think <i>Irish Travel</i> is a very well-produced journal which is improving as time goes on.  I do not know its circulation: the Minister might be able to indicate it, when replying.  It seems there is an enormous potential for circulating that journal in every possible country.  If we had agents doing that work, it would be of great advantage. I do not think <i>Irish Travel</i> is sold&mdash;Deputies get a free copy of it&mdash; but even if it is, if there were agents to dispose of it, without remuneration to the producers, the resultant dissemination of knowledge about Ireland would be great incentive to tourists to come here.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may not be able to do anything about the difficulties of travel agencies, I want to mention a recent case where a person asked me about the prospects of setting up a travel agency in a part of the country where I felt it would be very desirable. I endeavoured to find out for him the <Col N="1671" /> means by which he could become a travel agent, with an agency for one of the airlines, such as Aer Lingus, or for shipping companies trading to this country.  I found would-be agents had to surmount almost insuperable difficulties and that, in fact, it is not possible to get an agency unless one is already established as a tourist agent. Perhaps Bord Fáilte could come to the rescue.  If Deputies or others likely to hear of people seeking agencies were to get in touch with Bord Fáilte, does the Minister feel that would help people to get agencies in different areas?  That would mean more package deals.  These new-founded agencies, I understand, are now free to do package deals for people going out from here and perhaps what I suggest would mean that people could come in under package deals also.  Perhaps the Minister would consider these matters.</P>
    <P>The first duty of every Deputy after his duty to the National Parliament is to his constituency.  In my constituency there are extremely beautiful places which are not advertised.  People must know of them but the world generally, and intending tourists, do not.  Coming out of New Ross along the River Barrow, which is a well-wooded expansive river, there is perhaps one of the most beautiful parts of Ireland.  I suggest to the Minister that, so far as he has a right of direction in the matter, he should ask <i>Irish Travel</i> when producing their next issue to include a few photographs of this area.  I was amazed some years ago to discover what a beautiful place it is. The river is entirely navigable and it occurred to me that such places as that are completely over-developed for tourism in every other country.  It would be quite possible to have a considerable tourist development of our inland waterways.  Admittedly, there has been some attempt at development and I understand that on the lake which connects with the Shannon at both ends, Lough Derg, there is already a certain amount of traffic, but a big drive should be made for these waterways generally.  They offer a very relaxing holiday, providing an alternative <Col N="1672" /> to anxious driving of cars.  The areas I have mentioned should be given favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>There are many other beauty spots in the South of Ireland which are practically unmentioned in any publicity. Sometimes they receive casual notice as, for instance, in connection with the Wexford Festival.  That festival has a tourist potential but not in the same sense as scenery that could retain its appeal throughout the tourist season.</P>
    <P>The value of the stakes for the Irish Derby this year has been mentioned as a tourist attraction.  I fully agree but I should like to put this to the Minister: we have the best steeple-chasers in the world.  Every famous steeplechaser was bred in Ireland and practically every steeplechaser had his nursery training in chasing on the point-to-point field.  I suggest it would be of advantage to Bord Fáilte to sponsor a steeplechase for horses that have run in point-to-points, not necessarily in Ireland, but anywhere.  I think there is a big opening for that.</P>
    <P>I have tried to convey that I am happy about any efforts that have been made by Bord Fáilte.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the points I have put to him.  By doing what I have suggested, the advantages of tourism will be more widely disseminated.  That is what we want to see.  We want every area to get its share because every area has a tourist potential.  Through the Minister, I ask the Bord Fáilte officials to concentrate as much as possible on the development of small areas because the time will come, and it is not too far off, when people everywhere will become more travel-minded and we shall have opportunities of dealing with these people and we must have accommodation to offer.  The accommodation in the big centres will not be sufficient. It will be needed all over the country.</P>

      <P>Bá mhaith liom cúpla fochal a rá maidir leis an Meastachán seo.  It is gratifying to notice the very deep interest being taken on all sides of the House in tourism.  It is encouraging because tourism is a very important arm of our economy.  It is not so long since An Tostal was founded but it did not get the reception I thought it <Col N="1673" /> should have got at the time.  Since then things have changed a great deal and people have come to realise that tourism is a very important money-spinner. There is a lack of knowledge abroad about the facilities available for people who visit this country.  Many of the maps supplied to tourists are out of date.  Railways are shown on them that do not now exist and these maps should be brought up to date as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Something should be done to induce more of our own people, our exiles, to return.  They may wish to come here but they fear that if they do, there will be no accommodation for them.  We should cater more for the ordinary type of person and provide the accommodation they need.  My experience of visiting hotels is that there are too many porters and pages and too much swank in them.  Unless a person is armed with a bagful of golf clubs, he does not get the attention that is often provided for snobbish foreigners who come here to sneer at our way of life.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that we should not extend all the courtesy we can to the wealthy people who come to our shores but it would be wrong for us to ignore the plain people.  There should be accommodation and a welcome for the plain people, and particularly for our own exiles.  They should be met with friendliness and with courtesy and we should have for them the ordinary accommodation they require.  There is no need for so much lavishness but we should try to bring it home to our own exiles that we have progressed considerably in the past 40 years, that we have fairly decent houses, guest houses and small hotels and that we can provide adequate accommodation for them.  If we did that, we would add considerably to the number of people coming into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing any tourist will look to is the food.  If he is satisfied with the food given, he may afterwards, by way of relaxation, go out to look at the scenery; but if he is not satisfied with the food and the cooking, it would take a great deal of scenery to convince him that this country is a paradise for tourists.  I do not think there is any great necessity to have menus in <Col N="1674" /> French.  Not all the plain people can afford to spend a fortnight or a month in France and not all of them have the advantage of a secondary school education to make themselves proficient in French.  Our approach to the matter should be to have our menus in our own language and, if there is need for a second language, in English.</P>
    <P>A very old established firm in this country, Messrs.  Guinness, are not ashamed or afraid to advertise their products in the national language. They deserve every encouragement for doing so.  I know that horse racing, tennis and golf have an attraction for a certain type of person, but quite a number of our people who had to go to England or America to earn a livelihood had not much practice at horse racing or tennis or golf.  It is our Irish Ceilidhes, our Irish concerts and feiseanna that we should publicise for these people.  More publicity should also be given to the new tourist resorts. People who are used to seeing the old hackneyed seaside names should be made aware that there are inland places where they can get reasonable accommodation for holidays.</P>
    <P>It would not be a bad idea if, when the housing programme is nearly completed, some attention could be given to the building of an additional room to farmers' houses in the coarse fishing areas so that people interested in that sport could come there and bring their families with them.  Development associations have done quite a lot in recent years but there seems to be duplication in the brochure material. Very often, the brochures issued for Donegal or Galway, showing a man catching a fish, show the same man catching a fish in Kerry or elsewhere in the south.  Tourists catch on to these things so a national brochure should be published.</P>
    <P>It is very important for us to get home to the ordinary people that we have made advances, that our standards of living have improved, that our accommodation has increased and that we welcome people who are willing to come amongst us and spend their money.  We should let it be known that we will do everything we can to help them enjoy their holidays.  There <Col N="1675" /> is too much moaning and groaning about the Irish weather from everybody we meet in town and countryside. People are too often inclined to give the impression to the foreigner that it is always raining in this country and that when it is not raining, it is snowing.  Our climate is nice and suitable and it is a pity that some of the people who talk like that have not travelled more extensively abroad so that they could see what the weather in foreign places is like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>My own ideas on tourism were shattered recently.  I happened to be in Achill in the summer time and saw a tremendous number of people there, so I thought the hoteliers in Achill must be doing rather well.  I was there much more recently at a meeting and we were assured that the people are not doing so well at all. We were informed that the smaller hoteliers in Achill could not avail themselves of the loans and grants being made available by Bord Fáilte and that they were not being treated at all reasonably, with the result that the accommodation which was so necessary could not be provided.  They also said that any scheme sponsored by Bord Fáilte in that area, or about to be sponsored, was designed in a way which did not suit the local people or meet the ideas of the people there who were trying to develop tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, like Telefís Éireann, are trying to face in two directions.  As far as their activities in the west are concerned they do not seem to know what way they are going.  They seem to be set on a course to meet the requirements of millionaires.  Even though there may be a great many millionaires in the world they are still in a minority. I would point out to the Minister and to Bord Fáilte that millionaires are millionaires simply because they save their money, not because they spend it. There would be a great many more millionaires if more people saved their money in the way some of these people do who come here for a cheap holiday. They do not come here to spend.  The person who comes here to spend money <Col N="1676" /> is the person who has family ties with this country.  These are the people we should cater for and instead of building colossal hotels in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and elsewhere we should make reasonable facilities available in the rural areas and along the west coast where people would go if hotel accommodation were available. No matter what type of advertising we do, it is no use our hoodwinking ourselves that we are bringing in large numbers of non-nationals. Even though Bord Fáilte seem to be anxious to give money to big hotels, I can assure them there are many &ldquo;religious&rdquo; cooks in these hotels and a lot of what they produce is either a sacrifice or a burnt offering.  If they were not as anxious about sending out inspectors and were more practical they would achieve better results.  They will send down to the west some damsel with a painted face, perhaps with her stockings on inside out, to dictate to the ordinary man in the country who knows his business far better than she does.  Most of these inspectors have no experience of human beings at all. The ordinary person coming to the country for a holiday does not carry a bag of golf clubs or some other status symbol.  However, he has one symbol which is of importance to the hoteliers and the business people of this country, that is the dollar bill or the pound note.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand how Bord Fáilte or anyone else, in computing returns for tourist traffic, can discriminate between money spent by tourists and money which represents emigrants' remittances.  It is impossible to do it.  I believe the two have just been mixed together and that the figures are being used to reduce the figure for emigrants' remittances and to boost the figure for the amount allegedly coming from tourism.  I do not believe the number alleged to come here come at all.  Apparently the weather does not matter because the worse the weather the more tourists we get.  No reduction is ever shown.  Some proper method of computing the exact expenditure of tourists should be devised.  Bord Fáilte should turn their minds to the ordinary person who comes here on holidays rather than <Col N="1677" /> build luxury hotels which may be fine white elephants in a small number of years.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte does very little to develop sea fishing.  Sea fishing along the west coast can be a terrific attraction because we have the finest fishing grounds in Europe.  There are people down there who could throw a line from their beds and catch fish.  There is a dance hall where you can fish from the balcony.  No effort is being made to advertise fishing facilities or to provide further facilities for fishing.  If we in the West apply for a grant or loan to Bord Fáilte we are circumvented by red tape: we must employ certain architects and contractors; we must do everything according to the book.  One would think it was the Bible we had to follow or that Bord Fáilte were infallible. If they send any broadminded sane person down to the west of Ireland he will very soon find that their standing is not very high.  I would ask them before they do more harm in that part of the country to make every effort to discover the real requirements of the people of the West and help the people to meet those requirements.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies have mentioned the Irish weather and that is the reason I am on my feet.  I would take the Minister to task about the advertising of Bord Fáilte in regard to my constituency and the south-east of the country generally.  Day in and day out we are told that the West has the best of everything.  Just now we were told they have the best fishing.  We have some claim in that regard.  There was more fish caught in Dunmore in the last five years than was caught in all the other ports in Ireland together. There is better deep sea and game fishing off the south coast than in any other part of Ireland.  As far as salmon fishing is concerned, we have the famous Blackwater, the Suir, the Barrow and the Nore, four great rivers in the south-east of Ireland.  There is not enough advertising of these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the weather is concerned, the records of the Meteorological Office show beyond doubt that for years and years the south east of Ireland has the lowest rainfall and the greatest numbers of hours of sunshine in this country. <Col N="1678" /> The ancient people of Ireland knew that because the first name the estuary of Waterford had from them was &ldquo;the harbour of the sun.&rdquo;  These are the things that should be advertised and stressed.  I am getting a little tired even of the songs about the Hills of Donegal, the Kerry Dancers, Galway Bay, Moonlight in Mayo.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Mooncoin is not so bad at all, where they have good hurlers, good men and good dogs. These are the things that should be mentioned.  A good deal has been said about fishing.  A great number of people have been attracted to fishing because of something with which the Tourist Board had nothing to do, the Inland Fisheries Trust, that was established by the Leader of my Party, Deputy Dillon.  That has brought us and will continue to bring us many tourists.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress the value of coarse fishing.  Every Deputy who has spoken agreed that it is the ordinary working man who comes from Great Britain who is our biggest tourist potential.  These men have no big cartons of trout or salmon fly.  They would love to fish.  Some of them never did very much fishing and some of them never did anything in the way of fishing beyond throwing a line into the canals full of tin cans and old beds.  They would love to come here for coarse fishing if they knew where to go.  There is great coarse fishing to be had all along the Irish coast.  In the vicinity of Tramore and the Waterford estuary there is wonderful fishing. There are wonderful fishing opportunities at Woodstown.  That never appears in a folder.  I would draw the Minister's attention to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the Tourist Board for saying that we should have great hotels.  They should have everything that the great international hotels of the world have.  It is good for the prestige of the country to have these hotels.  I never felt that more than when I was in exile and met a man who had left Ireland.  This man <Col N="1679" /> went to a great American city and became a very great man.  When he came home to Ireland, I brought him to a hotel and he said: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, the hotels here are as good as any.&rdquo;  These things count.  Even though not many people go to these hotels, they add to the prestige of the country.</P>
    <P>Let me speak of the ordinary boarding house keepers.  Many of these people, without the aid of any grants, have done up their houses.  They might have only two or three rooms.  They put on hot and cold water.  They installed new bathrooms.  I know several such houses to which the people come back again. They like to stay at these places.  Even wealthy people come to stay at these places, not because they want a cheap holiday, but because they can enjoy the Irish way of life.  For a tourist the best way he can get it is to stay at an ordinary good boarding house where he will have up-to-date accommodation and reasonably good cooking based on Irish dishes which are traditional in the area.</P>
    <P>These small boarding houses find it hard to get on the register of Bord Fáilte.  It would be reasonable to add another section to the register outside the ordinary guesthouses.  I would appeal to the Minister and the officers of Bord Fáilte to include ordinary boarding houses.  These people know their business and they are open to any kind of inspection.  I would make a special point of asking the Minister and the officers of Bord Fáilte to make a note of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan spoke about hunting in Ireland and bringing people to this country to hunt.  I had some experience of that.  You do not bring many people by that means but I suppose it is good for prestige.  These people would come anyway.  We have an idea that there is no hunting like our hunting.  The Deputy mentioned the Galway Blazers and other packs. I brought a very good hunting man to another part of the country and I asked him what did he think of it.  He said he could ride over it on a bicycle.  In the south-east of the country we have great packs and great hunting.  We have the Kilkenny <Col N="1680" /> hounds, the Waterford hounds, the Wexford and Tipperary hounds.  I would stand these packs up against any pack in the world.  They ride over every kind of obstacle and that is what the Englishman wants.  In his own country the terrain tends to become monotonous.  In Ireland, on the other hand, there are all classes of obstacles&mdash;stonefaced fences, single fences, brook banks, double banks, single banks and, sometimes, gaps. There are plenty of sceachs thrown in which will test the hearts of both horses and huntsmen.  These are the things they come to Ireland for. Before I sit down, let me say it is good to have Deputies saying that we want to bring English people here in view of the fact that only a few short years ago I heard people sitting in the front benches of Fianna Fáil saying that we were selling our steaks for paper.  I shall mention their names if the House wishes.</P>

      <P>It took an awful long time to get going.  I do not see much advertising in relation to the constituency from which I come.  The people there have done commendable things. A small group of people got together in Waterford and started the Waterford festival.  There was an opera <Col N="1681" /> festival in Wexford and another in Cork.  I believe there is a festival in Dublin.  The Waterford festival attracted more tourists than the whole lot of them put together.  The Tourist Board admits that.  The Tourist Board helped them.  That is good but I want to draw the attention of the Board to my constituency and the city of Waterford. When they are running something, they run it in a commendable way.  It is not merely a matter of coming to look at the handfuls of money, with no chance of getting the money back.</P>
      <P>The Tourist Board gave the Waterford Light Opera Festival a very small amount of money.  When officers of the Department came to Waterford during the festival, they found the streets of Waterford full of people from Wales and England who had come to follow the fortunes of the various amateur light opera companies in the festival. Not only did they stay there but they came back for their holidays.  Many of them stayed in the small boarding houses in the neighbourhood in Tramore and Dunmore.</P>
      <P>As far as scenery is concerned, it would appear from the advertising that if one wants to see scenery in Ireland, one must go to the West.  I would say to the people to come to the south-east.  I mentioned this before, that if one is going to the West, one has the Shannon.  There is a boat going up and down the Shannon, which is very commendable.  It is a very nice run, but when you have had it once, you have had it for always.  In Waterford, there are the Suir, Nore and Barrow, all joined together.  There could be no public conveyance put on that stretch but I remember when there was one and the boat was taken away during the 1914-18 war and sunk and it was never replaced.</P>

      <P>It is no harm to mention it.  In the south, we have the wonderful scenery of the Blackwater; we have the wonderful antiquities of Ardmore, the wonderful antiquities of <Col N="1682" /> Waterford, Kilkenny and Cashel; we have all the historical places in Wexford, the marvellous trip from Waterford, through New Ross along this island-studded drive across to Inistioge and on to Jerpoint.  Everywhere you get history, tradition and beauty.  As far as folders are concerned, I agree with Deputy Esmonde that they are very good but a greater subvention should be given to the people turning them out so that they can turn out more of them and place them in cities abroad.</P>
      <P>The Board has been criticised from time to time in regard to the money they gave for Bunratty.  I commend them for that.  They have got publicity, and good publicity, for Ireland and Irish tourism because of it.  I suppose they have got thousands of pounds worth more in publicity than the actual amount they spent on it. I would urge the Board to keep doing things like that which draw attention to Ireland from all over the world.  I hope that because of these moneys Waterford and the south-east, Tramore, Kilkenny and Wexford, will appear more often in the folders of the Tourist Board.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and his Department on the development work and the work generally which they have been doing for the airports and for tourism.  I am pleased that it is a man like the Minister, who has such wide experience and great vision and imagination as to the potentialities of these two specific items who is in charge of this Department.  We can be proud of the efforts made up to now on the development of our airports. We have been spending considerable sums at Shannon recently to keep it up to international standards and this money has been spent on runways, administrative buildings and other improvements.  I hope that this programme of expansion will carry us on for quite a number of years.  I know how difficult it is to plan adequately for an ever-developing traffic and this appears to have been the experience of our airways and airports during the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> Anybody looking at the records would be hard put to imagine that when they started, they would have developed so rapidly and so successfully. For that, all concerned merit the nation's congratulations and support. A recent airport built and developed is Cork.  It was long overdue and was very necessary.  Cork is a very important gateway to Ireland and the Airport there should develop the outlook of the people of Cork.  It is the second city in the country and is fast developing both industrially and in many other ways.  Considerable sums of money have also been spent on Dublin Airport and continue to be spent. This Airport must now compare favourably with any of its size in Europe.</P>
    <P>I hope that planned expansion is coming to an end and that we shall have an opportunity of seeing that the money spent on these Airports has been well spent.  These Airports are the first places in Ireland which visitors see; they are the first points which returning emigrants see; and it is encouraging for them when they return from abroad to be shown a well-designed, well-serviced and well-organised airport. This shows the people who have left the country that there is something more in Ireland than they thought.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many young boys and girls from my own part of the country and I was appalled when they told me, after being away for 15 or 16 years, they had never seen Ireland at all.  All they had done was take a train to Dublin and Dún Laoghaire. All they saw of the countryside was the inside of the railway station at home and of the Dún Laoghaire station before they carried their bags on to the boat.  Coming back after a few years, with the confidence and sophistication gained abroad, they have expressed surprise at the development that has taken place since they went away, and indeed before they left.  For that reason alone, I would advocate good design and brighter buildings, good administration and service.</P>
    <P>In the matter of our airport development, I agree with the Minister that he has probably gone as far as <Col N="1684" /> present circumstances and needs permit. However, if one looks at a map of Ireland, one will see the need, sometime in the future, for a further airport.  I draw attention particularly to the north-west, and I think probably somewhere near Sligo would suit. This would serve all the north-west, including Donegal, and I know the Minister will bear that in mind when it comes up.</P>
    <P>Air traffic and airports are peculiarly associated with tourism.  It has been emphasised in this House, and I hope I will be forgiven if I re-emphasise it, that tourism is looked upon by every Deputy as one of our leading industries.  Moving as we are into the European field of operation and competition, and matching our best against their best, there is one field where our people can really excel&mdash;the traditional hospitality and welcome they accord to anybody from any country in the world.  They encourage people to come to this country, to consume what we produce here.  This trend should be followed up with the utmost vigour.</P>
    <P>Great steps have been taken in the promotion of tourism and Bord Fáilte are, I feel sure, extending their finances and initiative to this end.  However, they must continue to pursue new avenues and new methods of encouragement of tourists.  Not the least among those are our returned exiles and their children.  We want to see them coming back; we want to see coming here now not only those who have left, but the first, second and third generations.  From my experience of meeting sons and daughters of emigrants, I find that the second generation are probably the most tolerant of our ways and means, of our customs.  Our own emigrants deserve the best encouragement that can be given them to come back.  I know that is not being overlooked by those in charge of the Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>There is one part of Ireland particularly attractive to people coming in from abroad, that is, the western seaboard and I should like the Minister to pay special attention to that area.  It is poor in many ways but rich in scenery, rivers, lakes and the traditional hospitality of the people.  If <Col N="1685" /> these can be encouraged&mdash;and I know from going among the people there that it is easy to spark off some initiative&mdash;and if the lead can be given, it would mean a great fillip to the tourist trade.  Coming down to a specific area and dealing with my own constituency, there are along the coast of Sligo many rivers and lakes which could be developed. Nobody is unaware of such places as Enniscrone, Strandhill, Rosses Point, Mullaghmore, Lough Gill, Lough Melvin, Lough Allen, Lough Key and Lough Gara.  All of these areas are admirably suited to the English tourist, be he the hunting type or the working-class type.  They are all welcome in this country.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, because of the peculiar location, because of the special tourist attraction, to give some particular attention to that area.  I would ask him also to endeavour to co-ordinate the work of the different Departments in this respect.  Forestry, well handled, can help tourism; so can the amenities provided by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to congratulate the Minister's Department in the matter of hotels.  We are fast approaching a high standard of good quality hotel.  Perhaps we still lack a sufficient quota of first-class accommodation, but present estimates suggest that this will be attained in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Reverting to inland fishing and to the lakes in the west of Ireland and in other parts of the country, I think that at a comparatively small cost, unpretentious amenities such as little jetties whereby people can pull in and from which they can get easily and conveniently into their boats could be provided. Another point I would make is that we have in Connemara the Gaeltacht grants.  I think something similar could be offered to the people who have a tradition of catering for visitors from abroad during the tourist season, to those who provide for the people from the North of England and elsewhere who come here to fish.  The work these people have been doing is self-evident in Cavan and other places and I think that without involving ourselves <Col N="1686" /> in a huge scheme, some grants could be provided in this respect.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> On a point of information, I should like to know exactly what are the functions of the Minister with regard to this Vote, and Bord Fáilte.  Does he follow the expenditure of this money in great detail or is he here merely in the capacity of Daddy Christmas, to get so much money from the House and hand it over to the Tourist Board to spend exactly, or mainly, as they think fit?  I ask that question because when Questions are put down in the House with regard to State or semi-State bodies, quite frequently the Minister refers the questioner back to the particular body concerned.  He follows Pontius Pilate and says he has no authority or responsibility for it.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us exactly what the position is with regard to the Tourist Board, for my information and perhaps for the information of other Deputies who may be in the same dilemma.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> At that time, the General Secretary of the Irish Tourist Association was transferred from the Irish Tourist <Col N="1687" /> Association and Bord Fáilte was established.  I do not know, but I think that probably if the Irish Tourist Association had been given the same amount of money as was poured into Bord Fáilte, it would have done the job equally well.  At least, it was a step towards State control, and there has been evidence of that in our administration all through the years.</P>
      <P>The Statistics Office was mentioned and the Minister got very shirty and hot under the collar and tried to put words into Deputy Donegan's mouth. I was listening and the Deputy merely adverted to the fact that he did not accept the returns made here with regard to the income from tourism. Neither do I.  I do not think anyone living could compute or estimate what tourism brings to the country.  It is only a rough guess.  I have seen a summary of how it could be computed but to me, as a non-statistician, an ordinary person, it seemed quite obvious that it is little more than a guess.  It may be approximately true, but as a firm figure of any sort, it cannot be accepted.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that a number of tourists are merely returned Yanks and there is no point in the Government, the Tourist Board, or anyone else, trying to pretend they are responsible for the money those people spend here on tourism.  They come here by virtue of the fact that they are Irish emigrants coming back to see their own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one form of activity carried on by Bord Fáilte which I doubt is worth the money spent on it.  I refer to the &ldquo;tidy towns competition&rdquo;. Anyone who knows the countryside, and can cast his mind back over a number of years, will appreciate the change in the countryside.  I can remember that when I was young we had very bad roads and very bad villages; now we have very good roads but we still have very bad villages. Why is it that our roads have been improved to such an extent and our towns and villages have not?  That is a fair indication of the way spending has gone.  Most of the money has been put into the public spending sector and too little left for spending by the <Col N="1688" /> people.  In our towns and villages, the position is that if people do anything to improve their little houses, say, put in a new window, immediately the valuation officer comes down and the valuation is raised.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I agree with some of the previous speakers that probably too much money goes on helping to build luxury hotels.  In a town in my constituency, a hotel was burned down.  The hotelier went to Bord Fáilte and the story he told me afterwards was that they would help him if he was prepared to proceed and build a much more elaborate structure than he felt would be economic and suitable for him.  His trade was simply the local people and commercial travellers coming into his hotel for meals and drinks and he had that trade all the year around.  He felt that if he embarked on building a more expensive and extensive type of building he might enmesh himself in financial circumstances he might be unable to get out of.  For that reason, he abandoned his hotel business entirely and, at the moment, in that town there are poor facilities for the ordinary middle-class person, the commercial traveller or otherwise.</P>
      <P>More help should be given in the holiday resorts for what I might call private hotels, something like the <i>pensions</i> we all have experience of on the Continent, where the lower middle-class type of person could get accommodation at reasonable prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It took us a long time to realise that it was important to allow bus <Col N="1689" /> tours from Britain and elsewhere to come in here.  Those tours are initiated there and carried through here.  I understand that what happened was that they had to disembark here and take an Irish bus.  Presumably, that was calculated to help C.I.E., but, at the same time, what was happening was that the ordinary private associations in Britain, clubs and so on, liked to remain together when they had already booked a bus, and although the original intention was to come here, they changed their minds and went to the Continent.</P>
    <P>I have had complaints also that when these State bus tours were going around the country, they were organised on the basis of going from one State hotel to another, in effect, by-passing the private hotels.  One hotelier complained to me that all he ever saw of them going through was when they called to his hotel to use his toilet accommodation.  What truth there may be in that, I cannot say, but at least complaints were made to me.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is repetition to advert to the seaside resorts and the impact which the licensing laws have had and will have in the coming years.  One of the attractions we had was a certain ease or a lack of rigid control in our seaside resorts.  For cross-Channel tourists, it is very nice to have a drink at hours to which they are not accustomed in their own country.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Deputy Esmonde adverted to publicity abroad and suggested we should have more agents but perhaps some kind of mailing system and the establishment of reciprocal arrangements with foreign agents would meet the situation rather than embark on an expensive agency programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> Wexford has been mentioned ; Deputy Lynch has expounded the virtues of Waterford ; the West was always to the fore in looking for tourist help.  We are not without attraction in Tipperary.  It is very good hunting country.  We have the North Tipperary Hounds, the Black and Tans, and these are an attraction which the Tourist Board should publicise as much as possible.  We have good racing facilities in South Tipperary and a couple of equitation schools.  Beagle-hunting is becoming quite fashionable.  All these things, if publicised, might help to encourage tourists to come here.</P>
    <P>One area which might be developed is Mitchelstown Caves on the Tipperary-Cork border.  There is also the Glen of Aherlow and the Vee.  I understand some consultation has taken place regarding the Vee and that Bord Fáilte met some official from South Tipperary county council.  That type of consultation would be better if it were between Bord Fáilte and some of the local bodies rather than an official.  It would produce more enthusiasm if it were done through some local development body such as Muintir na Tíre rather than start off by having it announced in the paper that one official met another and they had a consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell </NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations within the terms of reference of this Supplementary Estimate.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years in the promotion of tourism and, speaking as one with some experience in that line, I should like to pay tribute to the officials of Bord Fáilte with many of whom I have had a good deal of contact in the past few years.  I have always found them most courteous, obliging and helpful.  While good progress has been made we must also realise that there is a vast potential awaiting exploitation.  As I see it, there are two main factors involved.  First, we must induce tourists to come here and, secondly, we must provide accommodation for them.  It is not too difficult to induce them to come because we have quite a lot to offer. As regards accommodation, I should like to give just one example of some <Col N="1691" /> experiences I have had in that connection.</P>
      <P>For the past twelve months, with the co-operation of the local development association in my home town, Bruff, County Limerick, I have been trying to develop an angling centre.  On the advice of Bord Fáilte we undertook an accommodation survey of the town and district.  We found that the aid available for the ordinary type of accommodation such as small guesthouses and private accommodation is practically nil.  Grants and loans are available from Bord Fáilte, but there is a requirement of a minimum of ten bedrooms for a hotel and five for a guesthouse. If we are to make further progress, especially in developing the angling side of tourism, these regulations must be revised.  It should be possible for persons who would provide even two bedrooms in private houses to get some type of assistance, not necessarily grants but, say, the loans operated by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Ten days ago I went to Bord Fáilte headquarters with a constituent who lives in a very good fishing centre and has a licensed premises.  Occasionally for the past year or two he had a fisherman staying with him.  I was quite satisfied there was a useful potential there but we found that before he could get any assistance from Bord Fáilte he would have to provide a minimum of five bedrooms.  While the potential existed, the person concerned was afraid to take that risk.  It was doubtful if it would be worth going to the extent of providing five bedrooms. I suggest to the Minister that assistance should be made available for a minimum of two bedrooms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey </NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to mention regarding tourism, which has great potentialities.  Lest I be misunderstood, may I say that I am not against the large hotels which are being built? We should have the best accommodation for our visitors.  I am not sure what grants are available for what I would term the family hotel.  Many who come here on holiday are not in a position to pay for accommodation in <Col N="1692" /> the larger hotels.  The smaller hotels should be encouraged by grants or loans.  As another Deputy has mentioned, I also have met people who are slow to tie themselves to providing a certain number of rooms simply because they feel they may be biting off more than they can chew.  The Minister should give some extra consideration to the question of grants for small hotels.</P>
      <P>Another matter I should like to mention is coarse fishing.  In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, we have coarse fishing on the Barrow and we have found that, through the efforts of the local chamber of commerce in getting out a brochure and in advertising, a number of tourists came to Carlow for the coarse fishing and have returned year after year.  There is a great potential in this, if we advertise it properly.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I should like to compliment Bord Fáilte and its officials on the good work they are doing.  My colleague, Deputy Lynch, mentioned the attractions in Waterford and Wexford and all around, except Carlow. In Carlow, we have everything for the tourist, hunting, shooting and fishing.  We have the best inland golf club in Ireland and many prizes are made available during the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill, in effect, provides for the cancellation as from 1st April, 1962, of the Road Fund debt on foot of borrowings from the Exchequer and, also, for the making of additional grants to the Fund from the Exchequer over the period of three years commencing 1st April, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £900,000 was borrowed by the Fund from the Exchequer in 1957/58 and of that amount a sum of £622,603 principal will be outstanding as a debt due to the Exchequer on the 31st March, 1962.  In addition, <Col N="1693" /> the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959, empowered the Minister for Finance to supplement from the Exchequer the income of the Road Fund by an amount not exceeding £2 million spread over a period of 5 years and payable as to one-half by way of free grant and one-half by way of repayable loan.  Up to 31st March, 1962, a sum of £1,200,000 will have been received by the Fund under these provisions, £600,000 of which is in the form of repayable advances.  Of this, principal amounting to £553,082 will be outstanding as a debt due to the Exchequer on 31st March.</P>
    <P>As announced by the Minister for Finance when moving the Vote on Account for 1962-63, it is proposed that the Local Taxation Account, which includes the Estate Duties Grant issued annually to local authorities through the Account, should be terminated as from 1st April, 1962; this matter is to be dealt with in legislation which will, in due course, be introduced by the Minister for Finance.  In compensation for the termination of these payments from the Local Taxation Account, the Bill proposes that the Road Fund debt on foot of the borrowings already referred to from the Exchequer up to 31st March, 1962, will be cancelled. In addition, two grants will be made in lieu of the two repayable advances of £200,000 each which would otherwise be made under the terms of the 1959 Act in the financial years 1962/63 and 1963/64.  This accounts for £400,000 of the £700,000 provided for in Section 1 of the Bill; the balance of £300,000 I will deal with later on. As I have already announced, local authorities will be compensated out of the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>The special assistance provided by the 1959 Act was designed to enable the Road Fund to meet applications from particular road authorities for grants to assist them in dealing with two special types of road problem, viz.: (a) that created in certain counties by the closing (in whole or in part) of railway lines; (b) that created by traffic serving certain important industrial undertakings, the <Col N="1694" /> public road approaches to which have been found to need improvement.</P>
    <P>The amount of £2 million has been fully earmarked against specific schemes and programmes of road authorities and supplemental grants are now required in the cases of some roads serving major industrial undertakings where the original estimates have been found to have been too low.  Moreover, further applications have been received from road authorities affected by recent railway closings or by new industrial undertakings. These new applications have been examined by my Department and I have obtained the approval of the Government to make special assistance available in certain cases.</P>
    <P>A further supplement of £300,000 to the Road Fund will be made to assist in meeting the cost of these additional special works, making available a total additional allocation of £900,000 for this purpose over a period of three years.  From this sum, substantial grants have been allocated to the county councils of Cork, Clare, Westmeath and Waterford and to Waterford Corporation for the improvement of roads affected by recent railway closings.  In addition, substantial grants for roads affected by major industrial undertakings have been allocated to Cork Corporation and the county councils of Louth, Kilkenny, Offaly and Laoighis.</P>
    <P>A number of applications have been received from other areas and while I cannot, of course, guarantee that they will all be granted, I can assure the House that they will be fully and carefully examined.  I am sure the House will have no hesitation in accepting the principles of the Bill and in giving it a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>We may take it that this measure is, in effect, a book-keeping transaction.  What it really does is to transfer the liability from the Road Fund to the national debt.  Since it is being transferred, it will have to be paid for at some stage and the service of it will eventually mean additional taxation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Road Fund itself and the allocations from it, there is, as everybody knows, discontent at the manner in which the money is being distributed and the way it is being raised and that discontent is being shown by the organisations which represent the farming community. They are gravely concerned about the increasing impact on the rates of road maintenance.  Other sections of the community who are not as organised, perhaps, as the farming community are concerned about this matter.  Everybody is of one mind that the charges which fall to be met in regard to roads ought to be transferred.  We believe more discretion should be given to local authorities as to the use of their allocation from the Road Fund.</P>
      <P>The Minister told me last week that approximately half the roads in this State are dust-free and that there is great demand for the improvement of secondary and minor roads in county areas.  What were known as boreens in county areas are no longer amenities but necessities.  The increased use of mechanical transport on farms, and so on, has led to the necessity for improvement of these roads.  The local authority deals with them at present by way of allocations from funds available to the county engineers from the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If local authorities had more discretion in the use of the funds available to them I believe they could do a good deal of useful work.  Local representatives consider that some road schemes are expensive, particularly in relation to the straightening of main and secondary roads.  A good deal of expense is incurred in removing dangerous corners.  Very often, an appropriate danger sign at the approach to the corner would serve <Col N="1696" /> equally well and obviate the outlay of a large sum of money.</P>
    <P>While the straightening of roads may lead to an improvement from the point of view of through-traffic and give the impression of wide and spacious roadways, in the long run it does not greatly reduce the problems local authorities have to deal with.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Excise Fund.  It would be no harm if he could see his way to deal with contributions made under old enactments of this Oireachtas and other legislative authorities in the past.  It would be of advantage to accountancy on either side and generally would be most useful and helpful.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making road grants in respect of the cessation of rail traffic and of access roads to industrial undertakings.  I notice he has taken certain counties into account where changes have already occurred in the transport system.  I mentioned on previous occasions that a very good case could be made for my constituency. For years, heavy traffic has been carried over sections of the road there which was not brought about by cessation of rail traffic.  Take West Limerick as an example and the traffic to Shannon Airport.  Consider the fuel transported from Foynes through the county and city of Limerick and, indeed, through Clare.  That is a national undertaking.  A case can justifiably be made for compensation to meet that heavy flow of traffic.</P>
    <P>Apart from the closing down of certain rail sections and the consequent transference of traffic to roads and, indirectly, the imposition of a burden on the ratepaying community, there is a tendency amongst firms having their own transport to use the roads to a much greater extent than was formerly the case.  Tourism has brought about a heavier flow of traffic which is not confined to any one portion of the country or, indeed, to several sections but is widespread.  Many roads in Connemara, Kerry and Donegal have been dealt with under various grants because they were classified as tourist roads, and so on.  Certainly, they have opened up the countryside to visitors The result has been that a very large <Col N="1697" /> number of roads, particularly in Gaeltacht areas, have been dealt with through 100 per cent. grants.</P>
    <P>I saw recently some information published by the Tourist Board to the effect that our road mileage is the highest in Europe, according to population. We have something like 55,000 miles of roadways.  Certainly, that must represent the largest mileage of traffic-free roads in any country in Western Europe.  That is an advantage in that it attracts people to come here who enjoy that type of motoring. However, it no less involves the local authorities who are not covered by such 100 per cent. grants because they will obtain the percentage grants for main and secondary roads which are applicable under the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>In regard to these percentage grants, the central authority is imposing on the local authorities an obligation in regard to certain services which enables it to maintain control over services locally.  In the initial stages, it does succeed in obtaining for the central authority the carrying out of the programme that is envisaged, but in the long run, it leaves very little choice to the local authorities in the exercise of any discretion in dealing with local problems.  It is something which the Minister, in his review of these matters, might consider, whether the time has not arrived when more autonomy ought to be left in these matters to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Over the years, we have been improving our main roads and county roads.  We have not reached the millennium yet in that respect, as the Minister's answer indicated.  I think there are only about three authorities in respect of whom the Minister was able to say they had passed the 80 per cent. mark in dust-free roads.  If that is the picture, we may look forward for years yet to heavy expenditure on our roads.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has taken into account what is likely to happen in regard to the transport system and the review which is taking place in regard to further closures or whether at a later stage, should such closures take place, the Minister will not have to come back to the House <Col N="1698" /> to seek further authority to make up the leeway in that respect.</P>
    <P>With these reservations in regard to the funds which are being made available, we have no objection to the measure.  Anything that can help in solving this problem is certainly to be desired.  On this side of the House, we have expressed the opinion and hold it firmly that, in regard to expenditure from the Road Fund and the funds being made available under this measure, the local authorities ought to have far more discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond </NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps much that may be said in connection with this measure would be better held back until the Estimate is introduced.  I agree with Deputy Jones that the local authorities should have greater autonomy in connection with the spending of funds within their county areas and the grants allocated by the Government.  The various local authorities are confined to the spending of a fixed sum on main roads and a fixed sum on county roads.  I realise that the Minister and his Department may consider that essential, in case any local authority may devote more to one private road than to another. Nevertheless, it is a pity that the local authorities&mdash;I refer to the members, not to the managers&mdash;are not in a freer position to decide for themselves whether they should concentrate, for instance, on the county roads rather than on the main roads.  Main roads are important from the point of view of tourism, industry and transport in connection with industry, but perhaps too great an emphasis may be laid by the Minister for Local Government&mdash; I mean any Minister for Local Government, not necessarily the present Minister&mdash;on main roads as against county roads.  It is essential that the people living in these areas all the year round should have good roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much is being said at the present time about the maintenance cost of roads being made a national charge. I am not so sure that the people who make these suggestions really understand that ultimately such a charge might not be very satisfactory for a particular county.  We are confined to the amount of finance we can raise <Col N="1699" /> locally, plus the grants within our county boundaries.  If it comes to a free-for-all, it may easily happen that some counties on the western seaboard, in the south-west or wherever they may be, will get less than they are getting at the moment because of the amount of money that must be spent on the roads in, say, Dublin, Kildare, all the roads leading to the south, to the Minister's county, and to the west.  If the other counties are in the heel of the hunt, it will be readily seen by those who advocate that the cost of maintenance of main roads should be a national charge, that it may not be of so much benefit to their own counties.</P>
    <P>Many people connected with local authorities and not connected with local authorities are calling out in a loud voice: &ldquo;Reduce the estimate for the improvement and maintenance of the roads.&rdquo;  Very often that cry is connected with the county roads.  I wish to make my position clear here, as I have done outside.  The people who are living in areas where they have very bad roads have been for years back contributing as ratepayers and indirectly as taxpayers towards the maintenance of other roads.  If we are not to adopt the selfish system: &ldquo;I am all right, Jack; do not mind the other fellow&rdquo;, we must not listen to that.  If we were to listen to the cry to reduce the rates solely based on the clamour of people who already had good roads, as representatives in the local authorities, we would not be just to the other people.</P>
    <P>I know it is a big problem.  I know the cost.  The cost of improvements to the roads, particularly county roads, is very big.  Naturally, I would wish that we could get it, if possible, from the national fund, but we must provide our own as well.  Unless we are prepared for some years to come to provide the money for that, then whether we speak of improvements to the main or county roads, or of the advantages for tourism or transport in connection with industry, it will not in the long run suffice to say that some of the roads are all right and some of them are bad because we cannot provide the money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> There is one point in the brief which strikes me somewhat forcibly.  It concerns the paragraph which deals with the substantial grants allocated to the county councils of Cork, Clare, Westmeath and Waterford.  Again, I do not intend to go into the matter in great detail.  The Minister must know that the allocation made to Cork is in no sense of the word substantial, having regard to the loss of the railway sytem.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities in Cork made it clear to the Minister in this Chamber at the time that we had full trust in the competence of our county engineer and staff who prepared for us an estimate of what would undoubtedly be the cost of improvements necessary in County Cork, particularly in West Cork and part of South Cork, following this closure.  We now know, as we then knew and as we told the Minister, that the grants offered to Cork were completely inadequate.  The word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; should, in my opinion, be completely removed from this text when it refers to Cork.  We know that even the Taoiseach abused the staff of the Cork county council engineering section in a most unfair manner because they did their work conscientiously in reporting the amount that would be necessary to provide an alternative to the railway service.</P>
    <P>I know that a junior member of the Government went so far in the Dáil debates at the time as to suggest that the county engineer in Cork should be surcharged for having prepared this report.  When we were faced with such a situation and when we realised that the head of the Government was prepared to attack our officials who had the full trust and confidence of all members, including the Fianna Fáil members, in the council, we knew what we were up against.  Now salt is being rubbed into the wounds because the Minister talks of substantial grants.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge Donegal or Sligo what they got, but I am entitled to say that the same fair treatment as was given to Donegal should be given to Cork.  I made my position clear in regard to the question of rates and provision for improved roads.  Over and above that, we are faced with the <Col N="1701" /> extraordinarily difficult position of having to provide extra money in Cork at the expense of the ratepayers because of the unfair way we have been treated by the Minister for Local Government in connection with the provision of roads as an alternative to the railway service.</P>
    <P>We have the figures in connection with Donegal, Sligo and elsewhere. The Minister knows that the allocation given to Cork is not fair.  While it is quite correct for the Minister to say that the grants given to Donegal and Sligo are substantial&mdash;and good luck to them&mdash;we are put in the extraordinarily difficult position of having to impose on the ratepayers of Cork a burden that should not, in all fairness, be imposed upon them.  I would ask the Minister to review even at this late stage his proposals and keep his word in connection with this county.  Perhaps, he would respect the views of the members of his own Party who in this Chamber stated clearly for everybody to hear that they knew Cork was not being treated fairly in connection with the financial provisions at that time.  If the Minister does that, we would be in a happier position.</P>
    <P>Why impose on the ratepayers of Cork such a severe financial burden ? As compared with Donegal, Cork has been robbed.  To that extent, Donegal has gained.  That is the difficult situation we face.  At the present time, we are dealing with our estimates.  We in the Labour Party are prepared to face the issue as we have in the past and will the future.  In the meantime, we have no intention of acting as a buttress for the Minister and the Department by saying to these people that we will have to increase their rates.  Could the Minister not do better for Cork, having regard to the fact that he has done so much for his own county?</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the Minister is able to give more money for the improvement of roads, but, <Col N="1702" /> having said that, I am very sorry that the Minister did not consider giving more to County Dublin.  The roads in County Dublin are used by heavy traffic from all over Ireland.  The city is an industrial pivot.  People come to Dublin by car and otherwise from all over the country.  Quite a number of heavy industries are situated in Dublin, necessitating the use of heavy vehicles on the roads.  Traffic has increased very considerably over the past nine or ten years on our main roads.</P>
      <P>We in Dublin County Council feel we should get a bigger grant for the upkeep of the roads in County Dublin. We are carrying the traffic of the greater part of the country, including the Six Counties.  We feel that, owing to the heavy traffic, we should be considered for a special grant.  I do not begrudge the other counties what they got.  All I say is good luck to them. At the same time, I feel that no area in Ireland has a greater claim than County Dublin.  County Dublin roads encircle the city.  Other counties may be in the same position as Dublin in regard to certain heavy traffic but the traffic is not concentrated to the same extent in those counties as it is in my constituency.  For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to consider County Dublin favourably.  We have a good case and we are only asking for fair play and that we should be considered the same as other counties. If he does that we will be well up on the priority list.</P>
      <P>If I may digress for a moment, I should like to refer to the problem we have in the city and county of Dublin in regard to laneways.  I shall deal with County Dublin first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman </NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand some of the calculations in the Bill and the Minister's statement and I should like some clarification of them.  Before dealing with them, I want to make one other point in principle.  It seems to me that we are arriving at a position in relation to our roads in which we need an entirely new method of classification.  Classification of roads, between main roads, on the one hand, and county roads, on the other, has now become quite out of date.  I am not referring alone to the fact that within the classification of main roads, there are now many roads no longer of main road importance and equally within the classification of county roads in certain counties, there are now roads which are of main road importance. That is a matter of individual road survey and the changing trend of traffic and a matter which perhaps could be considered in every county individually.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from all that, there is another and bigger problem which must be tackled.  We shall have to increase our classification of roads to three, namely, trunk, main and county roads.  The arteries that go out from the city of Dublin to Cork, Belfast, Limerick and Galway, all radiate rather like the fingers of one's hand and the counties which have to bear that radial traffic will have to bear an undue proportion of the cost of maintenance of those arterial main roads. In relation to improvement work, I apreciate that it is not a matter of consequence because the improvements are made out of the national pool provided by motorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I think improvements on arterial roads are done on the basis of 100 per cent. grants from the Road Fund and the only cost the counties concerned have to pay is the cost of the acquisition of the land.  When these roads have been improved, when, for example, one with which I am most familiar, the Naas Road, has been dealt with, the situation remains that the local ratepayers have to pay 50 per cent. of the cost of its maintenance.  That would seem to be an unfair distribution <Col N="1705" /> of the burden.  As I say, we have arterial trunk roads running from Dublin to the major points, going around the coast to Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and up to the Six Counties, and then coming down again to Wexford and the south-east coast.</P>
    <P>The counties through which those roads pass bear traffic that is not related to the local traffic at all.  The time has come, particularly with the closing of main railways, when there should be a new classification: trunk roads, the cost of the maintenance of which, as well as the cost of the improvements, should be a charge on national road users as a whole ; link main roads which would naturally be partly the responsibility of the local people, because they would use them, and partly the responsibility of national road users, through the Road Fund ; and, finally, county roads.  In individual counties, a case would be made that certain individual roads should be shifted from one category to the other.  There should be more flexibility there to provide for such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Burke refer to the <i>culs-de-sac</i> and the boreens and was glad to see he now agrees with a provision of last October which was very necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the tot of the figures in the Minister's speech.  As far as I can follow it, on 31st of this month, these will be a sum of £1,175,685 outstanding in respect of these advances and I should like the Minister to check that I am correct in thinking that that is the debt from the Road Fund to the Exchequer which is being wiped out and that it is the only debt there to be wiped out because the 1926 Act is being repealed in its entirely, as far as that type of provision is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not clear as to the term of years for which that money was borrowed and therefore I do not know how much that redemption was costing the Road Fund each year.  The reason I ask is that it seems to me the additional Exchequer grants to be made now to cover the renewal of the Estate Duty grants from the county <Col N="1706" /> councils is limited to 1962-63 and 1963-64.  As far as I can understand the Minister's speech, it is only for those two years that the additional amount may be paid by way of Exchequer aid into the Road Fund, but the old form of Exchequer aid by way of Estate Duty Grant is being stopped for all time.</P>
    <P>The Minister was good enough the other day to give me, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, information that the Exchequer figure was about £150,000 and I think he said the new grant would be £225,000 or thereabouts. That is so for these two years he has named, but it is in perpetuity that the Estate Duty Grant is being wiped out.  I am not therefore clear where the balance lies, unless it is that the calculation has been made that in relation to the sinking fund and interest on the £1,175,685, it would run over such a period of years that it is not necessary at this stage to take account of what will happen thereafter.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in answering some of my queries in that respect, the Minister would let us know what the outstanding term of years is in respect of the borrowings to which he has referred. Perhaps the point he made in relation to the new classification might be one which would be taken better on the Minister's main Estimate.  If that is so, he has plenty of advance warning that I intend to raise it then.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat intrigued to see that the counties mentioned by the Minister in his speech did not include Donegal. I presume the reason is that the Minister has had an attack of conscience because of the fact that the allocation he gave Donegal at the beginning was so outrageously large in relation to what other counties got that he simply could not dare put in that figure again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan </NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief on this Supplementary Estimate. Deputy Sweetman made a most relevant point when he said we now need this new classification for roads. I am a member of Louth County Council and I therefore know the amounts of money we have devoted to a road running from Drogheda to the Border&mdash;a road which carries a vast volume of traffic.  I cannot fully fix in <Col N="1707" /> my mind the book-keeping operation involved here, but there are certain aspects of the Minister's statement with which I should like to deal.  Deputy Sweetman pointed out that the 100 per cent, grant for main roads left the maintenance to be done by the local authority concerned.  That is so.  I am not satisfied with the present operation of the 100 per cent. grant system.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Minister could rejoin that perhaps Meath County Council should get less than 100 per cent. in respect of these roads but I am not convinced that in every case the 100 per cent. grant system is working properly.  The planning for such roads is done in detail by the officials of the local authority and every attention is given to the economic aspect of the plan.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that in many cases better value could not be got for less money, and while I can see the difficulty that could arise through duplication as between the central authority and the local authority, I can particularly understand that the central authority could hardly be expected to produce plans for roads which are, in fact, related to local needs and about which the local authority concerned would know more regarding problems that arise locally.  At the same time, I think a more detailed application by the Department of Local Government to main road works is warranted and in fact in my county it is absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a figure of over £100,000 spent on a road at my very front door. That figure was to eradicate a bend which 15 years ago could have been eradicated for £28,000.  It involves a stretch of three miles of road.  I do not want to cast a reflection on anybody involved in that work but I have the feeling that if more stringent control were exercised, better value could be got for less money.  That is an opinion which I do not expect will be popular in my own county or in the local authority of which I am a member, but when I come here, I say what I think.  In other places, similar circumstances have arisen, emphasising that the 100 per cent. grant system is not <Col N="1708" /> the answer to everything, the be-all and end-all.</P>
    <P>Without doubt this question of maintenance must be attended to. Deputy Sweetman made an important point in relation to it but one aspect he did not touch on was that the more prevalent use of rough tarmacadam involves much heavier maintenance every year.  The road I referred to earlier, from Drogheda to the Border, was a cement road.  For the most part, it is still a cement road.  Those cement roads require practically no attention in the matter of maintenance, but, with heavier traffic and the introduction of cheaper tarmacadam surfaces, it is quite true that the maintenance charge could be much greater over the years.  Indeed, it could easily involve the local authority in higher sums of money than that provided in the 100 per cent. grant originally.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that grants for roads affected by major industrial undertakings have been allocated to various county councils, including Louth County Council.  There are two individual items on which that could have occurred, and I am a little hazy as to which one he refers to.  I think it is the road from Dundalk to Greenore.  I should like to inform him that, in keeping with his statement on this question of industrial grants not having proved substantial enough, the situation there is that the grant allocated will not do more than approximately 50 per cent. of that road.</P>
    <P>I should like also to point to the fact that the Greenore-Preston container service is now a booming business. Heavy traffic, including various agricultural products in containers and machinery in containers, is moving from Dundalk to Greenore twice a week.  We have two shipments out of the port per week.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point to something which, in equity and fair play, he must consider when making further grants for roads affected by industrial undertakings.  It was intended that the plasterboard factory in Clondalkin would be moved to Greenore to absorb some of the labour which was lost by the closing of the Dundalk-Greenore <Col N="1709" /> line.  In fact, a loan was given by the then Minister, Deputy Norton, for that purpose, but because of a change in the financial structure of the company involved, and a change in financial circumstances, the succeeding Minister, the present Taoiseach, had to vary that grant and Greenore lost that source of compensatory employment.  As an additional factor, I should like to point out that in the north end of the county we have, by a coincidence, made most of our roads dust-free under our five year plan, so county council employment is extremely scarce there indeed.</P>
    <P>I make that local approach simply to inform the Minister of the situation. I have nothing further to say at the moment.  We will have plenty of opportunity to deal in a general and a particular way with the Road Fund and its application, on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government quite soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be brief on this measure, but I should like to dwell on the human element involved in the Road Fund, and not so much the road user as those engaged in the repair, maintenance and construction of our roads.  It is evident to many of us who are members of local authorities, and especially those of us who have the well-being of our fellow workers at heart, that too much of the Road Fund is used to buy rather costly machinery and materials, and too little is spent on the human element involved in the labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure, if at all possible, that county engineers and county councils, as such, are restrained from purchasing the unnecessary and very costly machines mainly of foreign make, imported from Germany or Great Britain, for the purpose of making our roads.  I do not want to seem to be against progress, or to be seeking to put the clock back, but in a country such as ours, with such a high unemployment content, we have a primary obligation to our workers, and especially to our county council workers who are superannuated servants of the Department of Local Government.  I feel we have a special obligation to keep <Col N="1710" /> them in employment.  It may seem economically wise to purchase these machines to do the job at the lowest possible cost, but I say that if it means the displacement of hundreds of council workers, it is socially bad.  It is socially bad that we should utilise so much of this colossal figure on foreign machinery, upsetting our balance of trade and displacing hundreds of workers as a result.</P>
    <P>Many of us were appalled at the cost of the very important jobs done by our county councils, such as road widening.  Some of them cost up to £100,000.  We have seen all these construction jobs done with the most modern machinery from Germany and elsewhere &mdash; excavators, bulldozers and various other Bucyrus machines &mdash; and indeed it seems that some county councils cannot cut hedges now without getting a machine for the purpose. I say that is going to extremes.  We were appalled, too, when we saw that the employment those jobs, which cost anything up to £100,000, gave could be counted on the fingers of one hand.  That is bad.  It is the tax-payers' money and it is also the ratepayers' money.</P>
    <P>I have always felt we have an obligation to keep those men in employment in order to give them an opportunity of maintaining their wives and families and to put back into our counties the rates money and the tax-payers' money, and to spread prosperity all around rather than to create unemployment and force people to go abroad.  I am particularly happy about one aspect of the grants under the Minister's jurisdiction, that is, the unemployment relief grants at Christmas time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that enshrined in that scheme is the principle that there must be an employment content in each scheme.  I would ask the Minister to see that to some extent our county managers and county engineers are imbued with that principle.  They should restrain themselves from going mad and <Col N="1711" /> importing <i>ad lib</i>.  The county engineers are vying with one another as to who has the most modern plant and machinery, and every one of those machines is a labour-saving device to put men out of employment wholesale. I contend that they are not necessary economically.</P>
      <P>I know of councils&mdash;and I congratulate them&mdash;which have not resorted as yet to that type of modern plant.  We see many men with picks and shovels. I do not want to go back to the pick and shovel.  I believe in progress, but it seems to me that where we see roads made mainly by labour and with the ordinary mechanisation that goes with it, they are good roads, comparable with the best.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister to see to it that the human element involved&mdash; which is very important in this country&mdash;is safeguarded and I ask him not to allow our balance of trade to be upset by reason of the importation of machines which we feel are unnecessary. The Minister will probably tell me that it is unwise economically to do that, that it is the obligation of the councils and the county engineers and managers to do the job in the most efficient and practical way, but I say we have a bounden obligation to safeguard Irish human beings who are our most cherished assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main emphasis is on our main roads.  I think the Minister will agree that most of our main roads are of a high standard and are virtually dust-free. We need to turn our attention to county roads.  I should like to see some of the money for main roads diverted to county roads.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Sweetman that many main roads are losing their importance and many county roads are becoming main roads.  I am also deeply conscious of the inability of local authorities to maintain county roads. Many of the roads in borough and urban areas are in a shocking condition and are extremely pot-holed.  The local authorities are unable to carry out the necessary work because of the impost this would put on the rates. If the Minister could see his way to <Col N="1712" /> divert money towards county roads, it would be appreciated throughout the country.  I am also concerned with the question of by-roads and <i>culs-de-sac</i> with which local authorities are unable to deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is relevant to the whole question of roads that the Minister should not have regard to priorities which no longer apply. County roads are now becoming of more importance and money should be diverted in a more equitable manner to these, as well as to link roads, by-roads and <i>culs-de-sac.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Jones to the desirability of giving the engineers in the various counties much more discretion in the expenditure of road moneys.  We are long past the time when grants from the Road Fund should be conditional on a contribution from the rates per mile of county and main road equal to the amount in the previous year.  In other countries there is a sort of block grant arrangement, which works out extremely well.  It has the effect of setting up competition between the various local authorities to see who is able to do the best job with the same amount of money.</P>
      <P>Efficiency is what we should look for.  If we are considering employment, we should not do so at the expense of the ratepayers.  If there is an unemployment problem, then there should be a 100 per cent. grant from the Road Fund.  We should not get mixed in this.  We should consider making more use of the contract system in regard to both making and maintaining roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by at least two Deputies to the roads radiating from Dublin to the various parts of the country.  Deputy Sweetman, I think, referred to the necessity for reclassification.  I should like the Minister to say if there are now any standards in his Department for classification. Some time ago, in answer to a question of mine, he said he was contemplating a reclassification of the <Col N="1713" /> roads.  It is very necessary that this work be put in hands soon.  Certain local authorities are being very badly treated at present.  Deputy Burke made an appeal for greater consideration for County Dublin, but he failed to refer to the most important point: that the ratepayers in County Dublin are called upon to contribute a sum of £640 per mile for main and county roads while the ratepayers in the Minister's own county are called upon to contribute £62.  I am not saying there should be equality in these things but that discrepancy is much too large.</P>
    <P>The claims being made by counties like Dublin, Kildare and Louth are justified because they are the counties contributing by far the most from the rates.  There is no county contributing as much per mile as Dublin.  The nearest is Kildare and the next is Louth.  With regard to the main arteries I do not think it is sufficient to give a 100 per cent. grant for the remaking of roads to meet the demands made upon them today.  These main arteries as they stand are more than adequate for the people of Dublin.  The ratepayers would be quite pleased with them.  However, they have to be enlarged and improved because the traffic of the country is using them and the ratepayers in County Dublin have to maintain a much greater surface area of road as a result of these improvements.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Burke was appealing for greater consideration for County Dublin I saw the Minister writing rapidly.  I know he was preparing to give the old answer that a considerable amount of the grants for the improvement of these main roads remained unspent.  The reason for that could be laid at his own doorstep.  We were for six or eight years without a county engineer because the salary could not be settled.  The whole business of road making and improving was in an unsettled state.  The Minister will have to agree that we are getting on with that now as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Not only should we be paid a 100 per cent. grant for those roads, but we should also be paid a 100 per cent. grant for their maintenance.  In many countries that is done.  The State makes <Col N="1714" /> and maintains the main arteries.  A change along those lines is called for. In County Dublin a section of railway line was closed.  As far as I can remember, we got no compensation by way of an improved grant for maintenance on that account, as other counties did in similar circumstances.  The appeal I would make would be for a reclassification as soon as possible, a block grant, a 100 per cent. maintenance grant for main roads and more use of the contract system for road making and maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be correct to support the view that not alone should there be a reclassification of roads but that the Minister should consider changing the present basis of allocating grants.  He might consider making the grants from the Road Fund on a mileage basis&mdash;not entirely on a mileage basis but taking into account the mileage a particular county council has to maintain.  Under the present system, the Minister allocates the ordinary grants to the county councils in accordance with the amount of money they themselves provide for main and county roads.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware, as most Deputies are, that there is a big difference between the road mileages in the various counties throughout the Twenty-Six.  There are varying degrees of prosperity, or one might say poverty, in the 27 county council areas.  So long as the Minister allocates the grants on the basis established over the last 20 or 30 years the poorer counties will continue to find themselves unable to do the roadwork necessary in their particular counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was asked last week&mdash;I do not now remember by whom&mdash;which sought information with regard to the percentage of dust-free roads in each county council area.  The answer was one of the most revealing we have had in relation to roads, road improvement and road maintenance.  The answer disclosed that the percentage of dust-free roads in the 27 county council areas varies between 20 at one end and 80 or 90 at the other.  There seems to me to be something wrong in that and I suggest that the &ldquo;something wrong&rdquo;<Col N="1715" /> is that the road grants are not allocated on a proper basis.  That is why I suggest that, apart from ability to raise money for road works, the mileage in each county council area should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The other item I want to raise is a matter in connection with which I approached the Minister in accordance with a request I received from the Wexford County Council.  I refer to the possibility of a grant being given to improve the road from Rosslare Harbour to Wexford town.  In accordance with the description of this Estimate the Minister may, I think, allocate moneys voted for it to such a purpose.  As a result of the correspondence the Minister has had with the county council he is very well acquainted with the reasons why this road needs to be improved.  Rosslare Harbour is the south-eastern gateway from Great Britain.  It carries a tremendous number of tourists all the year round, particularly from June to October.  The majority of the cars entering this country enter through the port of Rosslare Harbour.  Apart from the fact that the road is bad, we ought to be concerned with giving visitors&mdash;we value the tourist industry very highly&mdash;the best possible impression of the amenities and attractions the country has to offer.  The Minister has all the arguments.  I merely raise the matter in order to ask him not to close his mind to this application for assistance in respect of this road but, rather, to consider it sympathetically in view of the weight of argument in favour of giving a pretty substantial grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any move to provide a greater measure of financial support to local authorities, particularly in regard to roads.  I have a very special request which should receive the Minister's sympathetic consideration.  Local authorities should have a greater say and wider powers in relation to the spending of moneys from the Road Fund. I suggest that at an early date the Minister should summon a conference with his road experts, the county managers, and county <Col N="1716" /> engineers, and give them a lesson in common-sense and intelligence in regard to the spending of allocations from the Road Fund.</P>
      <P>We are living in the year 1962 and it is high time that a little sanity and common-sense were exercised in regard to main roads.  There is one way in which existing difficulties could be overcome.  There should be a statutory road sub-committee in each county council and every decision of a local authority to spend money from the Road Fund on a particular road should have the approval of that committee.</P>
      <P>We all know that huge sums have been expended in removing bends and corners and levelling hills.  A good deal of criticism has been levelled at that policy by the majority of ratepayers living on county roads, in <i>culs-de-sac</i> and along lanes.  We have succeeded in turning some of our main roads into speed tracks on which the well-to-do can drive over other people.  It is all very fine to say that our main roads are in very good repair.  Many representatives of local authorities believe that a good deal of the money so expended could have been spent to better purpose.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what plans are available in his Department for bypassing country towns.  I want to make special reference to three towns&mdash;Naas, Kildare and Portlaoise. No one will convince local authorities that it is in the interests of speeding up traffic that large towns must be bypassed.  That is bad for business, for trade and commerce.  Local authorities would be well advised to view with suspicion any plans for the bypassing of country towns and villages.  Bypassing in the past has proved very detrimental to business. I understand there are plans in the Minister's Department and that, within the next 10 or 15 years, a number of very important towns will be by-passed. I want to sound a note of warning.  The Minister should proceed very cautiously in the matter of bypassing towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse what has been said with regard to the amount of machinery <Col N="1717" /> now replacing manpower on our roads.  In the interests of economy we probably want to get a good job done as quickly and as cheaply as possible. We should, however, bear in mind that we have an unemployment problem and one way in which employment can be provided is in the construction, making and maintenance of roads. Special consideration should be given in the allocation of grants to those counties which have a large number of workers employed on the roads.  The problem has become rather serious in many counties; machinery is depriving the fathers of families of work on the roads.  The Government should implement a policy making grants contingent on the number of men employed.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for close on 20 years and I know one local authority has given increases in pay on three occasions to its workers; on every occasion the increase did not entail one halfpenny out of the pockets of the ratepayers. It was paid out of the grants provided by the Department of Local Government. If the Department provides grants for road-making or extension, the grants should be utilised for those purposes.  It is high time serious consideration was given to devising a new scheme for assisting local authorities and giving them wider powers in regard to road grants.  I shall have something to say in regard to county roads, by-roads, lanes and <i>culs-de-sac</i> on the Estimate as that will be the most appropriate time.</P>
    <P>More branch lines have been closed and C.I.E. have abandoned the railways in many instances and have taken to the main roads for merchandise transport.  There is one road in my constituency about which I am particularly concerned and it should concern the Department of Local Government also in the near future.  It is the main road between Mountmellick and Portlaoise.  It runs parallel to a branch line, one of those that C.I.E. decided to close but left like Mahommed's coffin.  It has not been abandoned but there are no trains on it except during the beet season. Neither is it a line which is properly <Col N="1718" /> functioning since there are no trains on it.  It might be helpful to the local authority if C.I.E. would make up their mind one way or another in respect of this branch line.  The fact is that both the line and the main road are built on bog which has been cut away practically on both sides with the result that at present the road is almost completely sliding into the bog. It will cost a fabulous sum of money to undertake the necessary work on this road.  This is a road in respect of which Laois County Council, in view of the fact that C.I.E. have taken transport from the railroad and transferred it to the road, will seek a 100 per cent. grant from the Department.</P>
    <P>A condition should be attached to those grants that where possible local quarries will be opened and local material where available will be used. In many cases ratepayers are asked to contribute very extensively towards road maintenance and construction while at the same time a large volume of road materials is imported.  Where there are good stone quarries and good sand pits which could provide suitable road-making materials the Department should insist on their being developed. That would provide extra work in the area.  Practically all counties have suitable quarries and sand pits and while it may be considered uneconomic to develop them and may involve large costs, an effort must be made to provide employment at home which will help the farming families to live in their own land.  We cannot neglect resources such as quarries and sand pits which could be utilised for road purposes.  As part of the roadmaking drive the State should give special grants and facilities for the development of quarries and the opening of sand pits.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Road Fund grants, suitable grants should be provided by the Department for the provision of lay-bys.  The present grants are insufficient.  The Department should stress to every local authority the importance of these lay-bys and, as I suggested originally, county engineers and county managers should be lectured on Government policy in relation to these matters.  There are some counties where there are no lay-bys for <Col N="1719" /> considerable distances.  These should be provided so that lorries and heavy traffic can pull in, night or day, so that the occupants may have a meal or a rest after a long drive.  Every local authority should be asked to provide lay-bys at appropriate distances to be decided by the engineering section of the Department.</P>
    <P>The engineering ability shown and the manner in which Kildare County Council and their engineering staff have carried out extensive work in that county deserve congratulation and appreciation.  They have done very fine work and Kildare County Council should be an example to every county in having a job done quickly, efficiently and satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider assisting and advising local authorities in arranging for the planting of suitable trees or shrubs along new roads. Nothing beautifies a road more than trees along the side.  I would recommend this as a tourist attraction.  The straight, poplar type of tree commonly grown along the roads in France would be suitable.  The Department should also give financial support to local authorities where, at the entrance to towns, they endeavour to make the roads as attractive as possible by providing flower beds on waste or cutaway portions.  This is commendable.</P>
    <P>Another point which is very important in relation to rural Ireland is that a number of land projects are held up in the Department of Agriculture because local authorities are not in a position to undertake certain works convenient to main roads and county roads where bridges have to be removed, gullies sunk and deepened and wider pipes laid down in many cases where road drainage must be provided. In those circumstances, county engineers should lose no time in obtaining the sympathetic consideration of the Department and small grants should be given to cover these small cases.</P>
    <P>When we draw the attention of county engineers to the matter, we are told that these things have not been provided for in the rate estimates and <Col N="1720" /> that no money can be expended on them.  We know of many instances where lands have been drained on both sides of the roads and the failure of the local authorities to make and maintain gullets, or lay pipes or put down wider pipes has held up drainage considerably. I would ask the Minister to consult the other sections of his Department on this very important matter and that grants of £50, £80 or £100 should be provided for individual cases. Some effort will have to be made to meet the need.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage when the standard of our main roads is almost good enough but it is very heartening and dispiriting for people living on by-roads, county roads and <i>culs-de-sac</i> to come out on the main roads and see the amount of grant available for such roads, while there is none available for the roads on which they live.  I would ask the Minister to modernise the whole system of co-operation between his Department and local authorities with regard to the maintenance of roads.  It seems to me that there has been little improvement in that system since the time we had an alien Government here.  I cannot but say that there has been some improvement with regard to expenditure which is not unknown to the ratepayers, but I would ask the Minister to co-operate more with the local authorities, to give more say to the local representatives and more discretion in the use of the money from the Road Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Some remarks have been made that should be commented on from this side of the House.  I must say that there is far too great a tendency on the part of county engineers and county managers to use machinery for work that could be done by manual labour.  It is the Minister who is responsible.  He sent out a circular to local authorities specifying that the money should be spent in the most economical way and that is the whole cause of the trouble.  I would suggest to the Minister that if the job can be done as well and as cheaply, even if it takes a little longer, it should be done manually, if possible.  Where men are laid off and go to the labour <Col N="1721" /> exchange and draw £5 a week for six months, they could be usefully employed full-time doing work on the roads which is now being done by machinery at about £6 a week.  That is a great loss to the State.</P>
      <P>We frequently see large lorries hauling little tar cans for the mending of potholes in the road.  The Minister should tell the local authorities doing that kind of thing to grow up.  A horse is much cheaper for that kind of work.</P>
      <P>Then there is the question of the roads that have been affected by the partial closure of railway lines.  The passenger trains have been taken off these lines but an occasional train travels over them carrying goods.  In my constituency, this has resulted in industries like the gypsum works in Kingscourt sending all their goods by road.  The cement company in Drogheda are using the roads in County Meath to transport their goods to the North and also to Dublin and the effect on these roads has to be seen to be believed.  Bridges have been damaged and the lorries have had to alternate from one road to another. The condition of some of the county roads as a result of that traffic is shocking.  There is no 100 per cent. grant to repair them and most of the cost falls on the backs of the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>There is also the situation where passenger trains to the seaside have been taken off.  If we get a decent summer we have thousands of cars and all sorts of motor vehicles travelling to the seaside over very narrow roads which were never made to carry that type of traffic and there are no grants available to do anything about it.  This is a direct result of the closure, or partial closure, of the railways and there is no other way that people can get to the sea.</P>
      <P>Local authorities can deal with drainage outfalls through the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is functioning in my constituency and that is all I know. <Col N="1722" /> If the local authorities do not make provision for it, that is their business. There was a suggestion made here that more work should be done by contract. All I can say is God save us from the kind of contractors we see carrying out some road work and some road repairs.  The suggestion that the making or repairing of roads should be taken over by contractors who would do the work in their own time and in their own way is something that none of us wishes to have anything to do with.  Road-making in these cases would entirely depend on a few contractors who would reap quite a harvest.  There would be very many more people taking the road to the emigrant ship.  There would be far less employment in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I come now to the amount of the grant.  The Minister said he was not quite clear what I meant when, following an answer of his last week, I asked about making up the amount from the Department of Local Government of increases in grants and costs of materials.  I presume the Minister studied the point since and appreciates that what I meant was that local authorities must make available the money to cover wage increases and, in the Estimates given by his Department, unless the wage increases are noted to him before the grants are available there is no arrangement by which that money is available.</P>

      <P>I want to put this to the Minister who is now at his luncheon. Is there any inconsistency in the proposition that, for the purpose of securing a higher degree of efficiency in road-making, we proceed to amalgamate the road-making authorities? That is a proposal that could well be considered on its merits.  Is there any inconsistency in viewing that possibility favourably and, at the same tme, saying: You have a social pattern over a large part of this country in which you have property-owning farmers, that is, small farmers with less than 50 acres of land and their ordinary life means that at certain restricted seasons of the year there is not full-time occupation of them on their own land whereas, at other seasons of the year, if they are to make their land productive, they are working 12 and 14 hours a day?  Even working as hard as that, at the times of the year when it is possible to work their land, their income is out of all proportion to the income earned by other elements in our society who are working a five-day week.  For that <Col N="1726" /> reason, in areas where there are farmers in those circumstances, we ought deliberately to provide them with employment on road works so as to expand their individual income and to do it on exactly the same principle as we encourage a factory to go down to a congested area rather than to an industrial area &mdash; because we want to get employment for the people there. We do not want to create exclusively employment which involves closing the small farm and abandoning the home. There is a case to be made for that proposition.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of a Minister for Local Government to say to the local authorities: &ldquo;While we expect of you to get the best possible value from the rates you expend, while we expect you to do all the work as economically as it is humanly possible so to do, you ought to bear in mind the social aspect of this question as well and, while observing all the canons of economy, see that you do not render 100 or 200 small farms in the area for which you are responsible uneconomic by refusing to provide any outside employment for the occupants.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

On every occasion, after some weeks, the workers who had to be laid off due to the fluctuations were taken on again.  It is hoped on this occasion that after some weeks it will be possible to re-employ the workers.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of the workers are technically trained?  If some of them go to England in the meantime they will hardly come back.  That is the great danger.  Will the company run the risk of losing the trained personnel? Can anything be done to meet that very serious situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no immediate remedy for the provision of employment to absorb these workers but I hope that the recession will soon pass. In reply to Deputy Corish, there is a quota in existence which, as the Deputy appreciates, is the most restrictive form of protection.  That quota provides for the importation of 900,000 square yards of cloth.  The cloth imported under that quota is not of a type normally produced from yarns made by Salts (Ireland) Ltd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be also aware that, if we become members of the European Economic Community, the quota goes automatically and there will virtually be no protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. There is already a duty on yarns.  The Government have already made an order making provision for a tariff on cloth in the event of the quota disappearing.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Minister for Local Government if he will consider setting up a small technical advisory group with special engineering, actuarial and geological experience to advise and co-operate with each local authority on the question of rural water supplies, with special reference to the question of grouped versus regional gravitational schemes, particularly in those areas as yet largely in the preparatory or planning stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the best method or combination of methods of supplying water in a particular area is a matter in the first instance for the sanitary authority concerned.  Each sanitary authority was advised by me in September, 1959, to have regard, when considering water supply proposals, to various scientific and demographic consideration, including all the relevant engineering and geological factors, and to possible variations in demand due to population changes, industrial development and so on.  When such proposals are being examined in the Department, my egineering and administrative advisers also take these considerations into full account.  I am keeping under review the maintenance of as full a liaison as may be necessary between my advisers and those of the sanitary authorities.  The main purpose of the surveys carried out by local authorities, at my request, was to ascertain which type of scheme, regional, group or a combination of those types is most suitable for each area, having regard to topographical and other factors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no functions in the selection of persons to whom allotments are allocated.  The local authority has full discretion in the matter but if they let allotments to an unemployed person at a reduced or nominal rent the difference between such rent and the economic rent may be recouped from the Vote for my Department. The statutory definition of &ldquo;unemployed person&rdquo; includes a person in receipt of unemployment assistance.  The regulations extend the definition to include casually employed persons whose earnings in the previous 12 months did not exceed £98 16s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not have anything to do with sanctioning the people who get allotments.  I said that quite clearly in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that Kells Urban Council have selected certain people for allotments and have submitted their names to the Minister's Department and the Department have intimated that certain people are ineligible because their incomes are over £98 16s.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me get the thing quite clear.  I think what the Deputy is saying may be so but not in the way he put it.  I have no function in the selection of the allottees or sanctioning those proposed to be given allotments, but what presumably may have happened is that persons for whom recoupment has been claimed from my Department have in fact incomes greater than the stipulated £98 16s. It is purely on the recoupment and only on the recoupment that the <Col N="1751" /> Minister for Local Government enters into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that £98 16s. per year is the income which a married man with one child who has been the whole year on unemployment assistance could be getting?  Will the Minister not agree that that figure represents an unreal sum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that, if the person is in receipt of unemployment assistance, even for the whole year, and even though the figure might exceed the figure mentioned here, that person is still regarded as an unemployed person but if he is casually employed and if his earnings exceed £98 16s. and the recoupment is not paid by my Department to the local authority nothing said here precludes that local authority from subsidising the rent or rate at which they let this allotment to a deserving case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Eligibility for Contributory Old Age Pensions.</Title>
    <P>28.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the section of the Social Welfare Act, 1960, which specifies that persons over seventy years of age who have an average of at least twenty-four stamps or credits over the years since their entry into insurance are debarred from receiving contributory old age pension because of their failure to have at least twenty-four stamps or credits over the last fifteen or ten years before they reached seventy years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25A. of the Social <Col N="1752" /> Welfare Act, 1952, which was inserted by Section 7 of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, provides that a person who has attained the age of 70 is entitled to old age (contributory) pension if he satisfies the relevant contribution conditions.  These conditions are set out in Paragraph 6 of the Fourth Schedule to the 1952 Act, the paragraph having also been inserted by the 1960 Act.  The provisions referred to relate only to insurance under the Social Welfare Acts which commenced on 5th January, 1953.  If these provisions alone were applied, no person would have qualified for pension when the old age (contributory) pension scheme commenced on 6th January, 1961, or indeed would yet have qualified, as no person reaching the age of 70 up to this would have entered insurance under the Social Welfare Acts before reaching age of 60, which is the first condition to be satisfied for pension.</P>
      <P>However, Section 66A of the Social Welfare Act, 1952 (inserted by Section 13 of the 1960 Act) gave power to count earlier insurance under the Social Welfare Acts and the National Health Insurance Acts for pension purposes and to modify the contribution conditions for pension. The wording of the section is that the earlier insurance</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall be taken into account in such manner and subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Old Age (Contributory) Pension) (Transitional) Regulations, 1960 and 1961, were made in accordance with the authority thus given.  These regulations do not debar anybody for pension who has a title to it.  They enable persons, who otherwise would have no title, to qualify for pension.  There are at present almost 35,000 such pensions in payment covering about 48,000 persons including dependants of pensioners</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not admit that by invoking a clause which does not appear to have been considered when the Act was going through the House his Department are <Col N="1753" /> debarring those who had stamped cards for upwards of 40 years but who had not stamps as required over the past 15 years, and would he now reconsider the matter with a view to bringing these people in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from that being the case these regulations have enabled pensions to be paid to about 35,000 people and allowances to some 13,000 dependants who otherwise would never have qualified and I think that could only be described as being very generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it was stretching what he calls generosity to bring in a penal clause under the Act?  There was no reason why the people he mentioned should not have been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from its being a penal clause, it was put in to enable such people to qualify and far from debarring them, the transitional regulations made special provision for such people including a provision that each contribution under the National Health Insurance Acts would be deemed as two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that tidal embankments at Cotters, Carrigtwohill, O'Driscoll's, Little Island and Ellis's, Little Island, County Cork have again been wiped out by tidal waves; that there have been new breaches at Fitzgerald's, Harpers Island, County Cork and Dickery's, Little Island; that the cost of repairing these embankments will be more than £20,000; and that there is a danger that these repairs will be wiped out in the next storm; and if he will consider a permanent solution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his previous Question in this matter on 23rd November last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Embankments at Courtstown and Killacloyne, on which repairs were being carried out by the Land Commission, suffered further damage from the recent severe storms.  The repair works have now been resumed and <Col N="1754" /> the cost is expected not to exceed £4,000.</P>
    <P>Whilst the construction of such tidal embankments as might ensure permanent protection against freak weather conditions is not a matter for the Land Commission, I am advised that such a project would not be an economic proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that where there were three breaches when his Department went about finishing the job, there are now 12 breaches in those embankments?  I suggest that if the two breaches he mentions are to cost £4,000 to repair, the sum for the other 12 will be much higher than the estimate given by the late Mr. Hugo Flynn for a permanent solution.  Would the Minister follow his example?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that his Department do not engage in such work and I am suggesting that he follow in the footsteps of the man responsible for the Minane Bridge scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minane Bridge Scheme and all I can say is that the Land Commission, although they have no liability, are now engaged in this work.  I have no estimate of what it would cost to repair the further breaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the wisdom of doing something permanent, in view of the damage caused by the breaches that occurred there last October on which his Department have been working since?  It is now worse than ever. What is the use of spending £20,000 or £30,000 of public money in repairing embankments when the work will <Col N="1755" /> last only a couple of years?  Why not do something definite?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands the cost to the Land Commission in each of the last ten years of (a) bringing prospective allottees from outside County Meath to that county for the purpose of viewing farms and bringing them home again and (b) transporting such persons to Meath when allotted farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Records are not compiled in such detail as to give the precise information requested and considerable time and effort would be necessary to extract it from the records of individual transactions.  I would not feel justified, in present circumstances, in diverting staff for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it would meet the Deputy's requirements to know that, for the country as a whole in the seven-year period ended 31st March, 1961, the aggregate amount paid by the Land Commission in connection with the preview of holding by prospective migrants and the transfer of approved migrants was approximately £1,500 and £26,400 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the information I have asked for not kept in the Minister's Department?  Has he not got on record what it is costing to move migrants to see farms and move them back again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>What I told the Deputy is that I do not think it is justifiable to waste time getting this information for this particular year. I have given the Deputy the total amount spent under that head over the past seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that even if the time is wasted, <Col N="1756" /> as he says, it would be better to spend the time than the money spent on bringing these people to see farms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the point of the Deputy's question.  He was very quiet about migrants during the period he supported the Coalition Government.  He was as mute as a mouse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report and do not agree with the opinion in question.  Genuine Six-County fishermen are not prevented from fishing within our exclusive fishery limits but I have no function in regard to any advantages they may enjoy elsewhere.  As I said in reply to a Question by Deputy Ormonde on 15 February, however, I understand that they do not qualify for a subsidy in respect of fish which they land in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I added that I am looking into the possibility of improving conditions for our fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that the group charging system introduced in August 1959 without prior consultation with the Subpostmasters' Union has operated to cause a reduction in the salary of sub-postmasters whose work is increased by over 127,000 transactions, but the telephone unit value of whose work has declined by some 10,000 units; and whether in certain cases this has resulted in a reduction of £30 in the annual remuneration of Subpostmasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the group charging system introduced in August, <Col N="1760" /> 1959, many calls which up to then were trunk calls became local calls. The handling of a local call involves less work than the handling of a trunk call and consequently a subpostmaster receives a lower unit credit for it.  The total unit credits earned by some subpostmasters dropped as a result of the change, involving salary reductions of £30 a year in a few cases, but I am not aware of any case where a reduction of up to £30 occurred in the circumstances set out in the question. The overall effect of the change, however, was to stimulate telephone traffic and in consequence the total amount paid to subpostmasters for telephone work has been increased substantially.</P>
      <P>A claim for revision of unit credits for telephone work is at present being considered by the Subpostmasters' Consultative Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The distribution of Garda personnel is not a function of the local authority. It is a matter for the Minister for Justice pursuant to Section 6, subsection (i) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, which provides as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Garda Síochána shall be distributed and stationed throughout Saorstát Éireann in such manner as the Minister shall from time to time direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In connection with the erection of new stations it is, however, the practice, in the interests of orderly and progressive development, to consult with the local authorities concerned.  Due regard is given to the views of the local authorities but it will be appreciated that the siting of Garda stations must be determined primarily by reference to police needs and requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although their relevance in this respect is not apparent, the particulars sought by the Cork Corporation in connection with the application for the site at Fair Street have, as a matter of courtesy, been furnished to them.  It is intended that this new station will be the District Headquarters for Cork City North and that it will also provide <Col N="1766" /> supervision for the areas presently policed from Shandon and Watercourse Road.  Because of the housing development in recent years in these areas the stations at these centres, which, at any rate, are in urgent need of replacement, are not suitably sited to give the most effective supervision.</P>

      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Table below shows difference between the salaries payable on 1st January, 1955, and those now payable.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Garda Síochána, the figures given are based on the maxima of the scales, and on the inclusion in the 1955 pay rates of the average amount of rent allowance payable in that year.  Since December, 1960, pay rates are inclusive of rent allowance.  The pay of members of the Force above the rank of Chief Superintendent has not yet been revised in the light of increases granted as from 1st November, 1961, to members of other ranks.</P>

    <Title>Foyle Area (Weekly Close Time) Regulations, 1962&mdash;Motion to Annul.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Foyle Area (Weekly Close Time) Regulations, 1962, be and are hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because I feel that the fishermen on the River Foyle and Lough Foyle are being treated harshly. As Deputies know, the story of Foyle fishing goes back a number of years. The fishermen there fought to have the right to fish it.  The situation was rather controversial immediately after the Foyle-Bann case was lost in the High Court in Dublin.  After 1952, the Foyle Fishery Act was brought into force to control fishing on the River Foyle. At that time, it was felt by all sections of the community that this was completely in the interest of the river and of the fishermen who fish it.  However, the position at the moment is that the fishermen are ill at ease.  They have come to the conclusion that we are going back to the Foyle and Bann period and that this is tending to be something like a private fishery again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into details, I believe that the difficulty on the Foyle must be <Col N="1773" /> placed fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Commissioners, who, in my opinion and in the opinion of many, have failed to do the job they were appointed to do.  This is due to the fact that the Commission do not recognise the advisory council, the body elected by the practical fishermen on the Foyle to speak for them in consultations with the Commission and to bring their practical problems to the notice of the Commission.  They have been consistently ignored, so much so that in September, 1960, the advisory body passed a resolution of no confidence in the Commission.  That is a known fact, despite the fact that it appeared in a local newspaper on Tuesday that the Commission refused to meet the advisory body without the Press being present.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I should refer to the fact that the Commission now say it was agreed by the advisory body to bring in these penal regulations.  With the greatest respect to everyone, that is not a fact, as I am sure Deputy Cunningham will agree.  He and I attended a few meetings of the fishermen.  It was brought to our notice that only one meeting of the advisory body had been called since the elections last year&mdash; and the one meeting called was to entertain them to dinner or high tea! I shall leave it to the House to judge without going into it further.</P>
    <P>This reduction of one day in the fishing week is a penal measure for the fishermen who fish the Foyle.  The Commission have the solution themselves, if they would only use it.  I am speaking the views of the practical fishermen, and I am sure Deputy Cunningham will do so as well.  With the greatest respect, the Commissioners are civil servants.  If they do not recognise the advisory council and if they completely ignore the fishermen, they are not serving the purpose for which they were appointed.</P>
    <P>I feel the Commission are not bringing in these regulations entirely in the interests of the fishermen who make their living on the river.  If they were, they would remove the stake net at Rosses Bay, which was described by Deputy Cunningham as a &ldquo;killer&rdquo;&mdash;a stake net which it would be illegal <Col N="1774" /> for anyone but the Commission to use. They have three such stake nets in the River Foyle catchment area.  They could also reduce the length of the draught nets they use themselves to the length allowed to fishermen above Derry Bridge.</P>
    <P>The big mistake is this.  The Commission make regulations and submit them to the Governments, both north and south, and whenever the fishermen make a protest, they kindly agree to meet a deputation.  Deputy Cunningham and I are to attend one of these deputations on Tuesday next. But it puzzles me why the Commission should be agreeable to meet a deputation after the thing has become an accomplished fact.  It seems to be wasting the time of the fishermen and of the Commission itself.  I am thankful to the Government Party for allowing me time to speak on this.</P>
    <P>In 1959, the fishing season was reduced by one fortnight, from 15th April to 1st May, and it is now proposed to reduce it by one extra day per week.  This is qualified by the Minister to, I think, a period of five years.  At the end of five years, there will be no guarantee that conditions and circumstances will have changed; it may be extended to another five years or, perhaps, the fishing week reduced once more, or the season reduced.  I submit that the Minister should recommend to the Commissioners &mdash; he appointed them &mdash; that they should consider the views of the fishermen who make their living by fishing the River Foyle before any new regulations are brought into force.</P>
    <P>There is a widely-held opinion that all fishermen are rogues and poachers. That is not so.  No one values a licence more than a legal fisherman. Fishermen appreciate that their living comes out of fishing, whether it is fulltime fishing in the Lough or in the upper reaches of the river.  They all realise that the regulations made are made in their own interests.  Now I have here some rather interesting figures.  In the year ending 30th September, 1960, the Commission paid back £6,000; in the vear prior to that, <Col N="1775" /> they paid back £8,000 practically.  They have £40,903 accumulated surplus; part of this is £27,000 in hard cash and investments, incidentally.  The fishermen cannot understand how, if these regulations have to be brought in the interests of the River Foyle, this industry can make money.  Would the Minister not agree that in this industrial age, with a Fianna Fáil Cabinet, this money should be spent keeping down poachers and benefiting the river ?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>One important factor is that the Commission have steadfastly refused to recognise the advisory council.  They bring in these penal regulations now.  Seven years ago, the advisory council recommended a curtailment of net licences, but that advice was not taken until two years ago, when it became obvious to the Commission they would have to curtail netting.  They then reduced the nets to one licence per house.  Had they taken the advice seven years earlier, the <Col N="1776" /> situation today on the River Foyle would be vastly different.</P>
      <P>Even at the risk of being misinterpreted, I think there are too many anglers with a licence for the sole purpose of illegal fishing.  I recognise the good angler is a sportsman, but there are too many anglers with licences for poaching.  If the days are to be curtailed, then make them Tuesday morning to Saturday morning, or Monday morning to Friday morning, but do not stagget it.  If the fishing week has to be reduced for all fishermen, then include the anglers. Fishermen would welcome bailiffs at recognised points so that the fish caught could be checked.  That would eliminate a market for illegally caught fish I think a great many of these regulations are brought in under pressure from anglers fishing the Mourne. Unless you are a cousin of a brigadier, or a close friend of Lord Brookeborough or Lord Wakehurst, you will not get any angling on the Mourne.  It is a closed shop.  The Minister for Transport and Power will bear me out in this but he might prefer me not to go into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should realise that this is an Irish industry with no chance whatever of failing.  If this were a Fianna Fáil industry, controlled by foreigners, we would have money in subsidies literally flowing down the Foyle.  The Minister should consider rejecting the claim of the Commission to reduce the fishing week.  I suggest the proper step would be to reduce the company's own draught nets to the same length as those of the fishermen who fish the river above Derry Bridge and remove the stake net at Rosses Bay, which is described by Deputy Cunningham as a &ldquo;killer&rdquo;.  I suggest also that a local commissioner be appointed on the Commission and, above all, I appeal to the Minister to instruct the Commission to recognise the advisory <Col N="1777" /> council who, like Deputy Cunningham and myself, are spokesmen for the practical fishermen who know the problems of the Foyle and earn their living from the Foyle.  Until such time as there is good faith between the fishermen, the Commission and the advisory council, there will always be trouble on the Foyle.</P>
      <P>I may have missed a few points but I have tried my best to put the case before the House and I appeal to the Minister to reject the claim of the Foyle Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of this motion are &ldquo;That the Foyle Area (Weekly Closing Time) Regulations, 1962, be, and are hereby annulled.&rdquo; In considering that motion, we should remember that the statutory regulation to which the motion refers is in two parts, one dealing with the net fishermen and the other with the anglers and reducing the angling season in November by a period of three weeks. I certainly do not want the Minister to annul that part of the regulation.  I am all in favour of it and I do not support the motion which asks that that part of the regulation which the Minister has signed and which is before us on the Table of the House should be annulled.  I shall strongly oppose the revision to a date three weeks later of the date for the closing of the angling season.  I think what the Minister has done in that part of the regulation is wise and necessary and that further action along those lines in regard to the angling season in necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte agrees that the angling season should be further curtailed, but in his motion he asks that the whole Order be not introduced, thereby suggesting that the angling season which it is proposed to reduce by three weeks should be left as it is.  I do not agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I say these regulations, if introduced, inasmuch as they would affect the net fishermen, go too far.  I do not agree with the statement of Deputy Harte that the net fishermen have no faith in the Commission. I say they have and that they have agreed with some of the regulations brought in, although all of them were not to the advantage of the net fishermen.  They agreed with some and opposed others.  I cannot say the net fishermen have no faith in the Commission but they say, and I agree with them, that this step in regard to the netting of the river Foyle is too drastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that it is not a hard and fast regulation: it may, and I hope will, be waived during the season.  It is stipulated that if there is a sufficient run of fish up the river, the regulation may be waived and that the net fishermen may revert to a five-day week as heretofore.  I hope that will happen and that the requirements for that to happen will not be severe, that the number of fish required to have passed up the river will not be so large as to make it <Col N="1779" /> almost certain that these regulations will not be waived.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte suggested that it was a waste of time for a deputation of net fishermen to meet the Commission on this matter.  I think it is not. This is something which the Commission under the Order may waive. I believe the net fishermen will be able to make a case showing why it should be waived.  It is true, and it has happened, that the advisory council met the Commission only once and that no decision of this nature was taken at the meeting.  No advice of this kind was given to the Commission. I do not agree with everything the advisory council suggests; I never have.  Even if the advisory council had met on a number of occasions, that council is so overloaded with anglers' representatives that these regulations might well have been suggested to the Commission.  Other regulations which seemed to penalise net fishermen in previous years were recommended by the advisory council because the council was then overloaded with anglers' representatives.</P>
    <P>However, there is that wrong statement in the publication by the advisory council or by the Minister's Department that these regulations were suggested by the advisory council.  At least, they were not suggested this year.  I am not quite sure when, if ever, that suggestion was made by the council.  Certainly, these suggestions were not made by the newly-elected advisory council set up some six months ago.</P>
    <P>This is a valuable fishery.  I can understand why the Commission want to improve it but I think this method of improving it is not the best one.  It is one which penalises the large number &mdash;not a very large, but a substantial number&mdash;of net fishermen, both drift net and draft net, who earn a livelihood from this river and whose fathers and forefathers earned a livelihood there.</P>
    <P>I think that there should be better supervision of the rivers of the Foyle system, a cutting down of the fishing season, absolutely drastic measures against poachers and those fishing by other illegal means.  We do know that <Col N="1780" /> wholesale poaching is taking place in those rivers and they get away with it because the Commissioners have not enough staff to look after this very important end of their activities.</P>
    <P>There is one point with regard to the regulations which staggers the fishing on two different parts of the river. I do not like the idea of all the drift net men being on on a Monday and all the draft net men being off on a Monday, with the exception of the Commissioners own draft net men.  If all the draft net men are to be off on a Monday, I think the Commissioners own draft net men should also be taken off.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners should take off their stake nets on the narrow Derry stretch of the estuary.  A good part of their income is derived from fishing by those stake nets and if anyone is to have a reduction of income, it should not be the net men.  In view of the fact that the Commissioners are making such a good income, they could well afford to lose a slice of it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Commissioners have agreed to meet a deputation of the net fishermen.  I think this is the first time that a direct meeting with the Commission has taken place, because, prior to this, it was between the advisory council, which includes anglers, and the Commission.  I would suggest that the Commissioners could easily relax the regulations in so far as they effect the net fishermen.  They should relax them and take more energetic measures against poachers and illegal fishing and also curtail their own catches of fish from the very narrow Derry stretch.  I hope the Minister and the Commissioners will take into consideration the points that have been made and that after meeting the representatives of the net fishermen, they will find it unnecessary to introduce these regulations in any of the Foyle fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They have introduced them and they are now going to operate them.  Deputy Cunningham can take steps to see that they do not. He wants to blow hot in Donegal and blow cold here where the Party Whip is hanging over his head.  This is a <Col N="1781" /> very valuable fishery.  I ought to know.  I bought it.  I persuaded the Irish Government to pay £55,000 for a half share and Stormont paid the other £55,000 for the other half.  We bought it for the fishermen in Donegal and it was not bought primarily as a revenue-earning asset for the Government.</P>
      <P>It was bought to put an end to a hated injustice, of which the people of Donegal bitterly complained, that the several fishery there was controlled by a London company and that our own people were not allowed to fish on it. When I first entered the Dáil, I represented a Donegal constituency and I promised them that in some way, some day, we would put an end to that.  It is a great source of satisfaction to me that we lived to do it and that we made that fishery the property of our own people because we wanted them to have access to it.  I think it is very wrong to introduce a series of regulations designed to take back from them that which they had been longing to have down through the generations.</P>
      <P>It is a valuable fishery and if you fish a valuable fishery too much, you destroy the fishing altogether.  There are more people fishing these fisheries than the fishermen of Donegal, but there is this difference between them, that the individual fishermen both from the east and the west coast of the estuary are all relatively poor men, depending for their livelihood on the licence which they have to fish.  The Foyle Commission is a wealthy body because we made a very good bargain with the London body from whom we bought it.  We paid £110,000 and the Commissioners have accumulated substantial reserves.  A great deal of the credit for the good work done in those negotiations goes to Mr. J. D. Rush, who is no longer in the public service.  These negotiations were very difficult and he made a very good bargain for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the aim is to reduce the take of salmon in order to increase the breeding stock of the river, would you not imagine that before they start to take the bread out of the mouths of the fishermen of Donegal, they would take <Col N="1782" /> a chance of lifting the nets of the Commissioners themselves.  If it is necessary to let more salmon up the estuary, surely the first people who ought to make the sacrifice are the Commissioners themselves, who have an annual income of about £20,000 a year?  How can you cut the man whose total interest is one licence, out of which most of them do not get anything?  They are now allowed only one licence per house, whereas in the past a father and son could have two licences or two brothers could have two licences.</P>
    <P>How can we go to these men and tell them that we are going to prevent them earning on one day out of the five they enjoy, while the Commissioners continue to fish all the time under the various concessions which they enjoy, some of which are not open to the individual fishermen at all?  I think the only people who can put a stake net in this fishery are the Commissioners themselves.  I believe that if the nets under the control of the Commission were lifted for one season or half a season it would have far greater effect on the fishermen than cutting off the fishing for one day a week.  Surely that ought to be tried before you take one fifth of these men's livelihood away from them ? Surely it is worth trying ?</P>
    <P>I am prepared to go farther, if the necessity arises.  If the device of suspending fishing by the Commission themselves is not sufficient to restore the stock of the fishery, we can then consider further steps.  Surely that ought to be the first step?  Until that step is taken, I suggest we should prohibit the making of this Order. That is the effective thing Deputy Cunningham can do if he wants to&mdash; but of course he will not.  However, wait until we hear him making speeches up in Donegal.  The scenes that will transpire in Derry will strike terror into the hearts of all.</P>
    <P>Here is the only place he can do anything.  Here, he can say effectively to the Commission: &ldquo;You will not make this Order at least until you have met the fishermen and discussed it with them.  You asked us to come to meet you in Derry next week.  Wait <Col N="1783" /> until we have had a talk with you before you make your Order.&rdquo;  Not at all.  He will vote for the Order today and then tear passion to tatters in Derry next week.  That may fool some very simple people in Donegal but it will not fool the vast majority of the people in Donegal whom I know.  They have no appreciation for a man who blows cold in Dublin and hot in Donegal.</P>

      <P>Because I had work to do elsewhere.  Do not forget that when I first went to Donegal, I was returned at the top of the poll and never lost my place, so long as I needed to stay there.  The people in Donegal will understand.  I do not think they have forgotten that I did not forget them and that the day came when I gave them the Foyle fishery, through the inter-Party Government, which this Government now propose to take away from them or at least 20 per cent. of it.  That is what they remember.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know in this House that that 20 per cent. reduction in the fishermen's access to this fishery is far less than the total take of the nets operated by the Commission themselves. I feel perfectly certain that if the Northern Ireland representatives on the Commission were approached by our representative on the Commission, they would be prepared to suspend their fishing rights for a month, two months, or whatever period is reckoned in order to restore the stock of the river.  That procedure would be much more effective to restore the stock of the river than the proposal to take the bread out of the mouths of the individual fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, both from the point of view of the fishermen and from the point of view of equality and justice, that is the right way to go about it.  If it is necessary, the Commission ought <Col N="1784" /> to do it.  They ought to take up their own nets for a month or whatever period may be necessary.  They should not leave their own nets fishing and then say that it is a most admirable thing that the Commission have consented to submit themselves to the same restraint as they prescribe for the fishermen.</P>
    <P>There is this little difference between them.  Each individual fisherman's income from this fishery can be counted in tens of pounds.  The Commission's income can be counted in thousands. There is no use in a man who is enjoying an income of £10,000 a year coming to a man enjoying an income of £100 a year and saying: &ldquo;I shall give up £2,000 of my income, and live on £8,000 a year, provided you will give up £20 of your own, and live on £80.&rdquo;  If a man came to me with that proposition, I should hit him across the face with a wet dishcloth.  But that is the proposition being made to them and it is against that proposal that we have moved to cancel this regulation.</P>
    <P>Surely Deputy Cunningham, if he is going to Derry next week, will have the courage to vote for its cancellation, at least pending this moving conversation he is to have in Derry?  Come now; we look to him to blow as hot in Dáil Éireann as he intends to blow in Derry.</P>

      <P>It does not matter a fiddle-dee-dee about the three weeks that the fellows are going to fish with rod and line.  They will be getting the traileach in their wrists to get as much salmon out of the river in three weeks as one of the stake nets would get in one night.  The Deputy knows it well. He is trying to slither out but the people in Donegal are not as innocent as that.  At least he should suspend the operation of this Order until the fishermen are met.  In my judgment, they should not have this regulation at all, until they have suspended their <Col N="1785" /> own fishing for a protracted period to see what effect it will have on the stock or, at the minimum, until they receive the deputation.  If they do not do that, I think they affront the fishermen.</P>
      <P>It will be interesting to read in the <i>Derry Journal</i> all the things Deputy Cunningham will say in Derry when he goes there.  I hope the people of Donegal will compare them strictly&mdash; however eloquent he becomes in Derry &mdash;with his temporary restraint in Dáil Éireann.  I hope they will note his astute and salmon-like manoeuvre by which he hopes to escape from the obligations of defending in Dáil Éireann that for which he is prepared to die in Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is displaying his ignorance of the law because I, and solely I, am responsible for Foyle fisheries under the law as it stands.  In connection with this motion of annulment, the effect of the Foyle Area (Weekly Close Time) Regulations, 1962, is to lengthen the weekly <Col N="1786" /> closing time in the Foyle area from the normal 48 hours to 72 hours and to stagger the weekly abstinence from netting between the lower and upper parts of the Lough and River Foyle so as to provide optimum opportunities for escapement of spawning fish. Deputies will know that the Foyle Estuary is approximately 30 miles long.</P>
      <P>The law prior to the introduction of this Order was that there was a 48-hour closing period from 6 a.m. on Saturday to 6 a.m. on Monday.  On the lower reaches of the river, that is, from Derry to the sea, the new period will be from 6 a.m. on Friday to 6 a.m. on Monday, and on the upper stretches of the tidal portion of this fishery the new period will be from 6 a.m. on Saturday until 6 a.m. on Tuesday.  The driftmen are mainly concerned with the stretch from Derry to the sea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to explain to the Deputy the reason for the staggering that has been described here. It has been estimated by these experts, who are in a position to judge, that the 48-hour close season or escapement period that was formerly in operation was not in fact effective in as much as fish that came in late on Saturday night and Sunday were subject to netting on the Monday <Col N="1787" /> before the escapement period.  From the speed of the salmon, their habits in that particular fishery, it was ascertained that although there was on paper a 48-hour close season in each week it was not effective.  The reason for this staggering period, for having a different close season starting on Friday in the case of the drift fishermen above Derry city and the change down, is to ensure that there will be an effective 48-hour period for escapement and that the running fish that move in now on Thursday will not, by the whole series of netting operations that go on from the mouth of the Foyle right up to the tidal portion, be subject at all stages to the nets and the net fishermen.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the Commission took this action without consulting anybody.  There has been, certainly since I became Minister for Lands, a consistent and persistent demand for conservation on the whole Foyle system, the one peculiarity being that everybody wants to prevent the other fellow fishing, even in connection with this Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The various sections, the driftmen, the net men and the anglers, as far as I can judge, are all agreed on one thing, that there should be conservancy measures.  The vast majority of them expressed fears, and such fears were expressed in the discussion of the recent Bill in the Northern Parliament, that this fishery was in danger because of a lack of effective conservancy measures.  It was stated that there should be more escapement.  Where the disagreement comes in is as to who, or as to which body would be curtailed in their fishing. I suppose it is only human, but, while every section is agreed as to the necessity for conservancy measures, no section wants the measures to be applied to themelves or to their particular class.  Before this Order was made there had been discussions with the advisory council.  The advisory council were agreed that conservancy measures should be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asserting there has been an advisory council meeting. I have seen a record of the discussion at it and while there appeared to be general agreement that conservancy measures should be taken&mdash;and indeed many of those present welcomed these measures&mdash;there were some who were not prepared to accept them <i>in toto.</i> They all appeared to be in agreement that it was essential to have some conservancy measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same story has existed as far as conservancy measures are concerned over a number of years in connection with this fishery.  The vital reason for the introduction of these measures, which, as has been pointed out by Deputy Cunningham, apply to rod fishermen and others as well as to the operations of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, was the extraordinarily poor escapement in 1961.  The main reproducing stock move upstream in, I think, the first week or fortnight in July.  On that movement, outside the ordinary escapement from the nets of the fishermen at other periods, depends the restocking potential of the whole system.  This last movement in July, 1961, has been the worst movement and the lowest escapement in the whole history of this system.  It has been far and away below any other figure since records have been kept by the Commission.  The red counts in 1961 decreased to something like 2,000 or <Col N="1789" /> less than 2,000 in comparison with some 4,000 to 7,000 in previous years. This was a real danger sign because if that position were repeated this year it might have disastrous results.</P>
    <P>Deputies may or may not be aware that the cycle for salmon is four years and the results of this small escapement of spawning stock would become apparent very quickly.  In 1959, another bad year, there were no steps taken towards conservancy.  It is not quite clear nor can the experts be satisfied why the salmon did not move up in sufficient numbers last year.  The fish undoubtedly were there but, for whatever reason, they did not go up towards the spawning beds with the result that we have had this low escapement figure.</P>
    <P>The Deputies mainly concerned with this realise that it is vital for the people for whom they speak that the future of this fishery should be ensured and that the fishery should be kept in good heart.  From 90 per cent. to 95 per cent.&mdash; and this is my information&mdash; of the net fishermen who operate there come from this side of the Border and if the fishery suffers from lack of stock, they would be the first to suffer.  The escaping fish determine, and will determine, the whole fishery system of the Foyle.</P>
    <P>The Commission took this step and were naturally reluctant to take it. They felt it their duty to take this step in the interests of preserving this very valuable fishery which I think is agreed to be one of the most valuable fisheries in the whole country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the House will permit me to say this.  The drift men have been met and while, as I said earlier, they agreed on conservation measures, they were not prepared to suffer any conservation or restrictive measures.  The net fishermen are being met by the Commission during the coming week.  Under Section 4 of the Order, I should like Deputies to appreciate, the Order can be suspended by the Commission.  The Commission will have power to suspend it this very year, if the run of fish justifies it.  If the run of fish comes up to expectations in July, the Commission can, and my information is, will, suspend the effect of this Order.  It is the risk of having two successive very bad years that would endanger the whole propagation system in this river.  Therefore, the Commission will no doubt listen to the views that will be put before them this week by the net fishermen concerned. If this is a normal year as far as fish runs and escaping are concerned, the Commission have the power, with my authority and that of my opposite number in the Northern Parliament&mdash;and it is the intention&mdash;to suspend for the rest of the season the operation of the Order.  In view of that situation, I would suggest that the movers of this motion withdraw it.</P>
