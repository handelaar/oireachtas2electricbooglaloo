    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were concluding last night, I was on the point of mentioning, in relation to the suggestion that grants are inadequate, the experience of certain groups of people in the country who have, by forming a local co-operative and public utility society and with the assistance of the local vocational committee who put at their disposal a building construction instructor, been enabled to build their houses without any cost other than the two grants which they have received from the Department of Local Government and the local council, together with the work which they themselves put into the building of these houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One place I have in mind is the little area of Glengad in North Donegal where about 30 houses have been built in this manner.  I only mention it here to demonstrate that the grants can be of very great assistance to private people building their own houses and an extension of that idea throughout the country could give <Col N="3117" /> very satisfactory results.  This area of Glengad is in the Malin Head Peninsula and the people in that group of 30 were undoubtedly, with very few exceptions, of the class we have been talking about here who could not be expected to put any worthwhile amount of money along with the grants to have their houses built by building contractors.</P>
    <P>In this relatively poor area of very small holdings, supplemented by fishing occasionally as the weather permits on that very rugged part of the coast, there are at least 30 families who have been rehoused by their own efforts, aided by the grants from the Department of Local Government and the county council, together with the invaluable assistance given by the building construction instructor who was put into the area by the Donegal Vocational Education Committee in order to demonstrate to these people, who had no building skill heretofore, how to do the job.  An excellent job has been done.  That is something which our vocational committees and our public representatives could very well copy and extend to other parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they run into any trouble with the trade unions or the craft unions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  There is nothing in this for the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>How many building instructors are available to each vocational committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter on which the Department of Education could enlighten the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no solution to the housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of itself, it is not, but it is a help.  If the Deputy were more concerned with efforts of that sort, instead of coming in here and obstructing the progress of business, it would be far greater help.  The Deputy knows nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="3118" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do know about it and it is insufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is insufficient in itself but it is a method that can be used and which can be a considerable help.  If in any one parish you can find 30 people who, with this assistance, are able to build houses, it is a considerable help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take two years for any instructor to get that done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is with one instructor. This is a method of assistance in these extreme cases.  It is an excellent idea, one that has worked out in a practical way and one that has provided results which, without this assistance, could not otherwise have been obtained.  I recommend the idea to the House and to members of the House who are also members of vocational committees.  It is an answer to a very serious problem in many cases.</P>
      <P>Overall, the grants that we have heard described here as insufficient, inadequate and meagre are not being spoken of fairly when these terms are used.  The general picture is one in which the encouragement given by these grants is improving the building of these houses, their repair and reconstruction and also improving the amenities such as water supplies and sewerage facilities.  That has been proved by the factual returns we have given to the House as to the amount and number of grants currently being allocated from the Department.  For that reason, I cannot agree with those who decry the adequacy of the grants and I suggest to the House that Section 2 as it stands, continuing the grants at their present level, is a considerable encouragement at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must always understand that Deputies can make a comparison between certain advantages in County Donegal and disadvantages in other counties.  In the south, we may not be able to avail of the method of financing building described by the Minister, particularly in areas adjacent to the city.  We must <Col N="3119" /> bear in mind the fact that outside the State grant, and the increased ceiling for the supplementary grant, if a man earns £10 or £12 a week and if there is other income to the house from a son or daughter, he is generally regarded as not eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no longer brought into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not finished at all yet.  It is not so long since the Minister explained the shortcomings of another Bill in the House.  Is there anything to prevent a local authority from introducing something of that kind?  I am hoping the Minister will say that there is not.  I have in mind the case of the present county manager in Donegal who, before we were lucky enough to send him away from Cork, raised these points.  When he was there, a man with a family income of more than £13 per week would not be considered for even a county council village type house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so now.  It was not the manager who was at fault&mdash;it was the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the manager. The record is in the Department of Local Government that, in spite of the opposition of Deputy Corry who, to give credit where credit is due, supported us, the manager's ruling went through.  That is one point we have to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point in the section as it stands to which I should like to call attention.  The explanatory memorandum states that grants in future will be paid unless where a piped water supply and sewerage schemes cannot be satisfactorily provided.  In getting the report on the matter from the officials concerned, whether they be local authority officials or Department officials, such a report may show that the local authority may hope to provide these facilities within a number of years&mdash;it could be five years and it could be 20 years.  It may happen then that in view of that, the Department may decide that in the foreseeable future such facilities may be afforded in the locality and, in the meantime, <Col N="3120" /> the applicant may not qualify for the grant, unless he is prepared to wait until the facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>I am not raising these matters for the purpose of obstruction but the manager and officials, acting on legal advice, as they are right in doing, may tell the members that the law is such and such and, irrespective of what the Department may say and of what circulars the Department may send out, the manager, fortified by his legal advice, can stand on his rights and say that these facilities will be provided in the distant future.  In such circumstances, the members of the council would have to tell the applicant that in spite of their best endeavours, he will be unable to get a grant under Section 2 as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this Bill, with plans as they are, can be of great assistance to persons building houses for themselves.  We all agree with that.  What we cannot agree with in this Bill is that the position is being brought about that people will not get the grant.  They could heretofore get grants.</P>
      <P>It is important in urban areas to encourage tenants of existing working-class council or corporation houses to vacate these houses and to go to newer houses, say, with higher rents. That state of affairs has rightly been encouraged by the Minister and his Department.  It is a good way of getting possession of low-rent houses which can be used for slum clearance purposes and which can be used for persons in the lower income bracket.</P>
      <P>This Bill, however, through omission, will now rule out the tenants of corporation or council houses.  They will not get a supplementary grant, under this Bill, if they apply to the local council to build a house under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I submit to the Minister that that is wrong.  The giving of a supplementary grant is a matter for the local authority.  I can see the Minister's point regarding his own bailiwick and the amounts he is giving for the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that if the existing tenants of corporation or council houses apply under the conditions of <Col N="3121" /> the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts to build a house for themselves they cannot now, according to this Bill, get a supplementary grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told last night about houses costing 30/- per square foot and that they were 1,400 square feet and not 1,000 square feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come back to what I was saying in relation to the supplementary grant.  I commend the Minister on this Glengad scheme. I would point out to him that such schemes exist all over the country. They are not the solution, but they are a great help.  If you can get groups of people to come together and help themselves I agree that it is a very good thing.  Here is where this comes in.  The Minister for Local Government is a Donegal man and the Glengad people are at a great advantage <Col N="3122" /> there.  If the same occurred in other places and if groups of people got together they might not get the same tolerance and liberal treatment from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the same grants: would they get the same grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They would get more grants, probably, in Donegal because you get more of everything.  It is we who get the cut in the grants.  That is what I am arguing here.  We are told that the fair wage clause does not interfere with that in the Minister's constituency: I am sure it does not.  That is peculiar to that area, and maybe to other areas, but it would interfere with it in my area.</P>
      <P>I want to find out, under this Bill, if existing tenants of corporation or council houses qualify to get the grant under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I should be very grateful to the Minister if he would tell me that.</P>
      <P>It was argued here last night that the cost of housing has not gone up.  I have got some costings here of houses built down to even 680 square feet and it was always running around £2 per square foot.  The houses that I am mentioning now, that were built at £2 a square foot, were built on land that cost from £100 to £150 an acre.  That land is all used up now.  In the area in which we are, our position is that we have to give £400 and £500 an acre for land to build ordinary working-class houses.  Surely that is raising the cost of the houses, because that will have to be paid for by the tenants?</P>
      <P>Then the wages went up between 8 and 9 per cent.&mdash;9 per cent. for the tradesmen and 8 per cent. for the labourers&mdash;and the working week was reduced to 40 hours.  That will not increase the output.  I would respectfully, then, point out to the Minister that housing, to say it conservatively, in areas such as I come from, has gone up in a short time from in the neighbourhood of £2 to about £2 10s. per square foot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are building flashy houses for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="3123" />
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We were always told about the proverb&mdash;I think it came from the Irish but my Irish is not good enough&mdash;that one swallow does not make a summer.  The Deputy over there built one house for himself which is supposed to be the be all and end all of everything.  I should be very glad if we could get the Deputy to come into our area at that price, but it cannot be done.  We cannot get the land as cheaply as formerly. We have to employ trade union labour. That argument, therefore, is of no use.</P>
      <P>I am trying to put a case to the Minister and I want to be reasonable about it.  In the first place, the Minister should leave it to the local authority and give them the discretion as to who would get the supplementary grants.  I submit to the Minister that that is very reasonable.  The local authority are paying up the money. I know I am not without support on the Minister's benches for that.  I would ask the Minister, before I sit down, if he can tell me now if existing tenants of corporation or council houses can get the grants under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts if they vacate such houses.  If this is a six-mark question, I shall wait until the Minister and his officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy but when he says &ldquo;grants&rdquo; under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, does he mean loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants.  A supplementary grant will not be made available. They would get the loan but not the grant.  A worker living in a corporation or a council house at a low rent might find in the course of time that he is earning more money or his family might grow up and his sons and daughters might have jobs and they might then decide to build one of these houses for themselves.  I am sure Deputy Colley has come across that in Dublin and various places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All members of local authorities welcome the Department's encouragement to get people out of low-priced <Col N="3124" /> corporation houses or council houses all over the country.  If you can get a man out of that type of house and encourage him to go into a dearer house, then you have a low-priced house to help you in your slum clearance for people in the low income bracket.  Therefore, if the Minister can say to me that I am wrong, I shall be delighted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>To get the matter into proper perspective, Deputy Lynch is right in one way but, I am glad to say, wrong in another way.  He is right in asserting that in previous legislation in regard to local authority housing tenants and people eligible for tenancy, we had no limit.  In this case, it is true to say that the £832 income limit does apply to all but there is this very significant difference: local authorities have discretion to determine in their own way what is the net income of a particular applicant. If an applicant of the type mentioned by Deputy Lynch had a gross income of £1,000 a year, the local authority may at their discretion decide, even though the gross income may be over £832, that a percentage of that income may be discounted for the purposes of the supplementary grants scheme and only the net remaining income will be considered. Therefore at their own discretion, they may devise a system whereby such a class can be treated in such a way as to bring their net incomes within £832.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discretion is solely that of the local authority and is not subject to my scrutiny or approval, either now or in the future, so that Deputy Lynch is correct in saying the terms of the Bill have been changed as against previous legislation in this matter but the net effect is that class of people, or any other categories, may have their incomes discounted at the discretion of the local authority by an arranged percentage by the local authority who are best in a position to determine the percentage discount.  Further, the local authority may decide that the £832 figure can be arrived at, even though the gross income of the husband and wife may exceed £832.  There could <Col N="3125" /> in fact be an allowance that would be discounted from the gross total in respect of the man having, as he probably would have, dependants or a number of children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed his annoyance last night that the debate on this section had continued over such a lengthy period.  He alleged that the statements made by members of the Opposition Parties were insincere and that there were no good grounds for opposing this section or for opposing the Bill.  As was pointed out last night by speakers on the Opposition side, the Bill does not give anything extra by way of grants for the erection of new houses and naturally members are very disappointed. What did the Minister expect last night or what does he expect this morning?  Did he expect that we should come along and say: &ldquo;You are a great fellow.  This is a grand Housing Bill.  This will meet the requirements of people and it will do a lot of good in so far as the welfare of the community is concerned&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister bothered with this Bill.  If he had brought in a few amendments in the previous Act, it would have done just as well and false hopes would not have been raised, as they have been raised in the minds of people about to build houses, that grants would be increased. The Minister adopted the argument last night that during the past two or three months the number of applications for new house grants had increased <Col N="3126" /> by 25 per cent.  That of course is correct but what is the reason for the increase?  The reason is that those people expected big increases in the grants and they were getting through the preliminary work, submitting plans and so on, because in previous Housing Bills the new grants applied to buildings which had been commenced after a certain date.  I am sure these people had not commenced the work because they were awaiting this Bill which had been announced some time ago at cumann and other meetings and it has proved a great disappointment.</P>
    <P>Last night, I appealed to the Minister, as did other speakers, to reconsider the question of the grants on the final stages of the Bill.  I said that some additional allowance should be given by the Department towards the erection of new houses.  I hope that some of the Independent members of the House may join with us in appealing to the Minister to do this.  I feel there are no circumstances to warrant his refusing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point which I should like to clarify.  Take the differential rent areas where not alone is the net income taken into account but the gross income of every wage earner in the house, together with the earnings of sub-tenants and relatives who are in the house only until such time as they qualify for a local authority house.  We come to the net amount mentioned by the Minister. The local authority, who is the city or county manager in a particular area, looks for the last shilling rent from the tenants in corporation schemes.  In Dublin, Cork and Limerick, the maximum rents are much higher than the rent that would be paid by way of a repayment of an SDA loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister would not expect a city or country manager to get his rents reduced by transferring a man from a corporation house to an SDA house and introducing a tenant at the minimum rent.  I can see great difficulty and great obstruction put in the way of the tenant who wishes to leave a corporation scheme and build his own house under the SDA scheme.  I would appeal to the <Col N="3127" /> Minister to forget altogether about the local authority and if a man is earning £1,000 or £1,500&mdash;which many of them are, thanks be to God&mdash;he should not be left in the hands of the county or city manager.</P>
    <P>These things should be automatic. If a man takes upon himself the responsibility of building his own house, he is an asset to the nation and should get every encouragement without placing a burden on the local authority, with the result that rents and rates are increased.  The Minister is just shifting the load from the central authority to the local authority. That is the difficulty I see.  I suggest that there should be no figure of £800 a year.  We know that managers circumvent those things</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to allay any fears which might have been raised in the minds of members of local authorities, I want to point out that the manager would be more than mad to try to insist on his own wishes being carried out against the expressed will of the council.  This is a matter for the elected body.</P>

      <P>They are just like any other group of people.  Most of them are reasonable, but the odd one is unreasonable.  Do not forget that the council have control of this matter ultimately and can require the manager to do their will.  There is no question of the manager dictating a line beyond which he will not allow the council to go.  This is not a question of interpretation of the law by the managers.  This whole question of drawing up a scheme of supplementary housing grants is a policy matter, and it is the elected body who are, in my estimation, best fitted to decide on policy, so far as their housing programme is concerned. Normally, the manager has valuable experience and knowledge in interpretation <Col N="3128" /> of the law but there is no law binding here.  If the matter is dealt with by the council, I do not think any manager anywhere will try to suppress the wishes of the local authority who want to go further in their own best interests, and with their knowledge of the situation in the local authority area.  I do not think there is any manager who would try to suppress the wishes of the local authority in a matter such as this.</P>

      <P>In differential schemes, the manager will extract the last penny out of the tenant.  In some cases, the breadwinner is taken to be a daughter.  Whoever is earning the most money is termed the breadwinner by the manager.  There is one specific case in Limerick of a man who was getting £2 12s. 6d. a week national health.  His daughter started work about three months ago in a factory in Limerick.  She is earning £5 a week, and she is taken to be the breadwinner in assessing the rent and the father is overlooked.  The same is the case when married sisters or brothers come home from England.  I appeal to the Minister to take advantage of this Bill to deal with that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw particular attention to this section, in view of the statement made by the Minister last night.  It suggests that the Minister is taking a very different line from that adopted by Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Local Government.  He laid emphasis on the importance of the contract system as <Col N="3131" /> against direct labour for house building.  Last night, the Minister spoke of the question of costs and the allocation of grants and I would point out to him that we must here be concerned with the problem of a person compelled to pay a flat price for the building of a house.  In this section, while the Minister may be right in saying he considers contractors' prices high, a fault lies with the Department in that their estimates of costs are outdated, particularly in the case of reconstruction.</P>
      <P>I can prove that prices estimated by the Minister's Department were anything from 30 to 40 per cent. below the actual cost of the work involved.  I am not blaming the inspectors who are tied down to the rates accepted by the Department, but the tragedy is that a person who has work carried out at a cost of £400 will find that he will get a grant of only one-third of what the Department estimated the work would cost, which could be as low as £300. This is not a new thing; it is a relic of old decency.  We have been told the figures will be revised and unless this is done immediately, very few people can hope to avail of reconstruction grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy and the House that a proposal to revise these scales of costs is at the moment under consideration in the Department.  The revised scale will be circulated to inspectors very soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is one scale which covers all cases fully and if there are areas where the work can be done for less, it can be taken for granted that the people at the top of the scale will not suffer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again refer to the fact that there has been no increase in the amounts of the grants.  The maximum grant remains at £280 in respect of a five-roomed house or 66? per cent., whichever is the lesser.  Another point I should like to mention is the painting of a house.</P>
      <P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that under subsection (6) painting is deemed to be decoration and accordingly does not qualify for a grant. The Minister should bear in mind that anyone who reconstructs or improves also paints and that painting is necessary to conserve the house and should be included as ordinary reconstruction. I should like to see the subsection amended on the Report Stage so that essential painting is included as reconstruction work.  It is good for the Department to encourage people to reconstruct, paint and decorate their homes so as to brighten up the countryside. Is that not what we are endeavouring to do?  This Bill, however, may be said to put a penalty on that type of work.  It is a deterrent in so far as the applicant is told that once he has done the building work, it does not matter about decoration. If he does it, he will get nothing for it. If he does not do it, he will still qualify for the reconstruction grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case that arises is that of one or more applicants living in a bad house but not likely to change their state of life.  They may be beyond marrying age but would like to have a house made habitable from their own point of view.  If they apply, no grant will be available until all essential work is carried out and the house completely reconstructed.  I understand the inspectors have instructions to that effect.  This may be a house in an isolated area not likely to be inhabited when the present occupants have gone and it might, perhaps, cost £700 or £800 to have all essential work carried out.  People in such circumstances cannot afford their portion of such an amount but would be anxious to have the house made habitable <Col N="3133" /> according to their own standards and would be willing to pay the lesser amount.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say they can avail of loans but these people are in very poor circumstances and in any case it is impossible, at least in Cork, to avail of loans, because, although the record of borrowers is excellent in Cork and there are no bad debts, it is difficult to get a loan.  I want an assurance from the Minister that people in the circumstances I have described can get the reconstruction they themselves require done.  I am sure the Minister has a number of such houses in Donegal and that every member of the House has met with that type of case.</P>
    <P>While making this plea, I agree that it is bad policy not to have a house properly reconstructed, and if a subsection is inserted to provide for the case I have in mind, it should be rigidly applied.  The number of cases involved should not be large as it is only where the Department's inspector feels that the house is not likely to be inhabited after the present occupants have gone that the provision would apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Heretofore, we had a different set of regulations obtaining in regard to Section 12 repairs and improvements grants as distinct from reconstruction grants.  There is no <Col N="3134" /> necessity to have local authorities certify that a house is fit for repair and improvement before the inspector from the Department of Local Government can call.  I understand that regulation has been abandoned.  If it has not, when the Minister is making regulations under this section, would he not provide that the necessary certification that the house is suitable for reconstruction be made by the officer of his Department?  There is no necessity to ask the county engineer to send an assistant to visit and examine the house.  It is quite easy for the Local Government inspector to do that on his first inspection.</P>
      <P>Another anomaly which I could never understand arises when a person applies for a repair and improvement grant.  The work has to be completed to the satisfaction of the Local Government engineer before any part of the grant is paid and naturally the Local Government grant must be paid before the supplementary grant issues. On the other hand, if one applies for a reconstruction grant and has half the work done, one gets half the grant from Local Government and if one applies and everything is in order, the supplementary grant comes along also. That puts a very unfair burden on the person trying to repair a house out of his own slender resources.  He has to provide all capital and have all the work completed before he gets any money.  I could not understand this divorce, why the Department take a different view of farm grants from their view in the case of people living in towns and villages, those in the categories of agricultural labourers and farmers.  I hope that when the Minister comes to make regulations under this section, he will get rid of this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Murphy that the estimates of the cost of work prepared by the Local Government inspectors are entirely unrealistic. They are completely divorced from realities.  I have often seen contractors examine these estimates and smile.  They say they would like to know where you would get somebody to carry out the work at the low estimate prepared by the inspectors.  The <Col N="3135" /> low estimate also has an adverse effect on persons hoping to qualify for a full supplementary grant.  More often than not, work that cost £500 was estimated by the inspector at between £380 or £400.  As a result, the applicant is deprived of a full supplementary grant, which he would get if the estimated cost of the work was three times the amount of the grant.</P>
    <P>A plea has been made to the Minister to take decoration into account in the carrying out of improvement or reconstruction work.  I hope some figure will be allowed for this.  When a house is improved, it requires the final polish in the form of necessary decoration.  Painting and decoration cost a lot now and some figure should be included for necessary decoration. As Deputy Murphy said, it helps preserve the life of the house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that a new estimates scale is being prepared in his Department. I would appeal to him to get it out to the local authorities as quickly as possible.  Further to what Deputy Carty and Deputy Murphy have said, the amount of the loan is dependent on the net amount which remains after the grant has been taken into account. That, of course, is based on the estimates prepared by the inspectors.  If the estimate is low and the amount of the grant is taken into account, the local authority will pay only a percentage of the balance of the net amount. Where these estimates have been badly framed, as they have been in the past, it has resulted in the amount of the loan available being insufficient.  People have to find from their own resources much more than they are able to provide.  It would be a great help, therefore, if the Minister would see to it that local authorities get this new scale as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to subsection (3), I think a case could be made for giving an increased reconstruction grant even to the smaller type of house.  There is a tendency for people to get a grant for the smaller type of house and find themselves precluded from obtaining further grants for a certain number of years.  A three-roomed house is <Col N="3136" /> certainly not a family type house, and at a later stage they find themselves having to add on a room.  Therefore, I think a good case can be made for the small type of house getting as large a grant as the others.</P>

Many Deputies know to their cost that it would take practically a full grant to paint a house, and we are not in a position to be quite so flaithiúil.  It might be regarded as maintenance but I do not think it could be regarded as repair or improvement in the correct sense of those terms.  To do so would be stretching the imagination a bit too far.  I do not think we could regard this type of external decoration as so important that we could devote public money to it when we are not in a position to grant money for other very meritorious purposes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jones referred to the restriction on second grants for the smaller type of house.  He suggested it prevented people from building the small type of house and that they were not able to build the larger type.  We have taken note of this situation and special facilities are now available to meet that type of case.  Where a young married couple start off by building the minimum size of house and they make application later for an additional room, the restriction on second grants, which normally applies over a ten or 15 year period, does not apply in such cases where the need is due to a growing family.  That is being taken care of. It appears in the Bill at a later stage but since the Deputy raised it, I thought I had better mention it now.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before section 4, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When an application for a repair grant is made to the housing authority the officers of that authority shall conduct the examination of such application, and will carry out the inspection of the work during its progress.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to change the system of supervision of work carried out under the repair grant.  As Deputies know, this is a two-legged grant.  Both the State and the local authority contribute the same amount.  The applications are made to the local authority, in the first instance.  The State examines and inspects, and then pays; then the local authority has to pay.  There are frequent complaints that the work done is faulty and there is at the moment no machinery in the local authority organisation for checking on these complaints.  As far as the members of the local authority are <Col N="3138" /> concerned, they live in areas where these jobs are done and one is, therefore, inclined to believe the allegations.</P>
    <P>The point is that such examination and such inspection could be better done by the local authority.  If it were, then the examination and inspection would be more frequent, more searching, and speedier.  Departmental inspectors' time would not be wasted.  If provision were made on the lines suggested, by arrangement between the Department and the local authority, control and inspection of this work would be more efficient and cheaper. After all, the officers of the local authority are stationed in the local authority headquarters.  There would be no question of subsistence and travelling allowances.  Queries could be dealt with very speedily by those living on the spot, so to speak.  I think the Minister should consider adding this new section to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  In our local authority, the Kilkenny Corporation, the local engineer inspects the work before a supplementary grant is given.  At the present time, therefore, we have two inspections, but we have to wait until the Local Government inspector comes and makes out his estimate.  Work would be much speedier if we were allowed to have our local engineer do the entire inspection work instead of sticking rigidly to the present system. There are, as I say, two inspections. The first is often delayed because it is a matter of the inspector having time and, when he does come, he does two or three inspections together.  The local authority officer could do them as they came into the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation, as we have known it, is that reconstruction grant jobs are not covered by the local authority officers, but Section 12 repair jobs have been and are being covered by the local authority, whose certificate of suitability for repair or improvement is a necessary part of the application to the Department.  In 1949&mdash;as far back as that&mdash;the implementation of these reconstruction grants was farmed out to the local authorities, but the experience of that <Col N="3139" /> system was not one which encouraged the continuation of that experiment.  It was terminated after a period of three years' trial because of not being a success.</P>
      <P>The Section 12 repair or improvement grants system was continued; it was left in the hands of the local authority.  What is proposed now is not that that will all cease, but, rather, that where it is expedient, in the opinion of the Department or the Minister, in order to improve an existing situation in any part of the country, power is being given under this Bill to have the work done; but we still have authority to allow the present situation to continue.  I might say at this stage, for the guidance of some of our bigger centres of population, such as Dublin, Cork, and perhaps Kilkenny, that the intention is that the existing system and procedure will, in fact, continue to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>But the local authority do not do any inspection of the work at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They actually inspect the proposed scheme and must certify for the work proposed and the manner in which the work will be done.  They must certify that the house on which the work is proposed to be done is suitable for the carrying out of such repair at a reasonable cost.  That is the measure of their inspection at the moment, together with what may well be their own affair, namely, their own building by-laws in the urban areas, plus any planning permission that may be necessary for external reconstruction or change.  All that has to be considered in the ordinary course of events, regardless of whether or not a grant is applied for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are taking this power of discretion on the part of the Minister for Local Government as to suitability for repair and reconstruction, but we are not precluding the Minister from farming out parts of the initial inspections to the local authorities in any case in which it appears that is the best and proper thing to do.  There is, however, the overriding power to take it back again where it is not, in <Col N="3140" /> fact, working satisfactorily and where there is not the expedition we require. Power is taken in this Bill to utilise the better of the two systems of operation in certain circumstances.  I do not think the House will object to our taking that freedom.  If things are not working well in any particular area for any particular reason, we can by-pass one system and do it ourselves. That is the change we are proposing here.  To accept Deputy Barry's amendment would be a reversion to a position which was not always satisfactory in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, I am satisfied.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new section empowering the Minister to make grants in cases in which grants have already been made under existing legislation.  These grants for reconstruction and repair will apply where damage has been caused by wind, rain or flooding, and where the works will be carried out not less than 15 years after the granting of the first grant, or, in the case of reroofing, not less than ten years.  In regard to these ten and 15 year limitations in this Bill, it is only fair to comment that these grants will be made available only where the damage has been caused by flooding or storm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now all these houses were, in fact, inspected by the Minister's inspectors in relation to the earlier grants.  Where the tenant purchaser is dependent upon inspections for a guarantee that the work carried out is of first-class workmanship, it is only fair, I think, that the examination should be more than a mere cursory look around.  I suggest that even the examination by the Minister's inspectors ought to be so thorough as to ensure that the tenant purchaser is getting a real job of work done.  If necessary, I would suggest that the Minister might abate the grant by £5 or £10, a nominal sum, to ensure that the inspection carried out is such as will ensure that the workmanship <Col N="3141" /> is first-class and that the materials used, and everything else, are the best possible under the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Jones, statutory effect is now being given to certain arrangements which we have been operating for a short period by stretching the law and by ministerial arrangement in relation to storm damage grants and other special grants.  We are giving legal effect and statutory authority to these procedures. The provision contained in this section in regard to these special arrangements is very necessary and will prove to be very useful.</P>
      <P>The storm damage grants, which have been brought to a head by experience of recent storm damage, are a very necessary part of our housing grants code.  The net effect, I should like the House to appreciate, is that where a grant is made for the purpose of the repair of storm damage, no cognisance is taken of when a previous grant may have been paid, nor does the payment of a grant in future have any regard to when a storm damage grant was paid.  So that, to all intents and purposes, in so far as the general regulations and the law are concerned, in respect of second grants, it is as if the previous grant never existed.  That in itself is quite a useful and very necessary feature of this code.</P>
      <P>In addition, we are giving special grants for the erection of bathrooms. Again, the 10 year or 15 year period mentioned elsewhere for the general application of second grants does not apply, provided, of course, the bathroom is not merely a converted existing room in the house; it has got to be an additional floorspace to the house; in other words, an additional room to an existing house, not merely conversion of an existing bedroom or some other room within the confines of the house as it exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned to Deputy Jones earlier the question of the provision of extra rooms to relieve overcrowding.  This is a very necessary part of our legislation. We are putting in here now, giving it statutory authority and weight, that additional rooms may be built where overcrowding exists.  Overcrowding <Col N="3142" /> usually arises and can create very great hardship where a young couple starting off build the minimum size three-room house and after four or five years find the house is bursting at the seams and there is no space.  The 10 year period is being designated.  An additional room built then can be paid for by way of grant of £50 and, of course, the general scheme of supplementary grants by the local authority may apply in like manner to that type of house.  A further room might, in a hypothetical case, become very necessary some years later and that additional room could be provided.</P>
    <P>By and large, what we are trying to do is to ensure that we do not force people to give up the idea of building a house, particularly young couples, because they know the minimum size house is likely to be too small for them in the future and as the law stood in the past, they would not be entitled to any grants for necessary extension. It is in order to relieve that to a large degree that we have designed this sort of building by instalment, as it were, when and as extra space becomes essential.</P>
    <P>Under those few headings, while we have been operating the provisions by stretching the law as it was, we are giving statutory authority, at the first opportunity we have had, which is this Bill, in order to secure their continuance and legality in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister mind having a look again at subsection (3), the subsection relative to the provision of bathroom grants? In order to qualify for a bathroom grant, a person must provide an extension to a house.  Take a house where there is sufficient space, which has, say, a spare room which the owner is anxious to convert into a bathroom and to provide the necessary equipment. Such a person should qualify for a grant.  It may be difficult in some cases to provide an additional room because space may be limited.  I have no doubt that in some cases it would be impossible to provide the additional room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That clause should be eliminated which provides that the work must involve an addition to the floor area. <Col N="3143" /> If there is sufficient floor area already or if there is a spare room which the owners are anxious to convert into a bathroom and to reconstruct to standard requirements, that should meet the requirements of Section 4.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to examine subsection (3) and possibly he may be able to amend it for the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point on paragraph (e) of subsection (1) of Section 4 I should make clear.  The special £50 bathroom grant indicated there is not payable if part of an existing house is used for the provision of a bathroom.  The special bathroom grant is not payable in those circumstances, no matter what case may be put forward.  But, if a person providing bathroom accommodation within his house qualifies in the normal way or, being a distance away from a water main or sewer, has to provide his own water supply and sewerage system, he is not debarred from providing the bathroom within the confines of the house and availing of the water grant and sewerage grant. To some degree, in fact, quite a large degree, while he may not be paid for the conversion of the room into a bathroom, he does qualify, subject to other conditions, for water and sewerage grants and possibly, supplementary water and sewerage grants.  So that, by and large, he is not just bereft of any support or assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that under existing regulations, a person who provides bathroom facilities in an existing room qualifies for a grant and, as well as that, the bathroom equipment is deemed to be reconstruction work and a grant is based on the cost of the equipment?  The conversion of an existing room into a bathroom and the equipment are taken into account in the estimation of cost, so that it appears that paragraph (e) of subsection (1) is a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I go with the Deputy this far: in discussing paragraph (e) of subsection (1), we are discussing the isolated bathroom grant.  I <Col N="3144" /> am sorry if I have confused anybody in regard to what has followed from Deputy Murphy.  If there is a reconstruction or general repair job being done in the house and part of that job includes the provision of a bathroom within the confines of the existing house, and bathroom fittings, toilet and so on, that does come within the general repair or reconstruction grant provisions in the matter of costings but does not qualify for the special bathroom grant which is payable only, and could be in addition, in respect of a net addition in floor space to the house by the provision of a bathroom.  The Deputy is quite right.  There was that other facility in the past and it is proposed to continue to incorporate that in reconstruction or repair work.  We are excluding, as we have been excluding, the application of the extra £50 special grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position in regard to this section.  It provides certain advantages in the rural areas but would it not be possible to offer the same concession to urban areas? Does the term &ldquo;county health district&rdquo; debar urban areas?  I presume &ldquo;county health district&rdquo; will debar areas like Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Limerick, but I would naturally be concerned about urban areas generally. Yesterday we were discussing the fact <Col N="3146" /> that many applicants there will not be able to avail of supplementary grants and apparently under this section a benefit which is being made available in other areas is being denied to them.  I should like to know from the Minister if that is the case.  I think it would be wrong if that is so and I hope it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right.  It is not intended that this Bill should apply to urban areas.  I shall explain why we came to that conclusion. As Deputies are aware, the local authority is normally obliged to secure the repair, closure or demolition of unfit houses.  We could not encourage any relaxation of that duty that is imposed on our local authorities as regards this very difficult and grave matter of removing and replacing unfit houses with proper housing or whatever you will.  We have had to take a very realistic view of the situation of the isolated house in respect of these special repair grants because the obligations that have been resting on our local authorities over the years in regard to unfit houses apply in these isolated areas just as they apply in the urban areas.</P>
      <P>While theoretically it was laid down that the local authority should do one of these three things I have mentioned, repair, close or demolish and replace unfit houses, in no matter what part of its functional areas they existed, hard economic facts dictated that, in practice, our local authorities did not demolish, close or repair unfit houses existing in out of the way, inaccessible places, occupied in many cases by people who are possibly the last of their line and whom nobody would follow in occupation of these houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in an effort to cope with the practical situation as we know it&mdash; that the local authorities have not been doing their duty, for the fairly good economic reasons I have suggested, of replacing such unfit houses in the circumstances I have outlined in the rural areas&mdash;that we are now proposing, where a house in a rural area is occupied by a person or persons who are unable from a financial point of view to do anything for themselves or are not in the financial <Col N="3147" /> position to enable them, together with the grants, to do the normal work that could be regarded as necessary repairs in a reconstruction job, that such cases be dealt with in an exceptional way, the exceptional way being that only necessary repairs will be insisted upon and that the general overall standards applying to ordinary reconstruction and repair grant cases will not be applicable.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the housing authority may supplement the grant from the Department of Local Government to whatever degree they wish or think is necessary to secure that some reasonable sort of accommodation will be provided in these extreme cases for the remaining years of an old couple or a single person.  In that way, we are trying to remedy what we have known to exist for a considerable time, a matter in which the local authorities have had a duty and which, for practical reasons, they have not got around to doing.  This is a method by which we hope to meet the most extreme of the hard cases to be dealt with.  This applies to houses in the rural areas and the reason it does not apply to urban houses should be obvious.  We cannot relax the duty imposed on housing authorities to rebuild and repair unfit houses in the urban areas. There is no reason, financial or otherwise, why they should not do their duty in the urban areas, for the reason that if they do repair a house which is unfit, that house will not be a dead loss to them when the occupiers have passed on.</P>
    <P>Such a house could be a complete dead loss if it were situated in an isolated rural area.  That is the reason we are excluding any of these necessary repair works in the urban areas and, instead, applying it to deal with a very special problem in a very little way, to ease in some way the desperate plight of some of our old people, particularly if they are living in an extremely bad condition in the out of the way rural districts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again ask the Minister to clarify the position even without having regard to the argument as between urban and rural <Col N="3148" /> areas.  The explanatory memorandum dealing with Section 5 mentions the owner of the house.  Unless I am very dense, I cannot anywhere see in the Bill mention of the owner of the house. All the way through, I see the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;.  In this case, are these grants being given to the owner or to the occupier?</P>
      <P>The Minister has also explained that there may be an old pair living in a house which was the family home for a long time.  There is no mention of that in the Bill.  The Minister, when speaking on the Second Stage, in Column 2094, Volume 196 said that where the local authority are satisfied that a certain amount of work could be done on a house which, in the normal circumstances, if that work was not done, would be unfit for habitation, they can give a grant towards that work.  The problem I have in mind in that connection is that of the county manager whom I have mentioned before.  I remember a case in Cork where the official served a Form 5 notice on the owners of a condemned house, gave them a certain time to appear in person to listen to his demands and when they were not lively enough to attend upon him, served a Form 6 on them.</P>
      <P>In that case, the owner would then have to go into court to meet that document.  Where such a position applies under this new type of grant where the local authority state that they believe that a certain amount of work is warranted on the house, they are then placed in the difficult position that they themselves, having condemned the house under Form 6, and if they are inclined to offer a supplementary grant, will have to go into court to have their own decision altered.  I have a horrible idea we will be up against all these things in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pretty hard on the owners of houses in the urban areas.  Here again the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; does not appear in the Bill.  The word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; is used all through.  If the old person is living alone and the owner of a house gets a grant for its repair when the old person dies, the owner may be able to make money out <Col N="3149" /> of that house even though it has previously been condemned by the local authority.  I should like the Minister to do something on Report Stage to clarify these matters.</P>

      <P>The section goes a little way to meet the case I put forward on Section 3 regarding the approval of grants for partial reconstruction work.  In this section, it is proposed to allocate a maximum grant of £80 from the State and £40 from the local authority making £120 in all. That is the maximum contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the few sections of the Bill that are helpful, but I can see difficulties ahead of any person making an application for such grants, whether his house is very isolated or not too isolated.  How are the applicants to be segregated?  What will happen in the case of a person living in a house that needs some repairs but that is not too bad?  I see great difficulty in applying the section.  Naturally there are bound to be a big number of applications and each person will be making his own case.  For instance, a man of 40 years of age will say: &ldquo;I am living in an isolated area.  I do not intend to get married.  I shall not do anything about this house as I do not require to do it.&rdquo; Then, he could get married and have a big family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought we would meet the situation by the Minister's agreeing to give grants for reconstructing the house in <Col N="3150" /> a partial way, in such a way as would meet the requirements of the existing inhabitants.  I realise that that would demand some contribution from the applicant.  I do not think it is such a bad thing that the applicant should make some contribution towards repairs, even though it is terribly difficult for him to do so or to get a loan. However, it might be possible to get a smaller estimate and to give a grant without any of the restrictions in Section 5, whether a person resides in a rural area or, in exceptional circumstances, in an urban area. Therefore, before we leave Section 5, I should like an explanation from the Minister as to the type of applicant who will qualify.  What yardstick will the local authority apply to distinguish between qualified applicants and non-qualified applicants and what other considerations will be taken into consideration?</P>
    <P>I can visualise many discussions at local authority housing meetings on this section.  You might have an applicant under this section who is capable of paying for repairs or who is capable of paying his contribution towards the repairs.  I think it will give rise to big difficulties.  I should like to hear the Minister on the type of applicant who is likely to qualify.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well appreciate the Deputy's expressed fears in regard to the misuse or the abuse of this section by those who would like to dodge the column, as it were, and to get a little more than they are entitled to or to get it a little easier or to be allowed off with doing the job less well than it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations will have to be made in this matter for the guidance of local authorities.  The first point is that the local authority will be required by my Department to certify the circumstances of any particular applicant who may come along to our Department or who, through the local authority's prompting, may come to us, and so on.  The problem has been brought to light, so far, of people who apply, specifying the amount of work that must be done and the estimate of the cost and who write back and say: &ldquo;The grant you are giving is all right <Col N="3151" /> and the supplementary grant from the county council is all right but there is £200 or £300 more work to be done and we have not got the money to do it.&rdquo;  That has more or less raised the problem.</P>
    <P>Merely because a man is 40 years of age and living in an isolated part of the country in no way entitles him to qualify.  That, and that alone, is not enough to qualify him for this minimum repair grant.  The person would be of the type who cannot do anything for himself or the amount that he could do for himself or the amount of money he could provide from his own resources, added to the total amount available, would still not do the job under the normal reconstruction or repair grant procedure.</P>
    <P>It is only when that stage has been reached that the question of whether or not an applicant would qualify for special repair grant consideration would arise.  The local authority, at that stage, by virtue of their knowledge and various other operations of which they are in control in their functional area, will be in a very much better position than any other agency to certify to my Department that a particular person lives in a house that is unfit at the moment.  They can certify that the person living there cannot do much for himself; that the financial resources are nil or next to it. They can certify that he cannot, because of physical incapacity or old age, do any actual work that would supplement the grants, as many country people do in these cases.  By and large they can certify that the applicant may be old or infirm, that his life span or expectancy is probably not very long. They can certify that the minimum repair&mdash;possibly the repair of the roof or even of half the house, most of which may now be falling down&mdash;to put the house into proper repair by way or roofing, new windows, doors, ceiling, and so on, would, in fact, while it could not be regarded as ideal or coming up to the normal standards of a desirable type of dwelling, nevertheless, in these types of circumstances, provide such a person or such persons <Col N="3152" /> in these very poor circumstances with a habitable home and shelter for probably the remainder of their days which, in the normal run, might not be very long altogether.</P>
    <P>It is for that type of general and exceptional hard case, for whom nobody has been able to do much in the past and for whom the local authority, for good, economic reasons, are not inclined to do much at present, and you cannot blame them, that we want to cater for here.  It is for that type of person who, for one reason or another, we have not been able to cater and who is not likely to be catered for through our normal re-housing by local authorities, and for whom grants in the past have not been sufficient, this type of section has been devised.  In general, that is the category to whom the section will apply.</P>
    <P>I do not visualise a widespread application of this section at all.  It is the hard case and the exceptional case that we hope to deal with under this section&mdash;not the letting-out of somebody, merely to let him out, or to give something to persons to which normally they would not be entitled.  That is not the intention of the section.  So far as I can regulate it or control it, through the local authorities, such a person will not get any benefit or be allowed away with anything under this section that the ordinary applicant throughout the country is not entitled to get under the general sections.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that to go into all and every aspect of the various circumstances which could add up to bringing about an operation under this section would not only be very difficult here in the House but would also be very lengthy and probably when we would be finished, we would still have left out various unthought of cases and circumstances.  To get a full picture, anyway, in a general sort of way, you could apply what I have said to your own area where you can see that such an operation under this section would be of immense help and in fact would be the only way in which you could help somebody in your district.</P>
    <P>I can see that this section might be <Col N="3153" /> of help where, as is not unusual in the country, a few neighbours of maybe an old man or an old woman or an old couple would come to their aid in doing vital repairs.  This would be of assistance to those few neighbours who in the past, indeed, may have done more than the grants would propose to do for these same old people.  It is there that I think we could look to these neighbours by giving them this encouragement and help through these grants.</P>
    <P>Those neighbours, with the aid of the supplementary amount from the council might, in fact, repair the house of the old couple whom they respect, whom they want to see remain in the district rather than see them go to the county home where they might have to arrive eventually for their own protection because of the state of the house.  It can be used and will be used to supplement the charitable instincts and practices of our people in rural Ireland who over the years have done a great deal of this type of work without any grants from the local authorities. Together with the local authority assistance we can do something to help hard cases.</P>

      <P>What are mentioned in the memorandum are typical circumstances and not necessarily the typical case or the only type of case.

As far as the actual section is concerned, the occupier is mentioned and, of course, the occupier may be only the owner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My worry arises because I believed it was an executive function.  I fear that the owner may be victimised because of the fact that there may be a large number of applications from occupiers of houses owned by other people and if the manager gets a lot of applications he will probably dig in his heels and do nothing.  Whereas it would be better if we could have it in such a way that we could help the occupier who is the owner of a house in a bad state of repair and who, through financial disability, was not able to repair the dwelling.  On the other hand, should it be the case that the occupier is not the owner and the owner leaves the house in a bad state of repair over the years, then, if we spend money on it, we are helping not the occupier but the owner.  I believe, as the Minister states, that very few cases will benefit but we should have it watertight and I suggest that between now and the Report Stage the Minister should consider the possibility of putting in &ldquo;owner-occupier&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I can follow the Deputy's line of argument, I cannot reach the same conclusions.  If we were only to have it owner-occupier we would then exclude many hard cases <Col N="3156" /> which probably we would like to include. How then would we deal with them?  The occupier in this section, as in all other sections of this nature, can only do these jobs with the consent of the owner so that to that degree there will not be an unreasonable spate of people applying because they have no responsibility for house repairs in somebody else's house.  Deputy Desmond has looked at it from a slightly different angle from the way I look at it.  If an occupier of a house, who is not the owner, is living under the most desperate conditions at the moment and the owner has not done anything about it over the years, then the local authority should have insisted that he do something about it, or have taken appropriate action against him.  If the local authority have failed to do that, and the stage is reached at which the house is of no real value to the owner and it would be unwise or uneconomic for him to spend money repairing it, he may get notice from the local authority that the house is not fit for habitation.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances, there would not be any real financial or commercial interest in the future ultimate clearance of the site.  In the rural areas where these types of operation are applied, the site may have some value to its occupier for a further number of years.  With uneconomic rent, the owner of the site is probably not caused great hardship because the site is not that valuable nine times out of ten, if it is of any value at all.</P>
      <P>Assuming we had reached the stage where the house is not owned by the occupier, where it is in a very bad condition, where it is in a condition of such a nature that its repair is not worthwhile from the commercial point of view, the owner cannot be reasonably expected to do anything about it.  In those circumstances, I can see the owner being only too happy to give his consent to the occupier getting a grant of this limited dimension from the Department, and with the assistance of the local authority supplementary grant, doing the minimum repair which the council is empowered to do under the subsection of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3157" /> I do not quite agree with the fears Deputy Desmond has expressed because it will be brought forward to the local authority, and the manager will decide it is too costly or that it is not worth doing anything about it.  I may be wrong, but I do not think that &ldquo;owner-occupier&rdquo; only would be fair, or would meet the considerations which I had in mind in designing the section.  Nor do I believe that by having &ldquo;owner-occupier&rdquo; only, and &ldquo;subject to the consent of the owner&rdquo;, it is likely that there would be an unprecedented clamour for this type of grant to a degree that would intimidate the local authorities from operating the scheme at all.</P>
    <P>After all, the local authority will be intimate enough with the financial considerations and the standing of the applicant and the actual condition of the house.  The circumstances in which a certificate can be sent forward by the manager to the Minister are very stringent and close-packed and a great number of them cannot possibly exist in which those unusual circumstances would be lined up and coinciding.  I do not think there could be so many cases in a county council area as would intimidate the council or the manager and prevent them from doing anything at all.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may have another view and he may be partially right, but I do not think he is fully right.  I quite agree there may be a lot in what he says, but my view is rather to minimise what the problems may be.  On the other hand, I think the Deputy's view is, may I say, exaggerated&mdash;not deliberately exaggerated&mdash;as against my rather conservative view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that both the Minister and I may be wrong, but from my own knowledge of the rural areas, I know cases in which the occupier is not the owner and the owner refuses to spend a shilling on putting the house into any fair condition. We are providing money for the benefit of the occupier&mdash;and that is right and proper &mdash; but we must remember that the occupier may be a man and his wife, an old pair, and the owner may refuse to do anything to <Col N="3158" /> the house.  If this Assembly, through the Minister, gave £80 for the improvement of the house, and if the local authority contributed to what was being done for the benefit of the occupier, perhaps in a few years, on the death of the occupier and his wife, the house would revert to the owner who had refused to put one penny into its improvement.  He would then be able to let it to other people at a rent of 5/- or 10/- a week.  That is what I want to get at.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that we must admit there are a few Shylocks in the rural areas as regards rent, just as there are in Dublin or Cork.  The owner who had refused to co-operate in spending anything on the improvement of the house could, on the death of the occupier, and on the house reverting to him, let his untenanted house to some other people and charge rent after perhaps a few hundred pounds had been expended on it between the State grant and the local authority grant.  That is what I am worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that in my first view of what the Deputy said I did not quite get what he was after.  I fully appreciate now the anxiety of the Deputy about the relationship between the owner and the occupier, and what he has in mind.  In the case instanced by the Deputy where the owner refuses absolutely to do anything with the house over the years and allows the house to fall into a bad state of repair, and an unfit condition, and is generally unco-operative, if a poor person who can do little or nothing for himself is the occupier, such a person may now bring to the house in which he is living the benefit of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Desmond has pointed out, the benefits may continue after his departure, through death or otherwise. It is the occupier, to a large degree, we are concerned with here, rather than the house.  I may say that is a fundamental difference between this section and any other section of our housing code.  We are usually concerned with the house but here, by and large, we are concerned with the occupant.  It is the circumstances of the occupant that can set in train the benefits of the section which will have <Col N="3159" /> the effect of having a few hundreds of pounds' worth of improvements done to the house.  The owner may have a Shylock disposition and have refused to do anything to the house and probably treated his tenant badly down the years.</P>
    <P>However, having reached the point where the present occupant has got the repairs done, here is the position as I see it.  If the house is in an unfit condition or could be regarded as being unfit, the chances are that it still could be and would be regarded in normal circumstances as unfit, and the local authority would no doubt have regard to the type of owner with whom they were dealing, and would undoubtedly, although they should not, have a recollection of the manner in which that owner had refused to co-operate in the past.</P>
    <P>Overall, the type of repair we are talking about is a minimum repair in connection with a house which is in a very bad way.  Undoubtedly, such repairs would be urgently necessary in order to render the house merely habitable and no more.  Even after these minimum repairs are carried out, it is unlikely most of these houses will be in a condition in which they could be let for a rent, and accordingly this rules out the possibility of a grasping owner, as Deputy Desmond said, making any money out of such a house. Our object in this section is to save an old person from being transferred to a county home or some such institution, or to save him from premature death from the effects of a leaking roof or a falling-off door&mdash;in order that he may die where he wishes to die.  I repeat that all that is intended here is the carrying out of minimum repairs and that when these repairs are carried out the house would still not be regarded as a fit tenement.</P>

In Dublin at the moment, the housing authority is looking after 600 elderly single people and 400 elderly couples, and the city manager says this section holds no interest for him because it will take him all his time to house the single people and the couples, all elderly, who are living in condemned houses at the moment.  The Minister says he would like the help of outside bodies in catering for these elderly single people and couples.  An elderly couple might be a man of 70 and his wife, aged 55, or an old man of 71 and his wife aged 61.</P>

At the same time, the Minister must examine the whole question of grants for these people in case local authorities might get the idea that people not so old could pay better than the very old people.  I am wondering if there is to be a differential renting system under this section, in which case there is a danger that local authorities would give preference to people not so old, who might be in receipt of up to £10 a week, over very old people who are getting only the old age pension.</P>

While it is undoubtedly true that in operations such as this, precautions will have to be taken and certain measures adopted by way of regulation and procedure so that there will be no abuse or exploitation of the elderly people concerned, on the one hand, or of the local councils and the Department, on the other, as far as the grant moneys are concerned, to put in a specific age, whether it be 70, 65, 60 or 55, would in fact create untold difficulties in the future.  A couple, one of 80 years of age and the other of 59 years of age, would have to be segregated if this amendment were adopted.  So would an old fellow of 80 and his wife of 59. These are the types of extreme circumstances that could arise, if we applied an age limit.  It could cause great difficulty and throw up sufficient anomalies to render it necessary to bring the Bill back to the House for amendment later.</P>
      <P>I do not think the stipulation of age is necessary.  In fact, I think it would tend to strangle the intention of the section and therefore I would not recommend the amendment to the House.  The general idea underlying the amendment is, of course, that there should be some precautions so that abuses would not arise.  On that point, I can do no more than assure the House that we propose in the Department to devise whatever precautions we think necessary, and even go so far as to advise local authorities as to what precautions they should take to avoid exploitation or abuse under the section. I suggest that the amendment, though well-intentioned, would probably cause more difficulty than assistance and I do not think it would achieve what those who proposed it have in mind.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the difficulty but I should like the Minister to see our difficulty also.  Much of this business will finish up by regulations made by the Minister but these <Col N="3162" /> regulations, unfortunately, will be made at a time when this House will not be sitting.  They will be tabled in the Library for so many days at a time when Deputies may not have an opportunity of seeing them.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is going to bring in anything that may be obnoxious to anybody here, but we are at a disadvantage in discussing a measure, particularly a Housing Bill, where so much is tied up with regulations. I was not the member of my Party who wished to insist on an age being fixed.  Young people may consider a man of 60 to be very old, while a lively man of that age may deem it an insult to be considered elderly.  Under the circumstances we shall have to leave the matter as it is and I withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 8, line 50, after &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(which in order to qualify for a grant must contain at least a living-room, a bedroom and a toilet and must have cooking facilities in a room other than a bedroom)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment makes clear what we have in mind.  We feel there should be some definite stipulation in the regulations as to what must be done to avail of the grants from the Department and from the local authority.  The Minister made it clear that the main objective is to cover philanthropic or charitable organisations who may be able to help but the Bill does not define these people.  I can well imagine certain people looking ahead and seeing the advantage of buying four or five houses and converting them and, as far as I can see, there is nothing in Section 6 to prevent them from having each room considered as a separate dwelling.  I may be wrong about that.  I can only read the Bill and say what it means to me.  Surely, we should get away from the position of these elderly people having a so-called dwelling for which the owner gets a substantial State grant and probably a local authority grant as <Col N="3163" /> well.  I do not always favour regulations but I think there is good reason for a stipulation that the dwelling should contain a living room, bedroom and toilet and have proper cooking facilities in a room other than a bedroom. If £300 is being given by way of grant and another grant given by the local authority and if we are anxious to help these elderly people to have a dwelling, we should make sure that what they get will be a dwelling which will be a real benefit to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the section.  I thought the grant would only be given in the case of three rooms.  If that is so, it covers the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it there is some misunderstanding.  It was argued earlier that if it is proposed to give a grant for the housing of elderly people they would not need three rooms.  It was argued that if they had to get three rooms probably people would not bother to provide dwellings at all as they would be too expensive for elderly people.  It was suggested that one or two rooms would suffice.  In fact, local authorities provide only one room for elderly persons and even a person living in a condemned house can only get one room from the local authority. I take it the Minister is not giving £600 to anybody to build a room.  I think the Minister should explain the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a very grave misconception of who may qualify to draw these grants from the Department or the local authority.  I think it was said earlier that if we do not have some very stringent statutory regulations in regard to the number and size of the rooms we shall have speculators moving in to take advantage of the maximum £600 they may get for these relatively small dwellings, as they might be, and as a result we might have speculators battening on prospective tenants by charging a fairly substantial rent for such accommodation <Col N="3164" /> to the cost of which £600 had been subscribed from public funds.</P>
      <P>The very fundamental matter in this provision which is misunderstood is that the body that may get such grants must be approved by the Department of Local Government.  It is not just any speculator chancing his arm trying to get more money than he would otherwise be entitled to by providing inferior living accommodation, herding old people into it and charging them exorbitant rents.  That cannot happen.  The first real stumbling block is that before a body can avail of these grants it must be approved.  In addition, there may be further restrictions as regards what the local authority may do in respect of supplementary grants and conditions suggested to them attaching to the payment of those grants.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the amendment. As in the case of the previous amendment, I think that to have a statutory minimum would tend to defeat the object of the proposers.  Such a requirement might defeat the type of development that might eventuate from what we are discussing.  A building may be provided from the ground up or converted from existing structures, by some charitable or philanthropic organisation.  That might incorporate, instead of a separate sitting-room for each tenant, a communal room with entertainment such as television and so on included.</P>
      <P>It could well happen that by writing in these minimum requirements here we would hinder the availability of money to the philanthropic and charitable societies in question. Accommodation could be provided for these groups of elderly people in much more congenial surroundings than their own small sitting-rooms. Therefore, the very fact of putting in these minimum requirements statutorily might defeat the purposes of the section.  I am not giving that as a complete answer but I am giving it as an example of how this amendment might be restrictive and a hindrance rather than a help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as suggesting that a communal room in a large tenement type structure, with <Col N="3165" /> cubicles for the elderly people, is my ideal of what they should have; but it could well be that a communal sitting-room, heated, and with various types of entertainment and, perhaps, supervised could in some circumstances be far more acceptable than separate small sitting-rooms where the old people are isolated in their own quarters.  I am not suggesting that would be the best way of dealing with all cases, but I am giving an example of how this amendment could be a stumbling block rather than a help.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not specified it yet.  Deputies are rightly somewhat uneasy that it is not specified, but I think they will agree with me in refraining from specifying particular accommodation as a minimum standard. We are talking in the dark in this matter.  Until we get propositions from charitable and philanthropic organisations, it would be unfair to lay down at this stage conditions which may tie them in advance.  I, personally, would have as much regard for the well-being of our old people as anybody else and, as Minister for Local Government, I would have more than usual concern for how they are housed.  While there is great latitude in this section, any Minister for Local Government must exercise his mind to see to it that there is no abuse by anybody, charitable organisations and others, so far as herding people into uncomfortable accommodation is concerned. No Minister would encourage that, but we cannot restrict proposals in advance by laying down now minimum requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not anxious to divide the House on this if we can possibly avoid it.  The Minister says he does not want his hands tied.  On this matter I am not speaking merely of the present Minister.  When this becomes law, it is law and no more about it.  Some people are not slow to use interesting names for charitable <Col N="3166" /> and philanthropic purposes.  A case may be put up which appears genuine and watertight but these people may be financial vultures.  It would be dangerous to leave the position stand as it is.  If the Minister is approached now by representatives of genuine charitable organisations, all he can say to them is: &ldquo;Go ahead and prepare your plans.  Give me an idea of what you are going to do and then we will discuss business.&rdquo;  Surely, from a business point of view, it would be better that they could be given a rough idea of the type of scheme they should prepare for the Minister's consideration? All we have at present is the fact that one room can be considered as a dwelling.</P>
      <P>Is there any possibility that the Minister could give us some indication that he would be willing to adopt a middle course?  We are being asked to give £300 for the housing of elderly people, and local authorities are being asked to contribute also, yet we have not the foggiest idea of what type of dwelling it will be.  I do not agree with that.  The Minister and myself have one thing in common.  We have a fair knowledge of rural conditions.  In discussing this we should not confine ourselves to the position in Dublin, Cork and other cities.  This would apply also in the large towns.  I know the mentality of the elderly people in the towns.  They do not want a room for a home and a large communal kitchen. If they meet a friend, they want to be able to invite that friend into their own home, where they can sit down and have a cup of tea and a chat or where the men can have a drink.</P>
      <P>I would not like the communal kitchen. It may be all right in Dublin and Cork, but not in the rural and urban areas.  We know that in the last century, around 1848, or thereabouts, a communal kitchen meant something very different from what it means to-day. To a large extent, however, we have not quite lost the earlier import of that term.  I suggest to the Minister that we may possibly avoid dividing on this section if, between now and the Report Stage, the Minister tries to meet the situation and improve on it.</P>

      <P>Before we go any further on this, here we are talking about £600 free money.  In regard to both the Local Government grant and the supplementary grant, part of the moneys may be paid.  Arrangements may be devised subsequently by the Department and the local authorities as to how much of the £300 should be paid in each case.  There may be certain conditions in relation to the number of rooms, the over-all floor space, and so on.  Control can be exercised by relating the grants to what is, in fact, being provided.  It will not be a matter of simply throwing out £600 for certain minimum standards.</P>

      <P>The kind of organisation the Minister envisages doing this kind of charitable work belongs, I think, largely to the 19th Century. There are some surviving organisations of the kind described.  I gathered from the Minister on Second Reading that he will consider the proposal that a local authority should avail of this section for the purpose of converting suitable buildings to this kind of accommodation.  I should like the Minister to speak on that aspect again because that is a way in which some progress could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are suitable buildings in every city and big town where 25 or 30 single or married aged people could be provided with sensible and reasonable living space.  These people do not want elaborate single dwellings. Two-roomed flats, with toilet facilities, would serve their purpose.  All of us who serve on housing committees are aware of the difficulties of finding shelter for these people.  There is an old charity in Cork.  It is a 16th Century charity and the building is now very old.  It is one of the drawbacks at the moment in that kind of charity.  Up to 25 or 26 people are provided with single rooms.  The fabric of the building is now in a state of collapse and the charity will require £5,000 or £6,000 to restore it.  I do not know whether they could be dealt with under this Bill.  None of the dwellings in that building&mdash;separate rooms with a common toilet for five or six&mdash;would qualify under the <Col N="3168" /> ordinary grant system.  It is a question of letting the building be demolished or restoring it.  That is the kind of pragmatic approach involved.  If we can save these old buildings in order to provide homes for these people, then I think we should do that.  I should be glad to hear from the Minister that he is prepared to allow local authorities to take the initiative in matters like this instead of leaving it to organisations.  Most of these charities are 19th Century.  There are not many of them left now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure the Minister is endeavouring to work out something that will be of some benefit to these people.  I do not support the amendment, but the Minister seems rather to be asking for a blank cheque: &ldquo;Just agree to this now.  I will give you the details later when I have worked them out.&rdquo;  When we talk about charitable organisations, I do not think anybody will suggest that the State is a charitable organisation. Now there are very expensive flatlets, consisting of one room and the usual amenities.  I think the term &ldquo;communal kitchen&rdquo; is a bad way of expressing it.  &ldquo;Diningroom&rdquo; might be a better word.  Charitable organisations are of various kinds and classes. There might also be new charitable organisations formed on the lines of the utility society suggestion.  If existing organisations are in need of funds for reconstruction, I am sure the Minister would consider them.  Old people do not want three-roomed flats.  They would not have the energy to keep them.</P>
      <P>We have sent representatives all over the Continent to study housing. They have benefited by their experiences.  The Vienna project in relation to old people is pretty well established.  There is nothing communal about it even though certain numbers are housed in the one building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to tenant purchase houses, deficient of toilet accommodation, £600 will not go very far from the point of view of reconstruction. Money seems to mean nothing here. Yesterday we had a good deal of talk <Col N="3169" /> about building a house for £1,400. That figure does not impress me in the slightest.  I am sure the Minister's intentions are good but I am not sure that if, tomorrow, a group of people formed themselves into X charitable society for the housing of the aged and made representations to a Deputy of this House to approach the Minister, they would find themselves in a very satisfactory position.</P>
    <P>What would they have to do initially?  What is in the Minister's mind?  What would they have to provide? Flatlets with a communal diningroom are just another kind of hotel.  The Minister says he does not want people to take advantage of this. Surely the local authority in the first instance, with their technical and other experts, would submit their findings to the Minister for his approval?  Surely that should be enough?  The Minister says not to worry about that.  He has to give his sanction.  But we have nothing definite.  This is just a formality.  If we could get more flatlets, there would be some hope.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sherwin says, we will have to wait another ten years before we can house the people of this city. I do not know whether the conditions are any worse in other places but it puts my blood pressure up to hear people talking about the building boom being finished or saying that we have nearly reached our target.  Deputy Sherwin has given figures cited by the City Manager.  We require new buildings rather than reconstructed buildings. The Minister for Local Government was not in office when Dublin Corporation reconstructed Gardiner Street, may be to save a facade.  What have we got?  Only expensive slums again, nothing more than that.  We require properly constructed flats and all the grants that can be given for that purpose.  That is the answer, not the reconstruction of old buildings.</P>
    <P>A separate grant to charitable organisations to bring their premises into a habitable condition would be a laudable provision but I do not approve of the idea that a person, charitable, philanthropic or perhaps keen on business, should be allowed to acquire any of these tenements for reconstruction. <Col N="3170" /> I should like the Minister at this stage to state that he will not approve of anything in the way of housing that provides fewer amenities than the type of local authority houses he has approved of in the past.  That would answer Deputy Desmond.</P>

He has brought that on himself because during the Committee Stage, he has not been inclined to debate the Bill as it should be debated and to give the information legitimately required by Deputies.</P>
      <P>It is peculiar that this section should be inserted in the Bill without some idea being given to the House as to what regulations are likely to be drawn up governing approval for grants under the section.  Surely the Minister and his advisers have some idea as to what the regulations will be?  There is no definition of separate dwellings in the section.</P>

      <P>Assuming a person buys a building which could be converted into 15 separate dwellings, within the meaning of the Bill that person could draw from public funds £9,000.  The Labour Party endeavoured by an amendment to secure minimum requirements for payment of a grant but the Minister has ignored that amendment and has not given the House any information other than evasive statements as to why it should be ignored.  Before we would agree to the passing of Section 5, we should have more definite information as to what the regulations are likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to house the elderly people by means of grants from public funds of £6,000 to speculators, as they could very well be, even though it is assumed, at least by the Minister, that applications would be more or less confined to charitable or philanthropic organisations or religious bodies?  There is nothing in Section 5 to preclude any person from applying for a grant. <Col N="3171" /> There may be some few persons around Dublin who have big houses capable of conversion into separate dwellings. It would be a very good way of disposing of such houses.</P>
    <P>The provision of accommodation for elderly people is a difficult problem in some areas at present, but would it not be better or more advisable to make money available to local authorities for the provision of suitable accommodation for such people rather than by the method proposed in Section 5?</P>
    <P>The Minister is not measuring up to his duties as Minister.  He is not giving the House a clear definition of the meaning of separate dwellings or an indication of the regulations that will be drawn up, if this section is implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has asked for power to decide the conditions, depending on what efforts are made.  In that connection, I want again to refer to the question of rents. In Dublin, the local authority will let a one-room flat comprising a kitchen, a sittingroom and a bathroom, for 12/6 a week.  That is all the local authority charges.  If a person is an old age pensioner, the rent can be as little as 2/6. Supposing grants are given to bodies to provide accommodation for elderly people, what rents will be charged? Assuming an elderly person is employed and pays 25/- a week and becomes unemployable, an old age pensioner, how can he pay 25/-?  Will he be evicted?  I want to know if the Minister, before he agrees to the grant of £600, will lay down conditions as to what the rents will be and that there will be some form of differential rents so that people will not be thrown out if they cannot pay the rent that may be sought in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It amazes me that such heat can be engendered by Deputies against the general background of the opinions they have been expressing here continuously for the past couple of hours.  The suggestion is made that the grants proposed in this section are so generous as to induce sharks of all <Col N="3172" /> descriptions to make money by converting private houses, no matter how small, for elderly people and that it will be a paying racket.  Do Deputies not realise that the latest costings in Dublin city show that, for the minimum flatlet provided, the price is approximately £1,500 and that, I gather, is in a flat block.  Even if there were £600 freely thrown out to be picked up by speculators, sharks and all the others we are told are lurking waiting to avail of this section, where do they get the rest of the money and in what way will they make a profit in providing another minimum £600 or £900 themselves in order to provide even the barest and smallest allowable space that up to the present has been provided by Dublin Corporation?</P>
      <P>Where are these people?  Is it not clear that there is in this section an attempt by the Department and the Government to encourage certain organisations, and indeed, even to bring certain organisations into being where they do not exist, to do work for the housing of the elderly people of this country that we have failed and abysmally failed to do over the years through our local authorities and through our other efforts?  In asking the House to approve this section I am asking for it merely as an effort to help in some little way to do this work and to encourage philanthropic and charitable organisations to carry out this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that in operating this proposed section we should spell out to the last letter all the conditions under which these benefits should be given.  Let us be quite frank about this.  We in the Department do not know, nor do the people in this House who have been talking know, exactly what is involved.  None of us has had experience of housing this type of people throughout the country so that we could come into this House and lay down stringent regulations as to how the benefits of the section should be applied.  It is because of our lack of success in this matter and our lack of experience as a result of that lack of success that I propose this section and ask that it be not hedged in with regulations which none of us is competent to draw up due to our <Col N="3173" /> ignorance and inexperience, never having done anything worthwhile in the matter in the past.</P>
    <P>Leaving that consideration aside as to why we do not want to make regulations which might prove to be a hindrance rather than an encouragement, let me deal with the fears about exploitation.  The Minister for Local Government must first approve of the group or person as the case may be. The fact that the approval of the Minister for Local Government regardless of who he is or in what circumstances he acts, is required surely is one of the prime safeguards against exploitation, against the &ldquo;sharks&rdquo; or the speculators even if there were something in this for them commercially, although I do not believe there is.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is in this section no provision that would compel the Minister for Local Government to pay even to an approved body the full £300 for anything they may provide. It is only up to £300 the Minister and his Department may pay out under this section.  They may pay less and probably will pay less in certain circumstances if the accommodation being provided is more easily provided, provided more cheaply or is less attractive than might be the proposals of some other body.  There is that discretion there which no doubt will be used when necessary.</P>
    <P>On top of that, in regard to the other £300 about which we have talked and heard so much, adding up to this mythical £600 that is there for the speculator to make a racket out of, this other £300 is to be given only at the discretion of the local authority. If they do not want to pay any of it they need not.  In drawing up their regulations under which they may pay any part of the £300 they may and will insert conditions in order to safeguard their interests in this matter. Indeed, I foresee and probably will advise local authorities to go so far as to indicate that if the dwelling accommodation provided with the assistance of a supplementary grant from the local authority be used for a purpose other than that for which it <Col N="3174" /> was designated the persons so doing will be obliged to pay back to the local authority what they got from them.  There are many other conditions far too numerous to mention which may arise or have to be contemplated and with which I do not intend to weary the House.  However, I do assert there is no danger whatever of exploitation.  If some Deputies seem to see such a danger, it may be attributable to the fact that we are here so long and that some of them may be suffering from hallucinations due to hunger from which I am also likely to suffer.  Those may be the extenuating circumstances for the unreal fears that were expressed but, as I have said, none of us has had sufficient experience of housing this type of people and, therefore, we cannot feel competent to determine strictly the regulations under which grants may be payable for this purpose.  By so doing we might stymie charitable and philanthropic organisations whom we hope to attract by this provision.</P>
    <P>As regards communal kitchens, and so on, I did not mention them.  I spoke about communal rooms for television and other entertainments.  I did not suggest communal kitchens or communal cooking arrangements.  I was merely instancing that as one reason why we should not be tied down by the proposed amendment to such an extent as to spell out the minimum requirements for a room.  I tried to show how such a spelling out of conditions could defeat what might otherwise be an attractive proposal from some of these organisations.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter raised by Deputy Barry which he also raised on the earlier stages of the Bill, we hope it will be feasible that some organisation or other may take over a large or medium-sized building and by conversion, repair and reconstruction provide&mdash;and that is what the Bill says, &ldquo;provide&rdquo;&mdash;dwelling accommodation for elderly people.</P>

      <P>If the local authority wishes I see no reason why it cannot set itself up and be accepted by the <Col N="3175" /> Minister for Local Government as an approved body.  In fact, I see no person or group better placed to co-ordinate the various activities in housing generally, the utilisation of housing sites and the planning of such building on these sites.  That could work eminently well and I do not think anybody would regard the local authority as likely to abuse its situation and make a racket out of this as has been suggested here. The local authority would appear to be an excellent type of body to constitute its total membership as a charitable or philanthropic organisation because they would be able to co-ordinate their efforts in that connection with their efforts in the general direction of rehousing the people in their area.</P>
      <P>I did suggest, on the earlier stages of this Bill, that we would have to encourage the sub-committees of our local authorities, such as the old age pension committees, to act in this way. They would be in a position to determine the age of the old age pensioner and as such they would be in a position to set themselves up as a philanthropic society to promote housing for the aged.  Taking into consideration the need for some advance in regard to housing the elderly, the lack of success in the past in this matter, and also having regard to the fact that the total grant, subject to conditions imposed by the local authorities and the Minister for Local Government, concerning such reconstruction is only £600, the idea of somebody exploiting the situation and getting away with it cannot merit any great attention.  The suggestion is that if we can do some good in this matter so much the better. It cannot do any harm.  I cannot see what damage the effect will have on the national Exchequer or on the finances of any county council.</P>

      <P>In column 2250 of Volume 156 the Minister mentions a suitable occasion on which the county council, through its sub-committees such as the old age pensions committee, could act as approved societies. I cast no aspersions in any way on any old age pension committee.  I am a member of one myself but we could not hope to make a success of this by arranging for the members of an old age pensions committee to operate as an approved society.  It just would not work.  It is only now that the Minister has indicated the possibility of all the members of a local authority being brought into it in the form of an approved society.</P>
      <P>In column 2251 of Volume 196 on the Second Stage the Minister was questioned by Deputy Barry, who asked: &ldquo;How would the Minister define dwellinghouse?&rdquo; The Minister replied that there was no definite definition and that it was a matter he would look into.  He said he could assure the House that it would be reasonable accommodation for the aged.  Now, on the Committee Stage, I really did believe that the Minister would be able to give us some clear indication of what had been considered on this matter by him and his advisers between the time they were questioned on the matter by Deputy Barry and now.  It is still as vague as it was in the beginning. It might be a bed sittingroom with a kitchenette and sanitary facilities. That might mean that a large number of families might have a bed sittingroom and that they would all avail of the facilities of a kitchenette and sanitary facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to tie the Minister to the word &ldquo;communal&rdquo; but if the Minister wants to adopted a different attitude from that which he has adopted since 11 o'clock this morning, we will welcome it.  He stated in this column that these people may avail of the facilities of a kitchenette and the sanitary facilities but the fact is that this Bill is now the property of the House.  It is no longer the property of the Minister or of the officials of his Department.  If <Col N="3177" /> this Bill is a failure, it is not the Minister for Local Government who must accept responsibility for it and it would be no use for us to blame the Minister or his officials.  The obligation is on us to do as much as we can to help the Minister and his officials.  I agree with what the Minister has at long last said to us, that there is a possibility of the members of local authorities being brought in under this category of approved societies. That may do some good.</P>
      <P>However, there is nothing to prevent some group coming along and using the name of some charitable or philanthropic nature and there is nothing to say what rent they may charge or may not charge.  Why should the Minister later blame us if anything should go wrong in view of the fact that the House will be adjourning shortly?  Regulations may be made and tabled in the House and if we are not here to examine them it may be too late to do so afterwards.</P>
      <P>In this instance I am offering constructive criticism and nothing else.  I am one member who has signed this amendment and I believe that if we start off by accepting as members of approved societies the full membership of local authorities we may be able to do some good and we may be able to help to keep the sharks who will come to the surface from doing the harm we are afraid they will do.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Desmond has misunderstood the situation.  He has said that it was only to-day that I came out with the suggestion that members of a local authority could form themselves into an approved society.  It is not recently I suggested that a local authority could operate in that way and I did not think it was necessary that it should be said that a local authority could become a philanthropic organisation. In fact, I think it is evident to everybody that by their very nature local councils would obviously be a group likely to be acceptable to any Minister for Local Government.  I should like to go back to a point I referred to here on 12th July last and reported at <Col N="3178" /> column 2250, Volume 196 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>As far as local authorities are concerned, I have been thinking that, in fact, every local authority has a pension committee with several sub-committees radiating from it.  It might be in the interests of the county council and the pensions committee, as well as the pensioners, where there are no suitable organisations or philanthropic societies, for the county council, through its sub-committees and pension committees, to set themselves up to do this work.</P>
      <P>My understanding of a pensions committee is of a body made up of the total membership of a county council. A pensions sub-committee would be drawn from some members of the council.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy has not the faintest idea of what I am talking about.  He was not here when the matter was mentioned.  The entire county council is represented on the pensions committee and, therefore, could act as a charitable or philanthropic society.  The pensions committee to my mind is distinct from a pensions sub-committee or any other sub-committee of a county council which might have members from outside the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>One was led to assume from an earlier statement of the Minister that legislation passed through this House could not be defective.  He mentioned possible abuses on the part of some sharks who might exploit certain sections of this measure.  In Committee here we try as far as possible to go over the Bill, section by section, and see that abuses do not arise.  Unfortunately, as far as this section is concerned, the Minister has told us he is not too sure about it &mdash;that we will just pack this section into the Bill and hope for the best.  I believe the Minister and the Department erred badly in this matter by bringing the measure into the House without any idea of what regulations they propose for the implementation of this section.  The Minister cannot expect Deputies to co-operate with that frame of mind.  Surely there was an obligation on him to give us much more information than he has given?</P>
      <P>The main safeguard the Minister sees in this measure is that he himself must approve of grants and any person who may be trying to exploit the provision will not be approved.  I assume, when this legislation is enacted, it will be equitably applied and that under it any citizen is entitled to apply for a grant and have his application examined under the terms of the Act.  There is nothing to preclude the owner of a big house applying for a grant to convert that house into dwellings and collecting up to £600 in grants in respect of each dwelling and letting such dwellings to elderly people with no limitation as to the rents chargeable.  So far the Minister has given us no indication that he will limit the rents that may be charged by societies availing of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret having to make such comments but if we give the Minister Section 5 on this Stage when the Bill comes before us on Report Stage he should have some more definite information about this section than he now seems to have.  He should discuss in the interval with his advisers how the section will be applied and be able to give the House some idea of the regulations that will be drawn up for its <Col N="3181" /> implementation.  As public representatives, we cannot give blank cheques. We had the same difficulty with another Minister yesterday and generally, so far as the Government are concerned in bringing measures to the House, they must present with them the detailed information that is required by Deputies before a decision can be reached.</P>

      <P>I am loath to continue this rather nebulous discussion which is based on assumptions, misconceptions and misunderstandings&mdash;everything except what is in the section. The basis for the greatest fear Deputy Murphy has does not even exist, that is that a person owning a large, useless house at the moment can get £600 in grants to convert it into makeshift accommodation to be rented to elderly people such as pensioners at exorbitant rents.  In the first place a person cannot get a grant at all under this section for any of the purposes the Deputy mentioned.  A person does not qualify.</P>

      <P>The Minister states that no individual will qualify for a grant when this Bill is passed. Some 15 minutes or a half-an-hour ago he told the House that the term &ldquo;body&rdquo; in Section 6 (1) meant any group of people, charitable organisation, public body or an individual.  I am assuming from the Minister's interpretation that an individual can qualify and I want to know whether that is so.  The Minister has said now that such a person could not qualify. Can an individual owner of a building suitable for conversion into dwellings qualify for a grant within the scope of this section?

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the standard requirements in man-days per animal or per acre of crops, etc., as set out in the British White Paper &ldquo;Assistance for Small Farmers&rdquo;, applied to the stocking and cropping date for Irish farms as given by the 1960 Agricultural Statistics Enumeration, it is estimated that the &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; in question <Col N="3185" /> in that year amounted to 66.47 million man-days.  It must be stressed, however, that these standard labour requirements are not applicable to Irish farming conditions where the degree of mechanisation is not so high and farms are generally smaller, and more labour would be required.  The corresponding number of man-years depends very much on the figure taken to convert man-days to man-years and this is influenced by climatic and other considerations.  In the Report on Small Western Farms a figure of 280 man-days per year was arbitrarily taken, since the main object of the compilation was to compare farms of different sizes in the four provinces.  If this figure is used the aggregate number of man-years required in 1960 was 237,400 as compared with 382,800 males engaged in agriculture as returned at the 1960 Enumeration, but it is necessary to emphasise that the assumptions on which this figure is based are of such a character as to deprive it of any real significance.</P>

      <P>The Quarterly Report on Vital Statistics for the December Quarter, 1961, was published on 13th April last.  The Quarterly Report for the March Quarter, 1962, was published on 6th July.  It will be noted that the anticipated dates of publication in both instances were fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of the Quarterly Reports, the population is estimated as in April of each year.  As the Census of Population was taken on 9th April, 1961, the figure for the population given in each of the two Quarterly Reports referred to is the figure given in the preliminary report on the Census.  This figure was 2,814,703. <Col N="3187" /> The figure of the estimated population in April, 1962, will be published in the Quarterly Report for the June Quarter, 1962.

      <P>As I have already explained in my reply to the Deputy's previous question on 14th February last, the general scheme for the reconstruction <Col N="3189" /> of St. Joseph's Home, Stranorlar, approved by my Department, is being planned to be carried out in two stages; firstly, the building of a new single storey extension to contain the new chapel and accommodation for 98 chronic sick patients together with the necessary ancillary services and, secondly, the reconstruction of the main buildings.  Planning of the first stage is now well advanced.  Working drawings for the new extension have been approved subject to certain modifications and final plans for the mechanical and electrical services are in course of preparation.  Bills of Quantities will now have to be prepared. Everything possible is being done to expedite the completion of the plans and other relevant documents so that the health authority will be in a position to invite tenders for stage I of the scheme during the next few months.</P>
      <P>I am aware, as I already stated in my reply to the Deputy's previous question, that conditions and facilities for patients in this Home are far from satisfactory by modern standards and must be improved substantially.  The need to provide improved heating in the Home in time for next winter has received particular attention.  Additional heaters have been installed and these should help to improve the situation materially.  Arrangements have also been made by my Department for an early conference with officers of the health authority and their technical consultants to determine what additional temporary measures could appropriately be taken to provide further improved heating, pending the installation of a permanent central heating system as envisaged in the comprehensive reconstruction scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary, in order adequately to answer the Deputy's questions, to recount briefly the facts in this case. On 23rd January last, the parents of a 13 months old baby took the child to see their family doctor.  He was out on a call at the time of their visit and they continued on to the Galway Regional Hospital.  They arrived at the Paediatric Department at about 3 p.m.  They informed the staff nurse whom they saw there that the child had been constipated for three days, that she was irritable and was not feeding very well.  They gave the same information to the nurse in charge and to the House Physician.  The child had been discharged, cured, from this Department of the hospital only a few days previously and the doctor was familiar with her medical history. He questioned the mother closely about the symptoms and put a number of questions to her about the child's health, including whether the child had had a convulsion, any cough, hoarseness or pain.  The mother replied in the negative to these questions.  The doctor reported that during this time, the child was sleeping quietly in her mother's arms, her colour was good and there was no evidence of respiratory difficulty; she was not flushed or sweating.  The doctor then explained to the parents that the constipation was a very simple condition to remedy which was probably due to the change of diet and feeding hours after discharge from hospital, that her family <Col N="3191" /> doctor could treat the condition very easily and that she was not a case for admission to hospital.  The parents appeared to be satisfied at this stage to proceed as the hospital doctor suggested and have the condition treated by the family doctor.</P>
    <P>It appears that later in the day the father approached Deputy Coogan. The Deputy went with the parents and child to the Casualty Department of the Hospital about 6 p.m. and having met the nurse-in-charge the Deputy left.  The parents repeated to nurses and to the Casualty Officer the history of the child's complaint as previously given.  The Casualty Officer questioned the mother and had the child's temperature taken.  He explained that, in the Casualty Department, only casualties and emergencies and patients referred by doctors are dealt with. The House Physician, Paediatric Department, who was then summoned, again spoke to the parents and reiterated that the child's admission to hospital was not warranted.</P>
    <P>The parents, later the same evening, brought the child to a general practitioner, who applied the appropriate treatment.  The father reported subsequently that the child was very well since being treated. Those are the simple facts.</P>
    <P>In reply to the specific questions of the Deputy:</P>
    <P>Question No. 6: The doctor concerned made no report to me.  The Deputy is, however, aware that this doctor has stated that admission to hospital was totally unnecessary in this case.</P>
    <P>Question No. 7: In the course of my outline of the facts of the case I have described what the parents said at the hospital about the child's condition and what the hospital staff observed.  Taken together these were the basis of the diagnosis made.</P>
    <P>Question No. 8: I reject as unfounded and unwarranted any suggestion that the staff of Galway Regional Hospital would fail to afford proper attention in any case appropriate for treatment in or at <Col N="3192" /> the hospital.  The Deputy should be well aware that it is no part of the function of a hospital to parallel, except in circumstances of grave emergency, the services being provided by the general practitioners in the area.</P>
    <P>Question No. 9: The Deputy ascribes to me by implication a statement I did not make.  What I said, in the letter which I caused to be sent to the Health Authority on 29th ultimo, was that &ldquo;on present information&rdquo; I was not satisfied that the occurrence had occasioned public disquiet.  The Deputy first raised the question, in the course of a discussion on salaries, and without prior notice to anybody so far as I can discover, at a meeting of the Health Authority on 24th February last.  His remarks were quoted in the report of that meeting which appeared in a local newspaper. Despite the publicity thus afforded to the Deputy's allegations, I heard nothing about the matter until some months later.  I have no doubt that if there did, in fact, exist that degree of public disquiet which the Deputy alleges, representations would have been made to me to that effect.  My attention was first drawn to the affair by a letter dated 6th June last from the Health Authority asking for a sworn inquiry, which, for the reasons I have indicated, I did not regard as warranted by the circumstances of the case.  I have since read the report of the meeting of the Health Authority on the 7th instant; it does not lend any support to the Deputy's allegation about public disquiet.  I am, therefore, still not satisfied on present information that any disquiet exists.</P>
    <P>Finally, I feel I should inform Dáil Éireann, in connection with this matter generally, that on 2nd March last the senior medical staff of the hospital put themselves on record in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the members of Medical Staff having considered all aspects of this complaint take a very serious view of the report which appeared in Tuesday's issue of a local newspaper. <Col N="3193" /> They highly commend the Co. Manager's responsible approach to the incident and his practical recommendation for dealing with such matters in future.  They concur in his view that the statements reported as having been made were slanderous and they could not guarantee to restrain the doctor involved from taking such further action as he deemed fit.  They point out that such adverse and baseless publicity affects not only the hospital, which has high international reputation, but also the social, industrial and commercial aspects of the economy.</P>
    <P>They consider that at least public apology is called for which will be given as much publicity as the complaint.</P>
    <P>They also desire to have their commendations of Dr. Jordan's statement recorded.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's cover-up statement, for that is what it amounts to, he has admitted that the parents made the diagnosis for the medical staff.  Is that correct? That is No. 1.  Seeing that he accepted the diagnosis, why did that child have to go 17 miles away from the hospital for treatment?  With regard to the question of disquiet, the Minister is so far removed from Galway as not to be aware of the real situation.  Any time he likes to come there I will let him know.  The people have good reason for disquiet.  Further, will the Minister state who signed this report of the medical authority?  I should like to let the Minister know that, while I am in public life, I have no apology to make to the Minister or the medical authority for doing my duty.</P>

      <P>The office of Resident Medical Superintendent, Galway Regional Hospital, became vacant in July, 1960.  As the office is one to which the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 applies, the Local Appointments Commissioners were requested to select a candidate to fill the vacancy.  A competition was held recently and I understand that a recommendation of a suitable candidate will shortly be made.</P>
      <P>I should explain that on the occurrence of the vacancy, it was necessary to review the entire position as the hospitalisation pattern in the Galway area had altered considerably since the original post was created.  This review necessarily took some time and gave rise to delay in referring the post to the Local Appointments Commissioners. I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to him on the 21st March, 1962, regarding the arrangements which have existed in the Galway Regional Hospital since the post of Resident Medical Superintendent became vacant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recruitment and employment of workers is the sole responsibility of Bord na Móna.  On inquiry, however, I have been informed by Bord na Móna that the numbers of seasonal workers employed at Coolnagun and Ballivor in 1961 were, at peak, 380 and 230 respectively. The numbers employed in 1962, at peak, were 192 and 150 respectively.  The number of men knocked off during the month of July, 1962, in Ballivor was 70.  The mechanical turf collector and improvements in other harvesting machinery have speeded up harvesting operations and reduced the number of workers necessary to complete this work. Exceptionally suitable weather conditions were also conducive to the speeding up of the harvesting work.</P>
      <P>The displaced workers are casual workers employed on a day to day basis for harvesting work and the Board has no alternative employment for them.  The maximum number of men for whom work is available is employed at the works concerned.</P>
      <P>It is the Board's policy to mechanise operations as far as possible and only in this way can production and sale of turf be maximised and steady employment for regular workers guaranteed.</P>

The future of Bord na Móna depends on the most economic exploitation of our peat resources.  I have also asked Bord na Móna to do all they can to ensure that those who will be employed on a purely temporary basis are warned in advance that the work is of purely temporary kind, so that no one will be under any illusion on receiving employment which may be terminated before the end of the season.</P>

      <P>The proposal submitted by the Donegal County Council in relation to the office of rate collector for Districts Nos. 10 and 12 was for my approval to the advertising of the vacant office with remuneration on the same basis as had applied to the previous holder of the office.  It was stated that the total remuneration of the rate collector, if he qualified for full bonus would be £590.  It is understood that this figure is based on last year's rate warrants.  As this proposal involved no change in the existing arrangements my approval was not required and in the circumstances the local authority would have been free to proceed with the filling of the <Col N="3209" /> vacancy without referring the matter to me.  Reference was made in the local authority's letter to the fact that the manager had suggested alternative arrangements for the collection of rates in Districts Nos. 10 and 12 but details of what the actual cost of such alternative arrangements would be for rate collection in Districts Nos. 10 and 12 were not given.  It is a matter for the local authority to decide in the first instance how a rate collector is to be remunerated and where it is proposed to change the basis of remuneration such proposals are subject to my sanction and are considered on their merits in each case.  There is no specific statutory provision governing the alteration of the boundaries of a rate collection district.  Such alterations are often made in conjunction with proposals for the creation of an additional office of rate collector or the abolition of an existing office in which cases the functions of the manager, the elected council and the Minister are involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Following are the replies to the two parts of the Question:&mdash;(a) Having regard to the wide range of holdings and varying forms of land use in different localities throughout the country as a whole, it would not be feasible to determine applications for enlargements solely on the basis of the Rateable Valuation of the parent holdings.  In practice the Land Commission would overall find it difficult to operate any rigid rule specifying a qualifying upper valuation limit.  In general, a person is regarded as an uneconomic holder if he is mainly dependent for a livelihood on the produce of a holding which cannot be regarded as adequate to support a family in frugal comfort, even under the best management.  The objective in the allotment of additional land is to provide the allottee, as far as circumstances permit, with an economic unit which at the moment is expressed in terms of acreage as 33 acres of good land or its equivalent in larger acreage of land of mixed quality.  The whole subject is under review at present and I should like to refer the Deputy to my views as recorded in Vol. 195, Cols. 2217-2226 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>(b) For the economic and proper working of an enlargement, it is desirable that it should be within a reasonable distance of the allottee's residence. Such distance has been accepted as about one mile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the current statutory position is that the bulk of the lands acquired under the Land Acts are paid for in Land Bonds. However, I am having an examination made of all the implications involved in adjusting the present method of financing land purchase.</P>
      <P>Under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, the Land Commission are empowered to purchase for cash lands offered for sale where such land is required for the provision of new holdings for migrants or to facilitate rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed conditions.  It will be recalled that I stated, when introducing the Lands Estimate for the current year on 7th June last, that I was having Section 27 overhauled with a view to extending its scope and aim.</P>
      <P>During the 12 months ended 30th June, 1962, agreement was reached for the purchase from landowners, under Section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, of 21 properties, aggregating 1,989 acres, for a total cash purchase price of £156,804.  Land Bond issues for the same period, at £709,444, were nearly five times that amount.</P>
      <P>The interest payable in respect of Land Bonds and their ultimate redemption at par are guaranteed by the State but this guarantee does not extend to the day to day fluctuations on the Stock Exchange; the Land Commission have no funds to compensate landowners for such fluctuations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The meetings in question were held under the new Garda Síochána Representative Bodies Regulations and their primary purpose was to elect representatives to the Area Committees.  The meetings were held in private and the Regulations provide that &ldquo;a statement or other communication regarding the proceedings (of a District Committee, Divisional Committee or Area Committee) shall not be made or issued for publication in any form whatsoever.&rdquo; No such statements were issued and no resolutions of the sort referred to have been communicated to the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>There seems to be some misunderstanding of the position regarding the right of members of the Garda to meet for purposes of discussing matters of pay, conditions of service and so on and I welcome this opportunity of stating what exactly the position is.  The Garda Síochána (Disciplinary) Regulations 1926 provide for the holding of authorized meetings of members of the Force and in addition the new Garda Síochána (Representative Bodies) Regulations provide for meetings of the District, Divisional and Area Committees who may arrange for the attendance at their meetings of any members they wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The best I can do is put what is in the Bill to the Deputy rather than try to deal with his point. This section makes it clear that it will be open to the housing authority to exclude certain categories if the housing authority so desires, and to limit the scheme to certain types and categories, again if the housing authority desires. It is tied up with the matter of giving <Col N="3225" /> the local authorities sole discretion in respect to where they think their money will be best applied.</P>
      <P>We are here giving freedom to the local authority to suit their own circumstances to the best possible purpose. The housing authority will have a very wide range of power under this Bill and particularly under this section so that they can make provision for certain types, classes and categories or, indeed, limit the operation of the supplementary scheme to certain classes.  The only emphasis is on the discretionary power of the local authority to devise a scheme which will serve the interest of that particular authority best.  We are not trying to generalise because what might suit one authority might be completely unsuitable to another.  We are trying to give this freedom of action and of selection to the different local authorities in as broad a sense as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has been in operation in the old Act for four years and there has been no income limit for supplementary grants. Could the Minister state how many housing authorities in the country provided supplementary grants and how many did not?  I understand that, where a county council is the housing authority, almost all applications for supplementary grants are awarded up to the maximum level approved by the Department but that very few urban authorities provide such grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say how many urban housing authorities provided supplementary grants?  In this Bill, we should endeavour to help urban dwellers who require supplementary grants mainly because they are living in small housing areas where the income from local taxation is not sufficient to warrant payment of housing grants.  It is a great disadvantage sometimes for a person to reside within an urban area.  In Bandon and Dunmanway, people are paid reconstruction grants <Col N="3226" /> of up to £280 in most cases where the actual work costs £420, but a similar person doing that job in Clonakilty can qualify for only £140.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to notice that the urban authorities in west Cork are taking active measures to provide partial supplementary grants but I think there should not be differentiation in housing authorities.  I do not like the idea of this House telling local authorities how they should spend funds provided locally but it is not good enough that some local authorities pay these grants in full, others pay on a sliding scale or partially and still others do not pay grants at all.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister, before Report Stage, devise some means of helping small housing authorities such as urban councils to pay grants similar to those provided by county councils? It may be some years before we have another opportunity of broaching this question as it is unlikely we will have another housing Bill.  Each householder in the country should qualify for a supplementary grant.  Could it be described as dictatorial on the part of this House if we make it imperative for housing authorities to pay supplementary grants up to the maximum of the scale set out here?  I do not believe it would be an abuse of our powers even though the money is not provided by the Exchequer.  We should have uniformity.  The main difficulty so far as the Bill is concerned is that there is no uniformity of operation between different housing authorities. If possible, we should avail of this opportunity to secure uniformity and we should have some amendment of the section to that end prior to the Report Stage.  I would go so far as to say it should be mandatory on local authorities to pay housing grants uniformly.  I do not see why a person living in one town in the county council area should get £280 for reconstruction of a house while a man living in an urban area, where these grants are not provided, must do with £140.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be disadvantageous for <Col N="3227" /> the housing authorities to give grants because supplementary grants would induce people to reconstruct houses and when houses are reconstructed in the course of time the rates will be increased after the specified period, seven years.  The house will then yield additional revenue.  In that way, I do not think it would be unjust for the Minister to send some directive to housing authorities to implement the scheme for supplementary grants even if he is not prepared to make it mandatory on housing authorities to provide grants.</P>

      <P>In reply to the first question asked by Deputy Murphy, the number of urban councils paying supplementary grants at the moment is rather discouraging.  Of 60 such councils only 32 pay supplementary grants in respect of new houses and only about 20 in respect of repair and reconstruction of houses.  In regard to county councils, all counties except County Louth pay supplementary grants on new houses and all, with the exception of Kerry, pay supplementary grants for reconstruction and repair.  There is one county missing in respect of reconstruction and repair grants and one county missing in respect of new house grants.  That is a pretty good picture and represents an almost universal application of the benefits of supplementary grants.</P>
      <P>For the urban bodies, the figures are relatively low and show far-from-universal application of the scheme. The cause, as I mentioned, is that on smaller urban councils in particular the impact of even a relatively small number of grants, either for new houses or for repair and reconstruction, in any one year can have quite a startling effect on the following year's rates in the case of a small valuation. Without doubt that is why the pattern, in the case of the urban areas, is so different from that in the counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The happy position in regard to county councils was not always so.  In fact, it has taken quite a number of years for county councils to appreciate that payment of supplementary grants is not giving money away without a <Col N="3228" /> future return.  In addition to increased rates where new houses are provided or reconstruction done and in addition to increased revenue resulting to the local authority, there is the much greater advantage that where Government and supplementary grants have been available quite a number of people have built their own houses and if they did not many of them would be eligible for rehousing by the local authority at much greater cost than the value of the capital grants provided by the local authority. County councils have come to appreciate that grants are not at all a loss and in some cases can be a gain.</P>
    <P>The same thing would apply in urban areas but, unfortunately, the position seems to be that the prospect of immediately facing a steep increase for even a relatively small number of grants in any one year has been a sufficient deterrent to discourage all but some one-third of these bodies from giving grants.  I can only say that I shall endeavour, as in the past, to induce by argument our local authorities, the urban authorities particularly, to pay these supplementary grants and point out to them the advantages of doing so and show that by doing this necessary job in that way they will obviate having to do it at their own cost and at greater cost.</P>
    <P>I should pay tribute to members on all sides of the House who are members of local authorities.  I think they have been largely instrumental in promoting this idea of paying supplementary grants in local authorities.  I ask them to continue to use their good offices, particularly in regard to urban authorities, to try to have some form of supplementary grants introduced for new houses, or for repairs and reconstruction, either or both.  It need not be the full scheme; it can be a partial scheme or a partial grant.  If they start even in a small way, I think they will be ultimately convinced that it does not solely mean an imposition on the rates, that they will benefit from it not only through increased valuation of their urban property but by obviating the necessity to build more houses to house these people if they have not housed themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3229" /> In so far as dictating to local authorities is concerned and saying to them: &ldquo;The vast majority of you are doing a good job and it is time the rest of you should be made do it,&rdquo; I do not think that is the answer.  Such a solution, if it were feasible, would probably gratify me, because it would undoubtedly lead to increased activity in new house building, repair and reconstruction, which I very much desire, but I still would not go so far as to compel local authorities to provide the sizeable sums required for supplementary grants rather than continue the present permissive legislation. We have reached the point now where only one county council is not paying housing grants and only one is not paying repair and reconstruction supplementary grants.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are members of county councils, in which there are urban areas which are poor from the point of view of revenue raising, should use their good offices to try and have discussions between the various urbans and the parent county council with a view to devising a scheme whereby the county council would contribute towards the pool of money from which supplementary grants might be made available by the urban councils. Deputy Hogan of South Tipperary mentioned an extreme example.  He said he came from one of the best off counties, from the point of view of raising rates, but one of the worst off urbans from the same point of view. County councils are empowered to contribute to such a pool, if they so desire.  Naturally, few of them wish to do so, because they have enough to do otherwise.  However, in cases where an urban is lowly valued and the impact of supplementary grants would lead to a disastrous increase in rates and in cases where the county council is relatively well off, there is a great deal to be said for the county council coming to the aid of the urban council. In addition, where you have residents from the county, in respect of whom the county council would have had to pay grants, coming into the urbans, where no grant is paid, the county council should realise that it has some responsibility in the matter.  That is <Col N="3230" /> another argument why the county council in conjunction with the urbans should at least discuss the establishment of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>What I have in mind is this: if a person who lived in the county and was going to erect a new house moved into an urban in the same county and applied for a supplementary grant, it would be the duty of the county council, once that person was otherwise qualified, to provide the grant either in whole or in part.  I throw that out as a suggestion, not without hope that some county council will lend a helping hand to their urbans. I know they have the interest of their urbans at heart.  In fact, quite a sizeable proportion of the total rate collected or collectable in an urban area is paid over by way of contribution to the county council for various services said to be rendered.  When you consider that, in addition to the other obligation I have referred to, there should at least be a basis for establishing discussions to see if some sort of a workable scheme could be devised so that the majority of our urbans would have some sort of supplementary grant scheme in operation.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting this is a complete solution, but it is the best suggestion I can make.  Much though it might suit my own book as Minister, I am not in favour of introducing compulsion on local authorities to pay supplementary grants in place of the present permissive legislation.  I know the argument can be made that that should be done and that there should be complete uniformity throughout the country.  But, if we are to have compulsion, we have to throw overboard the principle of permissive legislation. I am not sufficiently convinced that that would be the right thing to do at this stage.</P>

      <P>Over the week-end, I made further inquiries regarding the position from officials of local authorities. I was anxious about the subsection which deals with the availability of loans for tenants of vested cottages.  I know the Minister stated that receipt of the certificate would be sufficient.  I wonder what can be done by the Minister and his Department to make sure that it will be sufficient. My information is that a large number of local authorities will not accept it.  It is all very well to say that a circular will issue from the Department. A circular has not the effect of law.  Circulars have issued from the Department in the past.  I remember one famous one telling us we should use thatch for roofing.  Local authorities do not have to accept circulars. Unless something better than a circular issues it will be useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated on the Second Stage that there may be other ways of getting loans.  I do not know of any other way whereby the tenant of a vested cottage can get a loan.  Tenants of vested cottages will not get a loan <Col N="3232" /> from a bank or a building society even on a grant certificate.  There is no way they can get a loan on a grant certificate except from the local authority.  Unless this section is made watertight the whole thing will be a fiasco.  It would have been easy for the Minister to repeal Section 21 of the 1936 Act.  That has not been done.  That would be a guarantee to these people that they could go into the local authority and ask for a loan and the local authority would be entitled to give it to them.  As matters stand, the manager and the other officials will be confronted by the legal adviser pointing out that Section 21 of the 1936 Act is still in force.  If the Minister wants to make this really successful from the point of view of tenants of vested cottages, and if he wants them to avail of loans for reconstruction and improvement from local authorities, he will have to repeal Section 21 of the 1936 Act.  Otherwise, these people will not be able to bridge the gap between the grant and the ultimate cost of the work.</P>

I am advised that Section 10 (2) (b) of the section, while it does not repeal Section 21 of the 1936 Act, does in fact have the same effect as if that section had been repealed and thereby provides an effective method for making and securing these loans.  That is the advice I have been given after full investigation since the last discussion here.  More than that I cannot say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a local authority empowered under this section <Col N="3233" /> to give a loan to an applicant on the applicant's own personal guarantee or will it be necessary for him to have guarantors?  It will be some years before a vested cottage becomes his absolute property.  Will that cottage, under vesting, be sufficient guarantee for approval of a loan?  This is a very important matter.  Deputies will appreciate that it is very difficult for a man with a small income, who requires a loan of £200 or £300 to reconstruct his cottage, to go along to his neighbours and ask them to guarantee him for the next 35 years with the Cork County Council or the Dublin County Council, or any other housing authority.</P>
      <P>Our aim under this Bill should be to encourage people to reconstruct their houses.  We should make the regulations in relation to the granting of loans as easy as possible.  It is some four or five years now since the Cork County Council amended their regulations for the granting of loans to applicants by giving the loans on their own surety or on the surety of the house for which the loan was being made available.  That system has not been abused.  It is working very smoothly.  The returns from the borrowers in Cork are almost 100 per cent.  The ceiling of this loan was £900. Any applicant would get up to £900 for the erection or purchase of his house from the Cork County Council on the security of the house itself without additional guarantors.  We had several discussions before this motion was approved by the council.  It was felt that, if loans were given without security, it might be very difficult for the council to collect its money if the borrower defaulted.  We have had four or five years' experience now.  The scheme is working very smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to that time applicants who were anxious to build their own houses and to avail of loans found it very difficult to do so because they had to get two sureties.  Mark you, it is very hard for a man borrowing up to £900 from a local authority to find these sureties even though he may be a man of the highest integrity and completely honest in every sense of the word. People are not anxious to go surety <Col N="3234" /> for a person for such an extended period.  I should like the loans made available under this provision on the easiest possible terms from the point of view of sureties.  If the county council or the lending authority are satisfied that the applicant is honest, is doing his best to provide a livelihood for himself and his family, and unlikely, unless in most unforeseen circumstances, to default on his instalments, then the man should get the loan, particularly under this section which deals with reconstruction work only.</P>
    <P>If we make rigid regulations for lending this money, a number of deserving people will not be able to qualify under those regulations and the ultimate position may be that the housing authority will have to provide houses for them from public funds.  Therefore, I should like to have complete clarification as to what are the qualifications for lending money under this section.  Could we get that clarification now from the Minister?  I am sure the Minister appreciates the difficulty persons have in getting guarantors for loans.  Cork County Council have been endeavouring to make these loans available on the easiest possible terms so far as security is concerned. They have implemented that policy and it is working smoothly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not envisage guarantors in this context at all. Rather are we relying on the deposit with the housing authority of the land certificate as being a simple, straightforward and effective procedure.  The validity of doing that has been queried, not without some reason, I agree, but it was queried at an earlier stage.  I have had it examined and reinvestigated and I have been advised by my legal advisers, not just as a halfhearted opinion, but emphatically, that in this section, particularly subsection (2) (b) there is power to accept the deposit of the land certificate as specified in subsection (2) (a) (ii) as adequate and sufficient security for the issue of these loans.</P>

I had in mind the application forms of one housing authority as far as reconstruction grants are concerned. The applicant must submit two names of persons willing to act as surety for him.  If the Minister's statement is correct there is no need for the local authority to ask an applicant for a loan to submit the names of two guarantors.  If the Minister is correct, the local authority is not conversant with the regulations.  If he is correct, the local authority can delete that question from the application form.</P>

      <P>Yes.  When the Deputy interjected the query: &ldquo;What about vested cottages,&rdquo; I said I was talking about vested cottages.  In fact, this procedure can be used not only for the advance of loans to owners and occupiers of vested cottages but may also be used, if the local authority thinks fit, for the issue of other loans. It can be used for all other purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has made these points.  There was a case in Kilkenny where a person looked for a loan for the reconstruction of a house.  According to the local authority and their advisers the person could get a loan only on the value of the house before reconstruction and not on the <Col N="3236" /> value of the house when reconstructed. The value of the house before reconstruction would be about £300 or possibly a little more.  The person intended to spend £500 or £600.  He would probably get practically no loan on the basis of the value before reconstruction whereas he would get a reasonable loan, sufficient for his purposes, if the value were taken after reconstruction.  I would ask the Minister to clarify the position.  Must the local authority take the value before reconstruction or after reconstruction for the purposes of the loan?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 12, line 49, at the end of paragraph (iv) to add &ldquo;providing in particular that the period of repayment shall extend to fifty years at the option of the person to whom the loan is made,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>No loss would be involved if the amendment were accepted.  The difficulty, if any, would be that the person securing the loan would have to pay more, I suppose, naturally enough, but at least it would give the applicant an opportunity of spreading the repayments over a longer period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties that make acceptance of the amendment practically impossible, apart from any merit it may have or otherwise, is the fact that the period of repayment could not be left to the choice of the borrower as would be inherent in the amendment, in that it would be at the option of the person to whom the loan is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in respect of the Local Loans Fund moneys from which I take it all these advances will be made and funded, the period of repayment is fixed by the Minister for Finance. That is a control which all Ministers for Finance have retained over the years and I am not aware that any Minister for Finance would lightly give up that control which he has by <Col N="3238" /> tradition exercised in the disbursement of moneys from the Local Loans Fund.  Those are the two points which make it almost impossible for me to consider the acceptance of this amendment at all.  I say that without any regard to its merits or demerits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's views but the wording of the amendment would enable the local authority to permit a person to repay over a shorter period or over 50 years.  In case the Minister might be taking it from the amendment, not for a moment would we suggest that the borrower should go in and simply say to the local authority: &ldquo;I want the 50 years basis.&rdquo;  It is only for cases where the local authority may be able to make that arrangement that we seek it.  In the light of the second point raised by the Minister this proposal may be considered premature, but we have already come up against a big problem because of this 35-year repayment period.  It is about time the Minister for Finance did something about it or else that the Minister for Local Government would draw his attention to it.  It is particularly necessary in regard to the non-municipal type of house with a high rent; in the case of the vesting of this type of house the annuity is very high.  On many occasions the manager and members of the Cork County Council drew attention to the fact that they were anxious that the tenant would be able in these cases to avail of a scheme of vesting at a reasonable charge.  However, under the local loans arrangements we were confined within the 35 yearperiod and had to charge higher rates. It would be more satisfactory if it were left optional to the local authority to suggest, when a scheme is being prepared, that permission may be given for repayment over a period of 35 years or, alternatively, 50 years. Then perhaps, with the co-operation expected between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance, something could be done which undoubtedly would help the applicant for the vested cottage or the vested house where the rent over a 35-year repayment period would be <Col N="3239" /> a heavy financial burden on the people concerned.</P>

      <P>The availability of loans is a reserved function of the manager of each county and I regret that very much because if it were the function of the members it would be to the advantage of all concerned.  Can the Minister say on what grounds a manager may refuse a loan?  Must he say a man has not sufficient guarantee, that he is unreliable, that he has not a secure job or that he is unlikely to repay the loan?  I regret to find that in our County of Cork it has recently become more difficult to get loans.  A scheme was working very smoothly but I can instance a case to show that is no longer so.  One of our emigrants who returned from England wished to buy a house in County Cork and asked for a 50 per cent. loan on the cost of the house.  Fifty per cent. of the cost of the house was £750.  The manager offered him £450 but after some huckstering, which is most undesirable, he agreed to make it £600.  That would not buy the house.  He has made a down payment of £350.  He is in the £10 a week income group and there was no justification for refusing him the loan. He is a newly married man and the local authority would be obliged to provide a house for him if he sought one, but having gone to England and <Col N="3240" /> earned some money he was anxious to provide his own accommodation.  While in England he also availed of a loan for building a house from the local housing authority from whom he got a loan of £1,600.  He has documentary evidence that the instalments were paid back satisfactorily and that the council got its money in full before he left England.  He was refused a 50 per cent. loan from the local authority here although I understand under existing regulations a man who would qualify would be entitled to a loan of 85 per cent. of the estimated cost of the house. This man did not want 85 per cent., only 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister overcome injustices like that?  I do not know on what grounds this policy was adopted but it is rather unusual as far as we are concerned in Cork.  The trend has become noticeable only recently and I hope it will be discontinued. However, I feel it incumbent on me as a member of this House to refer to this instance because others may arise.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on such a position.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the making of loans by local authorities for the buying or building of new houses and for the making of regulations with regard to the classes of persons who may get these loans and the minimum contribution.  These regulations ought to be so framed as to embrace as many as possible within the scope of this housing authority loans scheme.  It is very desirable that the minimum deposit required for the purchase of a house should be as low as possible.  It ought not to be more difficult for a person to embark on the purchase of a house than it is for him to buy a motor car, a television set or anything else that is bought on hire purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These regulations ought to be framed so as to encourage people to acquire and build their own houses and the amount of the deposit required in these cases is often too high. It should be kept as low as possible so as to encourage people to go ahead and acquire their homes.  There has often been postponement of marriages <Col N="3241" /> in this country because the purchase of a house is put beyond the reach of the young people by reason of the minimum deposit required.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind when he comes to make these regulations.  I consider this section one of the vital sections of this piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>The question posed by Deputy Murphy is one which it would be impossible to answer fully, that is, whether I could cite the cases that are not entitled to get grants under these general powers in the Bill. Rather is it a case where one can specify broadly the people to whom grants may be made.  That is the only possible approach to this matter and to try to specify those to whom it would be right not to give loans might be a dangerous procedure, dangerous in a legal manner, and it would take a great deal more time than is necessary. Let me assure Deputy Murphy, at the same time, that there will arise, as he has outlined, cases where any of us would find it difficult to delineate. While these may be relatively isolated cases, there is not very much that any of us could do about them.</P>
      <P>If the situation should arise that a general trend of a restrictive nature becomes evident in the operation of these loan facilities by any manager of a local authority, all I can say to the members of that local authority is that if they feel they want the loans operated on a particular basis and are satisfied that they are within the law, they should requisition the manager to do it in that particular way.  If he still refuses to operate it in that way, then the best course for the members is to submit the matter to the Minister for Local Government of the day for a decision one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the best approach to a situation which might arise where a manager, from his own particular viewpoint, may have strong views to the point at which he suppresses his council's wishes to the extent that they may feel irked and frustrated about it. They can then requisition the manager <Col N="3242" /> to operate the loans in their way and, if he refuses to do so and if the law is on the side of the local authority, in 99 cases out of 100, the Minister for Local Government would be in favour of the expressed opinion of the elected members of the council rather than in favour of the manager.  That is the best I can say to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, the proposal in this section increases the valuation limit for these supplementary new housing grants from the old established traditional limit of £35 to £50.  Not only have we raised the valuation limit by £15 but there is now the advantage that a man with a valuation of £49 19s. can get a 100 per cent. supplementary grant as against the position in the past where, if a man had a valuation of £34 19s., by law he could not get more than one-third of the supplementary grant.  Accordingly, this increase is not merely one of £15 in the valuation. We must bear in mind the other provisions which give such freedom to the local authorities.  We must also bear in mind that the £50 valuation brings within its confines in so far as the agricultural community is concerned something like 85 per cent. of the farmers of this country.  We have, therefore, come a considerable distance when we apply this change to the wide discretionary powers we have given the local authorities in relation to the making of these supplementary grants.</P>

      <P>Speaking earlier in this debate, the Minister stated that subsection (5) of this section empowers the local authority to give supplementary grants to persons who may have a valuation in excess of £50 or an income in excess of £832.  I cannot see how that interpretation can be gleaned from that subsection as it appears in the Bill.  Are we to assume this is to be taken definitely in conjunction with a previous section governing supplementary grants?  Am I to assume from the Minister's statement that a man with a family of six or seven can have £100 deducted from his income in respect of each child, so that a person with an income of £1,200 or £1,300 can, by virtue of such deductions, have his income reduced to bring it within the range of the £832?  The Minister should explain to the House his interpretation of subsection (5) of this section because it is not readily understandable by us.  Are there some hidden provisions in the subsection which empower the local authority to waive certain incomes by virtue of a man having a big family, or to reduce a farmer's valuation because he is in poor circumstances?</P>

      <P>That is not the intention where the valuation is concerned. In respect of income, however, there can be that variation under this subsection. It was put there deliberately so that it may be at the discretion of the local authority in their wisdom, and with their rates money, to devise a scheme which would have the effect of rebating or discounting the gross earnings of a husband and wife, as the case may be, resulting in a net income of some hundreds of pounds below the <Col N="3245" /> gross figure.

      <P>It is true to say that even if we agree with this amendment, we will get very few local authorities to accept it at its face value.  Perhaps Dublin and Cork Corporations and certain other progressive local authorities may.  While the Minister has mentioned here subsection (4) of Section 12, to me it means that the making of grants under this section may, &ldquo;if the housing authority thinks fit, be confined to (a) persons of such class or classes&rdquo;.  I can imagine members of Dublin Corporation or Cork Corporation being bogged down if it comes to a definition of the classes because surely even within the various professions there would be rather heated arguments if some were, as it were, promoted and others degraded?</P>
      <P>Again, &ldquo;persons providing houses of such type or types&rdquo;&mdash;I do not think that would affect the individual case.  Then we have &ldquo;persons of such class or classes providing houses of such type or types&rdquo;.  I do not think that covers an individual application in such areas as those of Cork or Dublin Corporation or County Council where an individual applicant's income, with that of his wife, may go over £832.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister re-draft the section?  When the Act is circulated to housing authorities, if members at a housing authority meeting make recommendations that a certain person is entitled to a supplementary grant because he has a big family or for other reasons such as illness, the manager is likely to quote the Act.  That is the usual procedure.  He will ask: &ldquo;What in subsection (5) (a) or in Section 12 governing the payment of supplementary grants empowers me to make this payment to such an applicant?&rdquo; If the Minister really believes the section gives the authority, I think he should re-draft it, if I may say so, in more simple language, in language that can be readily understood.  It is difficult to read into the section the wide powers which the Minister says will enable the manager to ignore the £832 limit in certain cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have abolished it to the extent that we have given a demarcation point above and below which and around and about which the local authority has complete freedom of determination as to what is the net income of a particular applicant or class of applicants for supplementary grants.  Apart from this £832, which is a sort of a centre of gravity, there is no restriction on local authorities within the bounds of sanity and reason in making a determination on the process outlined in subsection (4), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), of Section 12, and in subsection (5) in the determination of the net income of the persons already mentioned in subsection (4).  The lack of specific definition is of more use to Deputy Murphy's view of the matter than if we were to try to spell out specifically what may or may not be done.</P>
      <P>It is by this freedom given in subsections (4) and (5) that the discretion of the local authority may be used to the greatest extent in the light of their experience and knowledge of the circumstances of the people in their own area so that they may devise a supplementary grant scheme that in their circumstances will give the best return and embrace the most deserving classes.  It is for them and not us to decide.  We could not be expected to be aware of the last detail of variation between the circumstances and housing conditions of one local authority and another.  There can be no appeal from the authority's determination of the net income and no Minister or anybody can say that it is wrong.  Even though it may seem to be too generous, it cannot be appealed against.  Neither can it be appealed against if it appears somewhat niggardly</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3248" /> The local authority has the final determination in regard to the type of person and building in respect of which grants will be made and they also have the right of final determination without any appeal in regard to the net income of an applicant.  How they arrive at it is their business.  I think what Deputy Murphy fears is more than adequately covered and to try to be specific about his point would restrict the purposes of the section rather than secure them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister has said, I think we are making a big mistake in this section. The Minister says it is a matter for the housing authority, that is, the manager, to say what classes will benefit or otherwise.  I can visualise that there will be a lack of uniformity. One manager may say &ldquo;I will not bother with any person except those under £832 per annum.  I cannot understand that section.  If I bring in a person with £900 I must bring in the person with £950 or £1,000 a year.&rdquo; There is no appeal.  The Minister says that is a good thing.  It may or it may not be.  Suppose an applicant applies to the local authority for a supplementary grant and his income is £1,100 a year.  He receives an answer that in the opinion of the local authority he is not entitled to the grant.  He can do nothing about it.  But should a neighbour in similar circumstances make an application and be approved, he can do nothing about it either. According to the Minister, the Department cannot enter into the picture at all.  The Minister is delegating his entire functions to the housing authority and the manager.  The manager is to be the sole judge and jury and, into the bargain, he is fortified by the knowledge that his activities cannot be questioned.</P>

      <P>This section will give rise to endless trouble.  Since the Minister has refused to accede to the request made to abolish the limit altogether, he should lay down some definite figure and say that, if a man's <Col N="3249" /> income is less than that, he will get the grant but, if it is more, he will not get the grant.  That would be of immense advantage to us.  If he thinks fit, the Minister should raise the figure on Report Stage; but in any event he should lay down a definite figure the same as is done in regard to farm valuations.  If the figure is a flexible one, which can be moved up and down according as the manager so decides, it will give rise to many rows at housing authority meetings and you may have allegations of victimisation and discrimination.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in the type of flexibility the Minister is giving in subsection (5) because I believe it will give rise to a good deal of trouble. The Minister should lay down a figure and say &ldquo;That is the law and nothing can be done about it.&rdquo;  The figure of £520 in country districts has been adhered to rigidly up to now.  If a man had an income more than that, he could be told there was nothing the local authority could do in the matter because they had no discriminatory powers.  The Minister is now giving them power to vary that figure.  When he is going that far, he should think about abolishing the income limit and valuation limit altogether.</P>

Only in the local housing authority, by virtue of the powers given to that authority under this Bill, do any of the operations here arise in relation to a scheme of supplementary grants drawn up and adopted by the council.  It is only when that scheme has been adopted and accepted that the provisions of Section 12 apply.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense to talk about delegation. I am absolutely satisfied that this wide discretion under this section is in keeping with the wide discretion given in the Bill in regard to a number of other matters.  That wide discretion is in the interests of flexibility.  It is designed so that local authorities may apply whatever amount of money they put aside for this purpose in what they regard as the best possible way.  Is there anything wrong with that?  Members of local authorities are experienced people.  By a combination of their experience and the wisdom of their officials, a scheme will be drawn up and adopted.  I cannot see where the pitfalls will arise.  I cannot see what objection can be raised to giving these wide discretionary powers to a local authority to spend its own money as it thinks best in the interests of housing its people or encouraging them to house themselves.

      <P>I do not want to discuss a section we have not yet reached, but the making of a scheme will be a reserved function.  If the making of the scheme were an executive function, it might be all right. From start to finish of the section, it is a reserved function, and I am afraid we shall find ourselves in the same position as we do now in regard to medical cards, faced with complete disorganisation and nobody satisfied.</P>
      <P>It may be that this section will be utilised to the best advantage.  There are a good many county managers; there are two in one county, in case one is not enough.  &ldquo;Doctors differ and patients die&rdquo; and, while the section may appear to be a good one, I am afraid that its full value may not be gained because of this being made a reserved function.  It will end up, like the medical cards, with nobody satisfied with what was meant to satisfy everyone at the outset.</P>

      <P>The making of a scheme and the bringing of it before the council will be a matter for the manager.  It will then be considered by the council.  They are in full control after all because, if they are not prepared to provide the money, the scheme brought in by the manager <Col N="3252" /> cannot be put into operation.  The scheme, as introduced, will probably have flaws in it.  It will be discussed. The council may eventually divide, and the scheme will finally be determined by the council, having hammered out the details.  If, at that point, the manager refuses to accept the scheme, a requisition can be made that the manager implement the wishes of the council.  If he refuses again, then the matter comes to the Minister for determination.</P>
      <P>There is no comparison between the medical card system and what is proposed here.  The comparison ends at the point that the manager determines who is entitled to a medical card, the money for which must be raised, and half of which is recoupable from the Department of Health.  In this case, the council has the entire control, a discretionary control, as to whether they will provide money for any scheme.  If they do not like the scheme, they throw it out, unless the manager is prepared to amend it.  If they want a scheme and the manager is not prepared to give it to them, they requisition the manager and, in the last analysis, if there is still a dispute and he refuses, the council refer the matter to the Minister for Local Government. So that, while the manager is left to prepare the scheme, the ultimate control and discretion are in the hands of the elected body of the council and not in the hands of the manager.</P>

      <P>That summarises more or less the point I had in mind earlier today when I asked the Minister if the scheme would be submitted to him in the final analysis.  I take it from what the Minister has now said that the elected representatives will have the determination of the final details of the scheme and that if the local representatives feel the scheme prepared by the manager is not what they want, the matter comes before the Minister for decision.  That would preserve the right of the local representatives to their judgement as to whether the scheme was one which suited local needs or not.  I am satisfied, if that is so.</P>

A person could get a supplementary grant of 50 per cent. or 100 per cent. where the valuation was £50 and in respect of each child, £5 was allowed, so that a man with four children would get a supplementary grant.  In Kilkenny, there are farmers with £50 valuation who are regarded as very small farmers.  If the valuation were anything less than that, we would be building a labourer's cottage for the person.  Some of the land is very highly valued.  Is it a fact that we have no choice any longer?</P>

      <P>The Minister has lectured the House on the advantages of flexibility, so far as the income limit is concerned.  He has also lectured some of us on our alleged inconsistency on this Bill.  If there is any person inconsistent in his statements to the House, it is the Minister. While he praised the value of flexibility of the income limit and said the figure can be juggled around as the local authority so decide, he has made it quite clear that the valuation limit <Col N="3254" /> cannot be interfered with.  In all fairness, he should be consistent.  If a local authority is empowered to vary the income limit stated in the Bill as £832, it should, likewise, have power to vary the valuation limit of £50.  We must be consistent.  I would ask the Minister to be consistent.  Deputy Crotty has given me some news this evening in the House.</P>

If he is so fond of flexibility and is anxious that the £832 should be flexible, in fairness, this House should ask him to do the same in relation to the valuation limit.</P>
      <P>If a man is interested in building a house and buys a copy of this Bill, he will be unable to find this flexibility of income limit which is hidden in subsection (5) (a).</P>

      <P>He would need some help to find it, possibly some Departmental help, but supposing he did find that this figure of £832 was not a fixed sum, that it could be varied as the housing authority decides, would it not be reasonable for him to make the case that the figure of £50 valuation limit should be variable also?  If we are making the £832 figure for income limit flexible, we must in justice make the valuation limit flexible also.</P>
      <P>It could happen that a man with a valuation of more than £50 might have a big family or would be in bad financial circumstances through misfortune, such as illness or loss of property, and would have a good case for the supplementary grant, but there is no power given to the housing authority to vary the £50 limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to review that position in the light of his statements on the income level and to bring back the Bill here again and make the £50 valuation variable, as well as the <Col N="3255" /> income limit.  In so doing, he will be living up to his own standards of consistency that he was trying to establish here.  The Minister has lectured the House on the value of consistency. The Minister is most inconsistent in his presentation of this section.  I would ask him to be consistent.  What is good for the wage earners should be good for the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has missed the point.  To be flexible in one's consistency is sometimes a very good thing. Let us look at this matter in this way &mdash;we raise the limit from £30 to £50, take off the lid in so far as a prescribed statutory table of percentages for the supplementary grant is concerned and, as I have already pointed out, instead of a one-third grant from the local authority being imposed in law in the case of a farmer with a valuation of £44 19s., as up to the end of last March, it is now possible for a farmer with a valuation of £49 19s. to get a 100 per cent.  supplementary grant. That should satisfy Deputy Murphy if he is to be as consistent as he advocates the Minister should be because he has insisted that we should have a figure; in other words, we should have something to which to anchor ourselves. Well, here is the anchor on the one hand, and let us drift on the other hand.</P>

      <P>Let us put it this way. We are giving this flexibility to the local authorities.  Let us see how well they use the flexibility.  Let us see if they are flexible more in an expanding than in a contracting way.  Let us see whether or not they will write off £200 or £300 of a man's salary in order to qualify him for the supplementary grant or diminish his net income to bring him under £832.  Let us see how many of them will come and say: &ldquo;We want to pay supplementary grants of 100 per cent. or 50 per cent. to all the applicants regardless of whether they have £100, £200 or £300 valuation.&rdquo;  If there is <Col N="3256" /> any evidence from our local authorities that that is the way they are heading, I can assure the House I will advocate to my colleagues in the Government that we change this.  I do not think there is any great danger of its being overstrained in that direction but if so I shall be one of the strongest advocates that the change will be made to allow them to go further and Deputy Murphy will find me most co-operative if that should turn out to be the case.</P>

      <P>Is it intended that in respect of the allocation of money from the Local Loans Fund there will be a saving whereby instead of so much money coming by way of loans or grants the local authority will just act as guarantor for a person?  In turn will such a system mean enhanced profits for some of these building societies and assurance companies?  It may become a practice that the applicant for borrowing may be encouraged by the local authority to go to one of these bodies mentioned here, &ldquo;a building society, an assurance company, a bank or other industrial or commercial organisation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the full value of this section as a protection for the local authority and the fact that the Minister and the Minister for Finance come in in the case of any losses, on the other hand this is a change from the old system to a system whereby building societies can advance money without much hesitation because they have as guarantor the local authorities to make sure that the money comes back to them.  Does that mean that at the end of the financial year these building societies, banks and assurance companies will find themselves in a stronger financial position than otherwise? I think it is inadvisable that we should transfer so much business to these concerns.  I hope I am wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need have no fear in that direction.  This section is a replacement for an old section that <Col N="3257" /> was tried out, Section 10 of the 1956 Act, which was amended to see if it might work but probably with not much more than a pious hope that it would work even in its amended form. We have had experience of Section 10 as it was in the 1956 Act being completely useless.  It was hedged around in such a way as to make it useless. To give just an example, if a person proposing to build a new house&mdash;it was only a new house in that Act&mdash; wanted £1,200, he might go to the lending agency and find he could get £900 and no more.  There was a difference of £300 that could not be made up.  The idea was that the local authority could then, by operating Section 10 of the 1956 Act, guarantee one-third of the £300 if an assurance company or a building society were to advance that additional £300 over and above the £900 that was provided otherwise.  If something went wrong it meant that the local authority carried a £100 loss, the assurance company or the building society would carry £100 loss and the Department would carry the other one-third loss but that was only £300 of a combination of loans amounting to £1,200.  I think the House will readily appreciate that could not possibly and never did work.  We have now come in with an extension of that section which is more of an experiment than anything else.  The reason I say that is that instead of applying this only to part of the loan, in other words to that which could not be got otherwise under the guarantee, and instead of its applying to a new house only, we have widened the scope so that the whole advance required could be guaranteed, that is, one-third recoupable by the Minister for Local Government, one-third falling on the local authority and one-third being carried by a lending agency which could be not only a building society or an assurance company but could include, and is intended to include, the ordinary commercial banks and possibly even some H.P. companies but that is something that would have to be examined.  Not only does it apply to new houses but to reconstruction and repair work as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; deliberately for <Col N="3258" /> the reason that the banks are brought into this for the first time.  If we could engender some business in this way it could be a good feature of our house-building finances in the future.  However, I have no great hopes of its success even in this new and amended form for the reason that I do not think it is likely to be availed of to any great degree.  At any rate, if it should be, the power is there and it is an experiment that can be watched with interest.  If it is found useful, it can be spurred along and, if necessary, made more workable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond's idea is quite an intriguing one, that there may be a boosting up of commercial lending agencies at the expense of the public purse but it is not inherent in the section. The lending agencies may have to bear the loss of one-third of whatever they advance and I think having to face one-third of a possible loss will be sufficient to make them prudent in the disbursement of their money for these purposes.  There is no fear that they will throw this money around and risk losing one-third of it.  This is an experiment in which we have more hope than faith.  It may prove useful on an experimental basis.  I have little faith in it but there is no danger of its costing public funds.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Before section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before payment of the final instalment (which shall be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister) of any loan or grant under this Act, the Minister or the housing authority as the case may be shall satisfy himself or themselves that all necessary auxiliary works such as roads, footpaths, etc., have been completed to the standard prescribed by the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to deal <Col N="3259" /> with what we call built-up areas or areas where builders rent or buy a certain amount of land and build on it.  We have had it in Cork and I suppose we have had it in Dublin and other large centres.  Notice is published in the Press and in posters on the site itself inviting purchasers to take advantage of the grants.  We have found in the past that many people did avail of these and many of the builders were quick enough to clear out without providing the amenities.  The onus was then placed on the purchaser of the house, and, to a certain degree, on the local authority, to provide the amenities the builder had not provided.  We found, in many cases, that the builder had absconded with the profits he had made, that the purchaser was not in a position to meet the liability and that the local authority had to help out. In this amendment, we are suggesting that this should not happen in the future and that a strict grip be held of the builder to see that the amenities are provided before the transaction is finalised.</P>

      <P>This amendment is a most important one.  We have had experience of this matter in Limerick and there was one area where there was what might be described as a semi-public road.  That was left over for us.  The Corporation refused to take it over as they said the owner would have to put it in a satisfactory position before they would accept the liability of maintaining it.  The unfortunate 20 or 30 people whose houses were built on that road were wading up to their ankles in mud. Nothing could be done about it.  There is no use giving a man a house in the middle of a bog.  You must give him the means of coming and going.  We have put down the amendment, which is very simple, for the purpose of providing these people who have gone to the trouble and expense of building their own houses with these necessary amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What the amendment asks is something which is no longer necessary.  It is true that the amendment arises out of past experience in various cites including Dublin, Cork and Limerick, where the situation as outlined by the Deputies has existed <Col N="3261" /> and was allowed to happen.  Such a situation is no longer being allowed to occur because there is sufficient control in the hands of the local authorities to ensure that it does not happen, and the local authorities have been put in the position to ensure that this sort of thing will not happen again.  The Deputy from Limerick will agree that local authorities have been taking good care to exercise those very wide controls to ensure that the rather difficult and awkward situations which arose in their areas some years ago are not allowed to arise again in any new estates.</P>
      <P>The suggestion in the amendment would appear at first glance to cover this matter but when we go more deeply into it we will realise that the withholding of these final instalments could, indeed, cause hardship to the person waiting to go into occupation of a house as well as acting as a deterrent to a defaulting developer or contractor.  I feel sure that will be given due weight by the sponsors of the amendment.  This power is not required by the local authorities who already have sufficient powers at their disposal.  Despite the fact that they may have operated these functions in the past rather badly with dire results, I think the experience of local authorities then will serve to ensure that there is no danger of a repetition.</P>
      <P>Over and above all that, there is the imminence of the new Planning Bill which will be circulated to Deputies during the Recess &mdash; if there is to be a Recess at all&mdash; and that Bill will have provisions and proposals which will deal even more effectively with this problem, created by the failure to complete estate development.  That Bill will certainly give the answers to many of the existing problems in relation to these estates in Dublin and elsewhere.  It will place in the hands of local authorities not only adequate weapons to prevent any such thing as incomplete development in the future but will also contain proposals that will help to eliminate problems that were allowed to arise in the past, many of which have not yet been solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering the two arguments I have given and the fact that this Bill <Col N="3262" /> is being introduced, I think the House can rest assured that we are very conscious of this lack of development or this bad development of estates in the past and the dire consequences they had for people who went into houses in good faith only to find themselves faced with lack of roads and footpaths.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the Minister's final point first. He said the withholding of the final instalment might be a burden on the prospective occupant of the House.  I do not think it would.  I know many families who moved into houses to find themselves faced with conditions which made it necessary for them each to pay up to £40 to try and provide decent footpaths and roads.  These families should not have been let into the houses.  It would have been much better to have kept them waiting rather than that they should have been allowed in and then found it necessary to pay up to £40 each out of their own pockets. I will take the Minister's word for it that in this new legislation which, I hope, will not be too long on the stocks, there will be provision to ensure that the same danger will not exist in the future, but there is still a danger that contractors or developers can go outside the belt of town planning and escape the provisions of the Bill in that way.  It may be all right in Dublin and Cork but it may be difficult on other local authorities to build a town planning scheme in such a way that there will be no escape for such people.  If we can get protection for the people I have been talking about I do not mind what the Bill is which provides such protection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Before payment of the final instalment (which shall be prescribed <Col N="3263" /> by regulations made by the Minister) of any loan or grant under this Act, the Minister or the housing authority as the case may be shall satisfy himself or themselves that the contractor concerned has given prescribed guarantees that any defect in the work concerned brought to his notice within a prescribed period shall be remedied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister may say, and I do not blame him for it, that this amendment might also create hardship for the tenant if the final instalment is withheld.  My reply to that is that something radical must be done in this respect because many people have been caught under the provisions of the 6 to 9 months period.  The contractor could wait and see that the grants were paid first and then get out.  Something must be done about extending the time for the withholding of the final payment.  It would allow for a thorough inspection to be carried out.  I use the word &ldquo;thorough&rdquo; knowing well that the Department's inspectors do their part in this matter.  They inspect the work at the start and again at the finish to see if it is done according to specification.  However, faults in the carrying out of the specification can be covered up by paint and so forth.</P>
    <P>I am not pressing for anything very extreme on this amendment.  If the Minister can suggest an alternative to it, I shall be satisfied, provided we ensure that the person paying so dearly for this type of house will not be left by the builder, after the short period of time until he has got his final instalment and disappears from the picture, with all the responsibility of paying for the house, looking after the loans and arranging the mortgage and also possibly paying for repairs found necessary in the case of defects arising after ten or twelve months after the final payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is full appreciation of the difficulty of acceding to the type of amendment suggested by the Labour Deputies.  The fact that it is put down gives us an opportunity of discussing what is a <Col N="3264" /> rather delicate problem, in the sense that I think nobody in his senses would suggest that the Local Government inspection should be regarded as a warranty. That would involve the Department in a matter in which they should not be involved.  The logical conclusion of such thinking would be that no house eligible for a grant could be built unless it were built by the Department, who would have complete jurisdiction; they would give out the contracts, supervise the erection, inspect the house and so on.  Nobody suggests that is necessary or desirable.</P>
      <P>Payment of grants is some assurance to the prospective owner that a reasonable house is being built but it cannot be a guarantee of perfection or of the continued good condition of the house.  Two inspections&mdash;one before the first instalment is paid, when the roof has been put on and another before the final instalment is paid after the house has been completed&mdash;are carried out by the Department's inspectors.  The final instalment is not paid until any defects which come to light on the final inspection have been remedied to the satisfaction of the inspector.</P>
      <P>What could be done in addition&mdash; and this might be of some interest&mdash; is that where loans are being made&mdash; and these are the cases we are concerned about here&mdash;the final payment is made after the payment of the Department's grant subsequent to our final inspection.  Not always do local authorities make a final inspection before paying the final loan instalment. It could well be that an inspection might be arranged before that final instalment is made.  That would be an additional check on the value of the house and the manner in which it is built, and how it looks a month or two after completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot get away from the fact that a person getting a house built is embarking on possibly the biggest single purchase of his life, running into probably not less than £2,000.  He is unlikely to enter into such a big commitment again.  Prudence would, or should, dictate to such a person that he should have regard to the terms of the contract he is entering into.  Yet <Col N="3265" /> it is surprising how casual people can be about the biggest deal of their lives, involving a considerable amount of money, although the same people would skin the proverbial flee for a halfpenny.  Sometimes they walk backwards into contracts that leave an unscrupulous builder an opportunity to give them bad value for money.</P>
    <P>That does happen.  It is happening and, I suppose, will continue to happen but anything we can say here to bring home to the people that such contracts should be said.  Not only are they seeking value for money but a sound home for themselves.  That covers all sorts of repercussions, financial and sanitary, if it does not turn out well. Anything we can do here, or through local authorities, to bring to the notice of our people how careful they should be in this matter should be done.  We should impress on them that we cannot, nor should they expect the Department to, look after every detail for them.  They have a duty to themselves. They must be prudent and cautious.</P>
    <P>The first thing they should do is to start off with a reputable builder. Even then, they should have regard to what is in the contract and what they propose to buy and what they expect to get for their money.  I have suggested that the local authority before paying the final instalment of the loan would make a final inspection. That might lead to further consideration and it is open to the local authorities, in fact, to retain some money for a considerable period on foot of SDA loans or on foot of supplementary grants.  Nothing prevents them doing that but the question of the repercussions it might have on prospective owners and builders is something they must take into consideration. Another inspection by local authorities would be no harm.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity of saying, as Minister for Local Government, that the standard of building in my opinion at the moment is not as it should be and that the tendency that occurs in boom building periods is there&mdash;it is not very considerable as yet&mdash;the tendency to <Col N="3266" /> jerry-build when there is too much work in the trade.  It is a natural thing.  I want to warn those concerned with the building of grant-type houses that my inspectors will be notified to be on their guard to try to prevent any development of that nature.  It is only fair to say that so that later on nobody can say there has been a change of practice and a tightening up of the inspections and that it is unfair. Whatever may have been got away with previously will not be allowed to happen in the future.  Our inspectors will endeavour to find these flaws which have occurred in the past&mdash;perhaps, not purposely&mdash;and have led, I am afraid, to a decline in our building standards.</P>
    <P>I am sure I have the support of the House in taking this line of action. It is in boom conditions we have this type of jerry-building, and it would be a pity if in five or ten years' time we were to reap the reward of badly-built houses.  Taking all things into consideration, I think the Deputies who raised these points should be more satisfied than they were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's remarks about the possibility of having an improvement by having more inspectors and particularly by having greater control by local authorities. It might be no harm if local authorities were reminded of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to another point.  Very often we see advertisements in the papers and on hoardings near housing sites announcing: &ldquo;Houses for Sale&rdquo; and giving the name of a builder or a solicitor.  I have in mind builders building anything from 15 to 30 houses.  In those cases a responsible architect should be employed by the builder, and before payment of the grant is made he should certify that the materials and construction are up to a certain standard.  Again, before the final payment is made there should be a certificate from the architect on behalf of the speculative builder.  No architect will jeopardise his good name by signing a certificate unless he is satisfied that the construction and materials are up to standard.  If that were done, I believe it would help a <Col N="3267" /> lot.  I would like to have the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We can have a look at it.  One thing comes to mind immediately. In some cases the architect actually is the speculative builder himself while, on the other hand, the company may sort of &ldquo;own&rdquo; the architect.  In those cases what the Deputy suggests would not be feasible, but I shall certainly examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking it for granted that the architect is a separate entity.  From my experience of the officials of the Department of Local Government, God help the architect who would certify a house as being of a high standard when it is not.  I would have full confidence in the officials of the Department to see to it that he would not try it a second time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the point.  I am not suggesting that my officials will have the wool pulled over their eyes in cases where the architect is the builder.  In that event the Deputy's suggestion would not be of much use.  In the case where the builder and architect are part of the one group, there is not much sense in that either.  In saying that I am not suggesting that anybody would try to put one over on us in this, but it is rather nebulous to suggest that if I were a building contractor and also happened to be an architect, I should give a certificate in order to keep my company straight.  It might be suitable in other cases, however, and I shall examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister.  We also have the profession of auditors in this country.  Do they audit their accounts and, if so, are they accepted as the true value of the accounts?  Surely, if an architect appreciates the importance of his profession, he would not certify a building to be of the proper standard unless that were the case?  I would ask the Minister to further investigate this between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This section states:</P>
      <P>Where a person who applies for a grant under this Act dies before the grant is paid, the grant may, subject to the provisions of this Act, be paid to his successor in title.</P>
      <P>There is just one point I should like to put to the Minister.  The personal representative of a deceased person may find himself with a house which is under construction and is not completed or which indeed has not been very long started.  I should like, also, to inquire from the Minister whether a grant payable to an applicant who would build a house would be payable to his personal representative in case of death?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The kernel of the matter is that under this section&mdash;it is a section in operation for quite a number of years&mdash;the normal requirement is that letters of administration must be taken out.  If, as often happens, that taking out of administration is a long drawn out and costly affair&mdash; a cost which the personal representative could not easily afford&mdash;we can accept a signed document by all the members of deceased's family saying that such and such a property belongs to such and such a member of the family and they have no claim on it. We have some procedure such as that. It operates in particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>As to who would be entitled to the grant, it would be the legal personal representative.  He would have to take out administration.  He would then get the appropriate grant from the Department and presumably the grant from the local authority.  After that he would be completely free to do what he wished with the property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise again now a matter to which I drew the attention of the House on the Second Stage.  Where a person gets the Government grant but, in some fashion, cuts across local regulations, may the local authority, the manager, or anyone else, withhold the supplementary grant because the applicant has broken some by-law?  Is the local by-law paramount?  Could the applicant be denied the supplementary grant for contravening the by-law? Would there be any appeal against such a decision?  It seems to me not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the Housing Acts, or the regulations made under them are, unwittingly, in conflict with a local building by-law, the Housing Acts take precedence over by-laws. The grant can be allocated even though the by-law is contravened.  There is nothing in the law to prevent a supplementary grant being given to the applicant. If the local authority decide they will not pay, there is nothing in the Act empowering the Minister to make them pay.  If, in the ordinary course, a grant is allocated and paid by the Minister, then the supplementary grant should also be paid even if it contravenes a local by-law.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I may not appreciate that aspect of things.  It is merely an amendment&mdash; I do not know whether the Minister saw it or not&mdash;to increase the floor space from the figure of 500 to 600 and from 1,400 to 1,600.  My view was that in so many of these cases, people will look for a grant and tend to build a certain size of house in order to qualify for the grant and then make provision to add a room later on. The result is that they get the grant but often they destroy the appearance of the house.  If we are to try to improve living conditions, a small increase in the floor space on these lines might be accepted by the Minister. I am told that, for some reason I do not quite understand, the amendment is not in order.  I should like the Minister to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of public money is probably spent in keeping a check on the present limit of floor space.  Architects can do a lot <Col N="3272" /> of things to defeat the purpose of the area limit imposed in previous legislation. The net result is not good.  Most of us know cases where after the final grant has been made, an extension takes place at some stage.  Why not provide for an increase in floor space?  A very small increase would probably save a lot of money for the State generally. I know of one case where it took a year and a half messing around between builders, architects and inspectors to get a grant which had not been finally paid but which after a great deal of difficulty was paid. The situation should be rationalised. If a man exceeds the floor space, I am not grumbling, if the limit is increased in a small way.  If he exceeds the present floor space, it is going to cost a great deal more than he will get from the State to the State and the owner of the property for the sake of that extra few feet.  The Minister should have a look at this whole thing again.  It is too limiting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the points made, the 1,400 square feet has been the upper limit for the past 30 years.  Of course, that could be used and possibly would be used as an argument as to why it should be changed.  It is not to me a convincing argument.  The fact that a provision has existed for 30 years and has been, relatively speaking, successful is, in my estimation, a reason why it should remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider that a 1,400 square feet area house will provide four bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen and bathroom, I do not think we are talking realistically in talking of grant-aided structures if we want to have them bigger than that.  If people do spend a year and a half messing about and spending their money and taking up the time of the architect and builder to find ways and means to defeat the limitation of 1,400 square feet, it just shows the effectiveness of having some limit.  If people who have money to waste try to evade the law, if we raised the limit to 1,600 or 1,800 square feet we would encourage people with even more money and less sense to mess around for two, three, four or five years and to engage <Col N="3273" /> two or three architects in order to find a way around the law to get something for nothing from the Department of Local Government.

On the basis of cost, I do not think it raises any worth-while argument.  As to the desirability of having State-aided houses of a bigger size in order to encourage people and to help people who are able to afford to build a 1,600 or 1,800 square feet house, to encourage them with taxpayers' money is not really justified.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £250,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>When bringing in a Supplementary Estimate on 21st February last, I gave the House a fairly full account of the history of the Avoca Copper Mines over the past 15 years or so.  I think it will suffice now if I indicate the principal points in that history.</P>
      <P>Following a favourable report on the Avoca deposits by a leading British consulting engineer, Mianrai Teoranta commenced the exploration of the deposits in the area in 1947. The exploration continued until 1955 at a cost to the State of about £540,000.  As a result of the explorations, the mines were advertised as having reserves of some 13½ million tons of ore, with a copper content of over 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>A number of approaches were received from mining concerns, and negotiations were commenced in 1955 with Consolidated Mogul Mines of Toronto.  A mining lease was granted to a subsidiary of that company&mdash;St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd.&mdash;in January, 1956.  The lease provided for the repayment to the State out of the profits of the Company of the £540,000 spent by Mianrai Teoranta and for the payment of royalties on the minerals extracted in the form of a percentage of the operating profit realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the following two years, St. <Col N="3276" /> Patrick's Copper Mines Limited were actively engaged in the development of deposits and spent somewhere in the region of £2,000,000 in that operation. At that stage there were certain credit restrictions in Canada and they found difficulty in attracting moneys beyond this £2,000,000 for further development.  In March, 1958, they asked the Government for certain assistance as a result of which a Supplementary Estimate providing for the guaranteeing of £1,368,000 loan was approved.</P>
    <P>Commercial production commenced in October, 1958.  As a result of difficulty experienced in the operations, largely as a result of the caving in of old workings, further assistance was sought and a second State guaranteed loan of £550,000 was approved in December, 1959.</P>
    <P>The two loans, which were made by the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited on the State's guarantee, were protected by a mortgage on the assets of St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited and there was a further provision that, in the event of a default in payment leading to the guarantee being called upon, virtually all the Canadian owned shares in St. Patrick's would become State owned.  Subsequently, St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited raised a number of different loans from private sources in Canada.  As a result of unsatisfactory operational results and exploration findings, however, they found difficulty in raising further capital and, accordingly, they approached the Government again.</P>
    <P>In February of this year, the Dáil approved a Supplementary Estimate authorising the making of payments to the company which, together with certain further payments which received approval in principle at the time but which did not fall due for payment until the financial year now current, amounted to £240,000.  I explained that the purpose of the Estimate was to provide money to assist St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd. over the ensuing few months when their resources would be unequal to their commitments.  I made it clear that, even with the further injection of money then proposed, the position at Avoca was <Col N="3277" /> serious.  In particular, I said that the whole future of the enterprise might be jeopardised if further testing of the mineral resources did not produce results nearer to the findings of Mianrai Teoranta on which the decision to develop the area was largely based, or if copper prices declined or if the further development work to be undertaken by the company encountered new difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say that, while the price of copper has been maintained, although at the rather low level of slightly more than £230 per ton, the reasonable hopes entertained in regard to the other two factors have not been realised.  Check drilling carried out by the company has continued to show results at variance with, and for the most part worse than, the results obtained by Mianraí Teoranta in regard to both tonnage and grade, that is, both the quantity and quality of the ore available.  In addition the practical difficulties met by the company in regard to both development and production have continued, and resulted in a reduction in the rate of output to a level at which it was seriously uneconomic.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the company came to me some time ago and told me that a further investment of some £600,000 would be necessary to keep the company in production to the end of 1962 and to bring it to a position where they estimated it could pay interest on the loans made to it and thereafter break even on its operations, but without being able to repay capital.  The company said it was unable to procure any part of this additional capital privately, and proposed that it be provided by the Government.  After discussions with the company, they were informed that the Government would not make further State funds available to them.</P>
    <P>An offer from the Canadian interests concerned was then received to the effect that they would put up 20 per cent of the additional capital required, provided that the loans totalling about £1,918,000 made to the company by the Irish Life Assurance Co. Ltd. were capitalised and that the Canadians <Col N="3278" /> were given a 50 per cent. interest in the reconstructed equity of the company. Capitalisation of the loans advanced by the Irish Life Assurance Co. Ltd. under guarantee would require the payment of the amount of the loans by the Government to the Assurance Company in return for a corresponding share-holding in St. Patrick's.  This offer was unacceptable to the Government not only because of the conditions attached to it but because it offered no reasonable assurance that it would provide any lasting solution of the difficulties, and the proposers were informed that it was not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The position now is that St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd. are already in default, since 1st July, with the payment of interest of approximately £56,000 due to the Irish Life Assurance Co. Last week, I was informed orally by the company that they do not propose because of lack of funds to pay this interest, and they have now confirmed this in writing.  In these circumstances, a Receiver has been put in, in accordance with the terms of the mortgage deed.  The assurance company has already claimed from the Minister for Finance payment not only of the interest due but of the capital of the loan by virtue of the guarantee given to them under the State Guarantees Act, 1954.  With the payment to the assurance company of interest and capital by the State, not only their interest in the mortgage but a large preponderance of the shares of St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd. will revert to the State, which will thus find itself virtually the owner of the mine and the mining operation.</P>
    <P>Throughout the course of recent developments, the Government have kept the position under review.  Its primary policy was to ensure that, as long as there was a reasonable expectation that the mine could be worked economically, everything possible would be done to ensure that this objective would be achieved.  It is clear from the debate on the Supplementary Estimate here last February that all Deputies would endorse this policy.  It is motivated first by the necessity of securing the livelihood of <Col N="3279" /> the several hundred men employed at the mine, with all that that means to their dependants and to the life of the whole district.  Secondly it is important, that the amount of State money, approximately £2¼ million which has been committed in one way or another in the mine should be protected. I may say too, and I am sure Deputies will agree with me in this, that we would be sorry to see the Canadian interests which had promoted St. Patrick's at the loss of the £2 million or so which they had invested in Avoca, and while we would not be justified in expending the taxpayers' money in rescuing private capital adventured on a commercial risk, at the same time we wished to give the promoters every opportunity of rendering their enterprise successful.</P>
    <P>These considerations, and principally as I have said the protection of employment, were no doubt present to the minds of Deputies when advances of £240,000 were agreed to earlier this year.  They were in the minds of the Government in examining the request for a further £600,000.  I may say that, had there been any assurance that this £600,000 would have achieved its stated objective of putting St. Patrick's in a break-even position, there would have been no hesitation about seeking Dáil authority to pay it.  As it was, however, there could be no such assurance. The failure of successive infusions of capital from different sources to bring the company to the stage of profitable operation, and the receipt in recent months of mining results and geological forecasts less favourable than had been hoped even as late as last February, forced the Government to the conclusion that further injections of capital into the present operation should not be made until an independent technical assessment had been made of the whole situation.  As I have said the company was accordingly informed recently that no further State funds would be made available to them.</P>
    <P>As I have already explained, the situation now is that the Government in effect find themselves in command, through the medium of a Receiver, of <Col N="3280" /> the operations at the mine and of the fortunes of Avoca.  The Government have decided that an independent assessment of the geological and engineering factors should be obtained as rapidly as possible.  It is estimated that a preliminary report should be obtainable within three or four months. On the basis of this new assessment, decisions as to the future of Avoca will have to be taken.  Were we merely concerned with the economics of the case, it would probably be best to put the mine on a care and maintenance basis while this review of the situation was being carried out.  We cannot ignore the human aspects of the matter, however, and what the Government propose is that in order to protect employment in the interim period, production should meanwhile be continued, though the intention is that production should be conducted on as economical a basis as possible and that purchase of equipment should be confined to the minimum necessary to maintain production.</P>
    <P>This will involve loss in operation but I believe that there is not likely to be a significant difference between such loss and the cost that would be incurred by further exploration and development, without production, which I am advised will be necessary in order to fully determine the future prospects of the mine.  Efforts will also be made to explore the possibility of having the mine taken over as a going concern by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I would like here to remove certain misconceptions as to the life of the mine.  Statements have been publicised that only five years' reserves of ore remain.  This is not correct.  The position is that subject to the problems I have referred to being overcome proved reserves of ore are sufficient to maintain full production for five years, but that there are reasonable expectations that economically exploitable deposits, of which there are strong indications but which have not so far been proved, exist in quantities sufficient to extend the life of the mine by a further 10 or even 15 years.  Indeed, I am advised that it may well turn out to be the case, in view of what is known of the geology of the area, that still further reserves <Col N="3281" /> may be revealed as exploration proceeds.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be necessary to provide the funds necessary to carry out the Government's policy.  It is not yet possible to say how much will be required for this purpose.  Commitments to date amount to approximately £230,000 subject to what I will say about one item in a moment.  These commitments arise as follows.  In the first place, in order to enable the discussions with St. Patrick's to be completed and a re-examination of the whole position to be carried out, sums have been issued to St. Patrick's over the past number of weeks to enable them to keep in production meanwhile.  A total of £70,000 has been approved for payment in this way.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed that State funds should be provided to meet debts due to trade creditors of St. Patrick's.  The Irish directors of the company represented to me some time ago that the mine was being kept in production largely because this was the wish of the Government, and that this involved the incurring of debt for equipment, etc., which they would not feel morally justified in incurring if they did not feel there was a reasonable expectation that the debts could be discharged with the help of State funds made available, whether by way of capital investment or temporary assistance, to the company.  They contend that the State should help to discharge these debts and I feel there is force in their contention.  Even from the most practical, commercial point of view it is desirable, as long as the possibility of continuing the production exists, that the mine should not have acquired a bad commercial reputation by reason of St. Patrick's being obliged to default on their trade debts. It is proposed, therefore, to provide for the paying off of trade creditors, at a cost which is expected to approach £100,000.</P>
    <P>Finally, a claim may be made for paying off a Canadian loan amounting to about £60,000.  This loan was made to St. Patrick's expressly for the purchase of certain equipment which is essential to the operation of <Col N="3282" /> the mine.  This equipment is actually <i>in situ.</i></P>
    <P>These commitments, as I have said, may amount to about £230,000.  It is not possible to say what future expenditure may be, but I am proposing to put in what can only be regarded as a token figure of £20,000 for this purpose.  That is providing that the £60,000 will be proved as a debt.  The total amount of this Supplementary Estimate is thus £250,000.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that it is virtually certain that when the Dáil reassembles it will be necessary to ask for a supplementary sum to keep the mine in production until the reassessment of which I have spoken has been completed.  When that reassessment has been made, it will be possible to see our way clearer for the future.  It would be useless to attempt as yet to predict whether that future will see an abandonment of the Avoca workings or a restart on new and conceivably even extended lines.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable to have to bring a Supplementary Estimate of this sort before the Dáil, arising as it does out of the failure of an important undertaking which made a significant economic contribution to a large area.  It also made an important contribution to our balance of international payments amounting to almost £1 million annually from the export of copper ore and pyrites.  Two principles must guide us for its future.  First, if the operation cannot be made at least self-supporting, it cannot be maintained by continual shots in the arm of new capital even in the interests of employment. Second, it must not be abandoned unless and until we are satisfied beyond yea or nay that it cannot be made self-supporting.  This is the question to which we hope we shall obtain an answer within the next few months.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I ask the approval of the House for this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The account which the Minister has given will undoubtedly come as a disappointment to Deputies and, indeed, to all who have been concerned with the progress of <Col N="3283" /> events at Avoca over a number of years.  On the other hand, some of the information he has conveyed has answered certain queries that naturally come to the mind of anyone who has considered this matter.  Where there is such a large-scale public investment as the investment which has been made by the State in Avoca, it is important that a full and careful examination of the manner in which public money has been expended should be undertaken. For that reason, the decision to get the opinion of experts is a sensible one and in fact the only obvious decision that could be taken.</P>
      <P>I hope it will be possible to get competent technical assessment, geological or otherwise and that that assessment will be made in as short a time as possible.  It ought to be possible to get persons properly qualified to examine and report on the quality of the ore at Avoca and, if possible, give an estimate of the quantity of workable ore available.  I notice from the Minister's remarks that originally when Mianraí Teoranta reported on the availability of the ore there, they estimated there were supplies of copper ore available exceeding one per cent.  I gather from what the Minister now says that since the St. Patrick's Copper Mines have found that the actual workings did not prove that earlier survey and that in fact some of the workings proved that the original estimate has not measured up in the actual production results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later, the Minister remarked there was some misconception about the life of the mine.  I must say I find it somewhat difficult to reconcile these two statements.  If it is possible to assess the quantity of ore available, there ought to be some indication of the quality.  It may not be possible to assess accurately the quantity of ore at a particular copper content, or ore at a lower or higher content, as the case may be.  On the other hand, before it was possible to give an indication of the life of the mine, some assessment must have been made of the quantity of ore available and I should be interested to hear if any assessment has been made of that <Col N="3284" /> quantity and what indication there is of the quality, on the basis of that assessment.</P>
    <P>It is many years now since I had something to do with this matter in the Department of Industry and Commerce. At that time, Mianraí Teoranta, who had been carrying on work there for a number of years, as a result of their surveys stated that there was available at Avoca copper, lead, zinc and pyrites, and one of the problems at that time was that though much of this ore was not regarded as of sufficiently high grade, the problem of segregation was a real technical difficulty, that while there was ore available, the difficulty was to segregate the different ores, one from another.  What the House and the country would be interested to hear is whether unforeseen production and technical difficulties arose which caused this financial problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister did mention in the course of his speech that the copper content was below the trial borings or the estimate originally made by Mianraí Teoranta.  On the other hand, he did not say to what extent the copper mined there fell short of the estimate, or what quantity of the copper already mined was short of one per cent. copper, or gave a yield of over one per cent.  I wonder whether the segregation problem is still a technical difficulty there.</P>
    <P>The other matter that, of course, affected the financial operation there was the steep drop in the world price of copper.  When the Mogul Mining Corporation came here originally, the price of copper was about £450 a ton. The price today is something around £230 or £232 per ton.  For part of the time since, it has remained at £234 a ton.  During earlier discussions here, the Canadian interests expressed the opinion that if copper prices did not fall below £232 a ton, it would be possible to work the mine on an economic basis.</P>
    <P>Whether it is because technical or other difficulties have arisen, or the fact that the price of copper has for the greater portion of the past few years been substantially below the price prevailing in 1956, or whether <Col N="3285" /> both have contributed to the present difficulties and problems, I am not clear.  This matter has been the subject of anxious consideration by Deputies and by those closely affected by it.  I think the views expressed here in February could be reasserted at present&mdash;that the general approach to this problem is similar to that expressed then: that the contribution which this undertaking made to the economy of the area was a most valuable one, that originally it held out high hopes of a worthwhile productive undertaking, that it had economic and social possibilities which revolutionised the prospects for Avoca and indeed for the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>It is vital in the interests of those employed in it, as well as the economic interest of the Avoca area, that a most careful technical assessment should be made.  It is equally true, as the Minister remarked, and as was stated here previously, that an undertaking of this magnitude depends for its continuance on its economic possibilities and on the possibility of working it on an economic basis.  For that reason, it is essential in the public interest that a first-class technical assessment should be procured as early as possible.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we should try to get a fuller picture of the position as it exists.  I gather it is proposed to provide a sum of £100,000 to meet certain trade creditors and £60,000 for a Canadian loan and then a token sum of £20,000.  The Minister referred to the fact that certain loans had been secured from Canadian sources.  He did not specify the amount so secured and while there is a general overall picture of the position, I should be interested to hear what sum was secured from these sources.</P>
    <P>At present the total State investment in this amounts to over £2,000,000.  I should like to say that from the national point of view it is important that a State investment of this magnitude should, if at all possible, be salvaged and rendered productive. Similarly, the fact that it was possible to secure technical advisers and experts from Canada and financial investment from Canadian sources is <Col N="3286" /> a very strong argument why every effort should be made to bring this mine into economic production.  No effort that can be undertaken by the Minister's Department or by whatever technical advisers he gets should be spared to ensure the continuance of productive possibilities there.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter to which the Minister refers, which is of economic significance, is the contribution which this undertaking made to our external trading position.  Exports of copper and pyrites amount to over £1,000,000, a very considerable contribution by any standard.  I should like to know what proportion of that was due to copper exports and what proportion to pyrites.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate also raises the question of the proposed fertiliser factory at Arklow.  According to the official announcement, the factory depended for the production of nitrogenous fertilisers on a supply of pyrites from Avoca as an essential raw material.  The prospect of establishing an industry with such a large public investment on the basis of the availability of a supply of pyrites must inevitably require most careful thought and assessment, especially in the circumstances which have now arisen. Quite apart from any technical opinions which may be expressed on the technicalities of establishing a fertiliser factory on the basis of pyrites or on the other bases which have recently been referred to and which are highly technical matters about which it is probably difficult for the layman to express an opinion and on which there may well be ground or reason for divergent views, the economics of a proposal based on a supply of pyrites, particularly in present circumstances, will obviously require to be considered further.  I have no doubt that before any decision is taken on that matter, the Minister will give the House and the country a full report.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate raises an even wider question.  The circumstances in which it is required, in my view, raise the whole question of the activities of State companies and the extent to which their activities are open <Col N="3287" /> to review by the Dáil.  The Dáil has a duty and responsibility to see that public money is wisely spent on the purposes and for the objects for which it is appropriated.  As regards ordinary Government Departments, this examination is undertaken annually with the presentation of the respective Estimates to the Dáil and the subsequent examination of the annual appropriation accounts by the Committee of Public Accounts to ensure that the money is spent exactly in accordance with the directions of the Dáil as appropriated when the Estimates are passed.</P>
    <P>State companies or State bodies are not subject to the same investigation or review.  Generally, this is reasonable enough because of the nature of the undertakings.  It is necessary to have freedom of action in running commercial undertakings.  It is also essential to preserve as confidential certain trade and business matters from possible rival trading concerns. No one expects an undertaking engaged in trade or commerce to be subject to scrutiny in its day-to-day activities. Having said that and having allowed a proper measure of freedom of action and control, the Dáil and the Government have a duty to keep the financial and other operations of State companies or bodies under review.  This matter has been adverted to here on previous occasions and has been the subject of considerable discussion from time to time in Britain and other countries.  The fact that it has not been possible to devise a satisfactory system in Britain is no reason why we should not try to devise a system here.</P>
    <P>In considering this matter, or in considering State companies and bodies, we generally tend to think of the successful undertakings such as those that readily come to mind, the ESB, the Sugar Company and many others.  Except for questions of policy and financial operations, they are rarely the subject of discussion.  There are, however, many other State undertakings, involving considerable sums of public money, where periodic reviews of activities would be justified &mdash;in fact, in certain cases for no other reason than to prove that the system <Col N="3288" /> of trading in operation is the correct one.  I believe this problem must be faced.  Taxpayers are entitled to know how public money is being spent and to see at regular intervals an account of the operation of State companies other than that disclosed in the annual accounts.</P>
    <P>It is true that all State companies present accounts in one form or another to the Dáil or to the appropriate Minister and subsequently they are laid on the Table of the House. It is equally true that, with few exceptions, these accounts are rarely the subject of a discussion here.  On occasions, accounts have been discussed by means of motion made and certain aspects adverted to and considered in conjunction with the Estimate for the appropriate Department or in cases where some Bill is introduced to increase the statutory limit under which the particular company is operating. On the other hand, most of the information given in these accounts is comparatively meagre.  I suppose invariably they comply with the requirements of the Companies Acts but at least they comply with what the accountants require in order to furnish their certificates when these accounts are presented.  The information generally given is meagre but that does not alter the reasons why, in the main, these accounts are accepted.</P>
    <P>We are now concerned with a company in which considerable sums of public money are involved, where over a period of time recurrent difficulties appear to present themselves. These difficulties are invariably unforeseen and unexpected when the operations are originally undertaken, but in world-wide experience, mining is a highly speculative business.  In many cases, after most exhaustive efforts have produced negligible results, mining operations strike a lucky break.  In other cases where operations were being undertaken, it happened that some chance investigation or some strike produced unexpected results. However, that is inherent in mining operations.</P>
    <P>What I believe we want to consider here this evening, as well as the matters undoubtedly of uppermost <Col N="3289" /> concern in the immediate future so far as Saint Patrick's Copper Mines are concerned, is the desirability and indeed the necessity for considering and establishing some machinery, either a Select Committee of the House or an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, to investigate periodically the investments and operations of State companies.  If necessary, certain information could be kept confidential to that committee in order not to jeopardise or in any way interfere with the commercial or trading operations of the concern. But nevertheless the committee would reassure and guarantee to the public that public expenditure was justified and that every effort was made to see that the utmost value was secured for the public confidence which had been reposed, both financially and otherwise, in the undertakings concerned.</P>
    <P>Subject to these remarks, we approve of the proposal the Minister has introduced this evening, not merely for the purpose of keeping the operations going, which is necessary, but also, I hope, with the objective of getting a competent technical and geological assessment of the position.  Even on the basis of the information we have been given, it is obvious that further financial assistance will be necessary in a comparatively short time to keep this company going.  It would be possible to review then the results of whatever technical examination is to be undertaken. We all can only express the hope that the technical opinions which will be secured will make it possible to exploit the resources there on an economic basis, not merely in the interests of all concerned in Avoca but in the national interest as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement here this evening has answered quite a number of questions that one was tempted to ask in connection with the Avoca mines and to a substantial extent the Minister has pulled back the curtain and given us a picture of the situation at Avoca.  I am sorry to say that, in general, it is a pretty regrettable picture.  I am sure the whole House will be disappointed to learn that a situation of this kind has been <Col N="3290" /> reached.  It is obviously a far cry to-night from the days we were told we were selling Ireland when we induced the Canadians to invest £2,250,000 in the development of the Avoca deposits. When you remember that at that time there were people now in the Government benches who said that the Canadians would make £13 million out of Avoca and leave it a dustbin afterwards, quite clearly, one occupation which these people should not take up is the occupation of metallurgist, and they should not try to pass themselves off in the role of prophets.</P>
      <P>What we succeeded in doing in 1956 was to persuade the Canadians, the only group in the world really interested in Avoca, to invest £2,250,000 there for the development of the deposits. It is true that in or about that time the price of copper was £450 per ton.  But copper, of course, is a mercurial commodity, as far as price is concerned.  One has only to look at the stock markets over the past 50 years to see the way in which copper goes up and goes down in price.  Very largely, its price is determined by the decision of certain countries to stockpile, in which case the price of copper goes high.  When the circumstances against which they have stockpiled have passed and they throw the copper on the market for sale, then the price falls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1955, the price of copper has moved between £167 per ton and £450 a ton.  It is now at the price of £232 a ton.  It was at that price that the Canadians said they believed Avoca would be an economic proposition. While they would have been glad to have seen the price continue at £450 per ton, or as near as possible to that amount, nevertheless, they were satisfied they could have done extremely well if the price were even much shorter than that amount.  Of course, they realised that a small mine in Avoca, the output of which does not even justify a smelting plant&mdash; and would not justify a smelting plant if it were even three times bigger&mdash;could not hope to influence the price of copper throughout the world.  This is especially true when you remember that the Rhodesian and Chilean copper <Col N="3291" /> ores contain a much heavier percentage of lead and other complex metals than is to be found at Avoca. I hope we can rule off now from the days of these daft prophecies that the Canadians would make £13 million. Anybody who would like to engage in light reading for the weekend ought to look up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Volume 154, preferably starting at Column 83 where the present Taoiseach delivers himself learnedly on the subject of copper and other minerals and, after two or three minutes says the Canadians will get away with £13 million of this.  He is assisted later in these lunatic prognostications by such well-known mining experts as the then Deputies Aiken, Childers, MacEntee&mdash;the whole bundle were thrown in.  You never came across such a bevy of mining talent in your life as precipitated themselves into the discussion of the Avoca mines.  If Avoca did not make the source of a first-class copper mine, it certainly very nearly made the source of a first-class play.  The number of engineering quacks who sought to bring their empty heads to bear on the deposits in Avoca was simply immeasurable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have ruled off all that now. That has gone into the insanity period, as far as mining prophecy is concerned. We have to face up to the cold realities disclosed by the balance sheet.  Whatever differences of opinion there were about the content of the mines and the profits to be made in 1956, whatever difference of outlook there was as to whether it was desirable to allow a foreign firm to come in here and spend £2,250,000 on the development of Avoca, we are all at least in the same boat now.  We have got a common interest in trying to save whatever can be saved of the Avoca mines.  But let us not overlook the fact that the Canadians brought in £2,250,000 and they backed their faith in Avoca by sinking that £2,250,000 there, in the belief that they could make a go of it.  They were encouraged to do that by the <Col N="3292" /> price of copper prevailing at the time, and even allowing for a substantial fall in the price.</P>
    <P>We made a lease of the mines to the Canadians for 21 years, but we could not guarantee the price of copper, for that is not fixed by us or by any one country.  It is very largely fixed not only by the producers in the countries where rich veins of copper ore are to be found, but it is also determined in large measure by the large countries which may decide to stockpile.  These countries might stockpile for commercial purposes or for military purposes and there is no substitute for copper.  Any lease we made to the Canadians did not, of course, contain any assurance that the price of copper would remain at any particular level but the Canadians asserted that if the figure was, I think over £220 they believed they could make a go of the mine at Avoca.</P>
    <P>They were told, of course, by Mianraí Teoranta at the time that there were two main deposits in Avoca, one was the pond lode and the other was the Tigroney lode.  In one there was about 2,700,000 tons of mineralised ore and in the other there was supposed to be 9,000,000 tons of mineralised ore.  It was said that the 9,000,000 tons ore had been assayed as grading 1 per cent. copper; that is what is known as the south lode. In the pond lode the copper was assayed as containing 1.35 per cent. copper.</P>
    <P>This report was made by Mianraí Teoranta.  It was prepared by their own personnel.  It was confirmed by what were then stated to be first-class consultants so that, so far as the Canadians were concerned, they got mineralised ore, 2,700,000 tons of 1.35 per cent. copper and 9,000,000 tons of 1 per cent. copper.  They knew all that.  They did not expect any better.  They knew it was low grade ore but they said there was a new method of processing low grade ores and they thought the flotation plant they subsequently installed was the answer to the low grade ore. Finding it so convenient in Avoca, with labour available on the spot at a rate that did not worry them, they believed <Col N="3293" /> they would be able to make a commercial proposition of Avoca.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister now to answer one simple question.  Mianraí Teoranta said 9,000,000 tons, 1 per cent. copper and 2.7 million tons with 1.35 per cent. copper ore in these two lodes at Avoca.  Do the Canadians now say that these reports were not, in fact, borne out by the evidence they found in their own exploration of the deposits in the area?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, therefore, that the Canadians took the mine on an assurance resting very largely on the references as to the mineral content of the ores as revealed by Mianraí Teoranta.  Now the Canadians say, and the Minister confirms it, that they could not find any ore in Avoca with a copper content of the percentages which were said to be there in the report submitted in 1954. That is, of course, a very grave disappointment to the Canadians and I can only assume now, from what the Minister says, that there are not 9,000,000 tons of one per cent. ore and there are not 2.7 million tons of 1.35 per cent. ore in Avoca.  There is mineral ore there.  Anybody can see it but apparently it does not contain the quantity of copper Mianraí Teoranta said it contained when they made their report in 1954, a report prepared by their own staff and underwritten by a firm of consultants. That is pretty tough.</P>

      <P>I should like to say, if I might intervene for a moment, that all the Canadian company exploration was done by boring and the ordinary exploration methods and, therefore, the findings of the Canadian company are not at this stage conclusive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very regrettable. One puts in £2,250,000 on the basis of a certificate from an Irish mining company, and a State-sponsored one at that, and one gets the report of the Irish company &ldquo;okayed&rdquo; by a firm of consultants, and then one gets £2,250,000 buried in the ground.  We discover now that the report was a bit glossier than was justified by the cold contents of the earth in Avoca.</P>
      <P>The Minister is, I think, wise in one approach to this problem.  The Canadians ought to get a chance, so far as we need give it to them, to redeem themselves, if it is possible for them to redeem themselves on the situation in Avoca.  The Minister says it has been established now that the Canadians cannot find the 9,000,000 tons of one per cent. ore and the 2.7 million tons of 1.35 per cent. ore.  Naturally, that is a considerable disappointment to them.</P>
      <P>When the Minister spoke on this matter on the last occasion, I think he said the Canadians were boring into the 2.7 millions area.  That is what is called the &ldquo;pond lode&rdquo;.  It was there the 1.35 per cent. copper was supposed to be found; but the Canadians were disappointed with their discoveries there, and the Minister indicated, I think, that they were going to move over to the 9,000,000 tons area to see if there was anything better there.  I gather now that, having searched both areas, they are disappointed in both areas and in the quality of the copper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the situation which has been reached, therefore, that the mine has not lived up, apparently, so far, to the certificate given to it by Mianraí Teoranta, there is only one course open to the Minister, that is, the one he has wisely decided to take, namely, to seek an independent survey of the mine from the most competent authority that can be found so as to enable us, on the one hand, to resolve this difference of opinion between the Canadians and Mianraí Teoranta, and, on the other, to decide whether or not further commercial development of the mine is possible or, at least, is possible on an economic basis.</P>
      <P>I do not know how long the Minister thinks it will take to get that independent survey.  I do not know whether he thinks he can easily get a competent firm to undertake the work but I gather from him that it is the intention to try immediately to get this independent test of the mine and that we should have as early as practicable a report from the consultants for further consideration by the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the Canadian company had contributed substantially to our balance of payments by the export of copper ore during the past four years.  It is interesting to note the figures given by the Minister on a previous occasion when he said that, in 1959, copper ore and concentrates to the value of £836 were exported; that, in 1960, copper ore and concentrates to the value of £1,100,000 were exported; that, in 1961, £809,000 worth of copper ore and concentrates were exported.  I do not know what the 1962 figure is to date.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some information on the 1962 exports when he is replying?  These figures take no notice of the value of pyrites which are not the subject of any separate index or tabulation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has raised a matter <Col N="3296" /> which I intended to deal with also, that is, the effect, if any, on the nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow, if for any reason the mine at Avoca is compelled to close down.  I have no doubt that the Minister could bring in pyrites from other places, including other parts of Ireland, and use it at Arklow or he could bring in sulphuric acid and bring it to Arklow for the purpose of production at the nitrogenous fertiliser plant, but I want to know from the Minister whether, independent of the future of the Avoca copper mines, he intends to continue with the location of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow.  Perhaps he could say something on that when he is replying?</P>
    <P>In general, I agree with the viewpoint expressed by the Minister in his introductory speech.  As I have said, he has taken the only course open to him, that is, to try to get an independent evaluation of the mine and then let us make up our minds in the light of that report what its future is to be.</P>
    <P>Having spent £2¼ million, perhaps £2½ million, the Canadians are entitled to some sympathetic consideration and I am sure the Minister will give it to them.  The development of Avoca was a magnificent effort, so far as they were concerned.  I had hoped that success in Avoca would light a fire never previously lighted on a commercial basis in this country and would lead to the merchandising of minerals in other parts of the country.  But, if Avoca dies now, it may very well mean that we are not far from the end of mineral development in this country.</P>
    <P>I would hope, therefore, that as long as there is a glimmer of hope that we can make any kind of reasonable success of Avoca, we should endeavour to do so, even if it means the State itself must, through a public corporation or public utility, continue to operate the mines.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is possible to do that.  Nobody can say definitely until the report of the consultants on the contents of the mine is received but it would be a great tragedy if at this stage every possible effort were not made, not only to save the mine in Avoca but all that it means in the way <Col N="3297" /> of employment, the development of Irish resources, its possibilities and its export capabilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hoped later in the year to be able to give us a report so that we could review the whole situation.  I would ask him to give the House an assurance that the mine will continue in operation while the Dáil is in recess, that it will not be closed in the meantime and that when the House reassembles, the Minister will find an occasion to make a statement on the situation to date so that the House can debate the new situation and see in what way it can make any contribution towards keeping the Avoca mine in production as an economic unit and as something showing great prospects, if it can be operated on an economic basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a matter of great regret to me and, I am sure, to other members of the House that the Minister found it necessary to come in here with another Supplementary Estimate in connection with St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  This occasion is somewhat different from the Minister's past efforts here in so far as it appears as if the Supplementary Estimate he is seeking is to wind up the business of St. Patrick's Copper Mines pending a survey as to the future prospects for Avoca.  The figure the Minister mentioned is about £2½ million.  He has given us a breakdown of the figures. I was very happy to hear that there is a sum there that will provide for the continued employment of the men in Avoca while the survey is being carried out.</P>
      <P>I was particularly gratified by the manner in which this Supplementary Estimate has been received by the two previous speakers.  Even if Deputy Norton did bring us back to 1955 and what was said on that occasion, I think, generally speaking, he agreed that the action taken by the Government on this occasion was the only course open to them.  I do not want to go back to 1956.</P>

      <P>There were some prophecies made in 1956 in this regard. I do not think Deputy Norton can be completely excused because he himself painted a fairly rosy picture of what he was doing.  It was unfortunate that it did not work out and I am personally very sorry the Canadian people were not able to make a go of Avoca.  I, possibly more than any other Deputy, realise what that project has meant to the locality.  I know Deputy Norton and Deputy Sweetman who were concerned with it at the time, and Deputy M.J. O'Higgins who has since come to represent County Wicklow, also realise the important part Avoca played in the economy of South Wicklow. However, I know a great many of these people personally.  I know what their pay packets have meant to them and to their wives and families and even though the prospects do not look bright, I am glad to see a sum of money is being made available to continue these people in employment while the survey is being carried out.</P>
      <P>With Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Norton, I wish to join in expressing the hope that the best possible technical advice will be obtained in connection with this survey.  From discussions I have had with people from time to time, I believe it is possible to work Avoca, maybe not to show a profit but at least to continue operations there without State assistance and to keep in employment the number of men who have been employed there in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1955, when discussions on Avoca were taking place in this House, I think 1.2 per cent. copper was the figure that was generally used.  Now we are told the figure is something like .8 per cent. copper.  Further surveys are the only means of finding out which figure is right.  Recently, I had occasion to meet somebody who has some experience of mining.  This person maintained that it was possible to work a mine economically with .8 per cent. copper.  I do not know whether <Col N="3299" /> that is true or not but that is one view I have had.  I have also been told that the mining technique in Avoca was the most up-to-date in the world and that it could be a very economically run mine.  This person also bore that out. If that is so, there must be some future for Avoca.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Canadian people have lost such a substantial sum of money on this project and I am glad the Minister stated that an opportunity would be given to the Canadian people of getting back some of the money they have invested there.  The only way in which they can recapture some of their money is by the continued working of Avoca.  I should not like to see the Canadian people stuck for such a large amount of money and I am glad the Government are anxious to help them out in this regard.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the nitrogenous fertiliser factory, which has been coupled with Avoca.  When the Minister was replying to the debate on the Supplementary Estimate in February last, he informed the House that it was possible for this nitrogenous fertiliser factory to go ahead independently of Avoca. Accordingly, I should like to ask the Minister on this occasion to make the position clear in this regard.  There is no point in having this matter ballyragged around the country, with people saying it could go here, there or elsewhere or that the project should not be proceeded with at all.  I should like the Minister to make an announcement, if he can, as to the prospects for this factory in Arklow.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken the only course open to him as regards Avoca and I sincerely hope that the advice he gets will be the best technical advice available and that as a result of the survey, we can look forward to a continuance of operations in Avoca as they have proceeded over the past four or five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly bear out fully what Deputy Brennan says with regard to the importance of the Avoca mines, as far as employment in the area is concerned.  Deputy Brennan can, I think, speak with <Col N="3300" /> greater and longer knowledge than I can on the subject and he can speak with personal knowledge because his own home of Carnew is very much within the sphere which was affected in respect of employment in Avoca.</P>
      <P>While everyone regrets the picture at Avoca the Minister had to present to the House and probably most people regard it as a very gloomy one, it is right to point out that there are some bright spots and that one of the matters which is very much on the credit side is the fact that for a number of years employment has been given, as the Minister himself mentioned, to several hundreds of people. That is a matter which has had no small impact on the area.  I do not pretend to know&mdash;I am sure the Minister knows&mdash;what the average weekly wage bill is in Avoca.  I imagine it is some thousands of pounds.  When one considers that, at the end of a year, that means something in the region of £70,000 being paid out to workers in the area and spent locally, one can appreciate the importance of the employment given to the people of the locality.</P>
      <P>While I say that the question of the employment given is very much a matter on the credit side and one that cannot be written off as of no importance, also on the credit side is the fact that the balance of payments position has been assisted to the extent of approximately £1,000,000 a year by the exports from the Avoca mines.  A considerable quantity of material has been exported over the years and the Minister has estimated that that assisted the balance of payments position to the extent of £1,000,000 a year.  That cannot be lightly disregarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the debit side is the fact that about £2¼ million of State money was put into the concern.  As against that, you had the advantage of the exports and the very definite advantage of the large scale employment that was given.  I think the Minister is probably doing the only thing he can do. I was glad to know that in his final remarks he mentioned that the approach of the Government to this matter was that the mines would not <Col N="3301" /> be abandoned, unless and until they were satisfied beyond yea or nay that they could not be made self-supporting. That is my own feeling on the matter and may I, as one of the Deputies for the constituency, urge on the Minister that there should be no question of closing down the mines, if there is any chance at all that, with certain assistance, they can be made self-supporting and continue the employment that they have given?</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced that the Government intend having an independent technical assessment of the position made both as regards the geographical and engineering factors. He mentioned that he hopes to have a preliminary report in three or four months' time.  I think we would all agree that it is a pity that as far as the workers are concerned, they will be left in this position of uncertainty and insecurity but I appreciate the Minister's position and that as things stand, that cannot be helped.  At least there is a hope held out in the Minister's approach and the approach of other Deputies who have spoken that if there are any reasonable prospects from the independent assessment the mines will continue in operation.</P>
    <P>I would like to urge the Minister also, as Deputy Norton did, that, one way or the other, even if the report comes in earlier than he expects there should not be any question of closing down the mines, without first coming back to the House and having the matter fully considered here.  I am sure that would be the Minister's own desire and approach to it.  I hope that the independent assessment when it is made, will be of such a nature as to warrant the Government deciding to continue the mines in operation.</P>
    <P>There are some questions on which I was not entirely clear from the Minister's statement and I am sure that he will clarify them for me when he is concluding.  I am not clear as to who is going to operate the mines for the moment.  I appreciate that from he is going to operate the mines for our own point of view the receiver will be in control but so far as the active operation of the mines is concerned is it the position that the Canadian <Col N="3302" /> people will continue to assist there? If that is not so, is the Minister in a position to say what alternative arrangements he has in mind for their running?</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Norton and Deputy Brennan in asking the Minister to give the House some assurance with regard to the fertiliser factory which it is proposed to build near Arklow.  There seems to be some confusion with regard to that matter.  It is assumed by a number of people that the fertiliser factory project is dependent entirely on the Avoca mines and on their continued operation. I understand that that is not so and that the fertiliser project can proceed as an independent project.  If I am right in that, I would like the Minister to make the position quite clear to the House so that the misunderstanding which has arisen may be avoided in the future.</P>
    <P>Finally, might I just say that if the question of the closing down of the Avoca mines should come about as a result of the assessment which the Minister proposes to have made, I would like to urge on him that, now that the mines have become a Government responsibility by reason of the fact that the Government have become their virtual owners by the appointment of the receiver, there is a definite responsibility on the Government to take whatever steps may be open to them to give opportunities for alternative employment in the area? It will have a grave effect on the whole area surrounding Avoca, if the weekly wage bill of people working in the mines is suddenly cut off.  If that situation should arise, I strongly urge on the Minister to see that some alternative employment in the area is given and that every encouragement is given to the provision of alternative employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent from the opening statement of the Minister that he and his Department have a patient on their hands that is seriously ill.  The first we heard of the Avoca mines was in 1947 and from 1947 to 1955, public funds were invested in the Avoca mines to the tune of £540,000.  We anticipated that <Col N="3303" /> by giving that subvention to the mines, they would be taken over by an independent company, give employment in the adjacent area and that they would not be a liability on public funds in the future.  That has been borne out by the statements referred to by Deputy Norton.  He mentioned how the then Opposition, the Minister's Party, were very worried about the concessions given to the mines, that they felt big profits would be made from the mines and that instead of handing these profits on a plate, so to speak, to the Canadians we should hold them ourselves, that if Fianna Fáil were in power they would work the mines and keep the profits at home.</P>
      <P>We have a completely different picture painted here this evening.  The figure for 1955 was £540,000.  In the meantime the patient got ill but the first we heard of that illness was in 1958 when the Minister came to the Dáil pleading that the Avoca mines needed money from the State if they were to continue in operation.  He said that the transfusion he required for the mines was £1,300,000.  That, to my mind, was an exceptionally big injection for the patient but this House, having addressed itself to the question at length, decided to give this £1,300,000.  The main concern of the House at that time was the maintenance of continuity in employment of the workers in the Avoca district. It was also felt it would be a big loss to the trading public in Avoca if the mines were to close and the wages of the men were to be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us at that time he was quite satisfied that once the Avoca mines got this big injection of £1,300,000 they would be able to stand on their own feet for the future&mdash;and we passed the money.  The next we, the taxpayers' representatives, heard of the mines was that they were again not feeling too well before Christmas, 1959, when the Minister came along again asking for another £550,000 and making a somewhat similar plea to the one he made in 1958.</P>

      <P>It was the Minister's predecessor who came here in 1958.  However, the Minister came along in 1959 and repeated the assertions of the former Minister and this House, for the very same reasons as before, gave its unanimous approval to the Minister's proposal for a guarantee of £550,000.  All went well as far as encroachment on public funds was concerned until some months ago, in February 1962, when the Minister came before us again and said he required a further sum of £240,000. He required £170,000 to carry the mine over the 1961-62 year and, in order to give them a start for the new financial year so that he would not be coming back again looking for more money, he said he was reserving £70,000 for the mines.  That money has been paid and we are back again six months afterwards seeking a further £250,000.</P>
      <P>Apart from the preliminary expenditure by the State of £540,000 this is the fourth time in four years the Minister has come before the House seeking for guarantees for the continuance in production of the Avoca mines and I believe it is incumbent on the Minister to give the House and the country some details of the working of those mines.  What was the turnover of the mines this year? Where are the balance sheets?  What was the capital expenditure?  How many men were employed and what wages were paid?  Who is directing the mines and what are the salaries paid?  Are they big or small?  Are the salaries paid to Irish people or to foreigners?  Who is the managing director?  Coming before the House for the fourth time in as many years, the Minister cannot hope to get the guarantee he requires without answering these pertinent questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another big question is whether we are satisfied the mines are being efficiently managed.  Surely any company or any board of directors who said in 1958 that if they got a certain amount of money, they would be able to stand on their own feet afterwards, who repeated the request in 1959 and repeated it again twice in 1962, would be knocked overboard immediately? <Col N="3305" /> It was mentioned that a State-sponsored body, Mianraí Teoranta, blundered in their assessment of the ore content of the mines.  We were told here this evening that five or six years ago they assessed the ore content at one per cent.&mdash;that there would be in the region of 9,000,000 tons of ore containing one per cent. copper and some 2,500,000 tons containing 1.4 per cent. copper.  I am sure the mining experts who gave those figures went to great pains and difficulty to make sure the figure was correct since there was such a big amount of money involved.</P>
    <P>Usually in making an assessment of that kind, one is more likely to err on the conservative side.  Deputy Brennan told the House tonight, and I am sure reliably, that the average ore content was .8 per cent.  Surely it is quite evident that if the ore content is much less than set out in the original assessment&mdash;it is in fact between 65 per cent. and 70 per cent. of what was estimated&mdash;the experts have a question to answer there?  Has the Minister taken any action against Mianraí Teoranta for blundering in this manner in a matter of vital concern since it involves so much State money? Did the experts who made this assessment get any reprimand?  Did the Minister call them into his office and say: &ldquo;Look here, boys, you have blundered badly, you have embarrassed me very much by giving me an assessment six years ago which has proved utterly wrong and as a result I have made statements in the Dáil that the mines were a sure bet?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On page 3 of the Minister's statement, he says that the Irish Assurance Company has lent £1,918,000 to the Avoca Mines.  Am I to assume that this sum is apart from the money we have given&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>Further on in the statement, I see that the State is asking for the current interest of, I think, £60,000 which is due to the Irish Assurance Company.  Am I right in assuming that if Avoca goes down, <Col N="3306" /> in addition to the money the House is guaranteeing, we shall have to pay the £1,918,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>This House has looked after the Avoca mine with fatherly interest.  We have watched and nourished it from the day it started in 1947.  We have cared for it as well as we could and, if I may repeat the Minister's terms, we have given it frequent injections to try to keep it alive.  Now we find the prospects are not too bright.  The demand made by the mining authorities is for a sum of £600,000 and not for £250,000, the amount of this Estimate.  If I interpret the Minister's statement correctly, the £250,000 will only meet current liabilities.  I think that £230,000 is required to meet the liabilities of the company up to the present and that there will be a carry over of only £20,000, according to the Minister's statement.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear in the statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it quite clear also that we shall be asked in the not too distant future for a further grant or loan?  I think grant would be a better term in the circumstances; I hope I am wrong, but we must go on hard facts.  It is reasonable to assume that before the year ends&mdash; and we are now in the second half of it&mdash;a further Supplementary Estimate will be required to keep the mines going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's statement some sympathy was expressed for the Canadians who put £2¼ millions into the mines.  Could we get more information on the Canadian investment? Are we satisfied they have lost the £2¼ million?  Did we make any inquiries to ascertain if they have got some of that money back through stock exchange dealings?  Has it all gone down the drain?  Have they got no return for it?  That is an important question.  This State, we know, has got no return for its money. <Col N="3307" /> Everybody agrees that is the position but we should be told, on the other side of the picture, whether the Canadians have lost their money in full.  I do not know if it is right, but it is alleged that they may not have lost the money, that they may have recouped what they invested in this scheme through exchange dealings.  If that is so, they must have been helped in their recoupment by the misleading assessment made by Mianraí Teo.</P>
    <P>A peculiar point about this transaction is that we did not give the money ourselves; we farmed that job out to the Irish Assurance Company so that they would get their whack out of it.  I understood from previous debates that when this money was voted by the Dáil, it would be paid by ourselves with no middleman and that the money would be paid directly to the mines from the Exchequer.  I now understand the Irish Assurance Company have a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; on it, that we did this job through them.  I do not like that.  I do not think in the Minister's statement previously he mentioned that the money would be lent by the Irish Assurance Company, with a guarantee of repayment by the State.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is a national question and I appreciate the anxiety of the Deputies who have contributed to the discussion that we should approve of this Estimate and take no action here that would hinder the development of Avoca.  Bearing all that in mind, can we, as a State, continue to guarantee money to such a company, without getting the information I have sought?  In fairness, I think we cannot, that we must get detailed information.  This is the fourth time the Minister has come to the House and we must have more information particularly regarding the efficiency of the management.  Are we satisfied they know their job; that they have the qualifications to control this firm which requires a good deal of ability? Are we satisfied they are making the best use of the money we vote them; that they are employing it in the most advantageous way in the company's and the nation's interest?</P>
    <P>It was unfair on the Minister's part <Col N="3308" /> not to have included some reference to the management of the firm in his opening remarks.  I expect to get that information in his reply.  If that information is forthcoming, I shall support the granting of money sought in the Estimate, but it is quite evident that support is contingent on the Minister making a more detailed inspection of the company and satisfying himself on the many points mentioned in the discussion. We want that information for the House and the country that may eventually have to pay this money.  We all hope that somebody in the company will some day be able to repay it. I do not want to be too gloomy in the picture I paint but I am afraid it will be some time before that day dawns.</P>
    <P>The Deputy from the constituency, Deputy O'Higgins, sounded a very pessimistic note.  I know he has interested himself very much in this mine and has a good idea of whether or not it is likely to survive.  But I was rather struck by the pessimistic note he sounded in his concluding remarks. He pleaded with the Minister to try to get alternative employment, if the mine were closed.  I thought that was very pessimistic on the part of a Deputy for the area.  It strikes me, to put it mildly, that all is not going well there at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for mining generally and we should not confine our attentions solely to Avoca.  The State has no right to discriminate. Every place is entitled to equal consideration from the State.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister not to confine his activities to Avoca.  There are other places in the country as well.  They may not be as nice as the Vale of Avoca but there are people there, too, who could do with a pay packet just as well as the people in Avoca.  I hope that the pessimistic note sounded here by Deputies&mdash;what other line could they take in view of the facts?&mdash;Will not be justified and that the Avoca mines will overcome their difficulties.  Even though I expressed the fear that the Minister or his successor will have to come back to the House in the not-too-distant future, I hope my prophecy is wrong.  I am asking the Minister to give consideration to Allihies because I believe the ore content there is far in excess of what it is in Avoca.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very easy indeed for anyone speaking from this side of the House to go back to the debates of 1956 and to quote extensively from the idiotic statements made at that time by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and, most of all, the Minister for External Affairs.  But the problem we have before us today is a national problem, and much though <Col N="3310" /> it would amuse me and make for the discomfiture of Fianna Fáil to go back on that debate, I do not propose to do so.</P>
      <P>However, I want to say one thing about it in an entirely objective way. When Deputy Norton and I started off to deal with the negotiations in relation to Avoca with the Canadians, we did so in the sure and certain knowledge that no one else had shown the slightest interest in this mine, that no one else was willing to come forward and to risk putting any of his money into the development of the mines there.  Knowing that, we approached these negotiations in the frame of mind that, if we could produce something of the minerals that were in the ground there, assisting us in our balance of payments and giving reasonable employment, whether the State did or did not make much profit out of the transaction was not of primary importance.  All the advice I got at the time&mdash;I think it was borne out by the advice Deputy Norton got, too&mdash;and which is on the files of the Department, was clearly to the effect that we could not possibly under any circumstances see in the future for any considerable time the continuation of the then high price for copper.  We were quite satisfied when going into those negotiations that the price of copper at that time was a scarcity price certain to tumble and that, unless we took advantage of the price then existing to clinch the negotiations at that time, there was perhaps no possibility ever of ascertaining the potentialities of the minerals in Avoca.</P>
      <P>We knew that not merely was that true then but also that there was a very strong possibility that we had seen the best of the surveys in relation to the properties in question.  It was most unlikely, according to the advice tendered to me at the time, that the actual working of the grades and the ores would be in excess of the survey results put forward to us by Mianraí Teoranta and confirmed by the consultants. In fact, the position has proved to be exactly in accordance with the views we were given on those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were faced with this situation <Col N="3311" /> in 1956.  Deputy Norton was abroad on one of those trips that produced very substantial industries and additional employment for the country, although they were decried at the time by Fianna Fáil.  When we came to this House in February, 1956, I was in this position: if I criticised at all the exaggerated&mdash;to put it kindly&mdash;statements that were being made then by Fianna Fáil, though I was reasonably satisfied at the time that the then price of copper would not hold, the only effect of any criticism by me as Minister for Finance would have been to injure and to harm the prospects of the Canadian company successfully developing the mines at Avoca.</P>
    <P>For that reason, therefore, and quite deliberately, though I was absolutely certain that when Fianna Fáil on that occasion were advocating and urging that we would not take Canadian money into this mine, but that we would go out with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Government and push&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;push&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;Irish investors into taking an investment in St. Patrick's Copper Mines, I decided, in the interests of the development of the mine, that it was better to keep quiet altogether.  For that reason, you will find that, throughout these debates, I did not at any time suggest that the price of copper was likely to fall or the possibility that the ore would not stand up to survey.  It was better that it should be that way.  Deputies know that I am rather a person who very often finds it very difficult to keep quiet when I am being taunted, but, if I had not then behaved as I did, if the Government at the time had not taken the view they did, and if the Government had not succeeded in prevailing on the Canadians to come in and put over £2,000,000 of their own money into this mine, we would never know, regardless of what the next survey might show, whether Avoca did hold out any prospects or any potentialities at all for us.</P>
    <P>The deal was made; the start was made.  As the Minister has indicated, the Canadians commenced by putting some £2,000,000 of their money into the working of the mine.  The Minister <Col N="3312" /> has not given us any indication, either now, or on the last occasion, of the manner in which that development money was used, nor of the manner in which the remaining funds were utilised after they had been granted by the authority of the State Guarantees Act and by Estimates introduced into this House.  At a later stage, I want to come back to that.</P>
    <P>The facts are that that £2,000,000, having been put into the operation, and the remaining moneys having been put up by the State with a guarantee indirectly, we have a situation today in which the results have not been satisfactory.  What are the causes of these results?  I suggest one can divide up the possible causes of the failure under three headings.  First, one would take, I suppose, in magnitude the fall in the price of copper. While the price of copper was as high as £400 at the beginning of the negotiations, there was at that time in every financial journal a clear indication that that price was likely to tumble at an early date.  The Canadians themselves said at the time that if a price of £240 was standardised, they would be able to succeed.  I have my doubts whether it could have been successful at that price.  In fact, as we know, at the time when Avoca started working, the price had fallen to £186.  It recovered later and it is now somewhere round about the £230 mark.  If anybody at that time&mdash;in this I include the Canadians&mdash;believed that the price of copper would remain at £400, equally it was expected, at the same time, and it certainly was hoped, that the price would not fall below the £200 level.</P>
    <P>We must remember that when the price of £240 was publicised at that time by the Canadian promoting corporation in Toronto, costs and expenses were not anything like as high as they are today and the equivalent of £240 in 1956, as a balancing operation, unless there had been a very substantial increase in mining productivity and very substantial increase in the estimated efficiency of the extraction of the ore, would probably mean that today we would require, on the same basis, a price of <Col N="3313" /> £280 or thereabouts to equate with the £240 of which we spoke in 1956. Be that as it may, I am certainly not sufficient of an expert on mining to know whether there has been any such increase in productivity or any such increase in efficiency in new engineering techniques.  The fact remains that the price is even now below the figure at which the Canadians at that time, in their most optimistic mood, said they could make a profit.</P>
    <P>The second cause to which one might attribute the failure is bad working.  I was glad to hear Deputy Brennan, as one who lives near, pay tribute to the method of working the mine and to hear him say that mining experts had paid such tribute.  When a thing is going badly, everyone always appears to hear all sorts of wild rumours and stories.  Some of us have heard some wild rumours and stories about the system of working in Avoca and about the complete lack of discipline in certain of its operations.  While that may have been the case at one time, I think it is significant that no one I have heard has produced any such story since the present manager went down to Avoca to take over.  It seems a coincidence that the stories about the lack of discipline and lack of efficient working terminated at the same time as the former manager left.</P>
    <P>The third cause with which one might be concerned is that working had become more expensive.  The increases in wage rates that have taken place, not merely in Avoca but throughout the country, since 1956 were bound to have their effects on the economic operation of the mine, unless new and improved methods were constantly being brought into operation to increase output in order to overcome these increases.  I do not know enough of mining throughout the world to know whether there has been in the past six years any such increase in productivity.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to tell us something about it.</P>
    <P>The fourth cause to which I would attribute the failure is that the mine in its operation did not stand up to <Col N="3314" /> the survey that was there before us. That survey was a survey made by Mianraí Teoranta.  It was confirmed by someone who was believed to be the best consultant that could be got at the time.  The assessment of the results of the drillings necessary for a survey is by no means an exact science.  While it is possible, I understand, without much difficulty, to assess the individual results that come up in each individual drill, the working out of the pattern that the ore takes so far below the surface from these individual drills must be a matter to some extent of estimate, to some extent of conjecture.  It is always extremely difficult to know whether it so happens that the drill that is being put down so many feet below the ground has hit a rich pocket or a bad pocket and it can only be on the basis of an average all round that an estimate can be made as to what the content of the ore body bebeath the ground may be.</P>
    <P>I do not know, for example, that the fact that the ore that was worked did not stand up to that survey arose because the Canadians, for their economic working, decided to approach the extraction of that ore in a manner different from the way in which Mianraí Teoranta felt it should be approached for the purpose of getting the results at which they had estimated the extractions.</P>
    <P>Quite honestly, I do not think that in a science, if I may call it that, an estimate of geological samples which are so far underground and, therefore, virtually impossible accurately to determine the results, it is fair to criticise the opinions given in the rather tough way that Deputy Murphy did criticise them.  The fact is that they were made according to the best of the ability in this country and confirmed by the consultants from outside.</P>
    <P>We have not got, unfortunately, much mining experience here.  We have not got here the practical experience over a large number of years of assessing different geological samples taken out from the bowels of the earth.  Perhaps we have the practical experience of assessing <Col N="3315" /> geological samples taken from the surface of the earth.  That has been done for a considerable period but the practical results of taking the samples from the bowels of the earth, as had to be done in the diamond drilling, is something of which we had not got, in the nature of things, the practice or the know-how that would justify us taking what was stated as being gospel truth.  It was, without question, the best estimate that was available to us and, as Deputy Norton has said, the estimate not having been good enough and the Canadians having accepted it, we do have at least the responsibility of hoping that things will turn the right way to ensure that they will get back some of their investment in the mine. But, while we may with simplicity determine that the cause of the failure must have arisen under one or more of these heads, the course of conduct we should adopt now is one which it is not so easy to assess.</P>
    <P>If I might start at the last one, first of all, I should like the Minister to give us clearly in his concluding speech what was the best percentage extraction that was taken at any time since the mine started work in 1958.  When I say the best extraction, I do not mean the extraction of an infinitesimal amount for the purpose, naturally enough, of putting on a good show the day people might be down there, but I mean over a reasonable period of time.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also give to the House the figures of the ore taken out month by month since the operations began?  I assume, of course&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash;that apart from the actual basic returns, the operators were bound to provide under the lease, because we provided certain basic returns under the lease, they have made available to the Minister any and every other information that he required.  But, what was the best percentage taken; what was the average percentage taken out and how did that percentage vary between the several lodes?</P>
    <P>There was a rumour going around at one time that the area that was <Col N="3316" /> believed originally to be the most likely for profitable working was in fact not as profitable as another lode in the area and that, in consequence, some of the initial funds had been lost in developing the wrong lode in preference.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister also tell us what was the amount of the total sales of copper, on the one hand, pyrites, on the other, and any other subsidiary sales as a third factor since the operation began&mdash;since 1958 up to any last convenient date?</P>
    <P>I cannot remember whether the company is a public company or a private company, but, having regard to the amount of State injection of funds, whether it is public or private, it would be highly desirable that the Minister should place in the Library of the House the accounts of the company over the period since initial operation so that we may have some opportunity of studying the manner in which public funds have been used.</P>
    <P>There was, as far as I can understand also, a suggestion at other times here that we were very wrong at the time in not providing that the Canadians were bound to install a smelter in Avoca or Arklow, as well as extracting the copper ore.  Of course, as Deputy Norton correctly said, the volume in the mine was obviously far too small to justify the provision of a smelter and, in fact, the non-existence of the smelter probably made it easier to sell the ore in recent years than it would have been otherwise.  The sale price of ore included a scarcity value following the developments in the Philippines where, instead of smelting, it was ascertained that it was a more economic proposition to break down their ore by chemical means rather than by the ordinary smelting.  In consequence of that, there was a very great over-capacity in the world of smelting appliances and, in consequence, there was an anxiety on the part of those countries which had over-smelting capacity to get ore, which would not have applied at all from a price point of view if the Avoca mine was big enough, which it was not, to justify doing our own smelting here. I do not know whether the Minister <Col N="3317" /> has taken that factor into account at all in his consideration of the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to have some indication from the Minister of the amount of pyrites that has been sold since the mine started and some indication not merely of the amount sold but of the period during which it was sold because even if Avoca were a success, it seems to me it would be entirely too short a life on which solely to base the setting up of the nitrogenous fertiliser factory.  From the somewhat pessimistic speech of the Minister, no one can say that the Avoca mine at the present time will be a success.  Even if it were a success for a short period of time on the basis of providing employment and providing some assistance towards our balance of payments without considering the repayment of the capital which has gone and which I am afraid most of us must consider has now been lost, that would be far too uncertain a supply upon which to base an investment of the type and of the size concerned in the fertiliser factory.  I trust therefore that the statistics and the estimates for that have been based not entirely on the provision of pyrites from just up the way in Avoca but allow for the fact that an entirely alternative supply must be provided.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Norton was speaking and when the Minister was answering certain questions put to him, there was some discussion about percentages in relation to the four lodes.  I think I am right in saying there were four different lodes or veins.  The Minister is probably in the same condition as I was six years ago trying to learn the jargon of mining.  I cannot remember the difference between a lode and a vein in the technical sense in the four areas of mining, the &ldquo;South&rdquo; lode, the &ldquo;Pond&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Tigroney&rdquo; and&mdash;I forget what the fourth one was.</P>

      <P>Whether it was an outcrop or part of the main vein is one of the things I remember being considered, but that is not the name that rings a bell.  However, in relation to this exploratory survey that is now to be undertaken, is it intended that it will cover all five, as the Minister indicates there now are, of these areas, or will it be restricted to any one?  If it is to cover all five, is it to cover all five simultaneously or is it considered that any one of these areas has the best chance of success and is therefore the primary area to be surveyed?</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister also to give us some indication of the type of export he proposes to get.  Let me be quite frank and say to him that he will find it extremely hard to get an expert who will give him an unbiased report because almost all the people who are expert in this type of operation have a tie-up in one way or another with different companies or with the prospects of different areas. It seems to me the only way he could get an expert to advise him adequately and successfully is to get someone who would perhaps be in the employment of some person who had a special reason to be on more than friendly terms with our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the great difficulty in that respect but, at the same time, I am not clear how production will be carried on while that exploratory survey is taking place.  I do not want the Minister to understand for one moment that I am casting any aspersions on the ability of the Receiver as an accountant but I do not think it is entirely an accountant who is needed to deal with a problem like this.  It must be someone who also has mining experience.  If a proposition is put up to an accountant by people engaged in the practical work of mining, he will not be able to say whether the facts, figures and <Col N="3319" /> reports they are putting to him are realistic.  In my view, the Receiver should have very considerable mining experience.  I do not know whether it would be possible to appoint as Receiver a person with mining experience and for him to get an accountant to assist him in the book end of the work or whether the reverse way is the better&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was about to say but certainly the two are required.  An accountant who is put in as a Receiver to work the mine in the manner the Minister indicated has an impossible task.  In saying that I am not passing any comment whatever on the gentleman's ability as a Receiver.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, from a purely legal angle, I was rather curious about the phrase the Minister uses in his speech: &ldquo;In these circumstances a Receiver has been put in&rdquo;.  I should have thought that as the initial mortgage was made to the Irish Assurance Company a Receiver would have been installed by the Irish Assurance Company.  Yet from the wording there, it would appear that the Minister has already, so to speak, accepted default and stood into the shoes of the assurance company under the guarantee. It is not a matter of any consequence except that I am interested in it from a legal point of view and perhaps the Minister can give us some help on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the difficulty of an accountant doing this job, great difficulty is bound to arise from the feeling of insecurity which occurs among the various key workers in the area.  While nobody who has been happy in his job would be anxious to leave if there were any real prospect for the future, at the same time, one must assume that when they see the difficulties all round, certain key workers might think of moving.  I hope that if that does happen, the Minister will be able to provide some means by which it can be overcome and avoid a situation which can only result in appalling <Col N="3320" /> losses, if these keymen are not available.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the company having obtained a number of different loans from private sources in Canada.  I would be glad if he would indicate whether those are the same loans as the loans of £60,000 for machinery to which he has already referred. If they are separate loans, I should like to know whether they went in with the other £2½ million in the total capital that has been sunk, and I am afraid &ldquo;sunk&rdquo; is the operative word in relation to any mine because it all goes under ground, whether it comes back in the form of returns or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the State was the owner of the large preponderance of shares.  Whether the insurance company or the State put in the Receiver, the position is that the Receiver has to recoup the loan moneys, first of all, and, if there is anything after that, it is for the benefit of all the shareholders.  I do not understand how the State could have come into the ownership of the large preponderance of the shares.  It seems to me that the State is the owner of the mine and that the only money the Receiver will be able to pay out of profits or the proceeds of sale will be those to pay off the loan moneys and give everything else back to the equity capital.  Therefore, I should be glad if that particular wording was explained.</P>
    <P>I am also in considerable difficulty in ascertaining the money already spent on the mine.  Perhaps the Minister will bear with me if I repeat that matter in some detail.  As far as I understand it, the Canadians put in an actual £2,000,000.  I thought the amount was to be £2¼ million but in the figures given in relation to the Supplementary Estimate last February, the amount was given as £2 million.  I should like to know what is the correct figure.  Under the first guarantee by us, there was to be put up a sum of £1,368,000.  That was followed by sums of £550,000, £170,000, £70,000 and £240,000, making a total of £2,328,000.  Are those figures correct or have I duplicated some of them?</P>
    <Col N="3321" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You have, to some extent.  The £170,000 should be added to the £70,000 making a total of £240,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If I take out the £170,000, I arrive at the same figure. That means that the Irish investments by loan capital and by Supplementary Estimate here come to £2,158,000.  In addition to that, Mianraí Teoranta spent £540,000 on development.  That brings the Irish investment up to £2,700,000 before this Estimate is given to them and with this Estimate, the Irish investment is £3 million.  Add that to the Canadian investment of some £2 million and it appears that the total amount invested in the Avoca mines to date, when this Estimate is passed, will be in the region of £5 million.  That seems to be a pretty large sum and in giving that large sum we have not got anything like the details we should have got tonight.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he would have to come back to the Dáil for a further Supplementary Estimate after the House reassembles.  He must have made up his mind as to what will be the amount he will have to ask us for then.  I think it only fair to the House and to the country that the Minister should give us some idea of the additional money with which the taxpayer is to be saddled by reason of the fact that this Estimate is required to keep the entire project from being written off.</P>
      <P>Let me make sure that I am not misrepresented in relation to this matter.  I am not advocating that the money should be cut off but I do think that there should be fuller information and a full picture put to the House as to what will be the additional amount we will have to meet at the end of four or five months when we come back after the recess.  It would not be unfair to say that no matter what happens, whether it would be success or failure, before the Minister comes to the House again, detailed figures should be put before the House and the country so that we can see where we have travelled and where we hope to travel in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may sound pessimistic in regard <Col N="3322" /> to this but I am afraid that I am not optimistic.  I read from the phrase the Minister uses here in page 3, where he says that the company came to him some time ago, that the examination of the situation by him and his Department took a very considerable time and perhaps that is the reason that the Government are anxious to give the company this money because it is to meet expenses incurred while the Government were making up their mind.</P>
    <P>I am not going to be as unkind about the matter as some of the Minister's colleagues would be, if they were on these benches and we were over there.  The charge would then be made straight away that the Government were dithering.  I am not going to say that.  This is a matter which required full, thorough and lengthy examination and if the case the Minister is making is that one of the reasons he feels he must meet these payments is that he required that length of time to make that examination, and that the debts arose some time ago, that is understandable, if one approaches the matter equitably but I am afraid his colleagues would not see it that way if the situation were reversed.</P>
    <P>No matter what reserves there may be at Avoca, they are nothing by comparison with the reserves in other parts of the world.  The richer veins of copper are somewhere in the two per cent., three per cent. approximation and there is in those veins some 400,000,000 tons reserve.  The amount of reserves we have are of so trifling a nature that they cannot affect prices, but equally when those richer veins are able to produce copper at £175 per ton and when the people concerned have those enormous reserves available, if there were an increase in future in the price of copper, they would be able to draw on their reserves and in that way create cash reserves to meet falls in prices at a later stage.</P>
    <P>We must remember this is the law of averages to some extent.  When the good Lord was creating an arid desert in Saudi Arabia, He did not give them much to look at on the top but He gave them enormous wealth underneath. <Col N="3323" /> When He created this country of ours, He gave us a very rich and fertile land and I think that in this case the law of averages is working in reverse against us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Jake Day theory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to liken it to something else.  What we have in Avoca in the way of mineral wealth will never make a great meal.  It may be pulled out now and again like a child pulling a raisin out of a pudding but that never makes a great meal. That is what happened in relation to the original survey.  Whatever the theory is in relation to a rich surface and a poor underneath, we can at least fall back on something they cannot fall back on in the arid desert, if they cannot find oil.</P>
      <P>May I say in relation to the general picture of mining, in an entirely objective way, that we were violently and viciously attacked in 1956 for having got the Canadians in to do this particular mining job.  I said earlier, and I repeat now, it was far better to get the Canadians in than to have nobody do it.  Of course, it would have been much better to have had our own people do it, if they had the technical ability.  Equally, in relation to the prospecting going on at present, it is much better foreigners were brought in to do the job rather than that it should not be done at all, and the Minister will pardon me if I refer to the reply he gave me here on 19th July last which showed that of the prospecting licences granted here in respect of 600 square miles, 75 per cent. have gone to Canadians or other foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister were on this side of the House, he and his colleagues, I have no doubt, would say the mineral wealth of the country was being sold to foreigners.  I do not make that charge because I realise if we cannot get our own people to do it, it is much better that we get the Canadians to do it, just as I believe it is better to have Ambassador Oil Corporation and others doing the oil survey rather than that it should not be done at all, that <Col N="3324" /> there should be no attempt made to find out whether we have any oil or mineral wealth beneath our land.  If we have, anybody who comes in to find it is welcome to the profits they make because the profits will be negligible in comparison with the benefits to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak here as a layman.  I confess to no greater knowledge of mining than the experts in this House who have been speaking for the past three hours on mining. The picture has changed considerably in connection with the Avoca mines over the past few years.  I recall that some six years ago the two major Parties in this House were vying with each other on the issue of the Avoca mines.  The Fianna Fáil group took up the attitude that there was a fortune to be made by the Canadians as a result of the activity of the inter-Party Government in handing the mines over to these people, and Deputies Sweetman, Norton and company were clapping themselves on the back for having achieved a wonderful success for this country in persuading a group of Canadians to come in and operate the Avoca mines.</P>
      <P>But the picture has changed.  It is no longer a matter of one or the other side taking credit.  Now we have them speaking with restraint, each side of the House saying: &ldquo;I would say a lot more only I do not want to be drawn. If I were on the other side of the House, I know what the other people would say at the present time.&rdquo;  Of course, they are showing a sense of restraint because they are all in the pot, all equally to blame for what has happened so far.  Only a few months ago, the Minister for Industry and Commerce came in here with a Supplementary Estimate to keep the mines going for a period and he got quite insulted and hurt at the criticisms levelled then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said: &ldquo;This is not my doing; I am not responsible for that.&rdquo; He showed his tender feelings in this respect.  If it had been successful, I have not the slightest doubt the natural reaction of the Minister or anyone in his place would be to claim <Col N="3325" /> credit.  This is a sad situation at the moment from the point of view of the workers.  It is sad that there is at the present time an air of uncertainty about the future of their employment and I think we should be more concerned with the workers involved and with the Irish taxpayers than we should be with the Canadians.  Since this debate began, all I have heard from all sides of the House is talk of the wonderful work of the Canadians, the sad situation that has presented itself in the loss sustained by the group from Canada who put their money into this venture&mdash;cheers for the Canadians and contempt for the Irish taxpayers.  Deputy Cosgrave spoke at length on the situation that has developed as regards the power exercised by the House over State and semi-State bodies.  For a while, I did not know whether he was in order or not but the Ceann Comhairle was the decider in that matter.  It was quite evident from the Deputy's remarks on State bodies and the necessity for more control by this House, that he sought to suggest that this company, St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited, was some sort of State company.  In that suggestion alone there was an indication to the public that State companies could not be trusted to do anything, that State companies were not fit to run certain ventures, that certain ventures should be for private interests.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear.  This company was founded by the Canadians and run by the Canadians and paid for, to a great extent, by the Irish taxpayer. What was the history of the company prior to 1956?  From a certain amount of research I have done, I am satisfied that the private enterprise group, small though it may have been, which some years ago operated in portion of Arigna showed just as great an enterprise in its development as the Canadian mining company which afterwards took over from Mianraí Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I understand that a company called Avoca Mines Limited functioned in a not very extensive way in the Avoca area in the mining business and that they came to the then Government <Col N="3326" /> some years ago and asked for assistance to the tune of £25,000 in order to carry out mining operations at a place called Connory, where according to the experts&mdash;I think the Minister is aware of the experts concerned; one in particular was afterwards employed by Mianraí Teo.&mdash;the extract in this locality was as high as 3 per cent. When this private company asked for State aid they were refused but not very long afterwards that company was approached by Mianraí Teoranta and informed that the State was going to take over their private mining rights in Avoca.</P>
    <P>I understand that after much discussion, negotiating and bargaining, a certain figure of compensation was paid to the private company and from that day on Mianraí Teoranta were responsible.  We know that perhaps £500,000 was spent by Mianraí Teoranta on the exploration, examination and investigation of the possibilities of the Avoca area.  They satisfied themselves so far as possible that it was a reasonable proposition and at that stage, we had the position arising as Deputy Norton suggested&mdash;this was his view and Deputy Sweetman's&mdash; that in all the world they could find nobody to take over and exploit these mines except the Canadian group. According to the inter-Party Government, nobody except the Canadian group was prepared to develop the mining potential of Avoca.</P>
    <P>I know, and other people in this House know, that a well-known Canadian speculator arrived in Dublin and, shall I say, floated down to Wicklow and had a look around Avoca.  He was familiar with the job of looking over potential areas where companies could be floated.  After having examined Avoca and getting information from Government circles on the report of Mianraí Teoranta, he got the bright idea that this would be a first-class venture on which to base a company.  It was through this gentleman that what is known today as St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited was born.</P>
    <P>The gentleman to whom I refer was connected with the Mogul company in Canada and he was, and is, known in <Col N="3327" /> Canada to be a manipulator of the stock exchange.  Having got the bright idea that this area in Avoca would be suitable to attract the money of people who utilised the stock exchange he went to London and it is common knowledge that he hawked shares on the stock exchange in London.  He pointed out in London, especially among sections of the community favourably disposed towards Ireland, that this was a wonderful opportunity for them to help the home country. He then went to Canada and these same shares were given plenty of publicity there.  Here is where the Canadian money came in.  A large number of Irish-Canadians and Irish people living in Canada were attracted to the idea put forward by this individual and his associates to buy shares in this company on patriotic grounds.</P>
    <P>They were told of the wonderful prospects it held for Ireland and of the amount of money they would make and to clinch the matter, the mining venture was described under the name of a saint.  Wherever you have a shamrock and a saint, it is a fair bet to attract some poor suckers into putting their money into it.  That has been the position in this country over the years&mdash;exploitation of something that should be sacred within the State. St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited was a wonderful name to use in Canada.  How reliable it would look! The gentleman to whom I have referred got out, having made his money on the stock exchange and the shares.  I do not know what he made but he lives in retirement in Canada at present and is very well off through manipulation on the stock exchange of St. Patrick's Copper Mines.</P>
    <P>He was not the only one.  I am personally aware of a man in Dublin who was shrewd enough, when this company was formed, to buy £1,000 worth of shares.  Inside two months, he sold them and got £3,000.  How many other people made money on manipulation of the stock exchange on this venture on Avoca, I do not know. Have we not the same situation arising at present in Tynagh where there has <Col N="3328" /> been a rush to purchase shares in the hope that people will make fortunes overnight?  I have not the slightest doubt that many people in Canada made fortunes on this idea of the Wicklow mining venture without the slightest work being done and without the slightest danger of their investment being lost.</P>
    <P>It is a ridiculous situation to have Deputies weeping for the Canadians who lost the £2 million they invested. Many of those people were like the people who put money into Shanahan's Stamp Auctions.  They put the money in to take a gamble.  They were not like the ordinary taxpayer who was mulcted in the Budget and who has to pay up now for the losses.  Because certain people look on mining as a form of gambling and are satisfied to lose on mining, there is no use saying the Irish people will have to do the same thing with their money in order to pay up for the losses these outside people have suffered.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to answer a few questions when replying.  He went part of the way when replying to Deputy Sweetman.  I should like him to say how much Irish money has been involved in St. Patrick's Copper Mines to date.  How much money has been advanced to the company from sources outside this House through the Department of Industry and Commerce in the form of loans and otherwise?</P>

Now he is asking the Irish taxpayer to subsidise inefficient private enterprise.  We had him stating in his opening statements that he hopes private enterprise will take over this venture later on. Let me tell the Minister that that is the rock he will perish on.  If the Minister thinks that, after the public have paid for the mistakes, the losses, the inefficiency and incompetence, when everything is fixed up, he can appoint his own pets to another private company and allow private enterprise to endeavour to run it successfully for another five years, he will find he will not get away with that.

      <P>When the assessment has taken place, the fact that the Government have put in this independent Receiver will not give them the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;The affairs of the company are now in good shape and we will hand it over to private enterprise.&rdquo; That is what is in the Government's mind.  I would not be at all surprised if they have picked out in their own minds the individuals who will run this company when it has been put on its feet again at the expense of the Irish taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the Government should have courage.  They should say at this stage: &ldquo;This is the property of the Irish people.  There <Col N="3332" /> has been enough tinkering and monkeying with it.  We are going to set up a State company and run it on behalf of the Irish people.  It has been running at a loss up to the present and those losses have had to be met by the Irish people.&rdquo;  If there is any prospect of money in it, then let that money accrue to the Irish nation. This would not be the first time that a State company ran things successfully here, and it is nearly time we gave an opportunity to a properly constituted State company to step in and salvage what can be salvaged from this project.  It may be possible that the project can be run without making any great profits; it may be possible that it can be run without incurring loss.  If it can be run without incurring loss, and since it provides employment, it will be good for the locality and good for the country, from the point of view of the balance of payments position.  We are not interested in big profits being made.  Particularly we do not want big profits made to be taken outside the country by those who, up to the present, have been lucky enough to make money out of this venture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, and others, have pointed out that there are regions in the world where there are vast reserves of copper.  Here was yet another example of cold water being thrown on a venture for which these very self-same speakers were taking credit six years ago.  It is said that there is only a small amount of minerals in Ireland.  I do not dispute that, but if that argument holds good in relation to copper, then the same argument should hold good in relation to coal, and everything else.  We should not exploit any of our resources.  We should meekly accept the view that coal should be imported from Britain.  On that basis, it is ridiculous to produce our own wheat. We could buy it abroad at half the price.</P>
    <P>No&mdash;if there is any possibility in this, let us keep the mine going. Let it be operated in the right way. I do not think the Government are going the right way about it at the moment.  I do not want to hark back to the way the Irish people were <Col N="3333" /> gulled about this project at the beginning. There can be no denial of the fact that the Irish people were led to believe that the raw material would be processed here and that a smelting works for that purpose would be set up.  But after a while the sad news was conveyed, bit by bit, to the public. The amount of ore was too small; one would want five or six times the amount of deposits before it would be an economic proposition to set up a smelting works here to process the raw material.  But the public were not told that at the beginning.  They were told that so much work would be provided on the processing and smelting and so forth.</P>
    <P>We are told now that was ridiculous &mdash;it just could not be done.  It was never envisaged.  All that was envisaged was these huge machines tearing into the sides of the hill, the raw material taken down and loaded on a ship in Arklow to be taken away and processed elsewhere.  There was no real advantage in that except that we got a certain amount of money to offset our balance of payments. The real benefits accrued to the people who did the smelting and processing outside this country altogether.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister now to let us know whether he is prepared to set up a State company or board to run this mine.  I want him to know that I strongly object, and will continue to object, to the idea of handing this back to private enterprise after the losses have been made good, and it is put on a running basis.  I have nothing against the individual appointed as Receiver, but I think the unfortunate man is merely a front. The Government will have to get an independent Receiver, with no connection of any kind with the Government, because we all know what this present Cabinet can do behind the scenes. In this particular venture, I think their hands should be securely tied by having a neutral independent group put in charge of any investigations that take place.</P>

      <P>Three or four days ago, I asked the Minister whether he had sufficient advisers to deal with mineral matters in this country and suggested that he might increase the number of expert advisers he has.  The Minister replied that he had very good advisers available, that he had the geological section of his Department, and so on.  I quite agree he has a geological section in his Department but the fact that we are faced with this issue this evening leads me to think, at any rate, that the Minister needs something more than he has got at present.  In effect, the Minister is asking us here for more money to carry on this project.  He has given us a financial survey more or less of what has happened over the years and he has intimated that he will have to come back again in the near future for still more money.  He has not really told the House why the mine has failed.  He has not told us why, when the prospects were so good, when the ore was proved, and when the experts estimated that there were 20 years of copper in the mine, and the money was made available, the mine should have failed.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave us one reason.  Now, Deputy Norton has some information on this matter and he stated that when the Canadian company was founded and took over the working of the mine, the price of copper was approximately what it is to-day; they were satisfied that with the then price of copper they could make the mine pay.  That is what I understood Deputy Norton to say.  He was Minister for Industry and Commerce when the venture started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was £450 a ton when they took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton said it was £230 per ton. Copper was £450 a ton at one time, but when this mine was first taken over, it was not £450 per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton stated here this evening that when he opened this mine, the price of copper was £232 per ton and the Canadian company were satisfied they could make the mine pay at that price. If I am misquoting Deputy Norton, I will withdraw, but that is certainly what I understood him to say, and I was sitting quite close to him.  Whether he is right in that, I do not know, but he must know something about it.</P>
      <P>Now that could be one reason.  The principal reason given by the Minister as to why the mine failed was that the price of copper had fallen.  Deputy Sweetman went further.  He gave four reasons as to why the mine failed.  He said, in the first instance, he agreed with the Minister that it was due to the fall in the price of copper.  The price of copper is something no one can control.  I attribute no blame to the Minister for failure in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason Deputy Sweetman related to the management.  I am not qualified to say whether there is good or bad management in the mine and I do not suppose anybody else in this House is qualified, either, to express an opinion on that.  That brings me back now to the question of expert <Col N="3336" /> advice and expert advisers.  By the time this Supplementary Estimate is finished, the Government will have invested over £3 million in this mine. Have they had any expert advice at any time from anybody who is a mining expert to the effect that the mine was properly run according to the methods by which a mine should be run?  Have they had anybody to advise them in order to protect the State investment?  I do not think they have.  They have geological experts who could tell them what was likely to be found in the mine.  They had a State company, Mianraí Teoranta, that was responsible for getting reports as to whether the deposits of ore could be proved or not.  Down through the years the mine was worked there was no mining engineer or representative of the Government, to my knowledge, whose duty it was to protect the State interest.  That is where the mistake is.</P>
    <P>If we are to expend money on mining, if we are going to expend in that direction on the Tynagh Mine or the other mines, there could be considerable expansion of mining.  I am not against expansion of mining.  If we can prove the existence of minerals, we ought to go ahead with mining but if we invest State money the taxpayers should be protected.  For that purpose I suggest to the Minister that he should set up experts in his Department on that matter.  He could, if necessary, repatriate Irishmen, experienced miners, working all over the world, and set them up as advisers in his Department.</P>
    <P>I fully and absolutely concur in what Deputy Sweetman said just now. There is a question of appointing an official receiver.  An official receiver can deal with financial matters but to a certain extent the official receiver in this case will have to deal with the ultimate management of the mine.  He will have to be for the time being overall director of the mine, no matter who is to run it.  I am personally not very clear as to who is running the mine at the moment.  In those circumstances the official receiver will require expert advice, unbiased expert advice.</P>
    <P>I take it from the Minister's speech <Col N="3337" />&mdash;perhaps I am wrong; I am not criticising in any way&mdash;that he has accepted absolutely <i>in toto</i> anything the Canadian company have told him. They have told him that it is not possible to get the produce of the ore out of this mine that was anticipated, that the prognostications with regard to that were entirely wrong.  That may be.  That very often is the case, I understand, in mining.  Mining, in all circumstances, is a complete gamble from beginning to end.  Where a mine is successful it is quite usual for people to invest money and to lose their investment in other mines.  In this case there does not appear to have been any other opinion taken as to whether the Canadians, who were the experts running the mine, were right or not.  If I am wrong in that, will the Minister say so?  If I am right in it, will the Minister accept my suggestion that he should get experts so that the State may be safeguarded in future because as sure as I am standing here&mdash;the Minister said so himself&mdash;in order to maintain this mine in existence, unless we cut our losses altogether which so far as the taxpayer is concerned are in the neighbourhood of £3,000,000, he will have to come back to the House to look for more money in the near future.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister what I have been told about this mine by a mining expert.  My information may be wrong.  My informant may be incorrect in what he told me.  I was told that the mine was estimated to have a production of copper ore for a period of 10 to 15 and possibly 20 years.  I am told that the people who were running the mine installed very heavy machinery, too heavy machinery under the particular circumstances of this mine in that the shafts were narrow in it, as most shafts are, I understand, in the mineral deposits we have under the soil in Ireland, that this very strong, big machinery was far too strong and effective for the type of mining that was to be undertaken and that as a result there was a very heavy dilution of the ore, that the machinery was not suitable to the mine, and that in his opinion this firm, the Canadians, were trying to get out of the mine in a <Col N="3338" /> period of about four years what they should have taken ten or 15 years to take, that it would have been far better if there had been, say, 250 men employed as against 500, if there had been a much lighter type of machinery used, that they would have got the results and would have been able to remain solvent and keep the mine open, without having to look for public funds all the time.</P>
    <P>Whether that is correct or not, I do not know and I do not suppose the Minister is in a position to know either.  He probably knows no more about mining than I do.  He has no expert advice at his disposal.  I suggest that is the root and kernel of the whole trouble.</P>
    <P>As far as the continuation of the mine goes, my point of view is that we will have to give this money to the Minister.  It is necessary that the mine should be continued in existence.  But, if we are going to vote the money and if the Minister has to come back again to the House, as undoubtedly he will have to do, it will be up to him to find out in the meantime how the mine is being worked, who will work it in future, what the potential of the mine is, what the labour potential of the mine is, whether it has, as I have been advised, a lesser labour potential, whether there is a certain future for the mine.  There is no use in our continuing in the present ambiguous position.  I hope the mine will be able to continue.  I hope it will be able to continue to give the employment it is giving.  I am directly concerned in it as far as my constituency is concerned because quite a few of the labour content are drawn from the area in which I live.</P>
    <P>I do not really attribute blame to the Minister in this matter.  I would not like him to think so.  I am only expressing a point of view that was expressed to me, and I think I am quite justified, now that it is said, in saying the Minister gave us very limited information as to why the mine has failed.  The reason he gave us such limited information was that he had not got the expert advice at his disposal which he should have had.</P>

      <P>It is true that the price of copper at the time this deal was made, or this lease was given to the Canadians, was £450 a ton, or thereabouts, and it was obvious to everybody that that price was unlikely to be maintained, certainly not for very long.  Deputy Norton also suggested that the Canadians at the time would have liked that price to be maintained but I doubt if they would because, from the little I know about it, it was obvious that if copper continued at that price per ton the likelihood would be that substitutes would replace copper in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my advice from expert sources so far as I could get it in that respect.  Nevertheless, whether it was desirable or otherwise, it was obvious, as I have said, that the price would come down and, unfortunately for Avoca, it came down much lower than the present price which I described as being comparatively low.  It went down as far as £170 a ton at one period for a short time and rose gradually from that a little higher than what it is now but has been maintained at roughly between £232 and £234 a ton for some time past.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made that the Mianraí exploration results were wrong as found in practice by the Canadians. I should like to point out that, as Deputy Sweetman observed, the deposits in the Avoca area are like a fruitcake.  You have currants, raisins and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a certain amount of drilling done by the Canadians after they started operations but, unfortunately, some of those drillings did not bear out the drillings by Mianraí.  I am told, and I have <Col N="3340" /> no reason to doubt it, that the methods employed by Mianraí Teoranta at the time were the very best available and the results attained were checked by experts, as has been mentioned in the House.  Some of these results are still capable of being checked because the manner in which some of those bores were taken was that the core, having been extracted, was cut in two down the centre and the half that was being checked by the expert consultants was sent abroad and the other half was retained by Mianraí Teoranta.  There may be a divergence of expert opinion as to the volume but I think the divergence of opinion here was not so much as to the volume itself as to the volume bearing a certain percentage of copper ore.  The Canadians apparently found that the volume that was reported as bearing one per cent. or more than one per cent. did not bear such a high proportion.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Supplementary Estimate I mentioned that one of the main difficulties was that the Canadians, in starting operations in this mine, found old workings which were quite convenient to the surface.  When I say quite convenient, I am not suggesting they were just under the subsoil but they were at a much higher level than the deposits which had been explored and reported upon by Mianraí Teoranta.  These higher-lying deposits were not reported upon at all by Mianraí Teoranta.  However, even though the ore content was much lower than would normally be worked by a mining company, by reason of the proximity of the deposits to the surface, the Canadians started to work on them.  They worked them reasonably well at the beginning but by reason of these cavings-in that occurred, their production was halted and losses were incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the manner in which the mine was worked, it has been suggested to me that the Canadian company did not drill sufficiently in advance or develop sufficiently.  It may not be necessary to explain but I shall do so in any case: there is a difference between development and production. Development is the work of tunnelling, <Col N="3341" /> getting at the ore body in order to extract the ore that is of value.  It was suggested to me, subsequent to these troubles having been conveyed to me, that sufficient development and sufficient drilling were not done in advance. To that extent, there may be some criticism of the company in regard to the manner in which they worked the mine.  Beyond that, I have not heard any criticism of the manner in which they set about the job.  It is true there was a change of management of the mine some time ago but I do not know to what extent that change was caused by reason of any defects in the previous operation of the mine, as has been suggested by Deputy Sweetman.  The fact remains that there is a mine manager who was brought in some months ago and I understand his capacity is beyond question. Fortunately for the Receiver, I understand also that he proposes to remain at the mine at least for some time.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the Receiver being an accountant&mdash;and being a first-class accountant&mdash;would not be competent to manage the mine, even in the interim period while the independent experts are being sought.  I have no hesitation whatever in agreeing with those sentiments.  The Receiver will have the advantage of having a group of three or four people with the best mining experience I can find in the country to help him to operate the mine on the production basis on which it is proposed to operate it.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I might say that when I sought the £240,000 Supplementary Estimate in the spring of this year, the company made a suggestion to me that it might be necessary to cease production and concentrate on drilling and development.  I asked for comparative figures between the cost of drilling and development as such and the cost of doing that work together with production.  I discovered the difference in cost was relatively low and therefore I asked the company at the time to use this £240,000 to the best advantage and to maintain employment as long as they considered it reasonably possible.  In the event, they retained employment to the full; <Col N="3342" /> at least no volume of men was deliber ately laid off.  By reason of this experience, I thought it well to advise the Receiver that production might be maintained while drilling and other development work would be going on which drilling and development work would be necessary in any event to establish what the real future prospects of the mine were.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy McQuillan's remarks, I deprecate his coming into the House and casting any aspersions on the capacity or the independence of the Receiver who has been appointed. I want to deny categorically that there is any connection as far as I know between that Receiver, his company and the Government collectively or individually.  It is a pity that men like the Deputy should make these wild statements here and then leave the House without bothering to hear a reply to them.  I said in my intervention that Deputy McQuillan was playing to the gallery.  The gentlemen of the Press are here and they have to report objectively all the statements made in the House.  Unfortunately, many of these wild statements get into the Press and take the headlines and somebody perhaps believes what has been said.

      <P>The only thing I am sorry for in making these remarks is being goaded into doing so.  Deputy Cosgrave asked me a number of questions and I hope I can answer them. He asked what was the value of the copper ore produced as compared with the pyrites.  I understand that the value, pound for pound, is about five to one.  I may be able to answer Deputy Norton's question when he quotes the value of exports for the years 1959, 1960 and 1961 as being something less than £1,000,000 by telling him that these figures include both copper and pyrites.  I used the words &ldquo;copper concentrates&rdquo; but I have inquired and I understand that includes both copper and pyrites.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked me what the monthly figures were and what was the best average ore content over a period.  The best average ore content in any one month was .92 per cent. and the average monthly figures show a great variation starting in 1958 with 15,000 tons in the month of September but rising gradually from 15,000 to 94,000 in the month of April of 1959.  There was a steady falling off then down to 61,000 tons in December of 1959 and all through 1960.  The lowest figure was 56,000 tons in February of that year and the highest was 78,000 tons in December.  There was again a slight upward trend from December, 1960, to January, 1961, when it was 80,000 tons. Generally speaking, there has been a steady drop in the tonnage since then. The lowest monthly figure was in 1962 at 41,000 and for May, 1962, the latest date available, it was 64,000 tons.</P>

      <P>I was not able to be here for the earlier part of the Minister's reply as I was trying to arrange the business for to-morrow, but the Minister will remember that the original estimate was one million tons a year.  Apparently we never reached the average that would produce that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got it in this document but the Deputy may have missed what I said in reply to a question, that the best average for a month was .92 per cent.</P>

    <Col N="3345" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the average must have been substantially less than that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The extractions were not all made from the one place. The extractions would be made from where the largest body of ore would be but with comparatively lower copper content.  I understand that the best method of production is where the largest body of ore with the lower content is married to the smaller body of ore with the higher content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Mianraí report showed one per cent. of ore and if there was 2.7 per cent. in 9 million tons, the average should have been well over one per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another consideration which is that the copper content as established by borings may not necessarily be maintained when the flotation plant has worked on it. There may have been some lightening of part of the borings generally and the tailings might have been taking away too much of the ore.  The assays of the copper when it is worked may not be as good as the assay when it is first extracted.  In taking it out and mixing it around in whatever way they do it, there could be some loss and that might account for some of the lower copper contents which they found in practice.</P>
      <P>To come back to the monthly output, having regard to the copper content of the ore extracted, I was informed that to reach a break-even figure, the mines would have to produce 80,000 tons a month.  As a result of the cavings-in to which I referred already, they were driven back from that 80,000 which they reached in early 1961 and in several months in 1959 and, by reason of a shortage of money at times, they were unable to maintain their equipment at the level that would make it as efficient as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently mining equipment deteriorates very quickly and needs a steady inflow of capital to maintain it properly. <Col N="3346" /> The company did not find it possible to get the necessary money for this in their own country and had to depend for these injections, as they have been called, on this country from time to time.  The lack of capital has hit them particularly hard in the past six months or so when production fell to 60,000 roughly in October and November of last year, to 50,000 tons in January-February and to 41,000 tons in April of this year.  There has been a slight improvement recently by reason of the fact that they have been able to buy some equipment on the understanding that the Government would pay for it.  It was 54,000 tons in May and that is the last figure we have.  The total tonnage extracted to date is 2,750,000.</P>
    <P>As far as the capital structure is concerned, the actual equity investment of the Canadians is £1.6 million. I think I allowed Deputy Sweetman to go slightly astray earlier on because I was unable to get a sufficiently quick grasp of the figures he quoted, but this is the true picture.  The Irish Life Assurance Company loans secured by the two mortgages amounted to £1.918 million; the advances by the State are £240,000 plus £70,000 which has been paid since, a total of £310,000 to date.  Then there are loans from Canadian sources.  I do not know whether I am authorised to give details of these at this stage but I think if I say that they were £269,000, £89,300, £59,200 and £69,200, I might be helping the Deputy who asked the question.  The last mentioned figure was in respect of a certain piece of equipment.  There is some doubt as to whether that should have been paid for out of sums we are now voting.</P>

It will take three or four months to have this independent survey carried out.  It was impossible for me on any advice I could get to estimate what this survey would cost or what it would cost to maintain production on the scale envisaged.  It was for that reason I wanted the £250,000, including a balance between the commitments that would be required to be met and that £250,000 as a token Estimate.  I may return to the Dáil in the autumn when we will have, I hope, the survey completed.
