    <Title>Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 1962&mdash;Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Section to which we took exception, not because more money is being made available for vocational education but because the ratepayer, as distinct from the taxpayer, is being asked to provide this money.  We think there should be a greater contribution from the Central Fund.  In the old days, technical education was a rarity in this country and the householder was asked to put up the greater portion of the contribution. However, vocational education has now reached a very important stage in the education of the entire nation and a greater proportion of the burden should be borne by the taxpayer generally.  That is the sole criticism we have of this section.</P>
      <P>We are in favour of the provision of more money for education but we consider that every person in the State should contribute towards it and not the unfortunate ratepayer who already has a burden to bear which is heavy enough in most counties.  The Minister, in his wisdom, should have another look at this method of raising money for vocational education.  He should see if more of it could not be extracted from the Exchequer and less from the local authority fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities are not asked <Col N="771" /> to contribute towards primary education. So far as I know, they are not asked to contribute towards university education.  Why, therefore, for this most important branch of education should the ratepayer be asked to contribute so heavily?  It is something the Minister should look at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill serves a very necessary purpose.  It is an acknowledgment of the brutal facts of inflation.  The old figures which limited the contribution of the local authority are no longer sufficient.  It shows that more moneys will be made available from such sources.  Of course, it implicitly acknowledges the importance of this kind of education in 1962.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the Dáil, I devoted quite a lot of my speech to the need for greater investment in this kind of education.  I think there is a realisation of the importance of the spread of this kind of education throughout the entire community.  If we are to grapple with the future, this, I believe, is our most important weapon.  Therefore, the Bill is welcome.</P>
      <P>I must agree with Deputy P. O'Donnell about the sources of the moneys.  As the Minister knows, very complex problems arise in that regard. The Minister says that such education should be supported mainly locally and, broadly, that is desirable.  However, the difficulties are obvious in areas where education is being provided for a much larger population than is living inside the supporting area.  The Minister will understand my reference.</P>
      <P>In the city of Cork, for instance, a very large scheme is carried out.  Practically 5,000 pupils are being taught under the scheme.  There are literally hundreds of teachers.  There are five important schools, two of which are of the utmost importance because of Cork's growing industrial potential.  In one of these schools, the most advanced technological training is being given. This is vital to the growth of an industrial community.  It does not occur outside Dublin and I think it merits special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> The committee in charge of the scheme are very far-seeing.  The classes and subjects that must be provided must be provided actually before the need for them arises.  Afterwards it is too late.  The public responses to the provision of these classes prove that.  Now we are in the situation that we are not able to do the work; we have not enough teachers to carry on the work that we are able to do, and I think that a major break-through is needed.  A big capital programme is in project and it is necessary that the demands of the future be met.  We have the industrial expansion and the promise of future growth in Cork.  We have the young people but we have not adequate buildings or staff and the provision of these calls for investigation both in terms of money and in buildings.</P>
    <P>The situation in Cork is completely unusual.  Geographically, Cork contains a little more than one-half of the city's active population.  That has been investigated elsewhere, but the present position is, that, of almost 5,000 pupils, practically 2,500 live outside the rating area.  Until that situation is adjusted special consideration must be given to Cork.  Cork's potential, I think, is too important to be left without this great service.  We have a population of 130,000 to be catered for by a rating area of 70,000.  Until that rating area is extended the burden must be carried elsewhere, but the burden cannot be discarded unless we are to make a mockery of all that has been said here about this branch of education.</P>
    <P>The Cork case is exceptional, the problem of teachers is exceptional, the situation of the buildings is exceptional, and if this work is to flourish, if the next generation is to be fitted to do the work which we hope awaits it, this investment of money and effort must be brought to bear on the problem. I commend that action in respect of Cork.  Its facilities for vocational training, its shortcomings and its needs, its ambitions towards industrial expansion, are obvious to the Minister and his Department and call for their alert consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to intervene <Col N="773" /> briefly regarding what has been said by Deputy P. O'Donnell concerning vocational education and the transfer of the cost of this branch of post-primary training to the Central Fund. I feel that what he has said in regard to the national schools is not altogether correct, since it is true that in the building and reconstruction of national schools the local people are asked to make a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct in respect of the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same also would apply to heating and cleaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>But not the ratepayers&mdash;the local people, every person in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, the money that comes in must come out of somebody's pocket in the locality.  It is not coming from direct taxation.  Therefore, I say the comparison the Deputy made is not correct on the face of it. In other words, local people also have to contribute towards the upkeep of the national schools, towards the heating, cleaning and reconstruction of these schools.  I also feel that if we were to carry this thing further, it is inevitable that we would have extra national taxation because the Central Fund must get the money from the general taxpayers, and while there may be some virtue in it in so far as explaining to the local people that they could call on the Central Fund for this money, I really feel that it is not at all easy to do it because we still have not got free education right from the bottom to the top and it will be many years before we can attain that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it is, I believe there has been fairly adequate machinery available to the local people to try to advance a little further in this field of vocational education.  There are many counties that have not yet reached the maximum permitted to them&mdash;15 pence in the £.  The only point that worried me slightly was whether some counties may be getting a little more than their just share in comparison with others.  They may have allocated this 15 pence all right, but my mind is <Col N="774" /> not at ease as to whether that is true or not.  I know that in my constituency of Cavan, which must be regarded as an undeveloped area, we have felt that we are suffering very much from lack of facilities for providing post-primary education of any sort.</P>
    <P>We have not a great number of secondary schools and we have not, either, a great number of vocational schools.  Our terrain is a very difficult one to manage.  It will be very costly on our ratepayers if they are to provide the number of schools and teachers necessary properly to serve these vast tracts of our county which still have not got post-primary education facilities.  We are not looking for any special concessions; we want only to be reassured that we are getting our fair share in so far as vocational education is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister in the case of a local authority raising the maximum amount of 2/- in the £, what would be the Departmental contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the local authority concerned.  We have not an even overall contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a local authority did not raise the maximum of 2/-, what would the Department's contribution be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The first few pennies would have to be raised without any contribution from the Central Fund and then in some counties it would be £1 for £1, in others £2 to £1 and in still others, £4 to £1.  It will not be in terms of pennies.  To answer the Deputy's question, I would need, first of all, to know how much a penny rates in terms of pounds in particular counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take County Donegal as an instance.  There a penny in the £ raises £1,300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Towards that £1,300, there would be an identical amount from the Central Fund in respect of some counties, but in the case of Donegal, there would be twice that amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.  I appreciate Deputy Dolan's point of view but there is the difference, which the Deputy possibly missed, that in the case of a local contribution for the building of a national school, the manager is responsible for the raising of the money.  He generally raises it not as a levy on each ratepayer or the head of a household but by organising functions, by getting the children to hold raffles.  However, supposing the manager had to raise his local contribution for the building of a national school through a levy on each ratepayer or each householder in the parish, would there not be an outcry?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good gambling element up there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of gambling at all.  It is a question of the children being asked to attend functions or the householders being asked to raise the money, but I have never known the managers in my county to put a levy on each household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In my county, the levy on the householders is only infinitesimal in cases where we are raising the money for, say, an £8,000 school.  The local contribution is generally about £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a very poor district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;parts of it.&rdquo;  The local contribution is usually made up of the purchase of the site and the lay out.  Mind you, despite what the Minister for Lands said last night about the price of land in the congested areas, when we come to buy a site for a school, we pay the market value for it, not Forestry Division values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> However, as I say, that is the procedure in my county and I cannot speak for any other county.  The local people could pay it, as distinct from the local householders.  I think that would be the proper way to do it and it would also be the proper way to raise money for vocational education &mdash;the taxpayers as distinct from the ratepayers should put up the money. It would not be such a heavy burden because there would be more people contributing to the pool because there are more taxpayers than ratepayers, possibly twenty times more.  That is why I am advocating this charge on the taxpayers instead of on the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy still has not got over the fact that there is a local contribution towards maintenance and erection of local schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Deputy, but the Minister does not say to the vocational education authorities: &ldquo;Your local contribution is £1,000 and you must take it from the ratepayers.&rdquo;  He says to the manager of the school: &ldquo;You can get it where you wish,&rdquo; when he is speaking of national schools, but when he is speaking of vocational schools, he says: &ldquo;Your local committee contribution is £1,000 but you must take it from the ratepayers.&rdquo;  That is my argument.  While you have rates at the moment of £2 12s. 3d. in the £, you could add another 2/- to them under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said you could raise it to a maximum of 2/- in the £ under the section we are dealing with now.  Where it is 15d. in the £ at the moment, we are entitled to put on another 9d. in the £, although since it may be done over a number of years, the impact will not be felt in one year.  I say that 9d. in the £ on a rate of £2 12s. and a few pence is a very severe impact, whereas if the entire people of County Donegal had to raise an equivalent sum, as distinct from the ratepayers, it would not be such a severe impact.  That is my argument.  If Deputies in the Fianna Fáil benches say that 9d. in the £ is nothing, let me remind them that when the local authority estimates come up in the month of February, we all have to pare and strip down as much as we can the estimates provided by the county manager, and we are lucky if we can take 1d. or 2d. off the global picture.  Ninepence is a considerable sum.  I am not sure what the rate is in the Deputy's constituency.</P>

      <P>Listening to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party one is prompted to ask how daft they can <Col N="779" /> get.  Deputy O'Donnell makes a perfectly simple proposition.  He says vocational education is now being levied very largely on the rates; that it has become a growing burden upon them and that since primary education is a national charge the time has come to ask ourselves whether the bulk of this charge for post-primary education should not be found from the Exchequer rather than from the ratepayers. There are hoots of rage from the Fianna Fáil Deputies who say : &ldquo;Sock it on the ratepayers.  Why should they not pay for vocational education?  They are paying for the primary schools out of the rates.&rdquo; When they are challenged on that they say : &ldquo;Do they not make a contribution to build schools?&rdquo;  Have they woken up to the fact that this is a proposal for an annual rate of 2/- in the £?  You do not build a national school every 12 months.</P>

There seems to be some etymological argument as to what the Deputy from Clare said, or did not say, but when you propose an increase of 9d. in the £ on the rates for vocational education which affects the ratepayers of rural Ireland, have you forgotten that you sent the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government in here six months ago to make an annual contribution of £2,500,000 from the Exchequer to relieve the rates, on the ground that the farmers could not afford to pay them?  Why did you provide £2,500,000 in relief of rates on agricultural land?  Was it not the argument here: &ldquo;We have reached the <Col N="780" /> absolute limit of the farmers' capacity to pay and the only way to relieve the situation is to take a lump sum of £2,500,000 per annum off the rates on land&rdquo;?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Where they have a large population coming in from outside the actual urban area to avail of the facilities in the urban area, there may be pound for pound.  But if we are to deal with it seriously, we ought ask ourselves whether we should not first face the fact that post-primary education is a proper charge as primary education has been.  Otherwise, we are going to end up by taking back from the rural community what Deputy Colley has described as the payment from the Exchequer designed to give them some kind of equality with all other sections of the community. I think the Deputy will agree with me that it would be grossly inequitable to give the rural community £2,000,000 to bring them up to the level of others and then proceed <Col N="783" /> to take it back from them immediately afterwards with the corresponding contribution from everybody else, which I think is the burden of Deputy O'Donnell's argument.  If everybody took up this 2/-, and there are corresponding increases by the Department, doubtless that would make a material contribution to the expansion of vocational education which is eminently desirable.</P>
      <P>We are reaching the point where we should try to do it with a larger contribution from the Central Fund. In that connection, I should be glad to know from the Minister, at some stage of this discussion, how far can he urge on the vocational education authorities the necessity for certain branches of instruction.  Can he urge on a local authority which proposes to increase the rates, say, by 3d. in the £. with a corresponding obligation on him to match it with a suitable grant from the Central Fund, to provide specified facilities?  What is present in my mind, apart from the actual technical instruction, is: can he lay emphasis on the teaching of modern languages in the vocational schools?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being done, I imagine, in Dublin, Cork and large places like that, but whether it is being done outside these urban areas is doubtful.  My consciousness of the problem was increased by my recent experience on the continent of Europe where there is a most striking and dramatic development going on.  If you speak to a middle-aged Scandinavian, or a middle-aged Dutch person or a middle-aged German, or Belgian, a multiplicity of languages is probably no more frequent than it is here in Ireland, but if you speak to Scandinavians from Denmark or Sweden, or to Belgians, Dutch or Germans, under 25 years of age, it is altogether bewildering to discover how many of them know two and often three languages, including their own.  That is to say you will meet a young Dutchman or Dutchwoman who speaks Dutch, English and German and what is even more staggering is that frequently <Col N="784" /> when you speak to them, you find they speak very good English and if you ask them: &ldquo;When were you in Ireland or in England to learn the language?&rdquo;, they will say that they were never outside their own country but learned the language in their secondary schools.</P>
      <P>That has been the deliberate policy on the continent, consequential on the European Economic Community mentality which has been growing there for long before the Treaty of Rome emerged.  But it is a very striking indication of how far we have fallen behind in that matter in Ireland.  I am not at all sure that England is not pretty far behind the continent in that matter also but there is a danger that our insular position will leave us an immense leeway to make up, unless we face up to the fact that modern languages are an absolutely essential part of post-primary education.</P>
      <P>I should be glad to hear from the Minister if outside urban areas any substantial teaching of modern languages is going on.  I know that in some centres like Enniscorthy, and towns of that size, modern languages are being taught.  I should be glad to know first if general facilities for the teaching of modern languages are available; secondly, if it is not within his power to press on the vocational education authority which looks for supplemental funds, consequent on the increased rates contribution, their obligation to provide language teaching there; and thirdly, despite Deputy Colley's helpful intervention, I should be glad if he would examine his conscience and ask himself, if Deputy Colley's explanation is adequate, how does he justify providing £2½ million for the relief of rates and agricultural land six months ago, and now proceeding to legislate in order to take it back from the community to which the Government felt it urgently necessary to give it, with the unanimous consent of Dáil Éireann, so very recently.</P>

      <P>Apart from going away from fact, we have gone away from the section and if the House does not mind, I should like to get something clear that caused a momentary panic in my breast when <Col N="785" /> Deputy Dillon said any worthwhile Deputy can get a school for a local contribution of ten per cent.  No Deputy can achieve that.  In some areas where obviously it would be a very heavy burden on the local community, we do make a bigger central contribution but it has nothing at all to do with the activity of Deputies. This is to save much trouble&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should know.  What has been raised fundamentally, I think, is the administration of the system of education which is a system peculiar to this country.  In terms of the national system, the administration is through the management method and we do require the managers to contribute some money, just to help them feel their responsibility in the local administration.  The contribution is not an annual one, except for heating and cleaning, but for buildings it is and it can be relatively substantial for the local area concerned but mainly it is demanded because of the local nature of the management.  Vocational education is again administered on a local basis by a statutory committee and again the financing of it can be through a combination of local and central funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>And school fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>And, to some extent, school fees.  But the administration is again mainly local and I think the strong charcteristic of our vocational system has been its local administration. Its adaptability and success is perhaps to a great extent due to the local nature of its administration.  The administration in secondary education has been mainly a private affair.  The schools concerned find their local contribution on a private basis from the payment of the fees by the scholars, the State paying a capitation grant and incremental salaries.  The ownership of the school is private.  To overcome the difficulty of people who cannot pay a fee, the State has introduced in conjunction with the local authorities scholarship schemes.  All the way through the system, there is that combination <Col N="786" /> of contribution, sometimes nominal, by the local authority, manager or administrator and a central contribution, which is very often the main contribution.  The question of how vocational education should be financed was decided many years ago on a local basis of administration and that makes me think it is well to continue this.</P>
      <P>What Deputies have lost sight of is this.  This 9d. has been the main topic this morning.  But the financing will not be 9d. but about 27d.  Taking the matter globally, it will be roughly one-third locally and two-thirds from the Central Fund.  For every £1 raised locally, the Central Fund will contribute £2.  It is not right to say that the bulk of the burden is falling on the ratepayers.  The bulk of the added burden will fall on the taxpayers again. Neither is it right to represent the ratepayers as the rural community alone, because the ratepayers in Dublin and Cork and our cities, towns and villages will pay rates as well as the farmers.</P>
      <P>There is good value for the money spent on vocational education.  It may be that in certain areas this Bill will not satisfy the demand for funds. Cork are particularly worried.  From my consideration of this, I think Cork will be able to manage their affairs as a result of this Bill, if it becomes law.  If they cannot, then, as an administrative act, the Minister for Education, with the permission of the Minister for Finance, can give central grants. There is nothing in this Bill to prevent my giving more from the Central Fund, giving assistance in the form of a grant or in the form of a higher ratio of central contribution.</P>
      <P>Of course, the rate of increase will not be a sudden one.  As I explained on the Second Stage, the demand which the vocational education committees can make will be 1d. in each year.  The rating authority may give up to 3d. if they want to in any one year.  The committee is appointed by the rating authority.  Experience up to now is that the representatives of the ratepayers have been happy about and have dealt with alacrity with any plan put up to them for increased expenditure on vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> On the question of languages, Deputy Dillon mentioned the smaller countries in Europe which, of necessity, because they were at the cross-roads, had to know more than one language.  Our position here is&mdash; and perhaps the same is true of much bigger countries such as Britain, France and the United States&mdash;that we have never had the need for another international language, because we do use an international language as well as our own.  In the last couple of years the possibility of a need for modern continental languages has become obvious.  In our secondary schools and vocational schools and in a variety of private institutions the Irish people are pressing in to learn world languages. There has been a remarkable increase in the number of people taking foreign languages in schools and in the number of adults taking them privately.  I have encouraged this in the secondary schools by providing for incremental credit for teachers who work in the countries where modern continental languages are spoken.  I hope to find other ways of encouraging the teaching of modern continental languages in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Apart from any action I have taken, there has been a considerable increase in the number of students taking these foreign languages.  I have a list of vocational schools here where committees are providing classes in modern languages or endeavouring to do so: Donegal, Galway, Clare, Limerick, Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow, Dublin, Louth, Cavan, Meath, Westmeath, and Kildare.  These can be recalled offhand. In County Clare, places such as Ennis, Kilrush and Scariff have classes going in modern continental languages.</P>
    <P>The question was raised by Deputy Dillon, if I could use force in this case. It has not been found necessary at any time to force them.  A suggestion has always been sufficient to get a response from committees to undertake valuable work.  Of course, I am in a position, because we do contribute, to bring pressure to bear; but that has never been found necessary at any time.  I think Deputy Dillon can rest <Col N="788" /> assured that there is not any neglect by our people.  Up to now we had not needed any other language, but since the possibility of the necessity arising, there has been an unbelievable demonstration by the people of enthusiasm and hard work in learning languages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would have it conveyed to the young people that there are very good jobs going for young people with a knowledge of German, Italian or French, he might get enthusiasm for learning these languages.  I want to express my gratitude to the Minister for what he has said.  We are aware that the local contribution for vocational education is only a percentage of the whole and that the State is really supplying the most of it.  The fact of building anything on the rates structure is dangerous in this context.  It is a dangerous pillar to lean on.  Rates are very high and it is very easy to stampede ratepayers.  This is a traditional expenditure.  Frankly, they grudge expenditure of this kind; and the work of vocational education is far too important for cheeseparing.  I would prefer if it were taken out of the short-sighted picture that local finance would impose on it.  Controversy of any kind in this matter would be very dangerous because there would be always the danger of the child being thrown out with the dirty water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the system of financing primary schools being compared with the system of financing vocational schools. I worked in a primary school down the country for 20 years and I would not wish our vocational schools to be carried on under the same system.  On the Minister's main Estimate, I said it would be a good thing if the Minister had at his disposal a central fund to pay for the building, repair and upkeep of the primary schools.  In my time, anyway, the conditions under which the primary teachers worked were not at all satisfactory.  The only way for the Minister to get money in addition to what is spent by the central authority is through the rates.  No doubt the present rates must be increased because we have increased <Col N="789" /> salaries, increased cost of living and increased cost of material.  One of the colleges in Dublin which four or five years ago was supposed to cost £800,000 is now costing in the neighbourhood of £1¼ million or £2 million. Prices, wages, salaries and everything else have gone up.</P>
      <P>Something that is very necessary, and I wonder if the Minister could do it or whether it can be done, is this. When you borrow £1,000,000 at 6, 6¼ or 6½ per cent. for 25 years, the school that costs originally £1,000,000 by the end of 25 years will have cost about £2¼ million or £2½ million.  If money could be provided for schools at a lower rate of interest, it would be a great help to the ratepayers and to the Government.  I have advocated this in Dublin Corporation but it does not seem to get anywhere.  I do not know if it is possible, but if it were, it would lower the rates.</P>
      <P>The more vocational schools we have the better.  The need for them is greater.  The horse is going, so far as the farmer is concerned, and it is very necessary to have vocational schools in each area where farmers' sons and those in charge of agricultural machinery will have an opportunity of learning all about that machinery.  Only vocational schools can provide that opportunity.</P>
      <P>In certain parts of the country, we have no secondary schools and sometimes children have to go ten or 12 miles to a secondary school.  Their parents are not in a position to send them as boarders.  If it were possible, as a temporary measure in cases where vocational schools exist, for the Minister to give the pupils in that area the temporary use of portion of the school as a secondary school, it would be a great advantage.  I understand we have three separate, watertight educational compartments but it is possible to do this if the effort is made.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to congratulate the Minister.  I do not like gilding the lily but no doubt over the past five, six or seven years, there has been a great advance in vocational education here and I hope it will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay <Col N="790" /> the House further but in view of exchanges which took place earlier, I feel I should say something in regard to Deputy Dillon's comments.  The Deputy appears to accept the argument I put forward as to the reasons for the relief given to the agricultural community in regard to rates and he quoted a figure of £2½ million and argued that under this Bill we are now going to take that back again.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that the amount which falls on the ratepayer as a result of this measure before the House depends, as Deputy Ó Ceallaigh pointed out, on the members of the committees concerned.  It is up to them to strike the rate, the contribution for vocational education.  Secondly, the amount of increases which are raised will to some extent be in respect of the provision of new and better services and so far as they relate to increased costs of salaries and maintenance, I think this country has been spoiled in the past by having education so cheaply that they do not value it because they do not have to pay for it to anything like the same extent as other countries.  To the extent that increases in rates attributable to vocational education bring home to the ratepayers and the people in general the fact that we must pay for our education and that in fact the odds are that we are going to pay a lot more in the future, it is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main principle that seems to have been argued here by Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Donnell is that ratepayers should not be asked to pay for vocational education because it would be more equitable to spread it over the much larger number of taxpayers. I ask Deputy O'Donnell to reconsider that argument very seriously.  Vocational education is based on an Act introduced by Deputy O'Donnell's Party before my time and I think before his.  That Act gave vocational education a most valuable characteristic which was the amount of local initiative, control and selfreliance which it involved.  It is the outstanding characteristic of vocational education and there is a grave danger that if the principle advocated by Deputy O'Donnell were accepted, this local control and initiative would <Col N="791" /> disappear.  We had a little hint of it in something the Minister said when he was answering Deputy Dillon's query about whether he could enforce things on committees; in other words, whether he could tell them: &ldquo;You must teach continental languages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said it had never been found necessary to do that, that committees had always responded to any reasonable suggestion but he did say that since we paid so much money, we must have this power.  We have the power but we do not exercise it.  That is perfectly legitimate and I think that would be the view of Dáil Éireann in such a case, but consider the implications of it.  If you abolish the local contribution from the rates, you are putting yourself in the position where inevitably this local control and ability to relate vocational education in a particular school to the district will be lost.  That valuable characteristic will go.  I ask Deputy O'Donnell to reconsider the matter very seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Colley's valuable contribution to the debate.  I see much logic in his arguments but when the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government in the early 30's or 1929 introduced what is known as the Principal Act, the 1930 Act, we must remember what vocational education was in those days.  We must remember the subjects that were taught in the technical schools.  While I cannot speak for Dublin, I certainly can speak for rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rural Ireland, the principal subjects taught to girls were domestic economy, shorthand and typing.  The only subject I knew to be taught to men was carpentry.  A person who graduated in any of these subjects procured employment locally.  The girls generally became domestic servants in the locality.  The classes were known as cookery classes.  Cookery was the only domestic subject taught and these girls procured employment locally.  They were of benefit to the local ratepayers.  Generally, there were itinerant teachers who went around three or four localities.  In those days in rural Ireland, you were very lucky <Col N="792" /> if you had one permanent school in a county.  The carpenter who did his apprenticeship in the technical school found employment locally.  He benefited the local ratepayers.  The shorthand typists, of whom unfortunately there were very few, generally procured employment in some local business or professional man's office.</P>
    <P>Compare that with what is happening today in vocational education.  We have magnificent schools that compare with vocational schools in any part of the world.  We have some of the finest teachers.  Consider the subjects being taught.  The Minister has very rightly told me that modern languages are being taught.  Will the students of modern languages find employment amongst the local ratepayers?  I do not think so.  The apprentice mechanics who attend these schools, and acquire a technique there, do not usually find employment locally; they move out to some of the cities.  I am referring to rural schools as distinct from city schools.  Graduates in the commercial subjects being taught to-day do not acquire positions locally.  In other words, the local ratepayer is paying for something which is of advantage to the general taxpayer.  That is the difference between the 1930's and the 1960's, in so far as technical education is concerned.</P>
    <P>Again, if we establish marine classes, as I hope we will, particularly in one of the premier seaports such as Killybegs, we hope pupils from all over the Twenty-six Counties will come there. They will acquire practical knowledge from practical teachers there and have an opportunity of doing practical work on the seaground.  If we expect pupils to come from the entire Twenty-six Counties, why should we ask the local ratepayer there to pay a contribution towards it?  An argument used by Deputy Colley, and a very good one too, is that he fears control may pass from the local authority, namely, the vocational education committee, to the Minister.  I do not think he need worry that that might happen.  The vocational education committees are in the same position as managers of national schools and, with the odd exception, we never hear of a clash between a <Col N="793" /> Minister and one of the managers down the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  You do not hear of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are something that can be sorted out at departmental level.  Again, there are exceptions.  We need not mention them to-day.  Generally speaking, there is 99 per cent co-operation between the Minister and his managers.  The only time they do fall out is as to the amount of local contribution in the case of a new school.  I think the vocational education committees are there to stay and that through their CEOs they will continue to cooperate with the Minister.</P>
      <P>May I point out to Deputy Colley, through you Sir, that what I object to is this: A ratepayer is a taxpayer and although the Government will give a two to one contribution, that is, for every £1 the ratepayer puts up, the Government will give £2, that £2 comes from the taxpayer.  The ratepayer is also a taxpayer.  So, the ratepayer, in addition to paying his contribution through the rates, is also paying his contribution as a taxpayer. That is very unfair.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, it is only three or four months since we relieved the agricultural ratepayer to the extent of £2½ million.  Now we are taking steps to take back from him some of that £2½ million.  That is not fair.  Perhaps Deputy Colley was not in the House when I said that we are in full agreement that the more money provided for vocational education, the better. All sides of this House are in agreement on that.</P>
      <P>The only thing that we in Fine Gael object to is that we think it is time the rates became stablished.  We have now reached the limits of taxation in so far as local rates are concerned and we think vocational education has reached such a broad level, it benefits so many people throughout the entire State, that instead of asking the local ratepayer to make a contribution, the taxpayers of the entire State should pay the full amount.  That is the only difference between us.  There is nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> Deputy Barron congratulated the Minister on his approach to this matter.  I should like to join with him. I think the Minister&mdash;like his predecessor&mdash;and his Department officials are doing a marvellous job for vocational education, a really magnificent job, if one thinks of 30 years ago, when you might have in a local authority one technical school.  Go around Ireland to-day and see the number of ceard scoileanna erected&mdash;magnificent buildings staffed by some of the finest teachers in the country, in which a wide variety of subjects are taught, which are most beneficial and possibly much more useful than subjects taught in secondary schools.</P>
    <P>It is on that basis that we have approached this Bill.  It is on the basis that the Minister and his colleagues in Government recognise the fact that the ratepayer has reached the limits of taxation, so much so, that they relieved agricultural rates to the extent of £2½ million and under this Bill permission is being given to local authorities to increase the rate by as much as 9d. in the £.  I know the Minister will say that, if the local authority increases the rate by 9d. in the £, he will give twice that contribution. If so, in addition to the 9d. in the £ being taken from the ratepayer, he will take some of that contribution from the ratepayer as a taxpayer.  That is my objection.</P>
    <P>Let nobody think that we in Fine Gael wish to obstruct the Minister or wish to retard vocational education. We do not.  We are in full agreement. We are united on this.  I think without exception in the House we are united that we must push forward vocational education but we disagree on the method of raising the funds to finance it.  That is all.  We think the money should come from the taxpayer rather than the ratepayer, that it should come out of central funds instead of from the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the rateable valuation. Theoretically, the rates raised on an area can be said to be based either on the rateable valuation of the total area or on the rates collectable from the area, taking into account any rebates or other concessions. There are two possibilities: one is the theoretical rateable valuation of a county and the other is the rate which can be collected.  The difference is the net rate, or the total rate minus any rebates or other concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original Act has been interpreted as meaning that a vocational education committee would get a rate based on the total rateable valuation of the area.  Committees, therefore, have got more than their share of the collected rates.  The position was left as it was until it was questioned by, I think, Dublin city and county; they thought the amount given should be based on the amount of rates collected. It is a matter which can only be determined by changing the wording of the provision to make it quite clear or else by having it determined in the courts.  I took the opportunity of this Bill, necessary for the financing of the <Col N="796" /> vocational education committees, to clear up the point.  If one takes a county in which there is a certain valuation but in which, as far as the county council is concerned, that total valuation will not be collected because of certain rebates and other concessions, then what the county council get is net.  But up to this money for the vocational education committee was based on the generous interpretation of the valuation of the county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Forestry is, indeed, a long term programme.  Development here has only reached what I would call the pit-prop stage.  The development of new forests is not at a stage where we are reaping the benefits we hoped for.  That is the only way in which we could justify the results in employment and productivity which are laid before us in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that a sum of £2,524,810 is voted this year for forestry.  At the same time, we find that the total <Col N="801" /> number employed is 4,803 and that the increase over last year is only 150 workers.  That means we are working towards the future and that we are investing in a project which we hope will give not only financial returns but also social returns, such as employment, ten-fold in the years to come.  That is the only way in which we can justify what we have.</P>
    <P>I listened to a lot of people speaking here.  Their line seems to be to congratulate the Minister and say: &ldquo;Is it not wonderful we have so many people working and that it is a great business?&rdquo;  A fortnight ago, I read an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on such a difficult subject as the nitrogen factory.  It was pointed out that the number of workers, namely, 300, would get £1,200 without ever working at all.  If you took investment in forestry and related it in the same way, you would find that you could keep your 4,803 workers at home and pay them a good wage for staying there.</P>
    <P>We are doing something which will give a much greater return in the future.  I believe it will and the policy is good.  I believe the first upsurge in the development of our land suitable for forestry and not suitable for agriculture began in 1948.  The tap, having been turned on, has been kept turned on since.  It is such a long term project that it may be 10 or 15 years more before you start to get the sort of returns which will employ our people and enable us to establish this pulp factory which will provide a lot of the high quality timbers which have to be imported.  We will have to wait for this situation.</P>
    <P>While, however, one sees in my own county in a limited way and in other counties in a much more intensive way, new planting, I find that in my county and in the county beside it, there are many privately owned woods where the timbers have gone past their commercial usefulness.  You can blame that on various things.  You find that these woods, largely, belong to old landowning families who have resided here for generations.  Times have not gone so well with that sort of family over the past 50 years.  They were usually <Col N="802" /> well-endowed from abroad.  That sort of thing seems to have gone.</P>
    <P>The income from large tracts of land, if not intensively farmed, is no longer high because of increasing overheads such as rates.  These people have not been in the position in which their forefathers were to maintain these woods.  My personal knowledge is that many of these woods have gone past their commercial best and are not being cut down.  Trees, as they come up for commercial usefulness, should be cut and replaced by planting.  I think that is where we fail.</P>
    <P>To give him his due, the Minister went around the country and made an effort to get private owners of woods interested.  His predecessors did the same thing.  Whatever the reason&mdash;and let us not apportion blame&mdash;the position is that we have not got it across to the private owners of woods that we have anything to offer them in the way of incentives or that there is anything there for them if they look after these woods and replant them.  That is a great pity.</P>
    <P>I believe that as well as the planting of State forests, there is a great amount of work to be done, but it can be done only in co-operation with these landowners when we have got it across to them that they have a potential asset that can be harnessed for their own future use and benefit.  In North Louth, we have an area where considerable forestry development has taken place. However, when we are up there and when we look across Carlingford Lough, from the Cooleys to the Mournes, we see that in Northern Ireland a much greater area has visibly been developed and at an earlier stage. Again, I do not wish to apportion blame.  We had our troubled times here, and so on.  In addition, I am sure we were slower in our initial approach to the asset that we had.</P>
    <P>In that area, there is very great opportunity which has not been harnessed to the full.  There is an area in my constituency where there is considerable unemployment and considerable seasonal as well as permanent emigration of workers to places in England, such as Blackpool, which in the summer period employ people who cannot find gainful work at home.  It <Col N="803" /> would be unwise policy if we here were to regard forestry as related to very marginal land in the West of Ireland, as if it were related to mountain land in various ranges and related to the more obvious places for our endeavours.</P>
    <P>I find that in the places which traditionally we would regard as the cream of our farmlands, places like Counties Louth, Wexford and Meath, there are areas which could very well be planted and could give posterity a great benefit, as well as being a sound commercial proposition for the State. The sort of place I am thinking of is a bad vein of land which I know well in County Louth.  It stretches from Blackhall, Termonfeckin, straight across the constituency to Rathbran and straight on into the centre of Ireland.  It may be a mile wide in places; it may be two or three miles wide in others.  Deputy Tully knows it as well as I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard it called by that name.  It is an area which is not suited to intensive agriculture. With the competition which we shall have to face and with the price which our farmers have had to accept for their barley&mdash;again, I do not apportion blame&mdash;the position is that it is not land that can profitably be harnessed in any way other than by forestry.  Furthermore, that is the type of place where you want employment and employment goes with forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another development has taken place in many other countries but has not been carried out here.  Again, if we could convince the private landowners of its efficacy, we might get somewhere.  It is a well-known practice in certain European countries where there are heavy death duties&mdash;not where there are none&mdash;for wealthy people in their middle life to plant woods of considerable area for the purpose of having something saleable and something valuable at time of death.  It is the same as if somebody took out an insurance policy and had <Col N="804" /> it marked under the Married Women's Property Act for one's wife if one were, say, self-employed in business or an employer.  On death, the sale of this wood or forest would defray death duties, so long as it had previously and at an early stage been transferred to a member of the family who knew the purpose and intention.  That is something which I have never heard of in Ireland.  I know it is done in other countries to a great extent.</P>
    <P>I shall end, as I began, by saying that every side of the House is agreed that the development of forestry here, as a long-term project, is something highly valuable and should be proceeded with.  While not saying that anyone is to blame, I would draw attention to the fact that the numbers employed, in relation to the amount of money expended in the past ten years&mdash;just to take a decade&mdash;are such that the return is not worth while.  It must be regarded as a long-term business which will bring, perhaps hardly to us but to those who follow us, a very great benefit in the way of employment and production within the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Estimate has been more protracted than I thought it would be.  I have been rather surprised at some of the misconceptions, both as to policy and fact that have emerged during the debate.  At all events, I hope to deal with the various points raised by the different speakers as I proceed.  I should have thought, generally speaking, that the policy of my Department as far as afforestation is concerned was more widely understood in this House and outside, and consequently I was rather surprised to hear some Deputies, including Deputy Esmonde, suggest that my Department were interested only in getting land in the immediate vicinity of established forest areas.  Of course, that is not so. That may have been the case some ten or 15 years ago, but that position cannot arise now because forestry is established in so many areas throughout the country that the situation has completely changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> My Department are now anxious and willing to accept land in virtually any part of the country where it is on offer.  It would be the very rare case indeed where an offer of land would be turned down for the considerations suggested here by Deputy Esmonde and some other Deputies.  I do not know how this misconception has arisen.  It was necessary for me some time ago to make it clear that it was the Department's intention to try to acquire any land suitable for forestry in the vicinity of established forest blocks, and I had to issue a warning that grants for private planting were subject to my approval and that people who were purchasing land in the vicinity of forest block build-ups would be well advised first to inquire whether grants would be available.</P>
    <P>It is incorrect for Deputies to suggest &mdash; I think it was again Deputy Esmonde who suggested this &mdash; that grants would not be available for the re-planting of old woodlands that were clear felled by private individuals in the vicinity of State forest blocks. That is not so.  What I did make clear was that some of the people who have come along to make what I call speculative investment in forestry by purchasing suitable forest land in the vicinity of forest blocks might not qualify for the grants available for planting these areas.</P>
    <P>Some shrewd businessmen did proceed some time ago to endeavour to buy land in the vicinity of forest blocks where they could take advantage both of State forest fencing and of State forest roads.  It was to these people that I issued the warning some time ago to the effect that in areas where suitable land was available for forestry, my Department would be interested in acquiring it and that those people who were purchasing land for the express purpose of afforestation in the immediate vicinity of State forests did so at their own risk as far as qualifying for the grants available from my Department for private planting was concerned.  I hope there is now no question of people who do clear felling of old woodlands being refused any of the facilities available from my Department.  The people I did refer to were those who expected <Col N="807" /> grants from the Department when competing for suitable forest land in the immediate vicinity of State forests.</P>
    <P>I also wish to emphasise that where land is available anywhere in the country suitable for forestry, my Department are interested in it, and while it is true that there were delays between inspection and acquisition, these delays are now virtually eliminated.  I hope to achieve further improvement in that field during this coming year as we are now engaged in a reorganisation of our forces, with particular reference to concentrating on the counties where the big forestry potential is, mainly west of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I realise there were delays between inspection and offer.  That was inevitable until we got the staff geared to deal with the new intensified afforestation programme.  It has been a big jump to achieve planting at the rate of 25,000 acres a year, and it was inevitable that there would be a certain amount of delay before we had the machine geared to deal with an acquisition programme that would ensure we would have enough land to achieve that planting programme.  I think I can now say that we have the organisation to deal with the new situation and I confidently hope that this time next year, we will not have the complaints we formerly had about the delay between inspection and offer.</P>
    <P>I want to refer at this stage to the question of private planting which was raised by a number of Deputies and to finish with it.  I dealt with it in my opening statement and while it is true to say that we can claim to have achieved a 100 per cent. increase due to the campaign we have launched, I am not at all satisfied with the figures. I have come to the conclusion that the main forestry drive in this country must be carried out by State services. In my view, part of the reason for our failure is the system of farming we have here, the system of land tenure, as distinct from the picture of some of the countries to which Deputy Esmonde referred.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this field that both I and the Department have not <Col N="808" /> tried to induce people to do more private planting.  We have gone from county to county with intensive campaigns in which I and the officers of my Department took part.  We got all the rural organisations to participate in the forestry drive for private planting. We arranged lectures in conjunction with the local committees of agriculture.  We did everything we could possibly think of doing to try to make people more forestry conscious. Indeed, in the west we reduced the minimum acreage to qualify for a grant from one acre to half an acre, to try to induce the small man to plant that waste half acre of marginal land which might be available on his small holding.</P>
    <P>The claim that we have achieved a 100 per cent. increase on previous figures on private planting is of course infinitesimal in comparison with the planting that is being done by the Department throughout the country.  I fully concede that I have got the utmost co-operation from all rural organisations, and from the local Press, in the different counties in which we engaged in those campaigns.</P>
    <P>While with those campaigns we did succeed in making the different counties forestry conscious and, indeed, in that way we gained another benefit in that we got more land in on the State side for the purposes of the Department, I agree that the national figures are disappointing, and notwithstanding the inducements offered, I do not foresee that there will be a great improvement on the private planting side.</P>
    <P>As some Deputies have said, very few of the old estates are left on which there are large areas of woodland. Most, if not all, of the large estates west of the Shannon have now been acquired by the Land Commission and split up and divided, with the exception of the portions of the old estates that have gone to the Forestry Division. The whole national scene has changed and, therefore, I think it is unrealistic to compare figures for private planting here with, for instance, figures for private planting in Britain where there is still the old landlord system, with large estates and large areas of privately-owned plantations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> Neither is it realistic to compare the figures in this country with countries like Turkey, Greece or the Scandinavian countries in some of which countries forests are indigenous and there has been natural regeneration over hundreds and hundreds of years. For instance, the general picture in the Scandinavian countries is that where an individual farmer may have only eight or ten hectares of what we call arable land, he has something like 300 acres of forest which he regards both as a bank and a system of insurance. He rarely draws on that 300 acres of forest to fell except in a case of emergency, if his wife gets ill, or he wants to buy a new tractor, or some such purpose.</P>
    <P>We found in those countries that one of the great national difficulties is to get people to cut the trees when they should be cut because, like farmers all over, they are rather conservative, and even though the trees have reached maturity, even though they have reached the age of 85 to 100 years, the farmer is rather inclined not to cut them so that his family will inherit them and he will keep intact what he regards as the family fortune. Campaigns are being conducted in those countries in an endeavour to get the farmers to fell and clear the trees when they should be cleared.</P>
    <P>The nearest comparison I could give the House is that if all our commonages, as we understand them here, were planted and had been under afforestation for generations past, different people who have undivided shares in these commonages now would in the same way have undivided shares in the woodlands planted on those commonages.  That is the picture abroad and, therefore, as I say, it is unrealistic to try to relate our local conditions here with conditions in those countries.  Not for many generations to come, not until we have all our marginal land, mountains and commonages planted as they are planted in most of the countries to which I have referred, will there be by planting and natural regeneration in those areas, a continuous crop of forests coming in from generation to generation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> Someone complained that only £25,000 is being provided for private afforestation in this Estimate.  That is true, but we should be very glad to spend double or treble that amount if we could get the people to take advantage of the schemes which are there. As I have said, while the results show that private planting has doubled, the results from the national point of view are disappointing, particularly in view of the fact that very many more people are availing of the advisory service.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, there is an advisory service in the Department at the beck and call of anyone who wants advice on private planting but, notwithstanding the reports they got from experts in the Department that their marginal lands were suitable for planting, the vast majority did not proceed to plant.  So, while I subscribe to what has been said on all sides of the House as to the reasons why it is good business, both for themselves and their children, for private individuals to plant I still feel that, due to our system of land tenure here, and due to the lack of a forestry tradition amongst the people, we will have a considerable time to wait before we get private planting up to the level which we all desire.</P>
    <P>On the question of economics, the question of investment and return, which was raised by some Deputies, I should like to point out to the House that there is no question whatsoever about the soundness of the economics of forestry in this country.  I was very glad to see, for instance, that Norway spruce, growing in its native habitat, at the age of 85 to 100 years had only about the same volume of hoppus feet as our pine or spruce at the age of 45 years.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that due to our sun and rain, our mild climate and long period of growth, we do and will produce at double the rate of growth of the Scandinavian countries.  As far as I can study the figures, we produce a rate of growth here approximating treble the rate of growth in Canada. Therefore we are in the position now to produce after 40 to 45 years' growth as big a volume of timber as <Col N="811" /> can be produced in what is regarded as the home of timber, the Scandinavian countries, after 85 years.  The big demand for timber now is in relation to pulp for both chemical and other purposes.  Undoubtedly that demand will grow from year to year and indeed every single year new uses appear to be found for different derivatives from pulp or from timber, plastics and other similar materials. The market will be expanding and ultimately, as far as we can judge, the market will be unlimited.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde asked if we were aware of the amount of timber imported into western European countries. If we had sufficient pulp produced here today, there is a market for it even in the Scandinavian countries. Even Norway and Sweden import and export pulp for different industrial uses.  Therefore, on the economics of this whole matter, the State investment, high as it is, and it certainly is high, is a sound economic investment.  Outside the different considerations of our balance of payments problems, of providing employment here through the side industries and the employment now provided, the State investment will well repay the taxpayer when the forests start to come to maturity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and that will be increasing from year to year.  We estimate that in about 10 years, the income should be sufficient to carry on this business without demand on the taxpayer.  I was rather surprised to find another misconception on the part of some Deputies, including Deputy Costello, that there were no pulp mills here, the fact being that <Col N="812" /> there are a number and the fact also being that newsprint is produced in a factory just outside this city, at Clondalkin. The question of the production of newsprint is one of the economics of the job for those concerned in the business but they are producing an amount of it there amongst their other diversified interests.  It is, of course, produced from pulp.  In the same way, the wallboard factory at Athy has increased its pulp production by something like 100 per cent.  Over the past couple of years.  There are also the chipboard factory producing pulp at Scariff and the chipboard or pulp factory going ahead in Waterford. The raw material of all these factories is pulp.</P>
      <P>Private enterprise is keeping abreast with the development of forestry here and we have virtually completed an assessment of all our State forests and we shall be in a position to inform those concerned in the industry as to what the approximate output will be in four years, six years and ten years so that the industry will be geared to deal with the output immediately it becomes available.  We have also been studying techniques abroad and keeping in close touch with the developments in the industrial arm of the business. I am quite confident that private industry here can develop and expand to absorb the additional output as it becomes available.  Our policy will be to ensure that they will have plenty of notice as to what will become available and when it will become available.  On that side of the business, I have no personal qualms at all that the people in the business, or those who will come into it in the future when the raw material is there, will be well able to handle what the national State forests can produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde complained of the size of the lots being offered for sale by the Forestry Division.  My information is that the Forestry Division arrange their sales in lots of different sizes to give the small man a chance of securing his particular needs.  Nearly three years ago, I directed my Department to endeavour to cater for the small merchant's problems and, apart from what has been said by Deputy Esmonde, I personally have received <Col N="813" /> no complaint, certainly over the past 18 months or so.  If there is any particular instance of which the Deputy is aware, then if he conveys it to me, I will have it investigated. But this is a matter which, if it were widespread, I would certainly have heard about and would have got complaints from those concerned.</P>

      <P>That is why the Deputy's statement came as a surprise to me, because in recent times, I have not heard any complaints on that issue. I welcome the statements made by the different Deputies who said they were worried about forest fires.  Some suggested that this was a matter of educating the people and one Deputy suggested that they were caused, in the main, by tourists.  That has not been my experience.  The most serious fires in forests and in the vicinity of forests were caused mainly by adjoining farmers burning gorse and heather, without due notice being given, as prescribed by law, to the Department. While the damage done was completely unintentional, the fact remains that they disobeyed the law and we had this rather large loss of approximately 600 acres last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a hazard that will be increasing as State forests spread at the present rate of planting.  Outside of the damage done to the national potential by forest fires, there is the very bad effect on the countryside where a young forest is destroyed. Where farmers wish to burn gorse or heather and they comply with the law and give notice, they will have the full co-operation of the local forestry service. The difficulty arises when they go ahead on their own and fires which are started get out of control and then tremendous damage is done.  After our experience last year, I want to make it clear again that, in addition to being liable to prosecution, the man who starts a fire is liable for the additional consequences of any damage he does and the individual who lets that fire spread on to forestry property is liable for damages on the civil side of the <Col N="814" /> court, so that, in addition to any fines to which he may be liable, he may be faced with a very substantial bill for the damage done to forestry property.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that I have got appeals in individual cases to let people off who have been guilty of this type of negligence and I want to make it clear that we cannot accede to any such appeals in future.  Everybody should know now the national danger of lighting fires in the vicinity of forests and people are surely aware of the consequences of their action if they do not comply with the law.  For the future, I am giving notice that the law both on the civil side, outside of any question of prosecution, will be fully enforced and that no appeals to relieve these people of the consequence of their actions will be entertained by the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking from recollection, there are a number of laws to deal with itinerants, if they are enforced, one of which is that it is an offence to light a fire within 60 yards of a road.  I do not recollect offhand that itinerants were responsible for any damage, certainly in the last year to which I have referred; but there are particular laws in the Statute Book to deal with these people, particularly in regard to lighting fires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello appealed for the growing of more hardwoods and said that hardwoods have been neglected in the national planting scheme.  I must say I share his sentiments as far as the desirability of having more hardwoods or broad leaves grown, but the fact remains that generally speaking, hardwoods cannot be produced on the type of land that as a general rule comes into the hands of my Department.  You need fairly good land to produce hardwoods, if I except birch, which in some countries is regarded as a weed, although on that point I do not agree with some of my advisers about the same tree.  At all events, we plant roughly about 5,000 acres of hardwoods inter-mixed with the other trees in our forests.  Those <Col N="815" /> who want to see more hardwoods planted should direct their attention towards easing public pressure to try to skim the good land from the Forestry Division when it is taking over land.  I mentioned before that it is no business of the Forestry Division to deal with land congestion problems.  That is a question for the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>As I said, the prices paid indicate that, in the main, the land is very poor or of marginal quality and where you have the odd acre or two acres coming in, it is only on these couple of acres that we can plant the variety of species, particularly hardwoods, that will give a successful result and a worthwhile return.  I would therefore suggest to those Deputies who feel, like Deputy Costello, that more hardwoods should be planted to use their good offices to stop this move in local areas by which immediately the Forestry Commission purchases land, there is a demand by some local farmer who has his eye on an acre or a half acre and wants to get it out of the portion taken over.  As I said, we have been planting some 5,000 acres and now that we have built up very substantial areas of conifers, we may in the future, provided we can get sufficient suitable land, give more attention to the growing of more hardwoods, if only from the scenic point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much substance there is in the suggestion that where hardwoods are cut down, they are not being replaced.  If there is any substance in that suggestion, I hope it is not widespread and that private owners who cut down hardwoods are replacing them with hardwoods.  It is invariably on such lands that hardwoods are successful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dolan suggested that forestry would go well with the farming of small mountainy sheep and that the sheep farmer should be preserved. There is no reason why that should not be so.  In many countries, particularly Scotland, forestry has been proved to be the friend of the mountain sheep farmer rather than his enemy.  It was clearly proved in the report of <Col N="816" /> the Crofters Commission in Scotland that strip planting on the mountains by providing shelter enormously improved the grazing and productivity of the mountain crofter.  I find the commonages coming into my Department are invariably little used and completely underproductive from the sheep farming point of view.  In many of these areas we find, perhaps, that nine or ten people have an interest in the commonage, while only one or two make any use of it whatever, and nobody is doing anything to increase the fertility or improve the commonage in any way.  There is no doubt that commonages of that kind would be far better employed producing timber than by leaving them in their present neglected and underdeveloped state. There are many areas, particularly west of the Shannon, which could provide a huge forestry potential in this field. I hope, during the coming year, with the co-operation of public opinion generally, that much more of this type of land will come into the acquisition machine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully raised the question of continuity of employment for forestry workers.  The policy of the Department is this.  Where work stops in one area, and if there is further work in an adjoining area, their preference is to re-employ these skilled men, if they are prepared to travel to the new area. Deputies will realise however that you cannot have a hard and fast rule. because there is another side to the story.  There is the view of the people in the adjoining parish that the men employed on the other forestry work did very well by being employed for a considerable time and that now it is the turn of the men in their parish.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Tully well knows, dealing with labour relations, you have got to see what the local position is.  It is not always simple.  In many areas, there is resentment if men are brought in from different areas at the expense of employment for the local men.  In a way, that is natural.  It is the policy of the Department to retain its old workers, who have undoubtedly achieved a certain amount of skill in the Department's service.  The situation will improve as time goes on.  The labour force fully engaged in forestry <Col N="817" /> will be on the increase from year to year as the new planting programme spreads throughout the land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also raised the question of the forestry wages tribunal. This matter is not yet finalised.  The tribunal proposal emanated from the discussions which took place in 1958 between my Department and the various trade unions representing forestry labourers in connection with the changes necessary in the system of basic wage settlements for forestry labourers as a prerequisite to the introduction of the incentive bonus.  It was felt at the time that, since forestry wages were in future to be the subject of direct negotiation between the Department and the unions, rather than automatically to follow the pattern of wage reform in some other category of employment, there would be bound to be difficulty at times in reaching agreement on a particular wage issue, which would call for the existence of some independent, or at least some kind of joint tribunal which would give balanced recommendations on whatever dispute or issue was at stake.</P>
    <P>In actual practice, there have been since 1958, as the Deputy knows, three successive wage rounds settled satisfactorily by negotiation between my Department and the unions concerned. That is at least indicative of the fact that no side suffered as a result of this tribunal not being in operation so far. The matter is not being lost sight of, however, and there is no question of shelving the proposal indefinitely.  It would be premature to pursue this, pending the outcome of the general review of the machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, which the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced some months ago.  The whole question of industrial disputes is being considered.  Until conclusions are reached in the wider field, it would be well to make haste slowly as far as the establishment of this tribunal is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy of Cork asked us to grow more ash for the GAA men concerned with hurling.  I shudder to think what might happen if the Deputy's suggestion about plastic glass <Col N="818" /> hurleys were adopted.  The Bould Thady Quill would turn in his grave, not to mention what might happen about the Cork Exhibition.  We are planting an amount of ash, mainly to meet the demand by the GAA people.  At our present rate of planting of ash, we should be able to meet a demand of 250,000 hurleys a year, and that, I think, should be sufficient to reassure hurling counties with anxieties in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed it would. Deputy Geoghegan raised the question of the workers at Dundrum and at the mills in Cong.  My information is that my officials are meeting the union some time next week for certain negotiations about the workers in Dundrum and, in the circumstances, I do not think I should say anything about the matter.  Of course it follows that whatever settlement may be made about the dispute in Dundrum will automatically be applied to similar workers in the sawmills at Cong.  I think I should leave the matter to those concerned in these negotiations and not go into the details of the issues in dispute.</P>
      <P>I now come to the rather extraordinary mis-statements of fact and allegations of fiction made by a few Deputies in this debate.  Deputy O'Donnell, who comes here with the same song as a number of Fine Gael Deputies, and who said that forestry in this country for all practical purposes was started only in 1948, will get a rude awakening when I give him some figures I propose to give in this connection.  The Deputy further alleged that there was an area of 157 acres in County Donegal which had been bought by my Department for £1 16s. an acre&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon&mdash;we were offered £1 16s. an acre for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Offered £1 16s.  It was, in fact, purchased from the <Col N="819" /> Deputy's client and if you take the 157 acres, which was the area in relation to the proffered sum, it might work out at that figure, but the Deputy was careful to refrain from telling the House that out of the 157 acres, 100 acres consisted of high, rocky slopes, cliffs, water and exposed mountain-top head which had to be valued at nothing and which was completely unplantable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

Trying to put over on the House that 157 acres were bought at this rate, without giving the actual facts is, I think, misleading and unworthy of the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned another case that he had in his own area of land offered to the Department which was subsequently sold for a much higher figure.  He suggested that local valuers should be called in.  If the Deputy thinks that anybody is going to accept that the Deputy or his client in Donegal would for a moment hold over an area of land to give it to my Department because of my bright head or curly bob, he is codding nobody but himself.  The idea of suggesting that the Deputy's client would not take the highest price he could possibly get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sure this piece of snipe grass in Donegal was a long time on his hands and that he is praying today to the Almighty for the benefit of having a Forestry Division to take such stuff off him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy said it was sad that more progress had not been made in forestry and went back to 1948 when it is alleged that the forestry drive started.  Let us look at the figures.  In 1948-49, the first year of the Coalition Government of which the Deputy was a member, a miserable 3,782 acres were acquired and 7,700 acres planted.  This is the year that is pointed at as a headline to me in 1962 when we have planted an all-time record figure of 25,200 acres and acquired an all-time record figure of 31,794 acres.  Let these figures speak for themselves and perhaps the Deputy will learn a lesson.</P>
      <P>Taking the first three years of the Coalition Government, from 1948 to 1951, the gross expenditure on forestry for those three years was £1,887,749; the total area acquired was 34,505 acres; and the total area planted, 24,501 acres.  We spent in the Forestry Division this year approximately £3.5 million, a figure three times more than the Deputy's Government in the three years from 1948 to 1951.  In this year, we have acquired practically as much land&mdash;31,749 acres against 34,000 acres &mdash;as the Deputy's Government acquired in the three years.  This year, we have planted 25,200 acres, a greater amount of land planted in one year than the Deputy's Government planted in three years.</P>

      <P>I hope the Deputy puts that in his pipe and smokes it and let us see what the result will be.  I must admire what I call the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; of both Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Flanagan who came into the House last night complaining about the awfully slow rate of forestry development and how little is being done by this Government in connection with forestry in the teeth of these figures. Obviously, the people who send them here are very gullible if that doctrine is preached down in Donegal and Offaly and the people swallow it in face of our record.  It is a very poor indication of the level of the intelligence of the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been such an outstanding <Col N="821" /> advance in the development of forestry in the past five years that the present position bears no relation to the position which existed before.  That advance is continuing.  Complaints have been made here that the Department are paying nothing for land, but in this very year we have achieved the greatest figure of acquisition in my Department ever achieved in the history of the State.  I hope that situation will continue.  I believe it will.  I am confident that we will be able to maintain the record figure of 25,000 acres of planting each year, the target which we have set ourselves and the target which has been achieved over the last three years by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;taking the picture of the whole country as it is.  I concede that we have a long way to go to catch up, particularly with the Scandinavian countries but, if we are able to maintain the programme at the rate at which we are going, it will not be very long until we change the face of the Irish countryside.  Indeed, we are changing it already with the afforestation programme.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I should deal with.  Again, there is a complaint by Deputy O'Donnell that so much land was refused on inspection by my Department as being unsuitable. Does anybody think that my officials turn down land as being unsuitable unless it is so?  Does Deputy O'Donnell set himself up as an expert in this field also?  Does he think that he is a better judge of what land will grow timber or what land will not than the experts of my Department who examine the lands concerned?  It is absurd to suggest that lands are refused by my Department because of any whim on the ground that they are unplantable.  Indeed, we have to take the good with the bad.  In view of our new knowledge through our experiments at Glenamoy of how to overcome native problems and problems of exposure, if there is any hope of the land being planted we take it.  It is only when there is no hope of the land being planted either for reasons of exposure or extremely poor soil condition, very rocky surfaces and so on&mdash;it is only for those reasons, when there is no hope, that land is turned down because it is unplantable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope that as a result of the experiments being carried out at Glenamoy and elsewhere we will soon be in a position to have better information about exposure problems. They are problems that, unfortunately, are practically confined to this country. There are very few other countries that have similar wind problems or exposure problems to those we have here.  The nearest I can get to it are the Steppes in parts of Russia where they have carried out planting.  I <Col N="823" /> understand, across long areas by way of windbreaks, but the difficulty about our exposure problem here is that we have not constant winds.  The winds blow at times from every way and that is a particular local problem we have here that is not experienced certainly in the Scandinavian countries and in many other countries.  Therefore, we must rely on the information we get by our own experiments which we have started and which are beginning to show results.</P>
    <P>We have not much difficulty about deciding that certain species will root well.  The difficulty is as to whether they will stand up to the changing and varied wind problems that we have in the exposed areas of our country.</P>
    <P>Let me try, before I conclude, to kill another myth that seems to exist in the minds of some of the experts across the floor of the House here, namely, that because you dig up old pine, or what we call bog deal, under a bog there was a forest there before. Of course there was a forest there before in the time of the Barmecides but the climate in those days was different.  There was no bog there when that forest was growing.  The bog came after the forest and went over it.  That is why these old roots are dug up there, which these experts over there suggest are a positive proof that all kinds of timber can be grown in these exposed areas where there is a completely different soil formation now and, indeed, a completely different climate.  At the time that these trees were growing, I suppose the original Piltdown men were crawling around on their hands and knees through the forests of this country.</P>
    <P>Again, to use a forestry expression, I am not quite sure as to which is the dominant species on the Fine Gael bench in connection with forestry and which is the scrub, because Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde seems to be the official spokesman of the Fine Gael Party on forestry in this country and I find it difficult to know between himself and Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Flanagan as to what is the real approach of Fine Gael or the real policy of Fine Gael in connection with forestry.</P>

      <P>Performance fell very short of the announcements.  You talked until you talked yourselves out of office as a result of doing nothing. Here, on the Estimate, on 22nd February, 1962, the official spokesman of Fine Gael, Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde, had this to say, at column 560 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>At the same time, I do not think it is satisfactory that we should have a policy for the acquisition of 25,000 acres of land every year.  That land is coming into the ownership of the State.  It means that the Department is making a big encroachment on the land that is available to the individual.  It may be very difficult to get private individuals to take up and afforest land.  There may be good reasons for that but I have frequently suggested to the Minister for Lands that the Forestry Department should take over land, plant that land and subsequently lay it off when they have developed and planted it.  It could be laid off to private individuals or to local authorities and the Department could act in an advisory capacity, have a controlling interest over it and see that it is properly attended to.  The State should not acquire such large quantities of land and hold it. </P>
      <P>I want to know: is that Fine Gael policy on forestry?  Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde is their official spokesman on policy, both on the former Estimate and on this Estimate and under the wing of his leader, Deputy Dillon.

      <P>I am confident, however, that the vast majority of the people share in my view about the development of the marginal land by way of forestry and that we have built up a vast store of goodwill amongst the general public to go ahead with full blast with the programme that has now been undertaken, which is now being successfully carried out, which target of 25,000 acres will be continued and for which sufficient money will be provided by this Government for as long as we are in office.  If we continue with that, I will not have any hesitation in coming back and asking for such a colossal sum as we are now nationally investing year by year in the future of Ireland by the intensified planting programme in which I am engaged.</P>

      <P>Go ndeonfar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná deich bpúnt chun íoctha an mhuirir i thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an t-aonú lá tríochad de Mhárta, míle naoi gcéad seasca a trí le haghaidh Tuarastal agus costas Roinn na Gaeltachta maille le deontais le haghaidh Tithe agus Ildeontais-i-gCabhair. </P>
      <P>Sé faoi ndear dom an Vóta Forlíontach seo a lorg ná chun seans a thabhairt don Teach an bun-Mheastachán don bhliain seo a phlé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taispeánann an caiteachas measta sa bhun-Mheastachán sin Méadú de £7,250 glan ar an soláthar a rinneadh don bhliain seo caite.  Tá méadú sa <Col N="826" /> soláthar le haghaidh tuarastal, tithe gaeltachta, seirbhísí cultúrtha, seirbhísí tarchuir, drámaíochta agus scoláireachtaí saoire agus scoile ach tá ísliú sa soláthar le haghaidh scéimeanna feabhsúcháin agus coláistí Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá an caiteachas faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) ag dul i méid ó bhliain go bliain agus caitheadh £160,035 anuraidh i gcomparáid le caiteachas de £136,000 sa bhliain roimhe sin.  Beidh an caiteachas níos mó fós i mbliana agus tá suim £185,000 á mholadh chuige.  Maidir leis sin is féidir liom a rá anois go raibh méadú de 19 per cent. ins na deontais a híocadh sa chéad leath den bhliain seo thar mar a híocadh sa chéad leath den bhliain seo caite.  Tá an méadú le feiscint i ngach gné d'obair na dtithe sa chéad leath den bhliain seo; bhí an méid tithe a tógadh nó a feabhsaíodh, an méid tithe ar cuireadh soláthar uisce nó saoráidí séarachais iontu, an méid tithe ar cuireadh seomraí folcaidh nó leathnú speisialta leo sa leath-bhliain níos mó i ngach cás ná an leath den iomlán den obair sin a rinneadh sa bhliain ar fad anuraidh.</P>
    <P>As Fo-mhírcheann D a cuirtear airgead ar fáil le haghaidh scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.  Bunaítear na meastacháin sna cúrsaí seo ar na meastacháin éagsúla a gheibhtear ó na heagrais éagsúla, go háirithe na húdarais áitiúla agus na Ranna eile Stáit, ar a mbíonn cúram feidhmithe na scéimeanna seo.  D'ainneoin dícheall na n-eagras sin, is annamh a cuirtear na scéimeanna seo uilig i gcrích laistigh den am a bhíonn measta dóibh toisc go mbíonn rudaí i gceist i bhfeidhmiú na scéimeanna seo nach bhfuil smacht iomlán ag lucht a riartha orthu, mar shampla &mdash; an aimsir, ganntanas foirne teicniúla, deacrachtaí teidil, cearta slí, etc., a chuireann moill ar an obair.  Beidh rudaí do-sheachanta den tsort seo ann i gcónaí agus dá bhrí sin d'fhonn an meastachán a bheith chomh gairid agus is féidir don chaiteachas is dócha a tharlós, socraíodh ar shuim £18,000 a bhaint den fho-mhírcheann. Fágann sé sin gur suim £118,000 glan a bheas ar fáil i gcóir na bliana d'ainneoin gur £136,000 an costas <Col N="827" /> measta do na scéimeanna uilig.  Ní fhágann sé sin, ámh, go bhfuil baol ar bith ann go gcaithfear aon cheann de na scéimeanna a fhágáil gan críochnú cheal airgid.  Airgead ar bith a fágfar gan caitheamh i rith na bliana faoi ghné amháin den fho-mhírcheann féadfar é a aistriú chun a chaite faoi ghné eile, más gá sin.</P>
    <P>Tá na scéimeanna feabhsúcháin sonraithe i gCuid III den Mheastachán. Ba maith liom cur síos gairid a dhéanamh orthu anois san ord ina bhfuil tagairt dóibh ansin.</P>
    <P>Suim £40,000 atá á chaitheamh i mbliana ar scéim na mbóthar.  Is é cuspóir na Roinne oiread agus is féidir den airgead sin a chaitheamh ar na bóithre áise, is é sin, ar na bóithre nach nglacann na húdaráis áitiúla chontae aon fhreagracht ina leith.</P>
    <P>Suim £15,000 atá á chaitheamh i mbliana ar scéimeanna uisce-sholáthair agus séarachais, sé sin, laghdú £5,000 ar sholáthar na bliana seo caite.  Deontais 25 per cent. den chostas atá á n-íoc ag an Roinn i leith furmhór na scéimeanna seo.  Ar an ábhar sin, chaithfeadh na húdaráis áitiúla obair a b'fhiú £60,000 san iomlán a chur i gcrích i rith na bliana sna cúrsaí seo sara mbeidís i dteideal deontas £15,000 san iomlán ón Roinn.</P>
    <P>Tá an soláthar céanna ann i mbliana le haghaidh na muiroibreachta agus a bhí ann anuraidh, sé sin £14,000. Sí Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí a dhéanann na hoibreacha seo de ghnáth thar ceann mo Roinne.</P>
    <P>Faoi scéim na dtithe gloine cuireadh chun 20 teach gloine nua, faoi theas, a thógáil i gConamara agus 12 i dTuar Mhic Éadaigh. Rinneadh damáiste mór stoirme do na tithe nua sin i mí Mheán Fómhair na bliana seo caite.  Is mór an trua an mhoill mhór a chuir na timpist sin ar an obair agus is oth liom nach dtig liom a rá go fóill cén uair a críochnófar an scéim.  Tá trealamh téacháin á chur isteach i dtimpeall 25 de na sean-tithe gloine i gContae Dhún na nGall.  Tá trealamh den tsort sin cheana féin i 34 de na tithe.  Tiocfaidh de sin go mbeidh teas i dtimpeall 60 per cent.  de na tithe gloine uile sa <Col N="828" /> chontae.  Cuireadh teas i 19 de na sean-tithe i gConamara cúpla bliain ó shoin agus nuair a bheas na scéimeanna éagsúla a luaigh mé curtha i gcrích go hiomlán beidh teas ar fáil i dtimpeall 50 per cent. den 223 tithe gloine a thagann faoi réim na Scéime.</P>
    <P>Suim £1,500 atá á chaitheamh i mbliana ar na deontais i leith cránacha agus síolta a dáiltear faoi Scéim na Muc.  Meastar go mbeidh timpeall 70 cránacha ag teastáil i mbliana.  Ó thús na scéime dáileadh 390 cránacha san iomlán agus, de réir gach tuairisce, d'éirigh go maith lena bhfurmhór mór.  Eorna amháin, agus pé leasúcháin a bheidh ag teastáil di, an síol a dáilfear faoin scéim seo feasta.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Fo-mhírcheann D, tá dhá scéim nua talamhaíochta á dtabhairt isteach i mbliana ar fiú tagairt speisialta a dhéanamh dóibh.  Faoi scéim chun talamh féaraigh a fheabhsú&mdash;tá deontais 50 per cent.  den chostas i leith leasú saorga á dtabhairt, i gcomhréir le toradh tástáil ithreach, le haghaidh timpeall 900 plásán (ó acra amhráin go dtí trí acra an ceann).  Is é sin an méid is mó is féidir a láimhseáil leis an bhfoirinn is féidir don Roinn Talmhaíochta a chur i mbun na hoibre.  Tá socair againn scéim a bheas bunaithe ar thionscadal na talún, fé mar atá sé á oibriú faoi Scéim Chonamara i láthair na huaire, a leathnú go dtí an Ghaeltacht uile. Iocfaidh Roinn na Gaeltachta an costas breise a thiocfaidh de dhroim an leathnuithe seo.</P>
    <P>Chífear go bhfuil £20,000 curtha síos le haghaidh meánscolaíochta i mbliana, sé sin, méadú de £2,500 ar an soláthar a bhí ann anuraidh.  Ó thús na Scéime seo sa bhliain 1958 bunaíodh ceithre meánscoileanna nua le cúnamh na Roinne sna limistéirí Gaeltachta agus méadaíodh ceithre cinn eile.  Tugadh deontais ab fhiú £32,000 ina leith sin.  Tá éileamh mór ag muintir na Gaeltachta ar mheánscolaíocht agus táthar tar éis na deontais faoin scéim a mhéadú i mbliana chun freastal ar an éileamh sin.</P>
    <P>Mar chúnamh breise do dhaltaí meánscoile sna limistéirí Gaeltachta ceapadh scéim faoina dtugtar deontais suas go dtí £500 sa bhliain chun <Col N="829" /> cabhrú le húdaráis meánscoileanna sna limistéirí chun seirbhís iompair a chur ar fáil do na daltaí lae.  Fuair naoi gcinn de mheánscoileanna cúnamh faoin scéim anuraidh agus tá an t-éileamh ar an scéim ag dul i méid i gconaí.</P>
    <P>Tá an soláthar de dheich míle punt le haghaidh hallaí siamsa i mbliana £2,500 níos mó ná an soláthar a bhí ann don bhliain seo caite.  Is mór an tairbhe do cheantar Gaeltachta halla siamsa maith agus tá súil agam go mbainfear tuilleadh feidhme as scéim seo na Roinne sna blianta atá ag teacht.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-mhírcheann E den Mheastachán, tá soláthar chun deontais bheaga a thabhairt le haghaidh imeachtaí cultúrtha agus sóisialacha, mar shampla, deontais le haghaidh feiseanna agus féilí drámaíochta agus cúnamh airgid chun oirnéisí ceoil agus a leithéidí a chur ar fáil do choistí áitiúla sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá méadú de £500 á mholadh le haghaidh na seirbhísí sin i mbliana chun cabhrú le scéim nua chun scoláireachtaí Gaeltachta a bhronnadh mar dhuaiseanna ag feiseanna.</P>
    <P>Tá £48,000 á sholáthar faoi Fho-mhírcheann G le haghaidh an deontais cúig phunt.  Níl aon athrú anseo ón soláthar a bhí ann anuraidh.  Tá ísliú de dhá mhíle punt, ámh, sa soláthar i mbliana le haghaidh coláistí Gaeilge. Meastar gur leor an méid sin chun an obair atá beartaithe a chur i gcrích, isé sin, coláiste Gaeilge amháin a thógáil agus leathnú a dhéanamh ar cheann eile.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-mhírcheann I, tá soláthar de £100,000 curtha síos mar dheontasi-gcabhair do Ghaeltarra Éireann&mdash; suim is ionann agus an soláthar a bhí ann anuraidh.  D'éiligh an Bord an méid sin in iomlán agus chomh maith leis sin cuireadh suim de £70,000 ar fáil dóibh i bhfoirm airleacain inaisíoctha le haghaidh caiteachais chaipitil.</P>
    <P>I mí Lúnasa seo caite, cuireadh faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas tuarascáil agus cuntais an Bhoird le haghaidh na bliana go deireadh Márta seo caite agus feictear uathu siúd gur tháinig feabhas ar chúrsaí gnótha an Bhoird i rith na bliana i gcomórtas leis an mbliain roimhe sin.  Bhí <Col N="830" /> méadú ar na díolacháin i gcoitinne agus shrois luach iomlán na ndíolachán suim £544,762.  Tháinig méadú sásúil ar na díolacháin thar lear &mdash; go háirithe ar dhíolacháin bhréidín sna Stáit Aontaithe agus sa Bhreatain Mhór.  Do hísíodh an chailliúint trádála de réir £32,000</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann M den Mheastachán, tugtar cúnamh do choistí áitiúla chun scoláireachtaí saoire sa Ghaeltacht a thabhairt do pháistí ó áiteanna lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Táthar sásta go bhfuil an Scéim seo ar cheann de na háiseanna is fearr chun labhairt na Gaeilge a leathnú.  Tá méid an deontais a híoctar i leith gach páiste méadaithe de réir deich scilling an duine agus cuireadh os cionn 4,500 páistí chun na Gaeltachta i mbliana faoin scéim.  Tá soláthar de £25,000 á dhéanamh don scéim sa Mheastachán seo i gcomórtas le £13,500 anuraidh. Áirítear sa bhFo-mhírcheann seo freisin soláthar le haghaidh scéime faoina gcuireann Gael-Linn páistí chuig scoileanna Gaeltachta &mdash; gach páiste ar feadh téarma scoile amháin. Íocann mo Roinn deontas nach mó ná £19 le haghaidh gach páiste&mdash;isé sin tuairim leath an chostais mheasta &mdash;agus meastar go mbeidh timpeall £17,000 ag teastáil le haghaidh na Scéime seo i mbliana.  Admhaítear go fóirleathan gur scéim an-tairbheach í seo agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh níos fearr fós léi sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Le críoch a chur leis an ráiteas seo ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuaireamar comhoibriú fial óna Ranna Stáit eile agus óna húdaráis áitiúla ariamh i bhfeidhmiú na scéimeanna éagsúla a bhfuilimíd ag brath an oiread sin orthu lena gcur i gcrích agus gabhaim buíochas leo go léir as ucht a gcabhrach. Is maith liom fós é bheith le rá agam go bhfuil comhoibriú le fáil ó eagrais agus ó chumainn deontacha i ngach slí ina bhféadfaidís é sin a dhéanamh agus tá mo bhuíochas féin agus buíochas mo Roinne tuillte acu uile.</P>

      <P>Beagnach seacht mbliain ó shoin, cuireadh an Roinn seo ar bun agus cuireadh Aire ós cionn na Roinne.  Cad chuige go <Col N="831" /> ndearnadh é sin?

An bhfuilimid sásta fosta go bhfuil oiread oibre sa Ghaeltacht anois agus ba chóir?  An bhfuilimid sásta anois go bhfuil ár dteanga ag leathnú amach ón nGaeltacht fríd an Bhreac-Ghaeltacht agus fríd an tír uilig?  An bhfuilimid sásta ar na pointeanna sin?</P>

Níor innis an t-Aire é sin dúinn.  Níor innis sé dhúinn go bhfuil níos mó oibre le fáil i dTír Chonaill, i Muigheo, i nGaillimh nó i gCiarraí.  Cad chuige? Níor innis sé dhúinn go bhfuil níos mó daoine ag labhairt ár dteanga anois ná mar a bhí nuair a cuireadh an Roinn ar bun.  Cad chuige?</P>
      <P>Dúirt sé linn go bhfuil níos mó páistí ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil sé sásta gurab é sin an scéim is fearr chun an Ghaeilge a thúirt do na daoine óga.  Is minic adúirt mé sa Teach so&mdash;agus táim lántsásta anois gur aontaigh an t-Aire liom&mdash;go gcaithfimid níos mó ná sin a dhéanamh más mian linn ár dteanga a choinneáil beo ar fuaid na tíre uilig.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin é mo bharúlsa fosta.  In or about the year 1954 or 1955, the inter-Party Government were satisfied that no progress was being made towards improving the Irish language or improving the life of the Irish speakers.  For that purpose, they set up this Department of the Gaeltacht and appointed a Minister in charge of it in the hope that something more and better could be done to revive the language and give a livelihood in this country to those who speak it and from whom others may learn it.  We have to ask ourselves today, after seven years' experience, if that Ministry has been a success.</P>
      <P>This morning, on another debate, Deputy Dillon and several Fianna Fáil speakers, too, agreed that, as a result of the approach of the Common Market, Scandinavian countries are now concentrating on European languages in addition to their native tongue.  Deputy Dillon gave his experience of his sojourns on the Continent. He said that any Scandinavian he met under 30 years of age could speak two languages in addition to his own.  Under 30 years of age, these people have acquired two languages in addition to their own and they are able to speak them fluently.  Deputy Dillon went so far as to say that when they were asked when they were in England or Ireland it transpired that they were never out of their native countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, after 30 years of compulsion, what do we find?  How many of us <Col N="833" /> can speak Irish?  How many of us can converse in the vernacular?  Very few.  Therefore, the policy which we said was wrong has proved that we were right.  Having set up this Ministry, have we improved the position? I am glad Deputy Faulkner is here. For many years I have advocated in this House the sending of children to the cradle of the language&mdash;the Gaeltacht&mdash;to learn Irish in vernacular.  I am glad to note that the Minister now states:</P>
    <P>Subhead M of the Estimate provides for assistance to local committees for the purpose of giving holiday scholarships in the Gaeltacht to children from outside the Gaeltacht. I am convinced that this scheme is one of the best mediums for extending the use of the Irish language. </P>
    <P>That is the very first time in the history of Estimates that we have got that admission from a Minister. Deputy Faulkner knows what I am talking about.  He knows I have been advocating that down through the years here.  What a tragedy that we are only now waking up.</P>
    <P>Might I sound a warning note in relation to that subhead?  We are sending too many children to the Gaeltacht for too short a period.  That is our trouble.  I advocated here several times that in addition to sending children to the Gaeltacht for the months of July and August we should spread out the scheme and send them for the twelve months of the year&mdash; but we should send fewer of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nach bhfuil sin dhá dhéanamh i láthair na huaire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an Teachta ag smaoineamh ar Chonamara.  Níl sé dhá dhéanamh.  I shall refer to areas which are real cradles of the language. I shall refer to Rannafast.  It is possibly one of the areas where Irish is spoken 100 per cent.  by the inhabitants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, about 500 children per month in the months of July and August are being sent into Rannafast to learn Irish.  They could not go to a better place.  The average number of pupils in the national school in <Col N="834" /> Rannafast is 40.  These young children going in there at the moment, during this short period, have absolutely no connection whatsoever with the locals. They are not getting the language, other than through the very excellent teachers.  They are not making the contact with fear a' tighe and bean a' tighe, as they are better known.</P>
    <P>If there are from 14 to 16 boarders then, between meals, the bean a' tighe is anxious to get them out of the house to enable her to clean up and prepare for the next meal.  She has no time to converse with these children in the language they desire.  I am not trying to run down the excellent work done not only by the trained national teachers and secondary teachers who go there but also by the locals, the seanachaí, who are employed for storytelling and other subjects.  I am not trying to belittle that in any way because I know that their work is excellent.</P>
    <P>If we send fewer students for many more months, we shall give them greater contact with the locals and give them an opportunity of conversing with Fíor-Ghaeltacht Irish speakers.  I do not think there are any great difficulties involved in that.  If we continue this scheme as it is now being operated, we might as well take over Gormanston College in County Meath and run it as a Gaeltacht college for two months of the year because we would have just as much contact in Gormanston with the Gaeltacht as we shall have in the native Gaeltacht areas after a very short time if we continue to send too many children in too short a period to these particular localities.</P>
    <P>I know there are Deputies who agree with me.  I have discussed the matter with them in private.  They agree with me that the children coming into the Gaeltacht have no opportunity of knocking around with Irish-speaking children of their own age group there. In some places, they go so far as to prohibit students from knocking around too much with locals.  That is bad.  In the early days of Rannafast College, when we had about 50 to 100 students coming there each year, schooling lasted about an hour.  For the remainder of the time, you were <Col N="835" /> expected to go around ag áirneail in the various houses and ag seanachaídhe with the various Irish speakers.  That was a much better system of learning Irish than the present system of cramming students there for this very short period of two months.  That is one of the methods whereby we could improve and extend the teaching of the language.</P>
    <P>The next thing we must consider is what we are doing to retain the Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht areas.  Are we providing more employment for people?  That is something the Minister should consider.  Take my own county. We have at least four Gaeltachta in it.  We have a small Gaeltacht, if you like, in Fanad.  We have a Gaeltacht at Cloughaneely, another at Gweedore, another at the Rosses and another at Glencolumbkille.  Not one solitary industry has been set up in any one of these Fíor-Ghaeltachta in recent years.  It is true that at least three to four major industries have been set up in the county.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a very difficult job.  He is more a co-ordinating individual than a spending Minister.  I know that the amount of money made available to him is limited but he should compel other Ministers, who have the siting of industries, to move into the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Let me quote an example.  Within the past five years, we have built a magnificent factory at Ards, about twenty miles from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. We have also built a very fine factory at Milford.  But, at Annagry, in the heart of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, we have one of the finest buildings in this country, a factory owned by the Department of the Gaeltacht, which has never been used since the establishment of the State.  The Department spend money on the upkeep of this factory. They keep it in perfect condition but it has never housed a solitary worker from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. It was built before the State was established.  It would be far better, instead of building new factories in the places I have mentioned, if the Minister had used his good <Col N="836" /> offices with An Foras Tionscal or others who give grants, to persuade prospective industrialists to set up their factories in these existing buildings and save money on the building of new factories.  He would be doing a considerable amount of good and giving employment in that thinly populated area of Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am not fully conversant with other Gaeltacht areas in the country.  I know the Gaeltacht in Kerry, the Ballyferriter district.  The last time I visited it, I had an opportunity of seeing the only industry there.  It is operated by the nuns who have great difficulty in getting private transport to bring their workers to the factory. The very good lady in charge of it in some way or another got possession of a van to bring her wares to Dublin and sell them.  In that way, she was able to keep a number of Irish speakers together in that very virile Gaeltacht area.  I cannot speak with authority about Galway; I am not sure whether any new industries have been set up in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht there.  I should like to see set up in every Fíor-Ghaeltacht many new industries.  I am quite sincere in that.</P>
    <P>One of the first things done when this Ministry was set up was to establish the Board of Gaeltarra Éireann.  It was set up to bring industries to these Gaeltacht areas and is it not a strange thing that year after year Gaeltarra Éireann receive a grant-in-aid from the Government&mdash; and this year it is no less than it was in other years&mdash;of £100,000?  That is a lot of money.  The Gaeltacht areas do not cover a very considerable area of country and one would imagine with £100,000, never mind the working capital, that a considerable amount of employment could be given in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Within the past week, the Minister has received from the Gaeltarra Éireann weavers in the Ardara area of County Donegal a resolution passed by them which I propose to read.  It says:</P>
    <P> 1.  That the present Board of Gaeltarra Éireann be abolished.</P>
    <P>2.  That a new Board of three full-time Directors be appointed, <Col N="837" /> one of whom would be a native of the weaving districts of S.W. Donegal, who would be responsible for the conduct of all Gaeltarra Éireann affairs.  The new Board to appoint a Sales Manager who would be responsible for Sales and who would seek out and appoint the best agents to be found anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>3.  That the three T.D.s for the constituency be contacted to raise these matters on the Estimate for the Department of the Gaeltacht and that deputations call on these Deputies with these proposals.  </P>
    <P>Here is Gaeltarra Éireann, who are primarily concerned with the weaving industry, receiving this resolution from their employees asking that the Board of Gaeltarra Éireann be abolished.</P>

      <P>I shall go back to Donegal and tell them the Deputy from Galway said I wrote the resolution and I feel sure my two colleagues, Deputies Breslin and J. Brennan, will support me.  Here we find the servants of Gaeltarra Éireann proposing and passing a vote of no confidence in their directors, simply because they find their directors are completely out of touch with the wants of the people and particularly of the weavers of the Gaeltacht.  Is it not a strange thing that in the past six years in Donegal a number of new industrialists have moved in, unfortunately not to the Gaeltacht.  Is it not a strange thing that in the past six years in Donegal a number of new industrialists have move in, unfortunately not to the Gaeltacht districts but into other parts of the county, and have established progressive knitting and weaving industries?  One of them, McGees of Donegal town, are inundated with orders and we find Gaeltarra Éireann laying off weavers and unable to find work for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 12 months ago, a very progressive priest, Father McDyer of Glencolumbkille, called me and my fellow Deputies and Senators to meet the directors of Gaeltarra Éireann to protest against the shortage of work for outdoor weavers.  At that meeting we were told by the directors of Gaeltarra Éireann that it was merely because it was a transition period. that they were changing over from <Col N="839" /> single looms to double looms, and that in fact there would be double the amount of work after the transition. We are still waiting for it.  The weavers are being paid off.  Some of them get only one day's work a week.  Far from being the success it should have been, Gaeltarra Éireann is being run at a loss.  Is it not peculiar that these private firms I mentioned are making a huge success out of similar business? Even with the £100,000 grant-in-aid, Gaeltarra Éireann are losing employment instead of gaining it.</P>
    <P>On examining the Estimate, what do we find is now being done to further the employment of the people in the Gaeltacht?  Each year, with the exception of the glasshouse scheme, the money spent there is spent as a sort of relief.  It is spent under the heading of &ldquo;Roads&rdquo; and various other headings. Nothing permanent is being established in the Gaeltacht.  I defy contradiction when I say that despite all these grants-in-aid, in the actual Fíor-Ghaeltacht, we still have the worst roads in the country.  Deputies who come from Gaeltacht areas will, I know, support me in that.  I do not think we are getting allocations of enough money to make the Gaeltacht an attraction to tourists and others who wish to come and see our way of life in those areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to see much more money spent in the Gaeltacht.  One place that strikes me at the moment is Arranmore Island which has a population of over 1,000, where Comhaltas Uladh, one of the most successful Irish colleges in the country, was recently established.  We have on that island approximately 15 miles of roads, and exactly one and a half miles are rolled and tarred.  When I inquired the other day what the grant was this year for the tarring and rolling of the roads in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, I was told that we had got no allocation as yet from the Department of the Gaeltacht, and we do not know whether or not we will get it.</P>
    <P>I see in the Minister's speech that the local authorities are unable to spend each year the moneys that are allocated.  He states that this year he <Col N="840" /> has had to reduce the allocation for roads by £18,000 because the local authorities have been unable to spend it in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot spent it when they do not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the local authorities are unable to spend it for the simple reason that the allocation is not made until it is too late in the year for them to plan to spend it. That is the trouble.  When I asked the local authority engineer the other day how much money he intended to spend on the Fíor-Ghaeltacht roads in Arranmore, he said: &ldquo;I do not know; I have not got the allocation yet.  We will get it within the next fortnight or three weeks, I hope.&rdquo;  How are we to spend it before 31st March?  We cannot do it.  That is one of the matters the Minister should look into very carefully.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister's hands are tied because he has not got a lot of money but he could keep prodding the other Departments.  He could become a prodding Minister so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned to ensure that the Gaeltacht will get a greater allocation. I am certain if he brings that proposal before the Government, he will get the support of every member of the Government.  That should be one of his duties, and he should have a special co-ordinating section in his Department for the purpose of pushing that work forward.</P>
      <P>He should also ensure that whoever provides the money provides it sufficiently early in the year to enable the local authorities to spend it because, as we all know, after 31st March, the money goes back into the Exchequer.  I should like to see all the Gaeltacht roads brought up to such a standard that all the local authorities would vie to take them over and they would become their responsibility.  We cannot expect the local authorities to take them over unless they are up to a reasonable standard.  That is one of the things the Minister could do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We dealt at length this morning with forestry and the Minister told us why certain lands could not be <Col N="841" /> acquired.  He talked about land being too poor for afforestation.  I must say I agree that much of the land is too poor for afforestation but where you have unoccupied marginal lands in the Gaeltacht area, possibly not as good as the land available in other parts of the country or in a particular county, every opportunity should be availed of to endeavour to plant it and thereby give employment to the people of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Afforestation is one of the best possible methods of retaining Irish speakers in their own localities.  In the Gaeltacht of Gweedore, a considerable amount of employment is given in afforestation and we have such a scheme in the Fintown area, but not in the Rosses area.  I have already mentioned the fact that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I accompained the Minister's officials on an inspection of various holdings we thought might be suitable for planting.</P>
    <P>I would advise the Minister for the Gaeltacht to give himself, as Minister for Lands, a kick in the seat to persuade himself to take over portion of the marginal lands in the Gaeltacht areas.  If he finds that physically impossible, perhaps his officials in the Department of the Gaeltacht would give him a prod in the same part of his anatomy.  By doing that, he would be co-ordinating two of the most important Departments, so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see something done to extend the glasshouse tomato scheme.  A considerable amount more could be done in that respect.  I condemned this scheme when it was introduced by the present Minister for External Affairs.  I said it would never be a success&mdash;and I still think it could never be a success&mdash;until heating was installed.  I am glad to see that we are now providing money to extend the scheme to other places in the Gaeltacht areas.  With heating, and with the turf which is available in abundance in most Gaeltacht areas, a much greater success could be made of the Gaeltacht glasshouse scheme than is now being made.  I appeal to the Minister <Col N="842" /> to see that the small number of houses which are erected each year are provided with heat.  If that were done, it would be of assistance to the people residing in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Scéim na Muc. I am familiar with three Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, Cloughwilly, Gweedore and Fanad, and I do not know if we are supplied with one sow in any of those three places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>You would not be able to rear them anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not the potatoes to rear them.  I think the Department of Agriculture were doing sufficiently well with that scheme, without the Minister taking it over.  If he had left Scéim na Muc to the Department of Agriculture, we would have got just as far.</P>
      <P>In passing, let me compliment the Minister on his strides with the Irish language.  I remember when the Minister first introduced this Estimate here, he read it haltingly.  I should like to congratulate him on the efforts he has made to acquire a good spoken knowledge of the language.  I am certain he had a good oral and written knowledge of it and that all he required was a little bit of brushing up and practice.  He certainly has done that and I congratulate him on the knowledge he has acquired of the language.  It just shows what can be done.  Deputy Dillon was right this morning when he referred to those young Scandinavians, how they acquired the language when they had to do it, when economic circumstances drove them to it.  There is a Minister who in a few very short years has acquired a very fluent spoken knowledge of the language and who has set an example to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to be parochial on this Estimate but we have so few Gaeltachta in the country that I am afraid we must be parochial.  I see no great effort by the Minister's Department to spread the Gaeltacht into the breac-Gaeltacht thought I see efforts being made by others to do so.  Again I refer to Comhaltas Uladh and Gael Linn who are doing a magnificent piece of work for the spoken language as <Col N="843" /> distinct from what might be described as the official attitude towards the language.  If the Minister would cooperate as much as possible and give grants-in-aid to Gaeltarra Éireann, Comhaltas Uladh and various others it would be a very good thing but there are a few things on which the Minister should also keep an eye.</P>
    <P>Apart from looking after the Gaeltacht, the Minister also looks after the Irish language.  I remember the time not so very many years ago when in the courts in Gaeltacht areas nothing but the Irish language was spoken.  If a solicitor who did not understand the Irish language came into court, an interpreter had to be employed.  The position is reversed today.  If an Irish speaker comes into the courts now, an interpreter has to be employed to translate his Irish into English for the benefit of the court.  That is a very bad business.  It means we are letting the vernacular slip out of our courts.  There was a time when in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht if you met a Civic Guard on the road he made it his business to speak to you in Irish and would only speak to you in English when he found you did not understand Irish.  He insisted on giving his evidence in the courts through the medium of Irish.  That is all gone.</P>

      <P>I say that with reservation.  I can only speak for the Gaeltacht I know and if the Deputy tells me that is not so in Galway I accept his word unreservedly for that. However, we should not confine this use of the Irish language to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice from the paper, which I sometimes read, that the editor of <i>Aiseirigh</i> was fined a sum of £9 for what I might describe as compulsory English.  The editor of this paper had a motor car.  He claimed that on all occasions, in compliance with the Constitution, he had the right to use English or Irish.  He refused to pay the tax on his motor car until he would be supplied with an application form in the Irish language.  He applied to the local authority here in Dublin for <Col N="844" /> an application form through the medium of Irish.  I can understand they possibly had not got such a form but surely there should have been no trouble in having one of the many typists engaged in 4 Kildare Street type out such an application form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht would have no responsibility for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>While he may have no responsibility for that he has responsibility for the Irish speaking community of this State irrespective of where they go, just as the Minister for External Affairs has responsibility for Irish citizens who cross the water. If the Irish speaker or an Irish citizen crosses the water, he has to look for protection to the Minister for External Affairs while over there.  If the Irish speaker leaves the Gaeltacht he still must look to the Minister for the Gaeltacht for protection.  If the editor of <i>Aiseirigh</i> refuses to pay his tax until he can fill up the application form in Irish it is the duty of the Minister for the Gaeltacht to protect him.  Here we find this man fined a sum of £9 and threatened with jail if he does not pay the fine.</P>
      <P>That is something the Minister should take up with his colleague the Minister for Local Government or with his colleague the Minister for Justice in order to find out if a limited number of application forms for various licences can be made available to local authorities so that no exception can be taken by such local authorities, if an Irish speaker from the Gaeltacht or from any other part of the State wishes to procure an application form in that language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a famous case in my own county.  I think it was the only time the late Pádraig Pearse ever appeared in the old Petty Sessions Court.  It was in Dunfanaghy a good many years ago when an old gentleman down in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht in Donegal refused to print his name in English on his horse-drawn vehicle.  At that time it was compulsory, and still is, to have your name and address on any horse-drawn vehicle.  This old man&mdash;I think McNulty was his name <Col N="845" />&mdash;refused to have it printed in English and had it printed in Irish.  He was prosecuted by the Crown and he engaged the late Pádraig Pearse to defend him.</P>
    <P>That is similar to the case of the editor of this paper.  He refused to fill up the application form in English with the result that he was prosecuted, dragged into court and eventually fined a sum of £9.  I cannot see any great difference between that case and the case in which Pádraig Pearse appeared.  I am certain Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain would not agree with that attitude of the Dublin County Council in failing to provide these application forms in the Irish language.  Again the Minister can hold out his hands and say: &ldquo;It has nothing to do with me.&rdquo;  I say it has.  Just as it is the responsibility of the Minister for External Affairs to look after Irish citizens who go across the water, it is the responsibility of the Minister for the Gaeltacht to look after every Irish speaker who leaves the Gaeltacht no matter what part of the State he goes to.</P>
    <P>Everything possible should be done by the Minister and his colleagues in other Departments to lighten the burden placed on those Irish speakers living on uneconomic holdings in these remote parts of Ireland.  I have a Question on the Order Paper today on a matter where the Minister could grant not only a luxury, but a necessity, to certain islanders off our coasts. I shall not have an opportunity by way of Supplementary Question of pressing the matter further, and therefore I hope to do so on the Estimate later on.  However, I would strongly urge the Minister to keep prodding his fellow Ministers and particularly his own shadow, the Minister for Lands, to push on any and every scheme which will assist in retaining in the Gaeltacht these Irish speakers, who are growing fewer and fewer in numbers each year, and, if they wish to remain and live in the most remote and bleak spots, to ensure that any little luxuries he can provide, or that his fellow Ministers can provide, will be procured for them in these places.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy in a reply to his previous question in April last regarding the appointment of a permanent medical officer for Schull district hospital and dispensary district the future organisation of medical services in this area has been under consideration. The position in Goleen dispensary district is being considered in connection with the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not yet in a position to state <Col N="851" /> when a decision will be arrived at.  I would again like to emphasise that the people of the dispensary districts have not been deprived of an efficient service by reason of the consideration which it has been necessary to give the matter as the posts of medical officer have been filled in a temporary capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his actions have considerably affected the medical services in the Mizen Head Peninsula and as a result, we have no permanent medical officer in Schull dispensary district or in attendance at the Schull dispensary or the Schull district hospital?  Is he aware that at present there is only one medical officer appointed in a temporary capacity who resides more than a mile from the village of Goleen at the western end of the peninsula, without even telephone facilities being available to him?  Surely that cannot continue?  Is the Minister also aware that as a result of the Department's attitude for nearly two and a half years, this position obtains in the Mizen Head Peninsula and the people are not going to stand for it any longer?</P>

I want to know this from the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Health, on the last occasion I addressed a question to him, hedged.

It appears that he took up residence in France near the Spanish frontier in 1960 after spending two or three years in Spain.  In October, 1962, he was served with an expulsion order by the French authorities but the order was not enforced and he was directed to take up residence in another part of France.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable research and investigation in many countries have established that bovine tuberculosis is caused by a micro-organism known as tubercle bacillus (bovine strain) and that the disease is most <Col N="856" /> commonly spread by the ingestion or inhalation of bacilli discharged by infected animals.  It is accepted by the veterinary and scientific authorities in all countries where the disease is being or has been eradicated that the only way to get rid of the disease is by the tuberculin testing of all herds, the removal and slaughter of reactors, disinfection of premises, admission to clear herds of only healthy stock, the application of suitable controls over the movement of stock and over public sales, the pasteurisation of separated milk fed to calves, etc.  Once the disease is eradicated its re-appearance can be effectively controlled.</P>
      <P>In dairying areas tuberculous infection is more widespread, mainly due to the environmental conditions under which stock, cows in particular, are kept.  Infected animals housed with others can be a source of rapid spread of the disease.  It is, therefore, very important that such animals should be suitably isolated pending their removal and slaughter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exports of refined sugar to Britain and the Six Counties amounted to 11,700 tons in 1961 and to 6,340 tons in the first half of 1962. The estimated quantities of sugar used in sugar-containing goods exported to these areas during the same periods were 21,000 tons and 11,000 tons respectively.  Particulars of the amount of levy collected by the British authorities on these exports are not available to my Department.</P>

    <P>The British sugar levy &mdash; which is payable on all sugar marketed in <Col N="857" /> Britain, whether it is produced in that country or imported&mdash;was increased as from the 30th December, 1961, and the effect of the recent Agreement is to offset largely the adverse incidence of this increase on our exports.  Under this Agreement our position is similar to that of South Africa, with which country also Britain has preferential trade agreements and I do not think there is anything further I can add with reference to Trade Agreement aspects except to refer the Deputy to the statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House on 2nd June, 1960.</P>

Is the Minister further aware that this private lorry-owner did the job for £3 10s. per day whereas the C.I.E. quotation for the same job was £7 10s. per weekday and £8 15s. for Sunday and that the employment of C.I.E. at the figures quoted would have rendered this operation uneconomic?

      <P>The interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution which confer the right of free association is a matter primarily for the courts of law.  As the Deputy is presumably aware, the courts, in various judgments, have emphasised the right of the individual worker to join the trade union of his choice.  The question of whether this particular right conflicts with the legal right of employers to terminate the employment of workers is a matter to be decided by the courts if and when a particular case is brought before them.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In December last I was informed by the Western Committee of Cork County Council that having considered the terms of the circular letter issued by my direction in the previous September regarding the desirability in future of providing water and sewerage facilities in rural cottages, they had decided that the cottages to be erected on the sites to be acquired under the West Cork County Health District Compulsory Purchase (Labourers Acts) Order No. 1, 1961, should include provision for the convenient installation of these services in due course.  This compulsory purchase order was at the time before me for confirmation and was subsequently confirmed on 28th June, 1962.  The decision of the council involved, however, the preparation of new rural cottage plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>North and south aspect plans were accordingly prepared and submitted to my Department for approval in July, 1962.  The south aspect plan was approved on 14th August, 1962, and at <Col N="868" /> the same time the housing authority was advised that the north aspect plan was not entirely satisfactory.  On 1st October, 1962, revised plans for both north and south aspect cottages were again submitted.  While these plans were found to be generally in order, certain technical re-arrangements were recommended to the housing authority on 19th October, 1962.</P>

      <P>The transport of fish is not subsidised by the State but early this year it was decided to pay, from the Fishing Industry Development Fund for a trial period, the vouched cost of transporting any varieties of fish from any part of the State to a fishmeal factory provided that  <Col N="870" />  (1)  the fish is landed by genuinely Irish boats registered in the State and  (2)  the quantity to be transported on any occasion is at least seven tons and  (3)  the transport is carried out by Córas Iompair Éireann or similar public undertakings.  </P>
      <P>It is a matter for the fishermen concerned to arrange for the sale of the fish to the fishmeal factory and for the necessary transport.</P>
      <P>The transport of fish under this arrangement did not commence until September last and, while all the necessary vouchers have not yet been received, the expenditure so far incurred is estimated at £2,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if, in view of the Taoiseach's statement that this country will accept defence commitments as part of Common Market policy, and as the country is not sufficiently protected against air-raid attack, he will follow the practice of other countries by encouraging commercial interests as well as local authority, State and semiState bodies to build underground shelters, when constructing new buildings, which could be used as car parks, etc. in peace-time; and if he will make more grants available or approve of a system of rates depreciation to encourage such building.</P>

      <P>As a normal part of overall Civil Defence planning the question of making some provision, in buildings of the types mentioned by the Deputy, <Col N="878" /> against the effects of nuclear weapons, particularly radioactive fall-out, is being considered.  While definite conclusions have not yet been reached, it can be taken that the provision of deep blast-proof shelters is not contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is a Planning Bill coming before the House, does the Minister not think he should avail of the opportunity to confer with the Minister for Local Government with a view to doing the things I suggest, that is, that the Minister for Local Government should offer a rates depreciation to civilians to build underground shelters which could be used for other purposes in peace-time but as protection in the case of war?  Surely it would be up to the Minister to consult with the Minister for Local Government on this matter?  It is a serious matter.  As I said, we are now <Col N="879" /> in some way committed to defence measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. The majority of the cases which the Deputy has in mind are cases in the district court.  These cases are of two kinds&mdash;one is the type of case taken under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the other is the type of case taken under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  The costs in the former are usually 10/-, though occasionally they may go up to £1 1/- or £2 2/-.</P>

      <P>I am coming to that.  There was one exceptional case recently which was adjourned in the district court on 39 successive occasions. In that case, the law agent for the Corporation asked for costs which would take account of this factor, and he was allowed £4 4/-.  That was an exceptional case.  The normal cost is 10/-; though occasionally it may be £1 1/- or £2 2/-.</P>

      <P>Police dogs have been used for the purpose of controlling disorderly persons on many occasions since they were acquired.  Patrols with dogs pay special attention to areas where disorder is prevalent or is thought likely on a particular occasion to arise, and the presence of the dogteams in such circumstances usually has sufficiently deterrent effect to ensure that no disorder arises.  There have also been several occasions on which the dogs have assisted in the quelling of actual disorder.  Details are not readily obtainable but the records show that, on at least nine occasions on which police dogs were used, proceedings were taken against persons for disorderly conduct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few further matters to which I should like to refer.  As I told the Minister when I reported progress, some of them are parochial.  The Minister should pay particular attention to harbours in the Gaeltacht area.  Most of our Gaeltacht is situated in isolated areas on the sea coast.  Some of the harbours may not be located in Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas but they are used by fishermen and others from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.  The Minister would be facilitating these, and providing an amenity for them, by improving the harbours.  One such harbour comes to mind and I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister is here because the one which comes to mind is the harbour at Burtonport; I think he has seen this harbour at low water and when the fleet is in.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to use his influence with the Minister for Finance, to call upon himself as Minister for Fisheries to support himself as Minister for the Gaeltacht in making representations for improvement at Burtonport. Within the last week, or fortnight, departmental inspectors had the opportunity of viewing this harbour.  It is not in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, but it is frequented by fishermen from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. I appeal to him to ensure that the necessary dredging operations are carried out and the necessary shelter provided for boats fishing there.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  I quote from the Minister:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have arranged to extend to all Gaeltacht areas the land rehabilitation <Col N="885" /> scheme, at present known as the Connemara Scheme.  The Department of the Gaeltacht will defray the extra costs involved in this extension. </P>
    <P>I wonder if Fianna Fáil members remember when Deputy Dillon, as Minister, introduced the Connemara scheme.  Do they remember the fun that was poked at him about rolling the rocks round rugged Connemara into the sea?  We do not forget it.  We told you at that time that here was a method whereby you could give employment in a place sadly needing employment, a place sadly neglected. We told you that here was an opportunity of trying to cultivate the small uneconomic plots in the Gaeltacht area.  I remember Deputy Ó Briain laughing at us and trying to paint a picture of Deputy Dillon rolling the rocks round rugged Connemara into the Atlantic.  It took eight years for Fianna Fáil to see the wisdom and sanity of the Connemara scheme. If they had pushed ahead with the scheme, as introduced by Deputy Dillon some eight years ago, that scheme would now have extended to every Gaeltacht and the uneconomic holdings would have been made more economic or less uneconomic.</P>
    <P>It is good even at this late hour to see that Fianna Fáil appreciate the scheme introduced by the inter-Party Government.  I hope that in the future we will not hear any fun poked at the Connemara scheme by Galway Deputies or any other Deputies.  It was an excellent scheme which gave employment where it was badly needed.  At the same time, it was an endeavour to rehabilitate uneconomic holdings where land was very scarce, indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, he did not understand the Minister's Irish. The Minister thinks so much of Deputy Dillon's scheme that I am <Col N="886" /> going to quote from his speech for the benefit of the Deputy from Cavan.  This is what the Minister said:</P>
      <P>We have arranged to extend to all Gaeltacht areas the Land Rehabilitation Scheme, at present known as the Connemara Scheme. </P>
      <P>It was named the Connemara scheme by Deputy Dillon.  Let me quote again:</P>
      <P>The Department of the Gaeltacht will defray the extra costs involved this extension. </P>
      <P>Does Deputy Dolan disagree with that?  He does not answer.  I think he is mute of malice.  He interjected some remark and then when he was pulled up and the veracity of what I said was pointed out to him, he immediately crawled back into his shell and we heard no more from him. Deputy Dillon's scheme has now been accepted and endorsed by the Minister eight years too late.</P>
      <P>I had a question on the Order Paper today&mdash;Question No. 28&mdash;addressed to the Minister.  During the past week, the Minister received a deputation from the Gaeltacht island of Arranmore. He received a petition from the spokesman, the local Catholic curate on Arranmore.  The curate, in consultation with the islanders, particularly the fishermen, made certain recommendations to the Minister which are contained in Question No. 28 on today's Order Paper.</P>
      <P>The first is a request for the erection of hand-winches at four different ports on the island.  The reason for that is this: when boats come alongside, particularly in a heavy ground swell, there is no hope of beaching the boats.  These boats have to be brought ashore by hand-winch.  I refer to the smaller type of boat.  In regard to the bigger type of boat, at low water, a hand-winch is very useful for discharging the cargo.  No very great cost would be involved.  I am certain that the local authority would be only too anxious to take over maintenance if the Minister provided these winches. The cost would be very low indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> The spokesman for the islanders also requested the provision of a derrick or small crane on the piers at Leabgarrow and Burtonport.  I was referring really to the derrick or crane.  What I meant by the hand-winch is this.  When boats are brought in at low water, it is difficult to secure sufficient men to haul them up particularly on a stormy night.  A hand-winch to haul them up is essential. The derrick or crane will be used to discharge the cargo of these boats. That is also very essential; otherwise, it means the manual hauling up alongside the pier of the ship's cargo. If the Minister can see his way to do these things for the people of Arranmore and give them those amenities and facilities at their island ports, he will be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>They also request the erection of lights on the pier at Chapel Strand, Arranmore.  That is an historic spot.  It is the spot where the famous Arranmore disaster occurred almost 30 years ago.  It is the spot where, had there been a light on it that night, there would have been no disaster.  It is a spot where many islanders land during the day-time and the nighttime. As they come from the approaches of the western fishing grounds, a light situated here is essential.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for having provided lights in another part of the island.  I am asking him to do the same for the third landing place at Chapel Strand.  He will be facilitating the islanders whose spokesman is the curate on the island&mdash;a gentleman who knows what he is talking about when he requests these things to be done.  In his reply today the Minister said that this request had been received and that he will consider it.  I ask him to give it careful consideration.  If he does so, I am sure he will accede to the request of the curate.</P>
    <P>The other matter is to make available a special grant for the repair of roads on the island.  In his reply, the Minister told me what was spent last year and the year before that but he <Col N="888" /> did not tell me what would be spent in future years.  It would not be a great undertaking for the Minister to ensure that, until the 15 miles of the roads on Arranmore island are rolled and tarred, a small allocation be made available each year to the local authority to roll and tar these roads.</P>
    <P>Arranmore is now the site of a very progressive Irish college.  It also has considerable tourist potentialities but, unfortunately, the condition of the roads debars tourist from taking advantage of the modern amenities and transport through the island.  The Minister says that they cannot say what we will get in the future.  I am satisfied that if the Minister gives his word that he will give an allocation each year to Arranmore island until the roads are rolled and tarred, which should take about three or four years no matter who his successor is, he will not go back on that promise.  Perhaps he could see his way to do that.  If he did, he would receive my thanks and the thanks of the islanders on this rugged, bleak outpost of civilisation.</P>
    <P>I conclude by dealing with one other matter, that is, the deontas paid to Irish-speaking children or children in Irish-speaking homes.  I notice that the grant this year is as it has been down through the years.  There is no change. This is one of the tests.  No additional families have been found who have become Irish speakers.  The same this year as last year: the same down through the years.  Then we are told the language is progressing.  There is one of the tests but I shall not go into that now.  I shall go into its administration, however.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar scheme.  It is a scheme administered in this way.  A school inspector makes inquiries not as to whether a child speaks Irish or the children of a household speak Irish, but as to whether Irish is the spoken language of the house.  How does he go about it?  He sneaks the information from the neighbours.  Very often, a bad neighbour will put in a bad word against an applicant for the deontas.  No person would be in a better position to know whether or not a household is Irish-speaking than the local teacher or the local manager <Col N="889" /> of the school.  An occasional visit from an inspector once a year or once every two years is not a proper test of whether Irish is the spoken language.</P>
    <P>One thing the people of the Gaeltacht suffer from is faiteas &mdash; natural shyness.  Immediately children of immature age are spoken to by a stranger in a dialect which is not too familiar to them, they shut up and will not talk.  Then they are classified as non-Irish speakers and are refused the deontas.</P>
    <P>There is one family I visit three or four times a year.  During my visits to that house, in the Kilcar district, I have never spoken a word of English. They were turned down the last two years for the deontas, although they received it up to then.  I made representations to the Minister and asked him to appoint an independent inspector to investigate this case.  The reply I got back was that if they worked hard enough at the Irish language during the coming 12 months they might become Irish speakers by that time.</P>
    <P>Why not write to the parish priest, who will give you his word as to whether or not they are Irish speakers, whether Irish is the spoken language of the house?  Why not write to the local schoolteacher and inquire?  Why not get some other inspector to call on the household?</P>
    <P>We have another gentleman in the Gaeltacht who is most unpopular, another sneaky little gentleman known as the investigation officer.  His job is to inquire into the means, the number of hens people in the Gaeltacht have, and, depending on the number of hens they have, the amount of their unemployment assistance is assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often, when the cigire, the school inspector, calls, he is mistaken for this sneaky little gentleman, the investigation officer, and the parents immediately clamp down. Again, the local Garda should be consulted as to whether people are Irish <Col N="890" /> speakers or otherwise.  The Garda know.  I appeal to the Minister to be liberal and generous in his investigations&mdash;I do not say in his administration of the scheme but in his investigations&mdash;as to whether Irish is the spoken language of these families.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer and the investigation officer is brought into mind.  The Minister is the Minister in charge of fisheries and fishermen in the Gaeltacht areas.  This year and last year, Gael Linn acquired a very valuable fishery in Teelin, County Donegal. They issue licences to skippers of boats to fish for salmon during the drift net salmon season or the draft net salmon season, as the case may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I do not think so.  I pointed out that the Minister for the Gaeltacht is in a peculiar position.  He is a co-ordinating Minister between all other Ministers. He is not a spending Minister in the sense that his is not a spending Department.  He siphons money from various Departments and generally passes it through the office of Public Works or the Department of Local Government for expenditure.  As such, he is a co-ordinating Minister. He could and should do something for the poor unfortunate fishermen of the Gaeltacht who are losing what they call their &ldquo;dole&rdquo; or unemployment assistance as a result of their activities in the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a most peculiar system.  I am telling the Minister this now, as Minister for the Gaeltacht.  A man living in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht can go over to Scotland for three months of the year where he may earn as much as £40 per week danger money in the tunnels or the underground mines. After three or four months, he can come back here with a couple of hundred pounds.  When the Department of Social Welfare come to assess his means for unemployment assistance, <Col N="891" /> that money which he earned is not taken into account at all.</P>
    <P>If a fisherman in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht goes out for a night's fishing and earns, say, £30 or £40 or £50 during the week, that £50 is taken into account in assessing his means for unemployment assistance.  It is most peculiar that a fisherman's earnings, as such, are taken into account in assessing his means, whereas a migrant's or an emigrant's earnings are not.</P>
    <P>The Donegal County Council, say, may employ an unemployed man for three months and pay him £6 or £6.10 per week.  Then his employment ceases. Supposing he wants to draw unemployment assistance.  He may do so and his earnings with the Donegal County Council are not taken into account. Supposing that that same man, instead of working for the Donegal County Council, fished either herrings or any other type of fish for one month.  The amount of that is taken into account in assessing his means and his unemployment benefit grows smaller.</P>
    <P>These things may seem strange and may sound peculiar here.  We have a very sparsely-populated House at the moment.  I know most people are not interested but every family in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht is interested in the dole, where there is no employment for them.  I trust the Minister for the Gaeltacht will prod his various colleagues in Government to see that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht gets cothrom na Féinne and that, in the distribution of the State's gifts, the law is a little more liberal and generously administered when dealing with people who are the sole and last custodians of our Irish language.</P>

      <P>Sa chéad dhul síos, dúirt sé go raibh sé ag caint leis an Teachta Diolún faoi na daoine sa tSualainn agus tíortha eile go bhfuil an Béarla go maith acu. Do chuir an Teachta Ó Dómhnaill é sin i gcomparáid leis an méid a deineadh leis an Gaeilge anseo, fén gcóras atá againn, ar a thug sé córas éigeantach. Ní féidir an dá rud a chur i gcomparáid lena chéile mar, ó thaobh na daoine sa tSualainn atá ag foghluim an Bhéarla, tá dhá rud i gceist, (a) go bhfuil siad comhgarach do thíortha ina bhfuil teangacha éagsúla (b) gur ceist eacnamaíochta atá ann.</P>
      <P>Tá Éire suite idir dhá thír móra&mdash; Sasana ar láimh amháin agus Meiriceá ar an láimh eile.  Dá bhrí sin, shíl cuid dár ndaoine nach raibh aon teanga eile seachas an Béarla ar fáil. San Eoraip tá na daoine in a gcónaí láimh le tíortha mar an Ghearmáin, an Danmhairg agus Sasana.  Deineann siad a gcuid gnótha leis na tíortha seo agus dá bhrí sin is fiú dóibh ó thaobh eacnamaíochta dhe na teangacha sin a fhoghluim.  Tá fhios acu go bhfuil an Béarla úsáideach dóibh in a nghnóithe agus mar gheall air sin tá fáth eacnamaíochta acu len í a fhoghluim ach ní hionann sin is a rá go gcaitheann siad a dteanga féin i leathtaobh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar an dara dul síos, ba mhaith liom tagairt gairid a dhéanamh do na páistí a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht gach bliain.  Deir an Teachta Ó Dómhnaill go mba cheart laghdú a dhéanamh ar an líon páistí a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht i rith an tSamhraidh agus gur ceart dúinn líon beag páistí a chur ann i rith na bliana.  D'aontóinn leis an méid sin ach a bé na constaicí a bhaineann leis.  Bheadh sé i bhfad ní bhfearr dá dtiocfadh linn na scoláirí seo a chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht tríd an bhliain ar fad ach níl sé indéanta.  Cé bheadh ann chun aire a thabhairt dóibh?  Cé hiad na daoine a bheadh ábalta fanacht sa Ghaeltacht i rith na bliana le haire a thabhairt do na páistí? Ins an Choláiste a bhfuil baint agam léi, Rann na Feirste, tá fhios agam nach féidir é sin a dhéanamh i rith na bliana ar fad.  Is féidir é sin a dhéanamh ar feadh cúpla mí sa Samhradh <Col N="893" /> ach tá sé dodhéanta i rith na bliana ar fad.</P>
    <P>Cúpla focal anois i dtaobh na gcoláistí Gaelige.  Tá daoine ann a cheapann gur féidir linn an teanga a athbheochaint gan an Ghaeltacht a shábháil.  Ní aontaím leis sin.  Má chaillimíd an Ghaeltacht ní bheimíd i ndán an teanga a shábháil.</P>

      <P>Tá dualgas orainn an Ghaeltacht a shábháil má táimíd chun an teanga a athbheochaint.  Bá mhaith liom anois labhairt ar gné amháin de obair na Roinne&mdash;an cuidiú a thugann siad do na Coláistí Gaelacha agus an baint atá acu leo.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar Choisde na bPáistí agus an obair atá déanta ag an Roinn le feabhas a chur ar an scéim sin.  Tá moladh mór ag dul don Roinn as ucht na hoibre atá déanta acu.  Bhí cosc mór ar an scéim sin in am amháin mar gheall ar aoiseanna na bpáistí&mdash;go dtí cúpla bliain ó shoin.  Níor bhain an scéim sin ach le páistí idir 11 agus 14 bliain d'aois.  D'ardaíodh an aois seo go 18 bliana agus ní amháin go dtugann sé sin cuidiú dúinn níos mó scoláirí a chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht ach tugann sé cabhair do na páistí sna Sé Condae fosta.  Is beag Gaeilge atá ag páistí na Sé gCondae faoi 14 bliana, ach tá Gaeilge mhaith i gcuid des na meán scoileanna.  Ós rud é go bhfuil na h-aoiseanna árdaithe, is féidir leis na scoileanna sin úsáid a bhaint as an scéim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom an Roinn a mholadh fosta mar gheall ar an chabhair a thugann siad leis na Choláistí Gaelacha a fheabhsú.  Thug siad cuidiú breá don Choláiste i Rann na Feirsde agus sílim gur beag Coláiste ar fúd na tíre a bhfuil crut chomh maith uirthi agus atá ar an cheann san anois.  Is cúis bróid do mhuintir Rann na Feirsde coláiste dá leithéid a bheith acu.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil a lán rudaí a dhíth i gceantair na Gaeltachta&mdash;tá déantúisí ag teastáil uathu agus tá rudaí eile eacnamaíochta in easnamh &mdash;ach tá fhios agam fosta go gcuidíonn na Coláistí Gaeilge go mór leis na <Col N="894" /> daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Is mór an trua, ar an ábhar sin amháin, nach féidir linn leathnú ar líon na gColáistí seo. I láthair na huaire díolann na coláistí a lán airgid i rith an dá mhí a bhfuil na Coláistí sin ar obair.  Chómh maith leis sin, caitheann na scoláirí féin mórchuid arigid ins na ceantair sin.</P>
    <P>Rinne muid iarracht i mbliana a fháil amach cé mhéid airgid a chaith na scoláirí.  Fuair muid amach i rang in a raibh 30 páistí, meán rang a bhí ann, gur chaith siad trí phunntaí an duine ar an mheán sa mhí, agus ós rud é go raibh breis is míle dóibh ann is mór an méid airgid é sin&mdash;agus bhí sé sin taobh amuigh ar fad den mhéid airgid a fuair muintir na dtithe ón Choláiste ar son a gcuid oibre.</P>
    <P>Ní shílim go bhfuil mórán eile le rá agam ar an Meastachán seo.  Tá i bhfad níos mó eolais ag Teachtaí eile ar na rudaí atá a dhíth sa Ghaeltacht ná mar atá agam ach ba mhaith liom mar focal scoir a rá gur ceart dúinn iarracht mór a dhéanamh páipéar nuaíochta Gaeilge a chur ar fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Taobh amuigh de pháipéar amháin, níl le fáil sa Ghaeltacht i láthair na huaire ach nuachtáin Bhéarla agus is mór an trua é sin.  Dá mbeadh páipéar maith Gaeilge le fáil, tá fhios agam féin go léadh muintir na Gaeltachta é.  Tá nuachtán Gaeilge ann ach cionn is nach bhfuil go leor airgid Stáit á fháil aige tá sá doiligh air freastal seart a dhéanamh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Bá mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an Meastachán seo.  Tá an dualgas orainn ár ndícheall a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge d'athbheochaint agus cultúr na tíre seo a thabhairt ar ais go hÉireann mar is chóir.  Tá an dualgas orainn ár ndícheall a dhéanamh ins na slithe sin. Iarraim ar an Aire, freisin, a dhícheall a dhéanamh chun muintir na Gaeltachta a spreagadh agus deireadh a chur leis an aineolas atá dhá scaipeadh ar fud na tíre i dtaobh ceist na Gaelige. Cathfimíd córas Críostúil a chur ar fáil. Is maith is eól dom an méid atá á dhéanamh ag an Aire ar son muintir na Gaeltachta agus tá rian a chuid oibre le feiscint ins na ceantrachta Gaeltachta.  Ach is mór an trua go <Col N="895" /> bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag imeacht i gcéin, go Sasana agus Meiriceá agus críocha eile ar fud an domhain.  Níl a ndóthain obair le fáil acu sa bhaile agus imíonn siad le fáin.</P>
      <P>Molaim Gael Linn, Conradh na Gaeilge, Coiste na bPáistí agus na gluaiseachtaí eile atá ag obair go dian chun an Gaeilge a choimeád beo agus ba chóir go mbeadh gach Gaeilgeoir in Éirinn buíoch dóibh.  Guím rath ar an obair seo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I note there is an increase of £7,250 in this Estimate.  I should like to know what percentage of that increase has reached the Gaeltacht. Has it all been eaten up in salaries in the Department?  These people are entitled to these increases; I do not see why they should not get what is going but when there is talk of an increase I would say the percentage that has reached the people of the Gaeltacht is very small.  What struck me most was the way the speech on this Estimate was rushed through by the Minister.  He spoke so fast that I do not know how anyone could keep up with him.  It was like something the Minister wanted to get rid of quickly.  That seems to be the approach of his Department towards the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of the glasshouses. People are beginning to see through a lot of these glasshouses because the Minister has turned his back on the people in regard to the glasshouses that were damaged by the storm last year.  Does the Minister recall having told the people to cut more turf so as to heat these glasshouses?  That turf has been cut but it has not been burned in the glasshouses.  We all remember the storm last year&mdash;&ldquo;Debbie&rdquo; it was called.  I do not think the people of Dublin knew the facts of what did happen in the West.  The damage to glasshouses there has been immense and the failure of the Minister and his Party to see that these glasshouses were put into proper repair is one that called for the strictest&mdash;the term I should like to use would not be Parliamentary&mdash;censure. Glass has been scattered all over the countryside creating a hazard to stock. <Col N="896" /> Glasshouses are standing like ghosts, most of them just twisted frames.  The Minister says here: &ldquo;I regret that I am unable to say when the scheme will be completed.&rdquo;  His regrets will not go very far and the people to whom I have spoken along the coast are disgusted with the attitude in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the Department's policy in regard to the division of work on the island of Aran. When I say work I mean something permanent, not just a stop-gap.  I would remind the Minister these people pay their share of taxes although they have no ESB, no CIE and, of course, they will have no TV either.  The Minister may say to us these people have got bottled gas but that is a poor substitute for the service for which they pay their share. Would the Minister turn his attention to helping to see that the little home industries are both developed and protected? I have said in this House before, one has only to go down some of the streets of this city to see the famous Aran crioses being sold having been made in back rooms in Dublin. What protection has the Minister or his Department given these people to guard against the activities of those cashing in on industries that were built up by these people over the years?  I have said that before and I shall continue to repeat it in this House until we get some form of protection for these people.  They have a genuine article but it is being substituted and certain elements are cashing in on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also responsible for fisheries.  Deputy O'Donnell has suggested that the Minister should have a co-ordinating effect on fisheries, so far as the West is concerned.  Government policy in regard to fisheries off the western coast has come to the surface in the past couple of days.  The Minister is abandoning&mdash;and &ldquo;abandoning&rdquo; is the word&mdash;the fish plant in Galway.  I should like to remind him of a statement made by his predecessor. He said:</P>
    <P>I am informed that the minimum operating capacity to enable it to operate economically is 25 tons. </P>
    <P>That is our fishery plant in Galway. <Col N="897" /> He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>At the moment twenty tons are being brought ashore to be processed. We hope to reach the figure of the extra five tons shortly when the plant will prove to be of economic value. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one he did not like especially since a few months ago, he stated his policy in regard to the people depending on fishing off the west coast.  I am talking of Government policy and the policy of the Department he represents.  No matter what Estimate he is presenting to the House, he is still the Minister in charge of the Gaeltacht and Fisheries. The Minister is trying to pass the buck with his Pontius Pilate act.  He is trying to wash his hands of the responsibility for the people who depend on fishing for their livelihood off the west coast.  The city of Galway has done a lot to train fishermen but, of course, the people can judge the Minister's attitude in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what steps the Minister proposes to take&mdash;or is he abandoning it like the fish plant in Galway&mdash;to decentralise his Department and place it in the West.  We heard all the pious statements made by the Minister and his predecessor about having the Department of the Gaeltacht in the West.  Of course, the Minister has got into the groove that holds that Dublin is the be-all and the end-all, so far as his Department is concerned. <Col N="898" /> The entertainment halls are very laudable but, hand in hand with them, should go the development of little industries.  It would take a lot of entertainment to fill an empty stomach or stop an emigrant from leaving the West.</P>
    <P>The Minister might tell us what progress has been made in regard to the national language, either in or outside the Gaeltacht.  Can we hear the children in the streets speaking Irish?  If you speak to children coming from school in the Irish language, they look at you as if you are a &ldquo;square.&rdquo; I would be a square in the circle that is being created nowadays&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh náire ar an Aire.  While the £5 deontas is a good thing, I feel that the time has come when the child from an English-speaking home who speaks Irish should be considered because that child is at a greater disadvantage than the child who has been reared in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Entertainment halls in the Gaeltacht are to be recommended and handball alleys are also being provided.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that one in Barna was badly damaged by storms last year and needs replacement.  Barna is an Irish-speaking area.  Possibly the Department might be able to consider giving a grant to have it replaced.</P>
      <P>I should also like to draw the attention of the Minister to the need for providing more slips for boats fishing off the west coast.  There is a great need now that they are engaging in lobster fishing as well as other fishing, and facilities should be provided to help to make the lives of the fishermen worth living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not ask me&mdash;he did not want to hear it&mdash;for the source of the quotation I gave earlier.  I quoted from the <i>Galway Observer</i> of June 14th, 1958.  I should like the Minister, in his dual capacity, to read what his predecessor said in regard to the fish plant for which he says he is not responsible today but for which he will <Col N="899" /> be responsible tomorrow, and for which, so far as I am concerned, he is responsible all the time.  I should also like the Minister to take note of replies given to me in the House on June 14th, 1958.</P>

Sílim gur Meastachán an-thábhachtach ar fad é seo de bhrí gur sa Ghaeltacht is mó atá teanga, ceol, nósanna agus macsamhail mhuintir na hÉireann leis na céadta bliain anuas agus gur cheart, agus gur cóir agus gur riachtanach an rud é an méid is féidir a dhéanamh leis an gcóras beatha agus an teanga a shábháil ionas go mbéidhmíd ábalta an náisiún féin a shábháil.</P>
      <P>Cuireann sé déistin orm éisteach leis an Teachta Ó Cúgáin thall ansan ag labhairt i mBérla go mór mhór nuair is eól dom go bhfuil an Ghaeilge aige.  Cheap mise go mbéadh seans againn cathair na Gaillimhe a bhunú mar cathair fíor-Ghaeilge na Gaeltachta agus measaim go n-éireodh le muintir na Gaillimhe é sin a dhéanamh ós rud é go bhfuil an Teachta Ó Cúgáin anois in a Iar-Mhaoir mar ní dóigh liom gur labhair sé focal Gaeilge le strainséirí nó le daoine áitiúla an fhad agus a bhí an oifig ársa sin aige. Is maith an rud é don tír agus don chontae agus don Ghaeltacht go háirithe nach bhfuil sé mar mhaoir na cathrach anois.  Ach fágfaidh mé sin mar atá sé.</P>
      <P>Is maith ar fad í an scéim sin atá ag an Aire maidir le páisdí ón Ghalltacht a chur chun na Gaeltachta.  Ní hamháin go gcabhraíonn sé le feabhas a chur ar teanga mhuintir na Galltachta ach cabhraíonn sé chomh maith le saidhbhreas agus tionscail sa Ghaeltacht féin.  In a theannta sin, cabhraíonn an scéim go mór le coistí feiseanna ar fud na tíre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith an rud é fosta dá bhféadfadh an tAire cabhair a thabhairt do pháisdí na Gaeltachta dul abhaile chun cónaí i dtíthe na bpáisdí ón Ghalltacht i rith an gheimhridh.  Bheadh seans <Col N="900" /> níos fearr ansin go leanfadh na páisdí ón Ghalltacht le labhairt Gaeilge agus fosta bhéadh sórt cáirdeachais idir an dá theaghlach uaidh sin amach.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom fosta tagairt dos na páipéirí nuachta, go mór mhór na páipéirí i nGaeilge.  Sílim gur cóir don Rialtas cabhrú leis sin.  Dá mbeadh na páipéirí i nGaeilge, is cinnte go léifeadh muintir na Gaeltachta iad.  Ba mhaith an rud é chun an teanga a shábháil.  Níl slí is fearr leis an nGaeilge a shábháil ná an focal scríofa a fheiceál agus sé an tslí is tairbhe chun an focal scríofa a fheicheál ná é a fheiceál ins na páipéirí nuachta.  Tá páipéiri ann agus táid scríofa i nGaeilge ar fad, fógraí, nuacht, agus mar sin de.  Is fiú go mór deontas agus cabhair a thabhairt dos na daoine atá i bhfeidhil na hoibre sin.  Go fóill ar aon chaoi, níl a lán léitheóirí aca, ach beidh an líon ag dul i méid.  Idir an dá linn seo, is ceart gach cabhair is féidir a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart freisin go mbeadh ainmneacha na n-earraí atá le díol ag na siopadóirí scríofa as Gaeilge, go mór mhór cártaí agus uile.  Chomh maith leis sin ba mhaith an rud é dá n-iarradh an tAire ar an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil na comharthaí bóithre a chur i nGaeilge amháin sa Ghaeltacht.  Ní dóigh liom go ndéanfadh muintir ar bith in aon tír eile aistriúchán ar na comharthaí bóithre chun cabhrú le daoine a théann thar lear go dtí a dtír ach amháin muintir na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil na tithe go maith sa Ghaeltacht agus go bhfuil siad go glan agus go néata, go bhfuil na daoine ann flaithiúil agus go ndéanfadh sé maitheas don a lán de mhuintir na tíre tamall a chaitheamh sa Gaeltacht.  Tá sár-obair á déanamh ag na daoine a théann go dtí na coláistí sin agus a bhíonn ag teagasc iontu.  Tá sár-obair á déanamh freisin ag na sagairt agus na h-oidi scoile chun cabhrú le muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is fiú fosta focal molta a rá anseo maidir leis an obair iontach a dheineann na Gaeil ins na Sé Chontae ar son na teangan.  Molaim go mór iad. Molaim Gael-Linn, Coisde na bPáisdí agus coistí feise ar fud na tíre fosta. Tá a fhios agam fosta go gcreideann an Rialtas agus an tAire i muintir na <Col N="901" /> Gaeltachta agus nach bhfuil dabht in a n-aigne go bhfuil an Gaeilge ag dul chun cinn i bhfad níos fearr ná mar a bhí riamh agus go bhfuil muintir na tíre go bhfuil Gaeilge aca brodúil as. Nuair a théimid isteach san ComhMhargadh, beidh spéis ag daoine i dteangacha iasachta agus beidh níos mó measa ag daoine ar a dteangan féin ansin.  Sílim féin go rachaidh eolas ar an nGaeilge chun socair go mór leo teanga iasachta a fhoghluim agus gur mar sin a bhéas an scéal.</P>

      <P>The saving of the Gaeltacht is a matter for the Government of the day, no matter what Government are in power.  There are fewer people now in the Gaeltacht areas than were there during the British regime.  Therefore, during 40 years, the various Governments in this country have done very little to keep the Irish-speaking people in the Gaeltacht.  Every area has shrunk and if we want to be sensible, we must realise that the only two parts of the country which are really Gaeltacht areas today are Galway and Donegal.</P>
      <P>The other parts of the country which people call Gaeltacht areas are not Gaeltacht areas at all.  Nobody should know that better than Ministers of State, the people who represent those areas, and every Deputy who comes into this House.  The most unfortunate part of the whole business is that even in those Gaeltacht areas young people do not speak Irish and they are not anxious to speak Irish. That is one of the great troubles in trying to bring back the Irish language and preserve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister on his own cannot do it.  You want three or four different Departments working in conjunction to do the work.  Only on Monday or Tuesday night, I read in the <i>Evening Herald</i> that a gentleman from our Development Authority&mdash;I have not <Col N="902" /> got the cutting with me unfortunately&mdash; was speaking in London in connection with the great advantages we have in this country to induce industrialists to come over.  But even though the Government are anxious to give grants to people to start industries here, they do not direct them to a particular area. The people themselves can decide in what area they will set up their industry.  I do not think that is the correct attitude to adopt.  We should have a comprehensive attitude adopted in such a way that if the taxpayers' money is to be given to any industrialist who comes in the Government will be in a position to place the industry in whatever area they decide.</P>
    <P>Why have industries, small ones if you like, not been placed in the Gaeltacht to give work to the people and keep them there speaking the Irish language?  I cannot understand it. There is no use praising the Minister about this thing or that thing.  He cannot of himself, with his Department do the work.  He will require the help of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Education. As I say, it is a Government responsibility and the Government should see that the three or four Departments involved should come together if we are serious about saving the Gaeltacht. One thing that has been done in the Gaeltacht areas, and in the west generally, has been the planting of forests which have proved to be of a productive nature, are giving employment and keeping the people in the areas as well as paying their way in a small way.  The timber can be sold after a certain time and in that way some of the money which has been spent can be recouped.</P>
    <P>If we examine the imports of woollen goods and the money we spend on them it is difficult to understand why we could not have such industries established in the Gaeltacht areas to keep the people working there.  I suggest to the Minister, in regard to trying to retain those people who are still in the Gaeltacht, that he should confer with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Education and any other Minister who would be helpful to him, in order to get State industries going which would provide <Col N="903" /> employment and keep them there speaking the Irish language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident there is no hope of keeping the Gaeltacht, or expanding it, unless we can provide for the people there a standard of living comparable with that available to the people in the Common Market countries and provide access to entertainments and to such facilities to doctors and dentists as are available in any of our county towns.  It is sad to find in the Minister's speech that it has been again necessary to provide £100,000 for the losses on Gaeltarra Éireann.  It is also sad to find the Minister taking solace from the fact that the losses this year have been reduced by £32,000.  I would have preferred if the Minister had gone into greater detail on the operations of Gaeltarra Éireann this year, but he chose not to do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister seeks solace from the fact that the losses are £32,000 less; yet he found it necessary to give them another £100,000 to keep them running as well as £70,000 for capital expenditure.  As long as that continues, the people will have no belief in the Gaeltacht and no belief in themselves.  For £10 they can get a first-class ticket to Liverpool, get all the amenities I have spoken of, have the attractions of the bright lights and all the rest.  I do not suggest that we can have an O'Connell Street in the middle of Donegal but unless we can give these people profitable employment, with the prospect of continuity in it, unless we can provide them with the money in their pockets to have these services and amenities, to have their cinemas and enjoy their TV programmes, we are throwing our money to the winds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the criticism of Gaeltarra Éireann over the past few years, which I do not wish to reiterate here, if the Government were serious in the matter they would have ensured by capital investment that, at least in the years to come, Gaeltarra Éireann would be able to show a profit.  Instead, they have accepted failure.  I do not accept that the standard of work in the Gaeltacht areas, where Gaeltarra Éireann <Col N="904" /> operates, is low.  From what I know of these people, they are decent people and good workers.  If Gaeltarra Éireann is trading in the wrong type of goods, if the knitted garments they make are not the ones that sell best, I would be happy to see the Minister putting in a large sum for capital expenditure to put things right.  Instead of that, he is putting in £70,000 capital expenditure to fill a hole somewhere and £100,000 to fill the hole of operating losses.</P>
    <P>How can you expect anybody in the Gaeltacht to have faith in the future of the Gaeltacht if the very place providing them with employment, providing them with their bread money, is subsidised by the Government to the extent of £100,000? Perhaps the popular thing to do would be to let this expenditure through without saying anything, but that is not any good to these people.  It is far better that we should draw attention to the fact that there is &ldquo;something rotten in the state of Denmark,&rdquo; that something has been rotten over the past ten years and that it has not been put right.  There is no evidence in the Minister's statement that he intends to do anything about it.  This will continue if these people are content to live on these small charities from Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is rather like the time when the first Vote of the Parliament here 100 years ago provided that any hungry person in the West of Ireland could go to the local police station and get a stone of maize to keep him from death.  That is no good to anybody.  As a business man first and a politician last I say the Minister and his Department ought to be ashamed of themselves if they support such a policy. I would prefer to wind up Gaeltarra Éireann altogether, start another company and employ the people.  I would tell the people the whole thing is a fraud.  I would not continue to produce £100,000 a year, because the people will not stay here on that basis.  They know that Gaeltarra Éireann is operating on the basis of being a depreciating asset and even the trade place Gaeltarra Éireann in the position of being somebody's poor relation. That will not wash in business to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> It is questionable whether the Minister will be allowed to continue to produce £100,000 for Gaeltarra Éireann when we enter the Common Market.  As I understand the provisions of the Rome Treaty, he will not be allowed to do it.  He might be allowed &mdash;I am open to correction here&mdash;to make available £500,000 for capital expenditure, providing there is an arrangement for repayment.  That would be sensible.  When that time arrives we are going to have faster emigration.</P>
    <P>All through the Minister's speech you find references to things like the provision of £10,000 for an entertainment hall.  If we had done anything to keep up the population of the Gaeltacht areas since 1922 by providing them with work, private enterprise would have provided all these other amenities.  On political business in Ennis last week, I was in a private enterprise hall, which accommodates 1,200 or 1,300 people at a dance.  If the people are provided with a decent standard of living, they will be able to purchase the tickets to go to the dances, the cinemas and everything else.  It is an admission of our failure that we can provide only a mere £10,000, hardly sufficient to build three good houses at the moment.  The entertainment hall, even if it is only one a year, will then only compare very unfavourably with the sort of place they will see if they come up the east coast or with the type of hall they will see 50 miles from a Gaeltacht area. You may forget this business of trying to produce an artificial situation. Nobody lives on an island.  Travel is becoming relatively cheap&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but why can we not get an industry there that will pay?  If none will move there, can we not put one there and having done that, will the people from their earnings in the area not provide the purchasing power that will mean that private enterprise will set up a hall?  Is that not the basis on which you want to put the Gaeltacht, if it is to be the showplace of the nation that the <Col N="906" /> Government and everybody wishes it to be?  Must we not have a natural situation rather than a completely unnatural one in which the main industry which has been put in there, after all sorts of scandals that we have had over several years, still has to get £100,000?</P>
      <P>How would Deputy Corish like to be working in that industry and to be sitting in the gallery now, if he were on holidays in Dublin and listening to this?  Would he feel that he was in an expanding thriving industry and getting ahead?  Would he feel that as it expanded, there was a chance of promotion for him, of being in charge of six or seven others, and perhaps getting a few pounds extra?  Or, would he feel this was going to damp him down and that this charity from Dublin was just what it is, something to keep him there, existing almost at the will of the politicians?</P>

      <P>There is no point in getting into an argument but if we are to change the policy completely and make the West a sort of game preserve, that is completely contrary as far as I know to the policy of the Government and to our policy on this side of the House.  If a policy to depopulate the Gaeltacht is adumbrated, that is a horse of a different colour&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but is it not the policy to employ people there? Are we not voting £100,000 for that purpose?  My point is that it should not be voted in that way and that we should face the fact that Gaeltarra Éireann has failed and that we should do something about it, by changing its production or forming a new company and putting up a much larger sum for capital expenditure, or doing something that will indicate that we are getting out of the wood so that the <Col N="907" /> unfortunate workers in Gaeltarra Éireann will have some hope, if it is wound up&mdash;if it were private business, it would have been wound up long ago&mdash;and re-floated on a new basis of expansion, of better prospects and constant employment, not dependent on the vote of any politician?  Nobody should be dependent on us and our whims and fancies for anything.  The Gaeltacht workers would probably agree with me on that.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am hypercritical, but I find that much of this Vote is just a joke.  For instance, we see £14,000 for marine works in the Gaeltacht area. In my constituency, we are now spending £375,000 on the port of Drogheda but, for all these Gaeltacht harbours, bits and pieces here and there, a figure of £14,000 each year is provided.  The cost of removing one cubic yard of mud is something that might be considered by the Minister.</P>

      <P>The provision of £14,000 for marine works is the same as that of last year.  The Office of Public Works usually executes these works on behalf of the Department. </P>

      <P>A sum of £42,000 is provided for two secondary schools. What are we doing with these people but educating them to export them, unless we do something practical towards providing work for them?  The one industry we have provided has to get £100,000 per year to keep it running. We have two secondary schools in which the children will get the benefit of secondary education but unless the whims of politicians favour pouring out £100,000 year after year, these children are educated for export.</P>
      <P>If we are to do anything for the Gaeltacht, we must take the natural step of providing decent employment and living standards for these people. Let me not be taken as opposing the provision of two secondary schools&mdash; they must be provided&mdash;but these things are subsidiary to the material, economic consideration of employment for the people on a profitable basis when they leave the schools.  Nothing else will do any good; nothing produced by the civil servants in Dublin or the policies of Ministers will be of benefit.  What the worker in industry wants to know is that the industry is making money.  As soon as he sees a drop in sales, in quality or in the quantity of production, he begins to slip. If you wish, you can blame him for that but really what is responsible is that his vision of the future is obscured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite seriously concerned with that aspect of this problem.  If we are to do anything worthwhile, we must either wind up Gaeltarra Éireann or reorganise it.  We must spend a lot of money on producing something to give these people employment gainful not only to them but also to the Government or the industrialists concerned if we can introduce them.  When we have done that, when we have produced decent employment in the Gaeltacht at a level that will enable people to live on a decent standard, if they will stay there for a great number of <Col N="909" /> the boys and girls coming to the age at which they need work, then we shall have a Gaeltacht.  Otherwise, things will merely become worse and the years to come will prove that, when we shall have no Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Ceist an-thábhachtach í seo.  Dá bhféadfadh an tAire gníomh fónta a dhéanamh i leith na Gaeltachta, bheadh clú agus cáil tuilte aige i measc laochra Éireann agus mhairfeadh a ainm go deo chomh fada is a bheadh Gael in Éirinn beo.  Níor mhór le h-éinne dhó an clú is an cáil, ach is beag comhartha ná deimhniú atá againn go dtí seo go bhfuil aon mhachnamh doimhin déanta ag an Aire ná aghaidh thréan tabhartha aige ar na fadhbanna agus na deacrachtaí nach féidir a sheachaint.</P>
      <P>Tá daoine ann a déarfadh gur sa Ghaeilge ba chóir an cheist seo a phlé ach tá an-chuid de mhuintir na hÉireann a bhfuil suim aca i gceist na Gaeltachta agus nach bhfuil an teanga chó laidir sin aca gur féidir leo gach rud a deirtear sa Ghaeilge a thuiscint. Is baol liom, uaireannta, go n-úsáidtear an Ghaeilge chun saghas cló draíochta a thógaint ós cionn na ceiste.  Mar sin, ba mhian liomsa cúpla focal a rá i mBéarla agus na tuairimí atá agam a nochtadh.</P>
      <P>When the Ministry of the Gaeltacht was set up, it had certain aims which were placed before the House at that time.  A little later, in Seanad Éireann, a motion was introduced to the effect that the proper way to save the Gaeltacht was by setting up a Board.  The debate on the motion is reported in Volume 45 of the Seanad Debates, for Wednesday, 2nd November, 1955.  An Seanadóir Mac Aodha a chur an cheist seo ós cóir an tSeanaid an uair sin.  His aim was, as he said, to enable the Gaeltacht, not alone to survive, but to better itself both economically and in the interests of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers from both political Parties took part in the debate.  They disagreed with the idea of a board because they felt a Ministry which would coordinate the aspects of Government in the various Departments which have a part in the administration of affairs in <Col N="910" /> so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned was the proper means for promoting the Irish language and the economic welfare of the people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>On that occasion, Senator Hayes set out the position as he saw it.  The language is a very precious national inheritance and we should try to ensure that the purity of the language is maintained in the Gaeltacht but the people in the Gaeltacht do not speak the Irish language for the sake of obtaining any grants; they speak the Irish language because it is the natural mode for them from an cliabháin. We do not want the Gaeltacht to disappear and that requires that the people of the Gaeltacht should find it economically possible not only to maintain themselves there but to increase. At column 483 of the Official Report, Senator Hayes said:</P>
    <P>That is to say you require to achieve economic improvement but economic improvement which will not injure the position of the Irish language.  As I said at column 612 of the Official Report for the 4th March, 1954:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The problem is how can we preserve Irish-speaking communities in their present situation,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and not as migrants. </P>
    <P>The argument then for the setting up of the Ministry was that a Government Minister sitting among his colleagues could influence the Government and the various Ministries and could influence this House and the people to use their efforts to co-ordinate the various arms of the State for the welfare of the Gaeltacht and could initiate schemes which he considered wise in the interests of the Gaeltacht and of its people.  It was for that reason that a Ministry was preferred to a board.</P>
    <P>Now the Ministry is so many years old.  It is still young, of course, but having regard to the high hopes that were held out for it, looking at it at this stage, can we say that the results are inspired?  Reference has been made already to the dwindling population of the Gaeltacht.  It is not implied <Col N="911" /> that any Ministry can keep people in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>A Deputy has referred to the economics of the situation for the people concerned.  The difficulties are recognised by the Minister, the House and the country, but is sufficient effort being made to overcome these difficulties? That is the kernel of the situation. It is fundamental that there must be favoured persons treatment for the people of the Gaeltacht.  I suggest that that is not sufficient, that there should be favoured persons treatment for those in the Gaeltacht and the BreachGhaeltacht. It should not be confined to the Gaeltacht.  Such treatment should be available to people in the Breach-Ghaeltacht who speak the Irish language, because it is from that point that the spread of the language must be encouraged so that eventually there may be a linking up of Gaeltacht and Breach-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>If the Gaeltacht dries up, the effort is in vain.  The work of the teachers and pupils will go for nothing.  The preference which is available for Irish in regard to positions will become illusory if the Gaeltacht shrinks and the number of Irish-speakers in the Gaeltacht diminishes year by year.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that migration is the solution for this problem.  I mentioned this matter here in previous years in regard to the policy of the Land Commission.  I would suggest to the Minister, who has a dual capacity at the present time, that the Gaeltacht ought to grow outward and that it is not serving the interests of the Gaeltacht to bring families out of the Gaeltacht and transfer them as entities to other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>When the Sasanach was planted here at the time of the Statutes of Kilkenny, he was absorbed into the culture of the neighbourhood about him and became, as the Statutes of Kilkenny were designed to achieve, more Irish than the Irish themselves. Is the Minister satisfied that the families from the Gaeltacht who have been taken principally from the western seaboard and have been settled elsewhere have remained chomh Gaolach is a bhíodar?  Or is their <Col N="912" /> culture and their language being absorbed into the surrounding countryside? Is it making its impact on the habits that prevail in these areas to which these people have been migrated?</P>
    <P>Why is it that we cannot devise a policy whereby, if we want to move these people and provide them with an economic holding&mdash;in these areas in the west an economic holding would constitute a much larger tract of land &mdash;we could not move people from, say, east Galway, people who are perhaps themselves at this stage English-speaking, thereby making land available immediately contiguous to the Gaeltacht and, in that way, allowing the Gaeltacht to expand from within itself into these adjacent areas? It seems to me that that would be a policy which might&mdash;I do not say it would&mdash;produce better results than have been produced by taking these people and transferring them away from their natural contact with their neighbours.  It is by contact with neighbours that the Gaeltacht lives and thrives.  Anybody who has been to the Gaeltacht knows that the Gaeltacht survives in the scoraíochtha, rinncí and tigheas, the moving about the home country, family meetings and people moving in and out freely in the homes of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>That is the ground on which the language, and all that it means, can best be preserved as the medium of communication between the people and the families in the Gaeltacht.  In that way one keeps the people, too, in their natural environment, with their ordinary commercial undertakings, be they agricultural or industrial.  That is the way in which you keep them in contact with their neighbours, with those with whom they grew up.  Instead of portions of the Gaeltacht being, as it were, picked up and transplanted elsewhere in the hope that it will thereby grow and thrive, you keep the Gaeltacht together as a homogeneous whole, giving it a chance to live, and to maintain its contacts with its other roots.</P>
    <P>The economic development of the Gaeltacht is not, in my opinion, a question of spending more money. Spending more money might seem to <Col N="913" /> some people an admirable way of doing things; it may seem to be the proper thing to do but, to my mind, it is not a question of spending more money but rather a question of spending the money wisely and spending it on a properly planned basis.  Connemara is at the moment the strongest and largest Gaeltacht in the country. The Minister ought to take that area and, for a start, see what can be done in it.  He should concentrate on that area to see if, on his own initiative and with the ideas of others, he may not be able to formulate a policy which will enable that Gaeltacht to grow and expand.  If the Minister succeeds in enlarging the Gaeltacht in Connemara, then the remedy successfully applied there can be equally successfully applied in other Gaeltachta because it will have proved itself.  There is a road policy in regard to the Gaeltacht. There is a policy for developing strands and building chalets, for providing fishing gear, and so on.</P>
    <P>How is this policy getting on in Connemara?  Do those who formulated it believe it has succeeded in doing what it was hoped it would do, not alone in relation to the economic life of the Gaeltacht but also in relation to the actual enlargement of the Gaeltacht, to the preservation, utilisation and the spread of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht itself because the people there were made economically better off by this policy of the Government in providing help for them?</P>
    <P>The Minister, when he comes to reply, might tell us what progress has been made.  I am sure he will not take it amiss if I ask him at this stage if he has any plan of his own for the Gaeltacht.  Or is he waiting to administer and implement the ideas that come to him from the officials of his Department and from various people who make suggestions?  I am sure the Minister has received suggestions.  Are these suggestions considered with the care and attention that ought to be given to them to see whether they might be adopted, in whole or in part, and used for the benefit both of the people and of the language in the Gaeltacht?</P>
    <P>What is least desired in the Gaeltacht <Col N="914" /> is a hand-to-mouth existence.  If we merely look at the Gaeltacht as something to which this House is merely committed at this time and leave it to somebody else to deal with it at some other time, then we are stultifying policy completely insofar as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  The people in these areas would prefer to live in the Gaeltacht, to live there their own natural lives, as their people lived them before them, but feeling that they can do so economically.  Now, when I say economically, I do not mean in a saving fashion; I mean it would be just as well for them to live in that area rather than leave the area to find a living elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is something inconsistent in life if a person finds that remaining in the Gaeltacht and speaking the Irish language means he must wear the badge of poverty.  There is something inconsistent in life if the people of the Gaeltacht feel that it is just a matter of the Government of the day, or a particular Minister, giving them handouts to enable them to survive from month to month, from year to year, or from gloom to gloom.  If that is our approach to the Gaeltacht, and to the salvation of the Gaeltacht, then I suggest to the Minister that we lack a proper, coherent policy.  No matter how many glasshouses we provide, no matter how many fishing boats we provide, if the people who live there do not feel their lives can be as fully, as well and as economically lived as they could be elsewhere, then the tendency will be for the youth growing up there to look afar.</P>
    <P>We all know that faraway cows have long horns, but it is not always healthy for these youths from the Gaeltacht to plant themselves elsewhere. They may, perhaps, find themselves earning more money than they could earn in the Gaeltacht, but that should not be the yardstick.  Indeed, I hope it would not be the yardstick of what life for them means.  I know a good deal of hard thinking is needed in regard to the Gaeltacht.  This is not a matter that can be postponed forever. Sadly, we have to admit that the census figures show, as previous census figures have shown, go bhfuil <Col N="915" /> líon na Gaeltachta ag dul i laghad in ionad bheith ag dul i méid.</P>

      <P>I regret it is necessary for me to delay the House in raising this question this evening, but the Minister acting for the Minister for Health in the course of his replies to my questions in the Dáil to-day gave me no alternative.  In my question, I asked the Minister for Health his reasons for precluding the appointment of a permanent doctor to Schull dispensary district and hospital and also to the neighbouring dispensary district of Goleen.</P>
      <P>Schull medical officership is vacant some two and a half years and Goleen for a somewhat lesser period.  When these vacancies arose, the Health Authority in the ordinary way submitted both posts for permanent appointment, but it appears that the Department stepped in and issued an order that permanent appointments should not be made.  Consequently, this was the subject matter of the discussions at the meetings of the Cork Health Authority and its subsidiary body, the Western Health Committee of the Cork Health Authority.</P>
      <P>Surprise was expressed by the members at the delay in making the permanent appointments.  As a result, after waiting for some 21 months in the case of Schull, I addressed a question to the Minister for Health, on 10th April last, relative to the post of medical officer in Schull hospital.  I asked him the reasons for the delay in making the appointment and at what date it was proposed to make the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not answer that question directly, but stated in the course of the answer he gave, that the post was filled in a temporary capacity for the period mentioned and that the future organisation of medical services in this area had been under consideration. He was not yet in a position to <Col N="916" /> state when a decision would be arrived at.  He emphasised that the people of the district were not being deprived of a satisfactory temporary service.</P>
    <P>He went on to state in the course of replies to supplementaries that Schull and its neighbouring district of Goleen appeared to be exceedingly small for each to carry a separate dispensary district and that he would make a decision when proposals were submitted to him, which proposals were to be submitted in the near future. That was his reply on 10th April, 1962.</P>
    <P>I inquired at the next meeting of the Cork Health Authority whether that authority or any of its officers had been asked to submit proposals to the Minister relative to the Schull dispensary district and Schull hospital in regard to the appointment of a doctor.  The Health Authority knew nothing about it and neither do they know anything about these proposals to the present day.</P>
    <P>I do not want to generate any heat on this matter even though there is very strong feeling in the Mizen Head Peninsula as a result of the Department's action.  I am hopeful that, when the Minister is conversant with the position as it obtains in the Schull area, he will take appropriate action and give his approval forthwith to both appointments.</P>
    <P>I could ask at this stage from whom is the Minister getting the proposals.  It is not from the Health Authority officers.  So they informed me and so they informed the Health Authority. It is not from the elected representatives of the people.  Who are making the proposals for these appointments to the Minister?  It must be some people either in the Custom House or in the Department of Health.  If that is so, I assume, and reasonably so, that they are not conversant with the geographical layout of the two dispensary districts in question.</P>
    <P>They embrace the greater portion of the Mizen Head Peninsula and both dispensary districts are some 27 miles in length from one extreme to the <Col N="917" /> other.  Both districts embrace the town of Schull, as well as Ballydehob, Goleen and Crookhaven, together with the hospital in Schull.  Is it seriously suggested by the Minister or by his agents in the Department of Health that one doctor could cater for that widespread area?  I say there is no justification for that assertion, an assertion which comes at a time when we are supposed to be improving the health services.  The emphasis is on the improvement of the health services and the provision of better medical services, particularly in the more remote areas.</P>
    <P>What of the efficient temporary service the Minister speaks of?  I live in the town of Schull which is in the centre of this area and to the present day we have one doctor covering both areas as well as catering for the local hospital.  He lives, as I mentioned at Question Time today, more than a mile to the west of Goleen village which, as the House knows, is not too far removed from the extreme end of the peninsula.  The patients further away from him are more than 17 miles &mdash;probably closer to 20 miles&mdash;from his residence.  He has no phone in the house.  He is only a temporary man and he has taken up lodgings with a local person.  If anyone in Schull, Ballydehob or Crookhaven or in any of these areas comprising both dispensary districts were to fall ill, what would his position be?  Whether he is a medical card holder or otherwise, he would have to get a car if he wanted to avail of the local doctor's services or the services of the doctor catering for both places and travel that long journey.</P>
    <P>Is that a satisfactory temporary service? What of the alternative?  The alternative is that outside doctors have been brought in when they are available. Recently, I understand that it is exceptionally difficult to get them. Naturally, the charge is much higher than the local doctor would charge, by virtue of the distance they have to travel to their patients.</P>
    <P>Taking it on average, the charge of the outside doctors for attending a person, say, in Ballydehob or Schull today would be at least twice more than the <Col N="918" /> normal charge.  The people of both areas are not in very affluent circumstances. This is a matter that interests all the people, irrespective of whether they are in the lower income group or medical card holders and entitled to free dispensary services or whether they are in the middle income group.  They have to bring along their doctor in most instances from outside places and even the medical card holders have to pay.</P>
    <P>Temporary appointments are not deemed by anybody, and should not be deemed by any State bodies, to be satisfactory.  We have had a succession of doctors, naturally, since the permanent post became vacant.  As I mentioned earlier today, some of the doctors have outside districts and are catering for either Schull or Goleen, in addition to their own.  It actually happens that the Goleen doctor is catering for both districts.</P>
    <P>The service is most unsatisfactory. The people are crying out against it. As the local representative, I have been asked to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Health as forcibly as I possibly can, bearing in mind that the Cork Health Authority has nothing at all to do with this question.  I am acceding to the wishes of the people in bringing this matter to the notice of the Minister here this afternoon and in delaying you, Sir, and the other members and the officials of the House to do so.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, I regret that it is necessary for me to bring up this question on the Adjournment but I think it is of sufficient importance to do so in view of the unsatisfactory statements made by the Minister replying for the Minister for Health today.  I am putting the question now to the Minister for Health, whether he is satisfied, as his answers imply, that one doctor can adequately cater for a reasonably populous area, 27 miles in length, embracing the greater portion of the Mizen Head Peninsula.  Is the Minister satisfied that the health services provided in the Mizen Head Peninsula and in both dispensary districts are at present satisfactory?  Is he satisfied that they are what the people are paying <Col N="919" /> for by way of rates and taxation? Surely no sane person&mdash;not to mind our friend, the Minister&mdash;could make such an assertion.  I hope that, now that the Minister is conversant with the position, the need will not arise to bring this matter to his notice again. I hope appropriate action will be taken and that his immediate sanction will be forthcoming to fill the vacant post in Schull and also the vacant post in Goleen.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, then, I urge the Minister not to leave this district without services which the people living there have enjoyed for years and years.  I believe both dispensary districts have been in existence for more than 100 years.  I would further ask the Minister to take into account the fact that, in the summer, we have a big influx of tourists to the area.  Having regard to all the factors&mdash;the population, the geographical layout of both areas&mdash;I think there is no justification for the Minister's implication that they should be amalgamated.  I am asking him to heed the representations made to him and to sanction both appointments forthwith.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy M. P. Murphy said that temporary appointments should be avoided, where possible.  However, sometimes temporary appointments are unavoidable for a number of reasons.  Sometimes the size of the district would not justify the making of a temporary appointment if any scheme of re-organisation were considered.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to Goleen and Schull, very briefly, is that there were permanent whole-time officers in both of these dispensary districts&mdash;in the case of Schull until June, 1960, and in the case of Goleen, until February, 1961.  Therefore, if Deputy M. P. Murphy has conveyed the impression&mdash;which I do not think he intended to do&mdash;that, for prolonged periods these districts have been without any sort of medical service whatever, I think that impression should now be dissipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, it is not correct, either&mdash;<Col N="920" /> it would be wrong for any Deputy to believe&mdash;that both these districts have not been served by dispensary doctors carrying on on a temporary basis for any prolonged period.</P>
    <P>It does happen that the temporary officer appointed to the Goleen dispensary district happens to be acting, at this particular moment, for both districts.  There is nothing uncommon in that.  It happens everywhere throughout the country when a vacancy occurs in a dispensary district of that kind.  Pending the filling of the vacancy, either on a temporary or a permanent basis, the immediate dispensary doctor is asked to carry on for a short time.</P>
    <P>It does happen that, on 1st November of this year, that is, nine days ago, the doctor who had been acting on a temporary basis in Schull left the appointment.  Therefore, it is quite true that, for the period from 1st November until today, the doctor in Goleen has been carrying on both dispensary districts.  But, as I have said, that is not uncommon.  It is an ordinary vicissitude of organising the service on the basis of prescribed districts.  That position will change.</P>
    <P>When Deputy M. P. Murphy returns to his constituency this evening and moves out tommorrow, I think he will find that a doctor is appointed to the Schull district.</P>

      <P>On a temporary basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on a temporary basis; that is quite true.  But, after all, if a doctor is a responsible medical man&mdash;and, as far as we know, they all are&mdash;he will give just as good service in a temporary capacity as in a permanent capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that unsatisfactory from the point of view of a patient who is attending a doctor and who finds he has left and who must then go to another man who comes in and who is changed&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess it is not the sort of thing I should like to happen, but in the circumstances it is unavoidable because here is the basic <Col N="921" /> circumstance in relation to these districts: in Goleen, there are 214 card holders.  There is a similar number in Schull.  In Goleen, the number of eligible persons is 489; in Schull, it is 489.  Between them, they would not make half the number in a normal dispensary district.  In fact, the position, regrettably, in the Mizen Head Peninsula is that there are four dispensary districts which have not a work-load which a dispensary doctor would carry in a normal district.</P>
      <P>I do not say that should be the sole criterion used when determining whether there should or not be a dispensary district, but it should be a factor.  It is the duty of the Minister to have these services administered in the most economic manner possible, having regard to the humanitarian considerations involved.  Since the doctor who held the Schull dispensary district died in June, 1960, we have had the problem of finding some way of reorganising the district so as to give a reasonable service at the most economic cost possible.  It has not been easy and we have not found a solution so far, but surely in those circumstances, we are bound, if we can, to provide a service of a temporary nature that will not involve us or the Health Authority in a long-term commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, with the exception of the one period, there has not been a prolonged vacancy on a temporary basis in either of these districts. It happened in February, 1962, that the doctor died and there was a period of five weeks before another doctor was found to take up the position, but that is the longest period during which the service was interrupted. There was some inconvenience undoubtedly&mdash;great, perhaps, in some cases&mdash;to medical card holders while the people of Goleen were served from Schull.  In the situation which existed from the first of this month until tonight, there has not been a moment in which there has not been a doctor in <Col N="922" /> each of these districts.  The appointment has been held on a temporary basis but, mind you, there are people who go down to a district of that kind on a temporary basis and who decide to stay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not been our experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is even difficult to get permanent appointees to stay sometimes.  As I have said, there are in that peninsula three or four dispensary districts, which, if all the eligible persons in them were put together, would not make a work-load for the normal dispensary district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

      <P>What about the hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not talk about the hospital.  We know the hospital has 17 beds.  Most of them are occupied, not by acute cases as the Deputy knows very well.  I have not the latest figures, but the excuse for keeping it open in 1961 was that it could be used as a maternity hospital. The number of deliveries there in 1959 was 11 and, in 1960, it was four.  The remainder of the beds are occupied by elderly people so that it is more a county home than a hospital. A big difficulty is the provision of adequate nursing care.  It, therefore, does not represent any great demand on the doctor's time.  My officials have the responsibility of trying to reorganise the dispensary districts in the light of the fact that the general location of the population is changing very rapidly and that we have to try to economise where we can.  Otherwise, the first people who would cry out against the cost of maintaining unnecessary doctors and institutions are the ratepayers and the health authorities.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 13th November, 1962.</P>
