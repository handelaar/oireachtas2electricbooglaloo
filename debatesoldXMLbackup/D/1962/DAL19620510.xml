    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention this morning to the question of the fluoridation of water supplies.  I have no intention of going back over the discussion which took place here when the Bill was being piloted through the House, the Bill which eventually passed into law.  Within the last seven or eight months notification was sent from the Minister's Department to the Cork health authority in relation to this matter.  A request was made for an examination of piped water supplies in connection with schools in certain areas within the jurisdiction of the health authority.  I fail to understand &mdash;I made this clear at a subsequent meeting of the Cork health authority &mdash;why, if the Minister and his Department wish to get a clear overall picture of the problem in connection with water supplies, a few isolated areas were selected in a large county like Cork for an examination of the water supplies in those areas, and only in those areas.  If, as the Minister has told us, there is a grave problem in relation to tooth decay in children due to lack of fluoridation of water supplies&mdash;lack of fluoridation has been given as being the cause largely of early tooth decay&mdash; why should the Minister suggest that an examination of the piped water supplies should be carried out in only a few areas in a vast county like Cork? I cannot understand this approach. If we are to get a clear overall picture, surely it is essential that all piped water supplies should be examined thoroughly.  If that is not done we will be entitled to say that the Minister is not showing us a true picture of the position and we will also be entitled to say that we are not satisfied that the Minister is adopting a proper method in relation to the problem of decay in school children's teeth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to say a few brief words on the problem of mentally deficient children.  Many members have already referred to it.  It is a very big problem. Are we, I wonder, getting anywhere near solving it?  We know various religious orders are doing wonderful work, but they can only do a certain amount.  They cannot take over the whole problem.  They have not got the requisite staff.  It is <Col N="615" /> vitally important that we should try to improve conditions so that the parents of children who have to be kept at home will be able to send them to suitable institutions for training and care.  Mothers of children write to public representatives asking if anything can be done.  At the moment there is not much that can be done. We will have to make a really vital effort to speed up the work of improving the lot of these children.  Unless we do so, neither they nor the parents will have any real satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the provision of accommodation and suitable staffs for the care and training of these children&mdash;a very wonderful work, indeed&mdash;would entail certain expenditure, and the question of finance must be considered.  I agree there, but may I make one suggestion to the Minister?  In my opinion, there is one source from which the Minister should be able to get more money. I believe that the money is available and should have been taken long before now.  I believe that we should get more money from the sweepstakes. A time was when a certain percentage was allowed for expenses but that percentage is outdated now and the Minister should be in a position to have the expenses for the running of these sweepstakes reduced so that more money can be transferred to where it would be of the greatest benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned, in connection with hospitalisation and X-ray treatment, that it is vitally important that these charges be recovered by the local authorities and we know that increased charges have been made for X-rays over the past few years.  I shall not discuss that point now but I want to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that there is another section of the community which should be made to pay the full economic cost of X-rays. I am speaking of the insurance companies.  These people are getting away with the same payments for X-rays as unfortunate people who are ordered to have them because of accidents or otherwise.  Insurance companies often insist that a second X-ray <Col N="616" /> be taken if they are going to contest a claim and they pay only the same amount for that as the claimant.  They do not pay one brown farthing more for these X-rays than anyone else.  I believe that is wrong and that they should not have the right of availing of our health services to benefit themselves at the expense of the unfortunate workmen and the community in general.  I suggest to the Minister that he should examine this position.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies would appear to have a panel of doctors and specialists for all these cases.  It has struck me, on reading reports of these actions in the courts, that these specialists do not always seem to be specialists in the particular illness or affliction of the person concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health should have a word with the Minister for Industry and Commerce because there must be some liaison between the Departments of Health and Industry and Commerce in connection with these actions.</P>
      <P>What stage has been reached by the Select Committee on the Health Services who were set up by this House some time ago?  A decision to set up that Committee was taken by this House and on that occasion the Labour Party adopted a certain line of action.  The Minister made it clear that he hoped to have the report of the Committee within a certain specified time.  I am not suggesting that the Committee are doing nothing but I would like to know how far they have advanced with this problem. During this debate Deputies have been drawing attention to various aspects of the Health Act and the sooner we have the report of the Select Committee the sooner we will be able to know the Minister's views on it and any proposed line of action.  Then it is possible that there may be the same spirit of understanding between Fianna Fáil and Labour as there was in 1952 and we may be in a position to make whatever improvements are necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather startled when I heard Deputy Desmond mention the expenses of the sweepstakes. If we were to say anything that might be to the smallest detriment of the sweepstakes, we would be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.  The Irish people can look at the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes with pride.  It is due to the initiative and to the integrity of the promoters which is universally recognised, that we have such magnificent hospitals all over the country.  It is not so many years ago that the majority of Irish hospitals could be used for sets for the making of films like &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo;.  They were not hospitals at all; they were the remains of the poorhouses.  I only hope that Irish Hospitals Trust will continue to bring in more and more money.  They are good employers as well.  The people who are working there are well paid and have good conditions.</P>
      <P>I want to say a word about mentally handicapped children.  A group of people in my constituency set up an organisation three or four years ago and they are doing great work.  They have got some help from the Minister. I have been asked by these people to convey their thanks to the Minister publicly in this House.  They know the great difficulty of looking after these children.  It is a matter not of buildings but rather of personnel.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that the manner in which this matter must be faced is that staff must be trained to give these children the nursing, in the first place, and the education in the second place, that they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Select Committee on Health Services are sitting at present.  All Deputies are agreed and even the Minister knows that the interpretation of the Health Act by various county managers or by the assistance officers varies in different counties under different local authorities.  It would be some help if the committee inquiring into the health services summoned not only the county managers but also the assistance officers and assistance superintendents to come before them. That is the best way in which the committee could get a picture of how <Col N="618" /> the Act is being administered in various counties and how the administration could be made uniform.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde, spoke about lung cancer yesterday.  There is a scare that cigarette smoking is responsible for the increase in the incidence of this disease and the number of deaths due to it.</P>
    <P>Diesel lorries are allowed to go around the country pouring out black fumes.  Medical opinion says that the incidence of lung cancer can be increased by these fumes.  The matter should be dealt with more severely than it is.  I would ask the Minister to make representations to his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to see to it that the legislation is enforced so that lorries and buses will not be allowed to go along the streets and roads of Ireland pouring out black fumes.  The law says these machines. are to be kept in such a fashion that the exhaust from them will be less dangerous than the dirty black smoke.</P>
    <P>White cards seem to be a common bone of contention.  The solution of this problem is the policy propounded before the last election by Fine Gael, namely, that, through insurance, the people would be entitled to a proper health service.  I have no doubt that some Government in the future will have to make provision for such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I was asked to mention the recruitment of hospital staff.  The Water-ford Mental Hospital recruited some staff for the kitchen and the house-keeping departments.  Some of the staff who were brought in were magnificent but they could not be kept because they were not of the required height. That qualification should be revised, more especially as the resident medical superintendent of the hospital had to allow these girls to go with great regret because they were competent and the type he wanted.  It is very difficult to recruit girls for this service. Greater latitude should be given to the officers in charge of hospitals.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, Deputy Colley said the State is contributing more than the local authorities to the health services.  It is <Col N="619" /> contributing very little more than the local authorities but that was not the picture put to the local authorities by the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Dr. Ryan, when he was Minister for Health and when he met members of the local authorities in the City Hall, Cork.  I was one of the members of the delegation that met him that day.  We were under the impression that the Department of Health would take over the greater part of the expense of running the health services.</P>
    <P>The promise was made to us that day that the local authorities would not be called upon to pay more than 2/-in the £ for the new health services. That assurance was given and reiterated by the Minister and I have the clippings from the <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> in relation to the matter.  Some amends must be made to the local authorities of Ireland whose members were taken in on that occasion by the former Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not say I want to have the health services reduced.  The health services are necessary and the improvements in them were good. However, I do not consider it right to shift such a burden on to the shoulders of the local authorities.  When the Bill for the health services was first introduced by Deputy Dr. Ryan, the then Minister for Health, the local authorities of Ireland were guaranteed that the ratepayers would not have to pay more than 2/- in the £.  There is one other item to which I should like to call the Minister's attention.  It is a matter that is before his Department and is a question of a 90-hour fortnight for the nurses in this State.  I do not think that is unreasonable.  It represents a 45-hour week.  When we consider that a great many men and women in industry have succeeded in obtaining a 40-hour week, I think these girls, who have devoted themselves to the nursing service of Ireland, are entitled reasonably to demand a 45-hour week.  I am sure that when the Minister is considering this, he will remember&mdash;and all members of this <Col N="620" /> House will remember&mdash;that we have often been personally greatly indebted to these ladies for their devotion and care.  I would ask the Minister to consider this in a generous manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to endeavour to disabuse some of the Deputies' minds in connection with the 2/6d. increase.  I should like to remind Deputies that before the amalgamation of the items into the health authority, you had a home assistance estimate, a mental hospital estimate, a sanatorium estimate and portion of the housing and sanitary services estimate.  All these were rolled into one afterwards.  You had all those separate estimates which came up on the rates.  My friend, Deputy Lynch, spoke about a 45-hour week.  If you allow for the extra staff, the extra specialists and the increases in salary, you will find that the Minister for Finance was about right in the 2/6.  Those making the complaints should investigate, as I went to the trouble of doing in Cork, that end of the matter.  You now have five or six different estimates rolled into one and it looks very high.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to know when will the Department come to a decision in connection with the proposed Cork Regional Hospital.  I am anxious for more reasons than one.  People are very funny at times.  I do not know when some crazy body will come along again and decide to spend a few more thousand on a famous site which has already cost in the neighbourhood of £60,000.  We have it held up repeatedly by the Department.  We ought to get some definite decision on that and I suggest it is time we got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also been held up in regard to a decision to get rid of the old North Fever Hospital in Cork. Those two derelict institutions, which are now unoccupied, are costing a rather considerable amount between a caretaker, ground rent, water rent and electric light each year.  I went down two years ago and inspected Lota with the assistant county manager and I had a look at it the other day and I can assure the Minister that Lota has deteriorated in value during the past two years by at least 50 per cent. <Col N="621" /> Public money has been spent on these buildings when there is no further use for them, as thank God, there is not now.</P>
    <P>The definite step should be taken immediately to get rid of them and thus get rid of the burden on the ratepayers and taxpayers who have to pay for their upkeep.  There is no justification for having a derelict building lying idle for five, six, seven, eight and ten years.  The local authorities will not get authority to get rid of them, particularly when, in the case of Lota, they are paying £500 or £600 each year between ground rent, water rent, electric light and a caretaker.  There is no justification for it.  Those are matters in relation to which we could very definitely economise.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he review his decision in regard to dispensary grants.  As Chairman of the old South Cork Board of Public Assistance, I remember, together with Deputy Desmond, dealing with this matter.  At that time grants were given to the local authorities for the building of new dispensaries, where necessary, but the Department said they wanted a survey. They carried on the survey for a period of ten years, I think.  We wrote and we got an answer that they were going on the survey soon.  The survey was still being carried on but nothing was done until the time came when the Department decided they would not give any more grants.  The whole burden was to come on the local authorities.  Since that day they have no objection to having the survey carried on and having the ratepayers pay for something for which the Department, if they were doing their job, would have paid long ago.  The condition of some of the dispensaries in the Cork area is scandalous.</P>
    <P>Those are matters I want to have dealt with.  I suggest that the Minister send an order down to sell these buildings. It would be better to get rid of them for 2d. than have the ratepayers paying and then to be told, if you want to make any use of them afterwards, that the buildings have been inspected, like Youghal and Kinsale and they are completely unfit for use.  I suggest we save public money in that way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> There has been a very large increase in the incidence of cancer and I suggest it is not due to the consumption of cigarettes and tobacco.  Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers smoked and in their time there was not onetenth as much cancer as there is now. I suggest that the medical profession turn their eyes in other directions to find the cause of this increase in lung cancer, that they examine our flour and our bread and the manner in which our wheat is now being mixed up and generally treated in the mills.  I submit it is not at all a healthy product when it comes out of the mills.  I am anxiously awaiting the report of the Select Committee on Health Services in this connection.</P>
    <P>No legislation passed by this House escapes the need for overhaul after a couple of years.  The Health Act is no different.  I should know because I took a keen interest in the operation of the Act as a member of a health authority. There are many changes I should like to see brought about in the operation of that Act and I hope to be able to deal fully with these matters when the report of the Select Committee comes before the House.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Health motion of a few weeks ago provoked a very full debate in the House has changed the trend which the debate on this Estimate normally takes.  Like some of the previous speakers, I am anxious to know what the Select Committee are doing, if they are doing anything, or whether we can hope to have their report by November as we were given to understand.  The idea voiced by Deputy Corry that legislation needs overhaul after a few years is, in many cases, quite sound.  In this case, I feel that the overhaul which the Select Committee can give the Health Act will greatly improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> Let me say that we in the Labour benches, as well as all other Deputies and the people outside, appreciate that the Minister for Health and his Department are as anxious to do the best they can for the people who need medical treatment as we are.  It is only fair to say that, because while they may not be doing, all we think they should be doing, we must in all honesty agree they are doing what they think is right and therefore we should give them all the assistance we can.  However, as they say down the country, they do it in a &ldquo;quare&rdquo; way sometimes and it is to some of those aspects that I should like to refer to-day.</P>
    <P>While admitting that we have the best intentions in the world, one of the things referred to by practically every Deputy during this debate was the system of mental treatment, particularly where mentally defective children are concerned.  I should like the Minister to correct me if I am wrong, but I think that a few years ago when a suggestion was made that there should be an overall effort to do something for mentally defective children, of whom there are far too many, the Minister said that buildings were not the problem, the real difficulty being the lack of trained personnel. He said it would be necessary to train people to look after these children and that the buildings&mdash; hospitals no longer used for tuberculosis treatment&mdash;could be converted for use as institutions for mentally defective children.</P>
    <P>I am wondering how far the Minister has gone in having these people trained.  I am aware that some of the religious orders are doing a tremendous job, that some of them are overtaxed, in fact, that they are doing far more than anyone could expect them to do.  They are finding it very difficult to have to refuse to accept children whom they feel they could help but for whom they have no more accommodation.  For that reason, I am wondering when the State will be prepared to step up considerably the number of institutions for the treatment <Col N="624" /> of these children.  I do not want the Minister to say he has started on one.  That is not the answer.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this matter which I find very bad is the alarming practice of sending boys of tender years to general mental hospitals where they are housed with mentally deficient adults.  It is a shocking thing to see little lads running around with people who, if normal, would be bad enough, but who, when they are mentally defective themselves, lend a shocking atmosphere to the situation.</P>
    <P>I wonder also if there is not some kind of mix-up in some of our mental hospitals over the question of staffing. I refer particularly to a hospital which some time ago advertised for trainee psychiatrist nurses.  A number of girls replied, did an examination, were later notified they had passed and were called into the hospital.  The first thing they noticed was that they were not being given any lectures which they expected they would get in order to complete their training as specialists in mental treatment.  Then, at the end of the month, they got their salaries and with them a note saying they were being retained for a further month as temporary nursing attendants.  After a period of nine or ten months, they were let go one by one.  Is the Minister aware of that and if so, does he approve of it?  Does he think it is right that these girls, who went into that hospital with high ideals of specialising in a difficult form of treatment, should have been codded in that way?  They found at the end of a period that they were being retained as nothing more than temporary attendants.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch referred to the 90-hour fortnight for the nursing staffs of hospitals.  While that is in operation in some hospitals, I should like to put to the Minister a point of view which he has no doubt heard before, but which, I think, it will do no harm to repeat.  While the nursing staffs of hospitals, who are required to work on Sundays, church and bank holidays without any compensatory leave, should be entitled to the best possible treatment, I suggest it should not stop with the nurses.  The girls who are <Col N="625" /> employed as attendants in those hospitals and who do just as much in the wards as those attending the patients, as well as others who do other work in the hospitals, should also be considered. They should be treated in the same way as the nursing staffs and not as a different race altogether, as if they belonged to a completely menial race employed only to do the really dirty work and therefore not entitled to be treated in the same Christian way as the nurses are. Nurses are entitled to the best, but those people are entitled to the same treatment.  They also should get reduced working hours, time off and decent pay, the same as the other members of the staff.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Kyne said on the question of general medical treatment.  We in the Labour Party believe that it is not a question of the Health Act being a bad Act.  In our opinion the whole trouble is that the local administration of the Health Act is wrong.  Some local authorities administer it in a very humane way.  I am glad to say that in my constituency, Meath County Council are in many ways models so far as administration is concerned.  In other local authority areas things are occurring which were never intended under the Health Act. They are causing trouble and annoyance, and that is why the people are saying that the Health Act is bad.</P>
    <P>Most dispensary doctors are dedicated men and women and do their jobs very well.  They are available night and day any time they are needed, but there is the odd black sheep and he is the person who is causing all the trouble.  He is the dispensary doctor who says that he is only paid such a sum and that he must be called by the dispensary patient before 9 O'clock in the morning or he will not attend.  He says that the dispensary patient is not entitled to summon him by telephone but that he must call to the house, that he must go five, six or seven miles from his own house to the dispensary doctor's house to collect medicines if they are required.  Some dispensary patients get very short shrift from him.</P>
    <P>I suppose there are a few such <Col N="626" /> people in every county and they are no credit to themselves or to the medical profession, and they are very little use, certainly, in the administration of the Health Act.  They are very few but we all know one or two of them.  They are the people who are making the general public say that the Health Act is a cod.  When someone is ill he goes to the doctor at the dispensary and asks for treatment.  He gets an examination, which sometimes may be very cursory, and a prescription which he must take to the chemist.  In some cases that unfortunate person is not able to pay for the drugs and medicines on that prescription.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health should carry out an inspection or instruct the local authorities to carry out an inspection. There is the occasional doctor who is never at home or whose phone is always engaged and you cannot get through to him.  Local gossip says that he takes the phone off the hook at a certain hour but when the local authorities hear of those things there is always an excuse.  It is very important for the administration of the Health Act that the doctors who are, in fact, the public face of the Health Act should see to it that nothing is done to bring the Health Act into disrepute.</P>
    <P>There is the other thorny problem with which I hope the Minister will be able to deal at some time.  I have a solution to offer which the Minister may or may not be prepared to accept. It is the problem of the doctor who has had a row with a patient, or with a patient's father or some member of the family, 20 years ago and for that reason there is bad feeling.  We are all human and we can understand that sort of thing happening, but the result is either that the patient will not go to that doctor or if he does he feels the doctor will not give him the attention which would have been given if that row had never occurred.  The doctor may have attended some member of the family years ago and that person died, through no fault of the doctor, yet the feeling is there that the doctor was responsible even though he was in no way responsible and the patient would have died if the doctor had no connection with him or had <Col N="627" /> not attended him.  Yet there is a feeling that the patient would be better if he went to some other doctor.</P>
    <P>That is particularly true of areas where there are a couple of doctors living within five or six miles of the patient, and I think it is particularly true of the towns and possibly some of the cities.  Possibly the Select Committee will recommend something in that connection, but whether or not the Minister could find some way of giving a choice of doctor I do not know.  I recommend that something like that should be considered.  I suppose the ideal way would be if there could be, as there is in certain parts of England &mdash;indeed all over the place&mdash;a selection of doctors, and you can phone a certain number and get one of a number of doctors.</P>
    <P>The patients see no reason why there should not be an arrangement, particularly at the present time with modern transport, to bring someone a long distance in a car in a half an hour.  It should be possible to have at each hospital a doctor who will be available and on call particularly late at night. I know of cases where doctors were called late at night and one after the other they were found to be out attending patients.</P>
    <P>It is rather unfortunate that many people seem to require medical treatment late at night.  I am sure doctors find it very tough when they have to go out night after night on these cases.  I agree with some doctors who say that those who require medical treatment should, if they feel they should call a doctor, do so at a reasonable time, but there is always the emergency case, the person who feels perfectly well going to bed but during the night requires medical treatment. It is very annoying to try doctor after doctor and find they are not available. Perhaps an arrangement could be made to have some kind of depot where doctors could be found or some other arrangement for making contact with them.  That is a suggestion.  I do not know whether or not it would be workable.  The Minister will be far more aware of what it would mean than I.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> My Party and I believe that there is one change which must be made in the Health Act, that is, in connection with the right of the insured person to treatment free of charge.  We speak for the organised workers when we say they are prepared to pay the necessary small charge on their insurance stamps for the purpose of getting that free treatment.  They are aware of what their insurance covers but they are also aware that we are getting back to the system which we thought was killed when the Health Act was introduced, that is, that the insured person who should be able to demand treatment by right must go with his cap in his hand looking for treatment as if it were charity.</P>
    <P>The one thing the workers of this country, or any other country, do not want is to have it said that they are looking for charity.  When a bread-winner, particularly, is ill he feels he should be able to get treatment by right.  I am aware that while the person who does not hold a medical card is not entitled to claim free domiciliary treatment he can claim it if he gets a ticket from the local warden, if he is ill, but again, does not that bring us right back to the old red ticket&mdash;I know it is no longer red?  It is a question of having to go and ask somebody for treatment if in the opinion of the warden they are entitled to free treatment.  That should be done away with completely. The system that will work is the system under which the insured person is entitled by right to free treatment.</P>
    <P>Following that, there is the question of the choice of hospital.  Under the present Act, the insured worker has a wide choice of hospital on payment of 10/- a day.  I also know that in certain circumstances the 10/- a day can be wiped out.  The important thing about the Health Act, as far as hospital treatment is concerned, is that the best treatment the patient can get should come first and not the convenience of the local authority.  The whole thing hinges around that.  The service to the people is what counts.</P>
    <P>If the Health Act can be amended, people who are living in close <Col N="629" /> proximity to a town, and can receive treatment in a good hospital in the town, should not be asked to go 30, 40 or 50 miles away from their friends and relatives, possibly when there is no bus or train service, to a town where there is the local authority hospital.  It is happening all over the country and it is wrong.  I know that Meath County Council have been very decent about this and in most cases where a dispensary doctor recommends that a patient should be sent to a certain hospital, they have been quite fair about it.  It is the ideal way to administer the Act but there are exceptions and those exceptions are the ones which cause all the trouble.</P>
    <P>We have also the problem of old folks' homes.  The old workhouses have been converted into homes for the old people and again let me say that the one in Meath is a credit to the local authority.  We feel, however, that there is something not just right happening in those homes, that is, that by some peculiar twist which I cannot unravel&mdash;perhaps the Minister would unravel it for me&mdash;a patient who is a chronic invalid and is in hospital or in his own home receiving treatment and is sent off to the old folks' home, not for shelter but for further treatment, if he is in receipt of an old age pension, either contributory or non-contributory, there is a very substantial deduction made by the authorities for that person's treatment.  In most cases, the people are holders of a medical card.</P>
    <P>It would appear that that deduction is entirely wrong.  Recently I discovered two cases where a similar thing happened.  The patients were sent temporarily to a mental hospital. They left families behind them who were depending on the pension they were getting.  They were holders of medical cards and in each case a deduction of three shillings a day was made.  It may not be very much but when the income is small and somebody is depending on it, it can be quite a lot if the deduction is made from the old age pension, or from a road worker's pension, as it is called.</P>
    <P>Those are things that should be straightened out.  I tried to get them straightened out at local level without <Col N="630" /> much success.  They can be straightened out by the Minister.  There should be uniformity, a person being either entitled to all types of treatment free or not.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is causing a lot of bother, and which has been referred to by practically everyone who spoke, is the question of dental, aural and ophthalmic treatment for adults.  We know where a youngster is going to school and where during the school examination a need for treatment is discovered, the treatment can be given free without difficulty.  In most cases, if the treatment is found necessary on examination at dispensary level, the same thing applies, irrespective of the parents' income or whether the family possess a blue card.</P>
    <P>However, the question of this treatment for adults is not what it should be.  I do not agree with the Dental Association or the Minister that the accent should be entirely on the child, particularly in the matter of dental treatment.  There is little use saying that children of some poor man should have their teeth treated and given first-class attention so that they will grow up with their teeth in good shape, while the mother has very bad teeth and as a result falls into illhealth. I know of cases where the father has had to stay at home to mind the children because the council were not in a position to give the woman the dental treatment she required. A similar situation exists in regard to the small farmer who has bad teeth and finds his children getting the treatment they require.  Even if there is a limited scheme, as there is in some places, including County Meath, we find people waiting two to two and a half years for dental treatment.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the parents should be completely ignored.  It is not a good idea and I would ask the Minister to have a good look at it because I believe something can be done to change it.  I know that the local authorities have been putting up the case that dentists are hard to get. That is rather surprising, in view of the output of young dentists from the <Col N="631" /> universities.  Again, the Association appear to say that because of the rates of pay in this country dentists go to England where they will be paid for the job they are doing, but that the recent increases given may make a change.  If that is correct, and if it is a fact that young dentists are leaving the country because they are not being offered the payment to which they think their profession entitles them, the Minister should try to make the necessary arrangements with the Association to see that the position is remedied as soon as possible.  There is very little use spending money to educate such people and then export them immediately when we have a greater need for them here.  There are several other matters to which I should like to refer but they have been very fully debated and I know that the Select Committee will be dealing with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the complaint made by Deputy Tully about the dispensary services, there is a good deal to be said for getting rid of the dispensary services altogether and allowing people to have their own doctors.  That would be practicable over a very wide part of the country and ultimately over all the country, although it may take some time to realise such an objective in the more remote parts of the country.  Quite apart from the representations made today by Deputy Corry and Deputy Tully in regard to the state of dispensary premises, it seems in principle a desirable thing, if people are sick and are obliged to enter into the intimate relationship a sick person must have with his medical advisers, that they should be free to choose their own doctor.  If that objective is capable of realisation, it would be the best solution of this whole dispensary problem. It is capable of realisation forthwith in places like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and the other cities where a number of doctors normally reside.  It is immediately realisable in a surprisingly large number of country districts where there are already one or two additional doctors in private practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it need necessarily disrupt present arrangements, because <Col N="632" /> a scheme could be worked out whereby the change would be made gradually as dispensaries became vacant.  In that way, without interfering with any existing rights of dispensary doctors already in occupation of appointments with the local authorities, we would gradually make the changeover.  That would be of great advantage to patients and to the general administration.</P>
    <P>The blue card is a pest, and we ought to try to get rid of it.  It could have been got rid of, and it still can be got rid of, if we introduce the insurance principle into the health scheme. The Minister for Health adumbrated this rather strange theory: that before he introduces his Government's proposals to formulate a health scheme, he wants Dáil Éireann to help him to formulate it.  I know of no precedent for that procedure.  He is going to have a Committee of the House to formulate policy.  I hope, when that time comes, proposals will be made before that Committee and adopted by it which will enable us to do two things.  One is to get rid of the blue card system and the other is to relieve the rates of the burden of the health charges altogether.</P>
    <P>Many people would have said that was financially impossible.  I believe the provision made in the current Budget for the relief of rates would have been sufficient to finance the necessary State contribution to enable the charges for health services to be taken off rates.  That would have resulted in the ratepayers getting a guarantee that not only would their rates be brought back to the 1956 level but, having been brought back to that level, that they would not immediately proceed to climb sky-high again.  It would also have the advantage that the rates relief provided would have benefited not only farmers living on the land but the small shopkeepers and businessmen in the towns and villages of rural Ireland, who are very hard put to meet the growing burden of charges that the local rates impose on them.  Think of a small shopkeeper in County Mayo with rates of, I think, something like 55/- in the £ at present.  That is a <Col N="633" /> desperate burden for such people to have to carry.  We have increased their sense of grievance by granting a rates concession of 25 per cent. to farmers with 1,000 acres of land and valuations of £700 or £800, while a small businessman paying 55/- in the £ rates is given no relief at all.  If, instead of doing that, we had taken the health charges off the rates, then we could have said to all who contribute to the rates, whether they live in town or country, that they all were getting a corresponding reduction in the burden they have to carry.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Health certain specific questions.  How long should a county hospital be left without a surgeon?  We must all have sympathy with public officials who are ill or who, for some reason or another, are prevented from discharging the duties of their office, but we ought to have regard to the circumstances of the people whom the hospital is designed to serve.  We all know that if a county surgeon is not available, it is customary that a neighbouring county surgeon or even two neighbouring county surgeons are asked to stand in and lend a hand.  For a short period that system will work.  But when it runs into a couple of months, two evils arise, which I consider are serious. One is that the people get extremely uneasy about seeing their relatives or members of their families sent to a hospital where they apprehend there is no administrative head.</P>
    <P>Another thing which is a great evil is that local medical practitioners, in the knowledge that there is no county surgeon, start sending their patients to Dublin.  Then we, the Deputies for these constituencies, begin to get the bills which the patients cannot pay. We are in the dilemma that the Dublin hospital may have received 10/- a day from the local authority, but is faced with the problem of collecting £20, £40 or £60 from a man who the Deputy knows is a road worker and cannot pay it.  Yet it is a hard thing to ask the Dublin hospital to forgo what it has spent.  You cannot get the local authority to pay for it and you cannot help having a certain sympathy with the medical practitioner who sent <Col N="634" /> the patient to Dublin because he knew there was no county surgeon in the hospital.  That is a matter to which I should like the Minister to apply his mind.  I do not underestimate the difficulty involved, but it is a difficulty that ought to be faced, because it can become a very serious problem if it is allowed to continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The next question I should like to ask is: how long does it take to fill a dispensary vacancy?  When a dispensary doctor resigns, in my experience it takes anything from nine to fifteen months to get a new dispensary appointment through the Local Appointments Commission.  Does anybody advert to the fact that during those nine or 15 months the dispensary residence is standing empty?  Most of us know what effect it has on a house to stand empty for 12 months in our climate.  By the time the new doctor goes in, he does so at the peril of his life and that of his family, because the house is damp and cold and if the roof has started leaking at any stage of its vacancy, very material damage may be done to the whole structure.</P>
    <P>There ought to be some system whereby the business of publishing the appropriate advertisement and filling these vacancies could be expedited. I am certain it could be done if responsible Ministers would bring sufficient pressure to bear on the Appointments Commissioners to act more promptly than they do.  I had some experience myself of the Civil Service Commissioners.  I remember trying to have appointed years ago an assistant librarian in the Department of Agriculture.  When the matter had been hanging fire 18 months, for reasons which I was wholly unable to understand, I said I would get the authority of the Government to override the whole business and to appoint him myself, unless steps were taken to expedite the matter.  I think the examination was then held and the appointment made within six weeks.</P>
    <P>There is some mystery about the delays involved in the filling of these vacancies.  Quite apart from the inconvenience caused in the locality, I put it to the Minister that the damage <Col N="635" /> that can be done to the dispensary residence, through standing vacant for these long periods, is a matter deserving of close attention and certainly a matter which would justify the Minister in urging on the Local Appointments Commissioners that greater expedition should be used in filling vacant posts of this kind.</P>
    <P>I am appalled at the thought of the Minister's plan for huge capital expenditure on county homes because if we commit huge capital sums to county homes, then the county homes are with us forever more.  I want to say with great deliberation that I detest the county home.  I admire and applaud the nuns who devote their lives to these institutions and in that context I should like to recall something Deputy Tully said.  He spoke of charity with something approximating to hatred.  He hated the thought of a working man having to accept charity.  I do not know why people speak of charity in that way.  I am very glad to accept charity from anybody who will give it to me and I frequently get it.  I have never been sick yet either in a nursing home or an institution where I was not the beneficiary of very great charity no money could buy.  Why one of the three virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity should come to be spoken of in our society as something disgusting and degrading for anybody to receive is a complete mystery.  Those who receive it and those who give it are ennobled by it.  I have no feeling against receiving charity and no other Christian person should.</P>
    <P>Charity is in abundance in the county home at the hands of those who run them but no amount of charity, no amount of benevolence or kindness, can compensate for removing old people from access to the place where they were born and the company of their neighbours.  No matter how good we make the county home structurally or administratively, when old people are no longer able to look after themselves, it is the final tragedy for them to be rooted out from surroundings to which they are accustomed and which constitute the only remaining consolation <Col N="636" /> they have and to be transferred 20 or 30 miles away from their homes into a county home where they know nobody.</P>
    <P>The county home is for these people a hospice for the dying.  They know that, having gone there, they will never come back and they have the additional intense distress of the knowledge that the room they occupy, perhaps the little house which was their own will probably be diverted to another purpose almost as if they had gone not to the county home but to the cemetery.  I want to put it to the Minister that to perpetuate that system in rural Ireland is wholly wrong.</P>
    <P>I often wonder where we are going at all.  It seems to me that a great many people in this country are concerned to tear up the whole social pattern of our society and, in the name of the Common Market or anything else you like to name, to announce that we have to tear down every institution that has been built up over the years, in the hope that something new from somewhere else will prove better than what we have.  I value the social pattern of rural Ireland and I believe it is a great mistake to do anything designed to shatter that fabric, unless we are absolutely certain we have something better to substitute.  I do not believe we have anything to give our old neighbours that would be an adequate substitute for their own homes.</P>
    <P>Where circumstances make it impossible for these people to look after themselves, through illness or advancing years, the next best thing is to provide that they will be looked after in close proximity to their neighbours and to their familiar surroundings. That can be done in either of two ways: one way is the substitution of parish homes for county homes, and I do not believe it would cost much more; the alternative would be an adequate system of dispensary nurses on the same lines as the Jubilee nurses with whom we are all familiar.  I understand that if such a service is working, it is very often possible to keep old people comfortable either in the homes of their relatives or even in their own limited accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> If a system of dispensary nurses is not immediately available, however, I should much prefer to see the old system, which used to be described as &ldquo;charities,&rdquo; in which you had a group of houses attached to each parish, wherein old people could be accommodated, with a lady superintendent to help in administering it.  In such groups, the atmosphere of the individual home could be preserved and, not only that, but a great many old people in such an atmosphere can make a very material contribution to the job of looking after other old people, if the place is properly run. I earnestly hope that, before we become irrevocably committed to heavy capital expenditure on county homes, further consideration will be given to the decentralisation of this service and to the making of it a unit of the parish rather than the county, so that we shall not continue to isolate our old people, as they have been isolated for many years, under the existing county home system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch spoke of the conditions for nurses and of certain improvements which they seek in their conditions.  It would be very desirable if these improvements were forthwith made available, not only in order that justice may be done but in order to avoid the emigration of the entire nursing service of this country.  We are faced with the fact that a fully trained nurse in the United States of America is today receiving approximately £60 a week, with very extensive benefits and, I think, a substantially shorter working week than that worked by nurses here.  The scale of salaries obtainable in England is not as high as it is in the United States, but it is a great deal higher than the salary which obtains here.</P>
    <P>As I say, even in order to retain the nursing services, I suggest something radical needs to be done to make conditions more attractive for girls who elect to enter the nursing service in Ireland.  It is quite astonishing the number of girls at present who elect to go to England in order to get <Col N="638" /> trained, astonishing until you discover the very material advantages they enjoy if they go to England to train rather than start their career here.  I hope, therefore, early and urgent attention will be given to this matter because it would be a catastrophic situation if the nursing services in our hospitals, particularly in those outside the city of Dublin, were to collapse for the want of nursing personnel, and that is not an impossible development.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose it is surprising, when you have a campaign like the anti-cigarette smoking campaign, that people almost close their minds to every other aspect of the problem of lung cancer.  I have for several years past directed the attention of the Minister for Health to the fact that there is strong evidence, which I notice Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde reinforced in his contribution to this debate, that diesel fumes contribute materially to the incidence of lung cancer.  I have invited the Minister to query the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, which conducted a survey 20 years ago and believed they had found a significant relationship between the incidence of lung cancer and the driving of diesel-powered engines as opposed to steam engines. I note that Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde said yesterday that a similar finding had been made by the British Navy.</P>
    <P>I often wonder how far improved methods of diagnosis are contributing to the increase in the incidence of lung cancer.  I suppose there are several contributing causes, one of which is, of course, that we are all living longer than we used to do, and a great many people who ultimately succumb to lung cancer would have succumbed to some other disease earlier but for the remarkable advances that have been made in medical therapy in the past 30 years.  How many of us here would be in Glasnevin now, if Sir Alexander Fleming had not discovered penicillin? I am sure 10 per cent. of us would be dead.  Some of us may survive, I suppose, to die ultimately of lung cancer, but we all have to die, and so <Col N="639" /> there is no necessity to get unduly fussed about it.</P>
    <P>However, in approaching a question of this kind, we ought to keep our sense of proportion and, while acknowledging the evidence that exists of the association between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, we ought not to forget that there may be other carcinogenic causes.  If we are resolved, as I think we should be, to bring people's attention to the dangers of associating themselves with cigarette smoking, we ought also to be vigilant to take such measures as are possible to abate the dangers associated with diesel fumes, and any other carcinogenic element that is known in our society.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound <i>outré</i> or unreasonable, but I suggest to the Minister that he has an interest in a recent discovery, a discovery on which we were seeking last week to get his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to move.  I refer to the device for reducing the noise of pneumatic drills.  The noise is almost intolerable. It must have a considerable effect on people's nervous capacity to do their work when this practice of using pneumatic drills proceeds continually in the immediate environment of a hospital or a person's normal place of working.  It would be of very great assistance if the Department of Health would collaborate with the Department of Local Government in urging not only local authorities but contractors and others to use the new adapter in order to abate the intolerable evil of the noise created by these machines.  I commend to the attention of the Minister that he might collaborate with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to use their strong influence to have the nuisance created by pneumatic drills abated.</P>
    <P>We should rejoice, of course, at the figures which appear in the Minister's statement describing the reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis.  The Minister used to tell us that he regarded our expenditure on the building of sanatoria as improvident and extravagant. <Col N="640" /> I want to say most emphatically that I glory in every shilling we spent. In 1948 we embarked on a programme of providing sanatorium accommodation on a large scale, a provision we hoped then would make 90 per cent. of the sanatoria superfluous at the end of 25 or 30 years.  It should be a source of immense satisfaction to us that the vigour and energy with which that problem was then tackled in order to attain our objectives has now resulted in our attaining those objectives far earlier than the most optimistic could possibly have hoped when we embarked upon it.  I want to recall my joy that the money was spent as we spent it, that the lives were saved, that the funerals were prevented, and that instead of burying the dead, our problem now is to find use for the vacant accommodation which is no longer required for the killing disease of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>But, while I do not doubt that the Minister is conscious of the problem, it seems to me that we are not doing enough to master the problem of the mentally handicapped child.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's proposition, which we know to be true, that the only thing that delays meeting this urgent need is the availability of competent staff.  We ought to go out and look for the competent staff and, when we find them, take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that their willingness to help is not frustrated. All of us who have constituents to serve know of the tragedies that obtain in homes up and down the country where parents are struggling to provide proper care for a mentally retarded child and, at the same time, to rear a houseful of normal children.  The longer that situation goes on, the greater the difficulty becomes.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, leaving the problem of the parents out of it, it is almost incredible what can be done for the mentally retarded child, if given adequate care and attention at the appropriate period of his life.  It is not a vast problem in this country and I think that if we double the existing accommodation, we shall very nearly have reached the size of the whole <Col N="641" /> problem we have to deal with.  I would urge the Minister to see that a strenuous effort is made in the immediate future to get the trained help necessary effectively to deal with this problem.  They will have to be religious because I do not believe we shall get, outside a religious vocation, a sufficient number of people to give themselves to this difficult work.</P>
    <P>If the Minister devotes his mind strongly to that end, he should know that he can look to all sides of this House for any support he requires for any plan he puts up and for any assistance he needs to meet this extremely difficult problem and to bring it to a really satisfactory conclusion. Of the several matters to which I have referred I would be grateful to the Minister if he would give special attention to the suggestion I had to make in regard to the future of county homes and the efforts that should be made towards reaching a satisfactory solution of the problem associated with the care of mentally defective children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As most aspects of our health services have been dealt with by previous speakers, I shall confine myself to a few matters.  I believe that the past two or three decades have been greatly deserving of credit for the change in the psychological approach of our people to the problems of tuberculosis, mental illness and mentally handicapped children and for the manner in which the secrecy and shame which used to be associated with these illnesses have been eradicated, in the knowledge that these are illnesses just like other illnesses and that they are readily curable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tuberculosis is no longer a killer disease largely because of the fact that it no longer carries a social stigma.  Those who contract it must take care and the incidence of the disease is still relatively high but because of the fact that so many of our people are making use of the mass X-ray facilities for its detection, in practically every case it is being cured and is no longer regarded by families <Col N="642" /> as something discreditable.  Those who have suffered from tuberculosis now return to their ordinary work just like a person who returns to his work after having suffered from any other illness.  It is now taken as being in the ordinary course of events but we have not too far to look back to a time when a different attitude was prevalent.</P>
    <P>Prejudice with regard to mental illness is breaking down.  This breakdown was slow at first but, because of the enlightened attitude of our health authorities towards it, the breakdown is becoming more rapid. I have no doubt that in a short space of time, it will go the way of the attitude which used to be prevalent in regard to tuberculosis.  Credit is due to the Department and to those in charge of our mental hospitals and institutions dealing with the mentally handicapped for the manner in which they have been endeavouring to educate the public in relation to these matters, more particularly through the new system known as the &ldquo;open&rdquo; day.</P>
    <P>On these occasions, the public are invited to come to the hospital and see for themselves the progress being made and the conditions under which the patients are living and the manner in which they are being treated.  Nothing tends to enlighten the public so much as these &ldquo;open&rdquo; days because of the manner in which the facts are presented to them.  Those in charge are doing a very fine job of work in getting rid of the prejudice and the old wives' tales which were common among our people over the years.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the Minister gave figures in connection with the number of beds per thousand of the population taken up by the mentally ill.  It showed a figure which was higher here than in Britain or European countries for which the figures were available.  I cannot remember whether the Minister qualified the figure or not, but I was approached by many people who asked me if it were a fact that the incidence of mental illness here was so much higher than in other countries.  From my experience, I guessed that the <Col N="643" /> figures given by the Minister represented the number of beds in use in mental hospitals rather than the number of people in these hospitals actually in need of treatment for mental illness.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are many people in our mental hospitals who are not in need of treatment for mental illness.  If we could do something to have these people comfortably housed in some other institution or place it would help considerably to improve the facilities for treatment for people in need of treatment for mental illness. For example, there are people in our mental hospitals who are cured, but who, perhaps, have no home to go to. There are also people in our mental hospitals whose relations refuse to accept them into their homes.  This is a very unfortunate position.</P>
    <P>If we are to advance more rapidly in our efforts to improve the position for those in need of treatment in mental hospitals, the whole question of the use to which the beds available in such hospitals are put should thoroughly be examined.  Perhaps this is being done. I have no doubt that it should be done by the commission which is now sitting to examine the whole matter of mental illness.</P>
    <P>In our mental hospitals, there are, roughly speaking, three categories.  In the first place, there are the patients who are mentally ill and in need of treatment.  In the second place, there are adult mentally handicapped people who were unable to get treatment when they were young and who had to be sent into a mental hospital because there was no other place available for them.  Also, there are mentally handicapped children who, because they are difficult to control and because there is no place available for them in the hospitals for mentally handicapped children, have to be put into a mental hospital.  In the third category, there are old people who are suffering from the ills of old age but who are in no other way affected mentally.</P>
    <P>The fact that three categories must be catered for hinders the work which <Col N="644" /> must be the main concern of these establishments, namely, the treatment of the mentally ill.  Doctors and nurses cannot devote the time which they feel is necessary or they cannot concentrate to the degree which they feel is necessary on the main work of the hospital which is the treatment of the mentally ill.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the fact that these three different groups are in the same hospital.  We must recognise that a very considerable number of patients who enter mental hospitals for mental treatment are highly intelligent. When they begin to recover, that is, according as their mental health improves, the general atmosphere for them is depressing with the result that restoration to good health is retarded. If we are to achieve the desirable end of reducing the number of beds in use in our mental hospitals it would appear to me that it is essential that we should try to deal with the problem of the old people who are there at present.  It is felt that about 75 per cent. of these old people can be accommodated elsewhere.  I have often wondered if it would be possible to utilise redundant hospitals to house these old people comfortably and to give them the necessary geriatric treatment.</P>
    <P>Another effective way of reducing the number of beds at present occupied in our mental hospitals would be schemes to give employment outside to patients who are able to work.  In our mental hospitals there are many people who are cured but who have no home to go to or whose people will not take them home.  They could work outside the hospital and be kept by their employers.  Some of them are excellent workers.  However, because of a certain amount of prejudice which is still here, sometimes it is difficult to get employers to agree to take them.</P>
    <P>A scheme is being operated in the mental hospital in my county&mdash;I think the same is happening in other counties &mdash;under which efforts are being made to secure employment outside for these patients.  The scheme is now beginning to operate smoothly.  I feel that as much publicity as possible ought to be given to the fact that these schemes <Col N="645" /> are in existence, that these people are available for work and that it would be a very considerable help to the patients themselves if people would employ them.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the fact that wonderful drugs are now available for the treatment of mental illness, great advances have been made.  For centuries, the only aim was confinement. Then there was compulsory treatment in our mental hospitals.  Later, we had voluntary admissions.  That was a very great advance.  It gave a person the opportunity to go into hospital for treatment without being forced to remain there.  More recently, there has been treatment in clinics which is an exceptional advance.  The opportunity is being given to people who feel stress, worry or anxiety to see a trained doctor so that illness can be prevented at an early stage.  It enables them to get advice in time.  There is no knowing the amount of worry and distress which this will save the patient in after years.  I should like to pay a particular compliment to the resident medical superintendent in my county and to his staff for their excellent work in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another considerable advance is the fact that a trained nurse keeps in touch with former patients who wish to keep in contact with the hospital.  She keeps in contact with former patients who accept employment outside and who are no longer resident in the hospital. She also endeavours, as best she can, to find out a new patient's background. Very often that gives a guide to the cause of the breakdown.  Our aim in this matter must be confined not merely to improving methods of treatment but also to preventing illness. Child guidance and family guidance are very important in this regard. Teachers often come across children who, for no obvious reason, are difficult to train or to educate.  It is not that the child is not intelligent, but, for some unknown reason, is very difficult to control.  Here it would be very helpful if we had a trained person who could diagnose what is wrong and thus save that child very considerable suffering and anxiety in his future life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> There is no illness where it is more essential for the recovery of a patient, particularly when the patient is recovering, that he should be in the position where his relatives and friends can visit him.  These visits are very helpful to the patient when he is on the road to recovery.  For that reason, we should be less rigid in insisting that the patient should be sent to his own health authority hospital only.  My reason for that is that I had a case of a patient, who lived within three or four miles of a mental hospital, who was sent to a hospital about 50 miles away because it was in his own health authority area.  This patient's sister, who is a very old lady, was very anxious that she should be able to visit him but, because she was old and her financial circumstances were bad, she was unable to do so.  The patient could not be transferred to the hospital which was much closer because the authority concerned would not pay for the patient in the mental hospital which was closer to home.  We should insist that the health authority should pay for the patient in the hospital which is closer to the patient's home or else we should try to make new health districts in so far as mental care is concerned.  We should have the hospital in the centre of an area so that the distance to be travelled by the patient's relatives and friends would be as short as possible.</P>
    <P>We should endeavour also to encourage the health authorities to brighten up the mental hospitals as far as possible.  I know this is being done in my own county.  The money spent on mental care is money well spent.</P>
    <P>A great deal has already been said with regard to the mentally handicapped. I have spoken on this subject on many occasions in this House.  I was glad to note from the Minister's statement that he is endeavouring to have more beds provided.  When we consider the excellent work which is being done for those who are in need of hospitalisation and who are lucky enough to get hospitalisation, we are more and more anxious that we should be in a position to provide institutional treatment for all who <Col N="647" /> need it and that we should be able to give the same facilities to all those children who are in need of treatment.</P>
    <P>We recognise that considerable advances have been made, but we realise that there is still a very long road to travel before we can solve this problem.  It is a problem which was neglected up to quite recently.  I recognise that there were very good reasons why it was not possible to tackle this particular problem long ago as we would have liked to tackle it.  There were many other demands which were, perhaps, more urgent because of their nature.  Nevertheless, we should push with all vigour the provision of facilities for the treatment of mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned something about local authorities&mdash;that he was hopeful they would help him in his efforts to provide more accommodation for mentally handicapped children. There is no doubt that the Minister will get full support from all local authorities in this matter.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter in connection with mentally handicapped children that I should like to mention, that is, that I am convinced, from my experience of this particular aspect of our health problems, that the provision of accommodation for those who are fully trained is the keystone to future development.  At the present time hospitals for mentally handicapped children are filled to capacity and when a child is trained to the limits of his capacity, there is nowhere for him to go except, perhaps, a mental hospital.  For that reason those who reach the adult stage are kept on in the hospitals for the mentally handicapped with the result that it is impossible to get new child patients into them.</P>
    <P>We all know that it is more essential in the case of mentally handicapped children that they should be treated and trained when young than it is in the case of the child who is not mentally handicapped.  If a child does not go to school when he is young, <Col N="648" /> he lacks a foundation.  With much stronger emphasis the same is true with regard to the mentally handicapped child.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work of the Brothers of St. John of God in my constituency in regard to this matter, and I should also like to couple with that a tribute to the work being done by all those working in this field.  Also, and, very particularly, I should like to pay tribute to the group of people in Dundalk who founded the school for the mentally handicapped&mdash;St. Dympna's.</P>
    <P>There is a Select Committee dealing with the health services and for that reason I do not intend to speak on this matter until we see the report. However, I am convinced that a very considerable part of the complaints with regard to the Health Act stem from the fact that very large numbers of our people are not conversant with their rights under it.  Perhaps, I should say it this way: They are unaware of the proper procedure by which they should look for their rights under the Act.</P>
    <P>Very often they infringe some regulations in a technical way and for that reason are deprived of their rights.  I know there are certain reasons for this technical approach but we should endeavour to overcome the need for it. For example, if a middle income group patient is sent to his own county hospital the maximum charge is 10/- per day and this can be reduced.  In my experience very often it has been reduced.  On the other hand, if the middle income group patient goes to a hospital outside the county institutions and without the permission of the county health authority, then the charge is 10/- per day and in no circumstances will that be reduced. Our people should be better informed with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I have on previous occasions advocated the publication of a booklet giving full particulars.  The Minister promised to do that but for the obvious reason that we now have this Select Committee, it would not be sensible to suggest that the booklet dealing with the health services should now be <Col N="649" /> issued until we have a report from the Select Committee and a decision on it. It has been said that local health authorities send out leaflets giving these particulars but, generally speaking, the vast majority of our people have not seen those leaflets or, if they have, cannot understand them.</P>
    <P>Most of the other matters in connection with the health services have already been discussed and I do not intend saying any more on them on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the Minister's speech on this Estimate a fund of statistical data, interesting material and informative detail.  Much of it was information on current topics such as smallpox and lung lancer, both of which came in for quite a lot of discussion during the past year.  I found in the speech, also, I am sorry to say, the ability of a good politician to say nothing.</P>
      <P>There was no indication of policy which is, of course, what a Minister for State is for&mdash;to propound and implement policy.  I am aware of course that there is a Select Committee enquiring into future policy in regard to health services but the circumstances in which that Committee was set up must be recalled.  It was set up by an amendment to a motion set down by members of this Party seeking to alter the policy in regard to health.  In fact, that Committee will preserve the majority of the Government in their findings because there is a majority of Government Deputies on the Committee. Accordingly, the position is that any report which disagrees with the findings of that majority in practice will have to be a minority report. The opinion of the minority here has been stated already during the debate on the motion on health policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Be that as it may, the existence of the Select Committee does not free the Minister from the responsibility I have mentioned&mdash;that of propounding and implementing health policy, and no fund of information, no mass of statistical data, no matter how interesting and informative, is an excuse for the job the Minister has been set to <Col N="650" /> do.  I do not want to discuss at length desirable changes in the health services because anybody who wants to investigate the suggested changes can read the reports of the debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>I shall say, though, that, at first, the operation of the British Health Act was expensive and partly a failure, but in its amended state at the present moment gives a much better service to the ordinary individual than our Act does, for a very good reason: it is based on the old adage that the customer is always right.  The customer can sometimes ask for too much and that is where the amendments became necessary because the situation at the start of the British Act was one in which, if I may coin a somewhat impossible phrase, the customer was always too right.</P>
    <P>However, the British have now succeeded in getting a much better approach to their health services and that should have been mirrored here had there been an acceptance of the reasoned arguments put forward by this Party and if that acceptance had resulted in a decision by the Government rather than an amendment to set up the Select Committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for our existing health legislation but he has not proposed here any changes in it. The existing legislation, as I see it, whether or not one enjoys certain privileges, is related to extraneous matters such as valuations, the level of the rates struck by the various local authorities, the level of the rates in various counties and the degree to which the rates affect individuals.</P>
    <P>All these matters must affect county managers in their decisions on health expenditure and this is one of the problems created in the 1953 Health Act.  I am sure the House will agree with me that these matters of valuations which are historical matters except when they are revised, and the level of the rates, vary from county to county.  According as they vary so does the administration of the health services from county to county.  For instance, there may be a county in which there are many industries.  If <Col N="651" /> one were to take any reasonable size of business one could apply to it a rate of about £500 a year but in the case of that business that rate would be proportionately nothing in relation to the other over-heads.  On the other hand, take a rating area in which the vast majority of the people are farmers.  If a farmer pays a rate of £500 each year, that amount, in relation to his output, may be his greatest expense.</P>
    <P>Consequently, if there is a large number of farmers in a local authority area, when the local authority sits down to strike its rate it can give less money in relation to the demands of that area for the health services.  Is it fair and just that a citizen, because he happens to live in one local authority area, should have a different judgment upon him as to the degree to which he shall enjoy the benefits of the Health Act?</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of which I have best experience.  Deputy Tully and I disagreed on this matter before and, while keeping to the rules of order, we may now be able to discuss it again.  In Louth the population is 69,000.  In that county a penny in the £ yields £1,000.  When the 26 county councillors sit down to vote the amount for health services they do it on the basis that a penny will get £1,000.  In Deputy Tully's county, Meath, the population is 67,000 and a penny in the £ there yields £2,300. Must not the decision of the county manager be conditioned by these variable conditions and is not that the reason for the failure of the Health Act?  Is it not the reason there is complete dissatisfaction with it?  The Minister came in here and gave us statistical data and information on lung cancer and smallpox infection, all interesting material which I should love to see circulated in a White Paper. I have already said that it is the Minister's job to propound and implement policy.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the matters that are affected by these variants which are permanently to remain.  During the coming year, the issue of the green <Col N="652" /> cards means an acceptance by the local authorities of certain financial burdens.  The issue of the green cards is conditioned by the variants I have mentioned.  Consider also the position of the county manager and his officials. He must pass judgment every day of the week.  In a situation in which the breadwinner in a house becomes ill and will be in hospital for the next two or three months, if he has not got a green card his case must be dealt with by the officer, who must deal with it on the basis of approximately the same number of people and on the basis of the £1,000, £2,300 or other odd figures obtained in the different local authority areas from the 1d. in the £.  Non-holders of green cards may also contract a disease which calls for the use of expensive drugs over a long period, and their case may also have to be adjudicated.</P>
    <P>There is another matter related to this matter and it shocks me that it was not mentioned by the Minister, but it exists.  I refer to dental provisions under the Health Act. Let us consider the position in Louth.  We had made no dental provisions under the Health Act because we could not afford them. Possibly Deputy Tully and his counterparts in Meath County Council have been in a position to do so&mdash;I hope they have&mdash;but is it right, is it just or is it fair that we could not?  During the past year, I devoted a certain amount of attention to the fact that there is a class of patient who, I feel, should have dental facilities available to him, even though we cannot afford them generally.  The type of person who needs them most is the green card holder whose wife is expecting a child.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows, at that stage a lady's teeth must be attended to or they will fall out of her head.  There is a numerous class in my constituency, namely, the farm labourer and his wife. She has been married a year before and is now expecting a child.  They have had the expense of the wedding and setting up house.  They will have the expense of getting a complete outfit for the child.  There will be expenses in the confinement which are not provided by the Health Act.  That unfortunate girl cannot possibly say to her <Col N="653" /> husband: &ldquo;I want to go to the dentist&rdquo;. If she is a decent girl, she will not do so, preferring to let her teeth fall out of her head.  That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with the county medical officer of health.  He said something was brewing and asked me not to go any further, and I did not. To my horror, I discovered that what was happening was that someone in Galway sued the Galway County Council for dental services.  That matter was not mentioned by the Minister when introducing his Estimate.  In Louth we got a circular from the Department and we had to provide a token sum for dental provisions so that the people of Louth could not sue us. The county manager advised us that we had no choice but to vote £1,000 and we did so.</P>
    <P>I thought we should devote it to those people I had discussed and I asked the county manager for the figures.  There was a great consultation and it was discovered that we could not give this £1,000&mdash;I nearly used an adjective&mdash;which we had voted, even though we could not afford it, to those expectant mothers but that it was first come, first served. The Minister gave us no facts on that matter, either.  He gave us excellent information and statistics on other matters but not on that.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the dispensary doctors.  Our county is about 50 per cent. urban and 50 per cent. rural and I have probably had as good an opportunity of assessing this situation as anyone else.  My view is that the position regarding the dispensary doctors will have to be changed.  More people are now living in some dispensary areas and there are various extras brought about by the advances in medicine so that dispensary doctors in particular areas are completely overworked.  Some of them are not and, in fact, it might be said that a few are underworked.  A vast number of the dispensary doctors are exceedingly good but there is an occasional one who is not overworked.</P>
    <P>We put down a motion which the Minister cancelled by amendment <Col N="654" /> through the strength of his vote in this House.  We wanted, in the urban areas at least, to have a choice of doctor on a panel system.  The Minister did not discuss that on his Estimate.  Under a panel system, if the number of patients gets too large, the doctor would appoint an assistant, and if the number again got too large&mdash;we could follow the line in Britain or think up a better one&mdash;he would appoint a partner.  If the service was not satisfactory at the end of the year, the householder could remove his five, six or seven cards and go to another doctor and, of course, the income of the first doctor would be reduced by that amount.  That is something else the Minister might have discussed but did not.</P>
    <P>I shall leave that aspect of health for the moment and discuss the problem of mentally retarded children.  The Minister told us that the institutional treatment available was largely handled by people with vocations.  They were not his exact words but that was his meaning.  I should like to pay tribute to the wonderful men, the Brothers of the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God, who do so much work in looking after mentally retarded children.  My colleague, Deputy Faulkner, and I live quite close to one of their ins itutions and we both know the wonderful work that is done there.  How they do it, I do not know.  It can be done only for the honour and glory of God.  The Minister has indicated, as have other Ministers for Health, that so far as equipment and accommodation are concerned, he would put on no brake. We must then leave the matter to God. I hope more people will find in themselves a vocation for that extraordinarily high calling.</P>
    <P>There are other factors which must be discussed, however.  I received this morning in the post a copy of <i>Caritas</i> which is the spring issue of the organ of the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God, and on page 3 of that publication, there is a brief survey of &ldquo;The Mentally Handicapped in Ireland&rdquo; by Brother Damien O'Shea.  I found it extremely informative.  Brother Damien produces figures in regard to the number <Col N="655" /> of mentally handicapped children on page 5.  These are: mildly retarded, for non-residential care, 17,000; requiring residential care, 7,000.  Of those, 2,000 are mildly retarded, 3,800 are moderately retarded and 1,200 are severely retarded.  This figure surprised me inasmuch as it showed me that the number that could be treated outside institutions was relatively very large and that there was a vast amount of work that could be done.</P>
    <P>On page 11, there is a Table giving the number of day centres for mentally handicapped children available in the country.  This number only totals seven institutions.  I know one of them very well.  It is run by a committee in Dundalk.  To give you an idea of the situation, in four of these seven centres, there are large waiting lists.  In one, there is a waiting list of 64; in another a waiting list of 100; and in another a waiting list of 16; while in yet another there is a waiting list of six.</P>
    <P>That leads me to believe that the position is that the question of nonresidential care has not been faced up to as yet, except of course by voluntary groups, and that there is a great field of endeavour to which the Minister could profitably address himself. For instance, the St. Dympna's centre in Dundalk is entirely voluntary. To give the Dáil an idea of the effort made in Dundalk to maintain a system which at the moment is catering for 19 handicapped children at home and going to school every day, a function was held not long ago attended by over 1,000 people who subscribed to this committee over £1,000.  That is in just one town with a population of 21,000.  It is a question of <i>mea culpa, tua culpa</i> and everybody's &ldquo;culpa,&rdquo; that in Drogheda, 20 miles away, we have not got any such organisation and the town has almost the same population as Dundalk.</P>
    <P>That is the situation all over Ireland. This question of voluntary organisations is one that must be fostered.  As far as I know, no real help or financial fostering has been <Col N="656" /> given.  I feel the Minister might possibly address himself to the matter and I hope that when he is replying, he may have something to say about it.  I should also like to quote from page 6 of <i>Caritas</i> where day centres are mentioned:</P>
    <P>A limited number of Day Centres providing facilities for the education and training of mentally handicapped children have been provided by voluntary effort.  Moderately and severely handicapped children are catered for at some of the centres and at others mild cases are also accepted on the basis of an appropriate school curriculum.</P>
    <P>The accent is on &ldquo;voluntary.&rdquo; I believe the voluntary organisation is the one that will do the job, but if the Minister could help financially, and initially provide officers and trained men and women who could assist those voluntary organisations, he might get very far with little effort.</P>
    <P>There is the question also of the recognition of certain institutions for the mentally handicapped by the Department of Health.  The Minister politically, of course, and I mean this in no disrespectful way, is a seagreen conservative.  There is not the slightest doubt about that.  If you were to provide the wings of the Fianna Fáil Party, he would be on the right wing tip.  In certain cases, he has been too conservative in the adoption of institutions, which means it is then possible for local authorities to send people there and be responsible for part of their expenses while they are there. In one County Kildare institute run by the Rehabilitation Association, namely, Knocknallen House, I know, from meeting one or two people who had friends there, of the wonderful work of rehabilitation that has been done by occupational therapy and other modern methods.  I feel that particular institution could be adopted by the Minister.  He should look at himself in the mirror and say to himself, &ldquo;Remember when I make these decisions, I am a seagreen conservative and therefore I could loosen up a little bit&rdquo;.  He could do with a certain <Col N="657" /> amount of loosening up in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the question of capital expenditure.  Deputy Dillon dwelt on the fact that we have, by the use of modern drugs and the provision of beds at a time when they were unobtainable, reduced the dread disease of tuberculosis to a very small level. We have got to have a rationalisation of our hospital beds situation. That is quite clear.  In every local authority you not only have that particular problem but also the problem of too many small institutions.  I feel it is so easy to decide to build splendiferous county homes and hospitals where a little rationalisation could do the job just as well.  The building of new institutions with present interest rates and building costs at no time means the reduction in the cost of the maintenance of patients.  In Louth we have built an excellent county hospital, and I approved of the action, but we now find that a major factor in maintenance costs of patients is repayment and interest charges.  The adaptation of old buildings and changing from one activity to another is something we must face up to, not only in one individual authority but in one as against another when they are neighbours.  A bit of rationalisation and a liberal and easy approach could save a considerable amount of capital expenditure and provide a better service.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I might mention that I detect in county managers, county officials and Department of Health officials, as well as Ministers, this great conservatism in relation to institutions. I am aware that if you have got an extensive institution in a local authority area then it has got to have full beds because if people go to another hospital it will raise the costs and you cannot have empty beds.  I am aware that you have to be a conservative on this point but there is another matter which could be discussed.  I find everybody from top to bottom is worried about voluntary hospitals.  They love to encourage them and to give them all the help they can but when it comes to sending local authority patients to them then everybody's eyebrows suddenly go up and do not come down for <Col N="658" /> a month.  But by that time the patient has paid the 10s. per day for exercising choice of hospital or is either well or dead.</P>
    <P>If we are to get the best value, the greatest comfort and the best approach for both patients and local authorities, we should take in when considering, rationalisation, the beds in voluntary hospitals.  If we can employ both those beds and the local authority hospital beds rationally, then we shall be doing a good job.  It is clear that, as soon as you begin to put one stone on top of another, your costs will go up.  Even if we do get the major portion of the health services made a central charge we shall still have the situation in which the Minister will have to go to the Exchequer, so that we shall still be operating on a shoestring.  But my object is to have the shoestring the same for everybody, whereas at present there are a lot of shoestrings of varying lengths based on the variables I have discussed.  In discussing the various medical, orthopaedic and obstetric units, we must seek rationalisation, and that rationalisation must ensure that, both in the voluntary hospitals and local authority hospitals, every bed is employed in the right way.  There has been too much conservatism in that regard.</P>
    <P>Mental health has been widely discussed here.  The establishment of extern clinics where, once or twice a week, people living at home can get treatment or be kept under observation is an excellent development.  I received this morning from the Department of Health&mdash;somebody must have known I was going to speak on health matters&mdash;a copy of the address given by the Minister to the conference of managers and resident medical superintendents held on 13th-14th December last.  I observed that the number of people per thousand in mental homes is seven here as against 2.12 in Denmark and 4.51 in the Six Counties.  I am sure the strain of modern life is no worse in the Six Counties than here.  We must therefore accept that figure as an indication of a different approach.  There is no doubt that over the years our approach to mental health has been bad.  You had the <Col N="659" /> situation in which people went into mental homes and were forgotten about.  Any irregularity of behaviour was regarded as a reason why they should stay there.  While the days of utter confinement are gone and while life in mental homes has been made more pleasant, we did not approach the problem of mental health in the best way.  Happily, we now seem to be doing so.  I would regard this figure as merely indicating we are behind.  I do not throw that at the present Minister or any Minister: I merely state it as a fact.  During the course of his remarks, the Minister did impress on the managers and the resident medical superintendents that they should address themselves to this problem.  That is the correct approach. We have got to press forward.  Each of them in his own institution has got to get nearer to the cure and further away from ordinary confinement.</P>
    <P>I should like to discuss the question of voluntary health insurance, as distinct from the institution bearing that name, and health insurance.  The policy propounded by this Party in our motion, to which the Minister put down his infamous amendment, is really one of health insurance.  It proposed that the State should provide one-third, the employers one-third and the employees one-third, and that the individual would be defined by category. If he were an employee, he had to pay; but he was defined by category, not by income, and he enjoyed certain privileges.  He had the choice of doctor, if at all possible.  That brings us back to what I was talking about at the beginning: that the customer must be right.  That situation must evolve.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say something extremely political.  If politicians do not do that, they will be put out of where they are and somebody else will be put in who will do it.  Who these people will be, I shall leave you to guess.  We have propounded that policy.  We might not get the opportunity of putting it through, and, if we do not, somebody else will or those there at present will have to change their tune.  You will not continue to <Col N="660" /> live in this fairyland where you have an approach such as I have described with people being treated differently. At the same time, you cross the Border and you find this other situation.</P>
    <P>There is a leavening out.  London is only two hours away.  It means that another couple of hundred thousand of our people can leave or can go over there, as they do, to get their health looked after.  Politics is the science, as I have always said, not of what you want to do but of what you can get away with doing.  My sincere judgment is that over the next ten or 15 years, whether the Minister, the Government, the officials of the Department or the county managers like it or not, the situation will evolve in which you will have some sort of contributory health scheme, a scheme under which the customer will be right.</P>

      <P>The last Deputy was less than generous to the Minister in his opening remarks.  If there ever was a Minister who was courageous, knew his own mind, had a policy and was prepared to push it through, it is the Tánaiste.  I think in all the annals of this House no one will find a Minister who can make a greater claim to having positive views and the courage to do what he thinks is right in the face of all opposition than the present Minister in all his long years in various capacities here.  I think, therefore, the slighting remarks made at the outset by the last Deputy were, to say the least, less than generous.  The last Deputy, too, in the Pontius Pilate attitude he took towards the Select Committee, was hardly fair to himself or to his Party.  I shall leave it at that.</P>

    <P>With regard to the Minister's speech, it was, as everybody will admit, a very informative one.  All too often there is a tendency in the rush of things to forgo opportunities of giving such information and to go to action too quickly.  In this instance, the Minister has done us all a service by taking a number of problems that will have to be considered when any health policy is being considered and putting them before us with the information he gave to enable us to form intelligent <Col N="661" /> opinions and not merely opinions and prejudices.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in the Minister's remarks in regard to cancer and its association with smoking, so much so that I should like to commence by quoting what the Minister said at columns 1682 and 1683, Volume 194, of the Official Report of 10th April, 1962.</P>
    <P>This fact of the association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer has been prominently publicised and it is quite unnecessary to labour the point in this speech.  The trouble about smoking is that the decision to smoke or not to smoke is a personal one, to be taken by the individual.  No nation has yet found an unfailing method of influencing the generality of its people to do what common sense dictates in the interest of personal health.  Smoking is not a disease.  It does not inevitably give rise to disease, and where it does, the disease is not communicable. It does not endanger the public safety; there is no turpitude attaching to it; and it cannot be held to be contrary to public morality. Consequently there is no justification for making it a crime punishable by law.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to point out what I think is a very important thing for us here to realise as legislators, that the experiment of Prohibition had its lessons, that you cannot deal with certain social problems of that nature very effectively by legislation.  I should like to add this to what the Minister has said: Yes, indeed, that is true; but what is also true is that legislation ultimately depends for its effectiveness on the public support for it.  Without the full support of public opinion, legislation for the good of the health of the population will fail.</P>
    <P>We have had that experience in connection with the licensing laws.  The failure of our licensing laws in the past, perhaps, is most to be attributed to the fact that there was never the full support of the public for the provisions in respect of the restrictions in regard to hours.  I mention that as an aside but it is important in connection with <Col N="662" /> this campaign about lung cancer when enthusiasts on both sides can get out of hand and raise issues that make it difficult to deal with the problem that undoubtedly is there.  I should, therefore, like to quote what the Minister said at column 1683 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>A calm and frequent reiteration of the facts as they have been ascertained by the research workers is the best strategy; and this is the line which we are pursuing and intend to pursue with parents, teachers and all who have growing boys and girls in their care.  By pursuing it, we hope to induce their elders to dissuade the young from starting and to teach them by example as well as precept that smoking is not &ldquo;the thing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have a double point in quoting the Minister: it is a very suitable introduction to what I have to say on the problem in view of what has been said. It is also, in one instance, an answer to the charge that there is no indication of policy in the Minister's outlook. As regards smoking, basically there is the question of personal habit.  That may be damaging to health but how are you to get over that difficulty especially when there are other causes of lung cancer and contributory factors that are very difficult to sort out? Have you enough evidence for the immediate legislation advocated by some people?  Have you enough evidence to warrant such action on the part of the State, particularly when one has regard to the fact that there are very serious economic consequences to be thought of.</P>
    <P>To mention just one of the consequences, that in relation to all those who are concerned in the manufacture and sale of tobacco products, to say nothing about the effect on the revenue. If I left it at that, I know I might be attacked by somebody who would say: &ldquo;You are prepared to sell the health of the population; you are prepared to sacrifice lives for commerce and revenue.&rdquo;  That would be a very simple thing to say to me, but it would not be a fair thing to say because that is not what I intend.  What I intend to say is that there are a number of complicated factors and <Col N="663" /> that it is not yet as clear as all that that such a course is warranted, even if it be practicable, that the course of legislative interference is probably neither practicable nor the best way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>Therefore having regard to the fact that, in all probability, you would fail in your purpose, is it wise to bring about these other economic consequences which would certainly follow from too impetuous an approach on the lines suggested by some people? I do not wish to suggest for a moment that commercial or revenue considerations should be put before health and lives.  I agree that the first consideration must be the welfare of the individual but even while one is careful to preserve proportions in these matters, might it not also be a relevant point that to interfere directly or precipitately in the way that has been suggested might, through its effects, make it even more difficult to provide the wherewithal to develop the health services which need development.</P>
    <P>It was not however from that point of view that I wished particularly to talk.  Although the subject is a large and complicated one, there seems to be a statistical association between tobacco smoking and mortality from lung cancer.  Even though that has been challenged by people unwilling to accept that evidence, that evidence is there.  However, while accepting the fact that there is an association between tobacco smoking and lung cancer we have to ask a further question: is the increased incidence of lung cancer directly attributable to smoking?  In other words, if you cut out smoking, will you eliminate lung cancer?</P>
    <P>It is essential to ask the question in that form because anybody who studies the statistics and literature will find that the answer to that question is not at all clear.  What is clear is that there is an association&mdash;an undoubted statistical association&mdash;between the two, and it is futile to deny it.  The question is: is the evidence such that it can be stated firmly that smoking causes lung cancer?  Is the smoking <Col N="664" /> associated with the increased incidence causative directly or in an ancillary way?  It may be that there is something else which, in association with smoking, is a root cause.</P>
    <P>The next question then is: are there other factors contributing to the inconvertible increase in cancer incidence in the respiratory tract?  Is the increased incidence due to tobacco?  Are there other factors? Is it a combination of both?  If it is a question of a number of factors, what factors are the most important? Before we can answer the question as to which factor is the most important, it is very difficult to take anything like the positive legislative action advocated until such time as one knows pretty certainly where one is going.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given some statistics relating to Ireland.  I wonder are the statistics available sufficient?  Are they of such a nature that one can draw a very firm inference?  In England and Wales, there is a large volume of statistics, collected and collated over a number of years.  They definitely tend to prove two things; the first of which is that there was an increased incidence in lung cancer, and other forms of cancer, since 1920.  That increased incidence was greater amongst men than amongst women.  On an analysis of the figures, however, it was also found that the figures had to be reduced for various reasons.  It is extremely difficult to collate figures of this kind.  For instance, at first sight, the figures in relation to one area tended to show that the increase in lung cancer between 1920 and 1935 was 40 times greater, according to death certificates; but, when all the other factors were taken into account, the statistics weighted and adjusted, the incidence was reduced to about four times.  We have to realise then that there are great difficulties in interpreting these statistics.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say, however, that the consensus of authoritative opinion, making allowances for all the factors involved, is that the incidence of such cancers has increased since 1920. Again, there is the question of whether the rate of increase has accelerated, <Col N="665" /> and how.  I am not competent to go into any greater detail than that on the figures, but, in case I should be challenged on my apporach, I should like to refer to an interesting publication. It is the report of a lecture given by Dr. Cook, F.R.S. and it is published by the Royal Institute of Chemistry. He is in a peculiarly detached position, as far as this problem is concerned. Dr. Cook gives a number of statistics and a good deal of statistical data. That is available to anyone who wishes to get it.  He says that&mdash;</P>
    <P>The statistical association between smoking and lung cancer can now be regarded as firmly established.  It has been reported by at least 21 independent groups of investigators in eight different countries using the retrospective method.  It was further investigated in two countries by three independent groups using the prospective method.  The results all lead to the same conclusion that there is a statistical association.</P>
    <P>He goes on to give the basis for these statements.  They are available.  I need not delay the House on them.  I emphasise that in case I should be charged with either distorting the facts or trying to overlook what has been established. I do not think either the Minister or myself can be accused of that.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that in the same lecture Dr. Cook goes on to deal with the factors other than smoking. He points out that for a large number of areas now it has been recognised that industrial factors enter into the picture.  It has been established unanimously, for instance, that workers in certain mines, particularly mines in which there is a higher than average radioactive content, are liable to respiratory cancers.  Workers in chromium and nickel industries are liable.  There are many spheres in which there is a correlation as marked, in my opinion, as the correlation with smoking.  Since these contributory causes in industry have been localised, they have been guarded against, not by prohibiting the industry but by taking specific precautions.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which seems to be emerging now as an important <Col N="666" /> contributory cause.  The authority I have quoted says it is more important than many other causes.  I refer to the urban-rural relationship.  There is a marked difference in the incidence of the disease in urban and rural areas. That brings us then to the problem of atmospheric pollution.  It has been equally well established, it would appear, that the incidence is affected by the urban atmosphere; the incidence is higher in the towns.  To quote the same authority, there is a strong presumption that the increased incidence in the towns is due to atmospheric pollution in the towns.  The factors involved may be smoke from chimneys, exhaust fumes, and so on. Internal combustion and diesel engines have been specifically mentioned. There can be no doubt, I think, that polluted atmospheres, especially in urban areas and industrial regions, are as likely as anything else to be a cause of the higher incidence.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that the question of protection from diesel and internal combustion engine fumes, and things like that, may be as important in this connection as smoking.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is at all clear what the relative values of the factors concerned are.  One must admit that tobacco smoking is a factor.  One must also admit that pollution is a factor and that there are other factors.  The whole thing is further complicated by the fact that there seem to be geographical factors.  It has been stated that in South Africa, where they have been heavy smokers for a long time, the lung cancer rate is surprisingly low. Immigrants from other countries, European countries, showed a higher incidence of lung cancer than the people who were there already and who were notoriously heavy smokers. There are confusing factors like that in the situation.</P>
    <P>There is also the well-known factor that for a long time there has been a large number of heavy smokers who get away with impunity.  I am not to be taken as an advocate of smoking but I think a subject like this should be approached, as the Minister suggests, in a calm way with due regard for the facts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> In short, here is the situation.  There is an association between smoking and cancer and nobody can deny, as Dr. Cook says, that it is wiser to refrain from smoking.  There is also an association with atmospheric pollution and similar matters.  There are complicating factors like the difference between certain geographical regions and practices. Personally I do not think that the whipping up of this issue with regard to one factor of the situation alone is the most helpful way to deal with the problem.  Again, to be specific and to protect myself, I do not want to be taken as suggesting that the economic factors should take precedence over the factors affecting individual health. What I am trying to do is to put forward a few arguments in support of what the Minister said and to show that the approach which he suggested is the best one in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other matters in relation to health but I shall not delay the House as they have been covered already.  I should like again to pay a tribute to the Minister for the information he has given on this and other matters and to say that I take exception to what I consider were the ungenerous remarks of the speaker who preceded me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long.  I heard Deputy Burke stating yesterday evening that there was a 50 per cent. recoupment of health service expenditure to the local authorities.  I heard other speakers make the same statement.  I do not think that is correct because the recoupment does not include loan charges for health services nor does it include any sum in relation to new work carried out by the local authorities. Recently we carried out some such work and discovered that there was no recoupment for it.  If you put in electric heat instead of a fireplace there is no recoupment.  If you want to tarmac the place around the county hospital there is no recoupment for it. If you want to break out a window or a door there is no recoupment for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the financial aspect of the matter&mdash;and it does mean an increase <Col N="668" /> in the rates&mdash;there appears to me to be a killing of local initiative because the local bodies are loath to go to their councils and ask them for a further increase in the rates to carry out some very necessary work.  A person in hospital is entitled to the best service that can be given.  Patients going into hospital are led to expect that service.  They are told they will get it but if the local authorities are to provide the best services possible they should be fully recouped for doing so.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that 50 per cent. of the net health service expenditure should be recouped to the local authorities.  At the moment it is not 50 per cent. of the net expenditure. If any local authority compares their net health expenditure with the recoupment received from the Government they will find that it is not 50 per cent. In my county the extras are costing us between 3d. and 4d in the £.  I would remind the Minister that under the 1947 Health Act certain savings were made from the operation of the National Health Insurance Society and if those savings were devoted to providing a 50 per cent. recoupment of the net expenditure it would be a help to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>My main fault with the present Health Act is the tremendous cost to the country in relation to the benefits being derived from it.  In spite of that tremendous sum of money, the services in my county are generally inadequate.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with a point in respect of mentally handicapped children. We have difficulty in providing for those children at an early age.  I have been interested in several such cases. Sometimes there was a waiting period of up to two years.  In some cases, the reason given was that the children were too young.  They would have to be up to three years or four years before certain hospitals would accept them.  That matter should be redressed as soon as possible because it is not good for the home.  It is bound to cause worry and anxiety to the mother and father and it is bound, also, to have a detrimental effect on the other children in the home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> I understand, from some explanations I have been given, that there is a lack of space and a lack of staff. With the money available from the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes, and so on, priority should be given to suitable provision for mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>The medical card appears to have lost most of its value.  Valuations in my constituency are very low.  Quite a large proportion of the people there are in the lower income group.  That creates a problem.  Dentures and spectacles are no longer being supplied to holders of medical cards.  Generally, cases are taken on their merits but there are cases of hardship due to the fact that some people are not supplied with a medical card.  A general medical card is supplied to a person only after intensive investigation.  That should be sufficient proof that the holder is entitled to all services free of charge.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of patients who are brought direct from their homes to Dublin hospitals.  It would appear that if they are not sent direct from a county institution such patients are liable to a charge of 10/- per day.  That can cause much hardship where the illness is prolonged. I have a case in mind of a woman who has been in hospital for almost a year.  The bill is now in the region of £500.  Her husband has already paid £200 and he has told me that he has gone beyond redemption. All extras are charged for&mdash;all X-rays, medicines, and so on&mdash;because the man is over a certain valuation. In fact, this case should be considered on its merits.  I refer to it because I am certain that there are hundreds of similar cases throughout the country.  I should be very glad to know what can be done about such a case because the local authorities say that, according to a certain regulation, they cannot come to the rescue.</P>
    <P>I want to mention footwear for needy children, from the point of view of health.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to information on health and health services.  I am sorry to see a reduction of £5,000 this year in that connection.  At the moment, we have a smallpox scare, a cancer from smoking scare and a poliomyelitis scare. At such a time, one would expect an increase in the amount of money for information on health and health services. Two cases of poliomyelitis have <Col N="671" /> been confirmed in my county in the past day or two.  I know quite a lot is being done in that respect.  I do not think it was a time when there should be a reduction under that heading. Film shows in the national schools, the vocational schools and so on illustrating the effects of smallpox and poliomyelitis might benefit not only the children but also the parents. Parents would be encouraged to have their children vaccinated as a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>The present Health Act calls for too much money for administration having regard to the amount passing over in direct benefit to the people who are entitled to treatment under it.  I hope the Select Committee will arrive at proposals for a better and more adequate health service at a lesser cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that there is very serious confusion in the minds of many of the prophets of doom in this House.  During the past few days we listened to the most extraordinary speeches.  According to one section, unless we completely dissociate ourselves from tobacco and smoking habits we will die very young. According to another section, unless we eschew alcohol and all its associates we will die younger still.  As far as I know, we are reputed to be the hardest drinkers and the heaviest smokers in the world but we are also the longest livers.</P>
      <P>There must be something rather seriously wrong about the statements which have been so glibly made here over the past few days.  It is readily understandable that, as the years of this Parliament go by and as we reach a more mature stage of advancement, it should not be very difficult, even after what we heard here last night, for somebody else to come into this House and advocate the abolition of sweets unless we are to die very young. I do not know how sincere these people are in the statements they have been making.  They would find it very difficult to convince any reasonable man as to there being any degree of accuracy about these statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> People have been smoking tobacco since practically the beginning of the world and drinking alcoholic liquor. Even if it only started at the wedding feast of Cana, we have been a long time at it.  The population of the world has been steadily increasing and as far as I know the length to which people normally succeed in living has also increased.  I think these geniuses should turn their minds to something other than alcohol and tobacco.</P>
    <P>Some of them pointed out that if we had certain medical and social facilities in this country we would be longer living still; I do not know, but the Swedes, who are generally understood to have one of the most advanced social and medical systems in the world, I understand, are the shortest livers.  There must be something more than tobacco and drink involved.  I do not know if the gentlemen who dealt with the question of alcohol have any experience of it; I do not know if the gentleman who spoke on the tobacco question has any experience of it but if some of them spoke about the manner in which alcohol is delivered in the city of Dublin and got something done about that they would be doing a better day's work.  I would suggest that if the Minister is to take any steps he should take them in relation to alcohol as delivered to the public.</P>
    <P>He should do something about that. I know pumps and pipes which are to be found in the public houses of this city and through which stout, porter and beer are still being delivered unhygienically to the public.  The sooner the Minister does something about that, the better.  These contrivances or contraptions, call them what you will, have, I understand, been abolished in most civilised countries for years.</P>
    <P>We know today that no matter how highly people are paid they are not terribly inclined to work.  I have an idea that there are a good many Dublin barmen who are not at all disposed towards washing out those pipes on the prescribed number of occasions.  I would suggest to the Minister that to get over that difficulty he should take steps to have the pipes eliminated entirely.</P>
    <P>With regard to the problem of cancer, <Col N="673" /> a subject on which nobody has erred on the side of brevity in dealing with it, something should be done about fumes.  That would be a much better day's work.  Any clear headed Deputy from the country must be dismayed to find himself in a fumesmoked city.  I understand that Dublin is one of the freest cities in Europe from fumes.  If it is, I should not like to live in any of the other cities.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, unless something is done about diesel fumes, the situation will eventually become very serious.  It is probably serious enough already.  If you go out into the country and find a man driving any diesel powered machine, you often find him probably more subject not only to cancer but to many other diseases as well.  It is time something should be done to deal with that problem.  Legislation should be introduced to ensure that appalling black fumes are not emitted from buses, tractors and lorries and all kinds of diesel powered engines throughout the city and country.  Naturally enough, their effects cannot be as bad in the open spaces of the country but, needless to say, they are not healthy.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House.  I believe our hospitalisation services could be somewhat improved.  Too many of our hospitals are seriously understaffed.  I do not think it is because of the fact that nurses cannot be found.  I know that there are hundreds of Irish girls in England who would be only too delighted to come back here if the salaries were made sufficiently attractive. Even if they go over to England to train, it is only right that, when they are trained, employment should be provided for them here if at all possible.</P>
    <P>It is a rather extraordinary situation that these girls cannot be trained in this country in the same way as in England.  Then if they want to leave this country after they have been trained, let them leave, but they will have been trained here when they were young and definitely not be exposed to the temptations to which they are so readily exposed in foreign countries today.  Another matter is that hospitals <Col N="674" /> who use the services of these girls should pay for them.  There is a moral obligation on us to see that they pay for them and it is up to the Minister to examine the matter and see that something is done about it.  Whether girls train here or in England, their salaries should be brought up to a level commensurate with the work they do.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also look into the question of the staffing of hospitals. In my county the county council are very often presented with programmes for increased staffs in hospitals but we find it is years later before the programmes have been carried out. That is not right.  County councillors do not desire that such delays should occur and if councils come to decisions that there should be better staffing of hospitals those decisions should be put into effect without delay.</P>
    <P>I would also submit that something should be done to deal with the teeth and the sight of the people in the rural areas.  The position is not so bad in urban areas and in the cities where it is easy to get to a dentist or to an oculist but we know that many of these professional people will not reside in rural areas and the problem of getting to them is therefore a rather serious one for rural dwellers.  I suggest that there should be a system under which a person who holds a medical card or his dependants should be able not only to get free treatment but to have free transport.  There should be no question about that. After all, there is not much point in providing free treatment if a person cannot get to the centre where the treatment is available.  I know, as a member of a county council, that the amount of money involved in such transport would not frighten any of us.  In my county people have to travel up to 60 miles to the county hospital and the county clinic and the amount of money involved is a very great burden on them.</P>
    <P>There is now a proposal, apparently, to depart from the district nursing service.  It seems that this question is to be left to the county medical officers of health and, as we all know, very often their theories are more suited to moon men than to earth <Col N="675" /> men.  Some of them are up in the clouds.  They have an idea that the people living in the country are in an identical situation with those in urban areas.  It is nonsensical to suggest, for instance, that 5,000 people spread throughout the countryside are in the same position as 5,000 people concentrated in an urban area.  Yet the county medical officers of health pursue the same policy towards the two communities.</P>
    <P>It is all right for them to say that telephones are plentiful.  Perhaps they are, but not where I come from.  The medical officers are probably struck by the fact that there is a waiting list of 10,000 for telephones in this city.  They should be made to realise that there are large areas in the country where there is no access to a telephone.  At the moment under the district nursing service people may live within five miles of a nurse.  As a result of the proposed change they may not find a nurse within 20 miles of them.  Therefore the situation is not improving and I think the county medical officers are responsible. Practically all schemes, medical and otherwise, are based on what some of these officers find in urban areas. That is not fair to the rural communities and I suggest that the Minister should intervene because, if he does not, we shall not only be running to the towns but racing to them in order to exist at all.</P>
    <P>The question of sub-normal children is one which is not being reasonably dealt with.  I know it is a difficult one &mdash; probably one which could be dealt with better by the religious orders than by a Government Department or by any service which a local authority could set up &mdash;but there is an obligation on us, morally and otherwise, to deal with this problem.  We are sorry when we see a man dying one year younger than is normal because of cancer and we try to do something about it, but it is a much more serious affair to stand idly by and regard a situation in which a child who would become a useful member of the community is left there as a burden on its parents. <Col N="676" /> That is happening in thousands of cases throughout the country.  It is a question which has not been tackled properly.  I am not putting the blame on the present Minister.  Successive Ministers for Health have not decided to deal adequately with this problem. Some Ministers have dealt specifically with tuberculosis and others with cancer, but here is a more pressing problem and nobody has yet seriously thought of a method of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>It should be possible, by way of inducement, to assist the religious orders in dealing with it.  I have no hesitation in saying that religious orders are the proper people to take on this work but we cannot expect them to do it entirely as a work of mercy because there is undoubtedly an enormous amount of money involved. Religious orders cannot be expected to set up institutions and provide the services of trained staffs unless they have the money.  It is up to us to provide that money.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the case of disabled persons living at home and to the maintenance allowance now payable to such people &mdash; 22/6d. a week.  I feel quite sure there is not a Deputy in the House who honestly believes that is a sufficient allowance. Many of these people experience much greater hardship than many of the pensioners about whom we have been hearing for days.  I would, accordingly, appeal to the Minister to re-examine the position of such disabled persons and to bring their allowance up to that obtaining for old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate, it would appear that we will never arrive at the stage of hearing that everyone is satisfied with the health services.  I should like to judge the services by what they were 50, 30, 20, or 10 years ago, and to compliment the Minister and the Department on the great strides that have been made over the years.  I am confident that the Minister, being a man of purpose and high integrity, will continue to bear in mind the necessary improvements that are becoming obvious from day to day.  I know there <Col N="677" /> is no need for me to add my voice to what has been said already.  It can be said that the Minister, more than anyone, is aware of the shortcomings, where they are and where they occur. Anyone who knows the Minister fully appreciates his sincerity and his desire to eradicate the defects in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>Like all other services, the health services cost money.  Listening to the debate, it would appear that Deputies want to shift the load off the rates and on to the Central Fund and <i>vice versa</i> and also want a more equitable distribution.  When there is a question of finance, I am afraid there will always be something that should have been done yesterday but is left until tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister very sincerely on behalf of the people of Sligo for a great privilege.  I was invited to the opening of Cregg House as a home for subnormal and mentally defective children, sponsored by the Minister and under the patronage of the great Sisters of La Sagesse.  A promise was made to find a location in Sligo about ten years ago and it came to fruition a few short months ago.  The Minister deserves the highest commendation from the people of Sligo and Leitrim.  It is a very encouraging sight to me to see those children so well cared for.  A few years ago, they would have been locked away in some dark room and they would not have been allowed to be seen because it would be a reflection on the family. However, education has pushed back the dark clouds of ignorance and this problem has been brought out into the open.  I should like the Minister to tell us the percentage of those sub-normal and mentally retarded children. I believe there is not a family in the country that does not know of some incident which arose in the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, as we know, a great case to be made for extending the dental, aural and ophthalmic services.  Deputy Donegan mentioned Louth and said they could not afford to do it.  I was surprised to hear that coming from him.  Unlike Sligo and Leitrim and other western counties, Louth is not <Col N="678" /> one of the poorest counties in Ireland. It was disappointing to me to hear a Deputy from Louth state that they could not afford to make a contribution towards providing dental services in Louth.  Generally, prevention is better than cure.  The fluoridation of drinking water and water used for domestic purposes has been generally approved as a method of prevention. I would ask the Minister to implement these preventive measures that will eradicate dental caries in children as fast as he can, and so cut down the necessity for large sums of money being spent in providing dental services and dentures.</P>
    <P>Recently a dispensary doctor was appointed in Kiltyclogher.  I am told that he has left again, and I should like the Minister to tell me, if he can, why it is that they cannot keep a doctor in Kiltyclogher.  We have also been quite a while without a dispensary doctor in Tubbercurry.  It is about time a man was appointed and took up residence there.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the Minister and all concerned with the hospitals and the health services.  There is one service which I think could be improved.  I visit hospitals and I sometimes arrive when the patients are eating their meals.  I think the food could be presented and served with better taste and a little more care.  This may not be a matter for the Minister but as health services and other services come under his jurisdiction, I should like him to inquire into that matter.  I have seen the food served and the method of serving it and frankly I did not consider it very palatable.</P>
    <P>Some of the county hospitals where older people are admitted to public wards, sometimes with sores, seem to be using the same equipment. I have known patients to complain about it and again, a little more care could be taken with the food.  After all, in the wards, there are people who have delicate tastes and they sometimes find scenes like that somewhat repulsive.  I should like to end by complimenting the Minister on what he has done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of useful work is being done under the Health Act and in nearly all our counties, we have hospitals which if they are not already good, are about to be very much improved.  The management and administration of mental hospitals have improved very much over the years.  Like my colleague, I visit the mental hospital that serves Sligo-Leitrim.  I should like to ask the Minister to try to reach the stage as quickly as possible when little boys and girls will not be seen in mental homes mixing with adults and growing up in the atmosphere of an institution which will spoil them for the remainder of their lives.  It is very sad to see a little boy running around a mental hospital with no other place to go.</P>
      <P>Just as many people are still being fooled about the £800 income and the £50 valuation.  We often meet people who still tell us they qualify for this, that and the other, due to the fact that they come within those two figures which, to my mind, should never have been mentioned.  In all counties, it is always brought down to a means test.</P>
      <P>Medical cards are very useful and a great source of contentment to the families who have them.  Unfortunately in the county I represent, there are many people who should qualify for medical cards but do not qualify. We must admit that if they did, the rates would soar because our income from 1d. in the £ brings in only £600. If something could be done to relieve that situation and if the Minister could bear a little more of the cost, it would be a good thing because if medical cards were to be handed out to the people who should get them, there would be no end to the rise in the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I had the experience of meeting ex-tuberculosis patients who have married and are living in very poor circumstances.  No attempt could be made to provide a house for one such particular person.  The person was not able to avail of the grant and the council has no scheme whereby housing accommodation can be provided for ex-tuberculosis patients.  This was a case of a young woman with a <Col N="680" /> family of five and nothing was more certain than that she would end up by going back to a sanatorium later on. She was living in two rooms.  The Department should attempt to check up on some of those houses and see that the people are more adequately provided for.</P>
    <P>I also had the sad experience of meeting a man with a family of eleven who had spent two years in a sanatorium in Galway.  He is back at home now and the T.B. allowance has been stopped.  He has no hesitation in saying that he is not able to work, even if employment is provided for him.  I am quoting only one case but I am sure there are other similar cases.  It is the type of case for which something should be done to provide means until the person's health improves.  It is all right for a county medical officer of health or a doctor to give a person the all-clear and to say: &ldquo;You are all right; we are finished with you.&rdquo;  That does not mean that the man is able to take up his shovel and carry on with his work.</P>
    <P>In my constituency also, there are people who should qualify for a disablement allowance.  It would make a great difference in their homes because they have to be kept by their friends at great expense and inconvenience. That allowance should be given more generously.  We find many people getting the certificate from the doctor but when the final word is given by the county manager, they find they will not get it.  We county councillors have made representations but the manager or somebody else will tell us: &ldquo;No, he does not qualify.&rdquo;  That position should be examined and deserving cases considered.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell on the question of mentally retarded children as other Deputies have already gone over that ground.  Another experience I have had is in relation to a young married couple who find themselves responsible for keeping a sister or brother of the bride or groom, as the case may be.  When young people get married, they find it hard enough to live and raise a family without having to be responsible for a sister or brother, and in all these cases a disablement <Col N="681" /> allowance should be paid to the person who has to be maintained and kept at home, where otherwise he or she might have to be kept in the county home.  Every consideration should be given in this regard to the young married couple, especially if their circumstances are not good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the very informative report on the state of the country's health which he has presented in this Estimate.  I should also like to congratulate his staff who have worked so conscientiously for the community.  I should like to refer to the three major health problems that confront the country.  They are T.B., mental illness and the mentally retarded children, to whom so many Deputies referred.</P>
      <P>Wonderful progress has been made in combating tuberculosis.  As a member of Dublin Corporation, it was very gratifying to me to find we have so many empty beds in our sanatoria and that we are able to utilise them for other purposes such as geriatric, the treatment of patients who had been overcrowding some of the mental homes in the city.  While that situation has been achieved, it is not a matter for complacency to find in the Minister's statement some 3,000 cases of tuberculosis were brought to light during the past year and that notwithstanding the public apathy to the utilisation of the mass radiography service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to appeal to employers and organisations to co-operate fully with this service throughout the country in the splendid work being done.  A disturbing feature about the tuberculosis figures is that cases now coming to light show that older people are being affected.  In the long struggle to deal with that problem, it was the young people who were the victims.  I should like the Minister and his Department to examine the social and economic reasons which produced that situation.  After all, associated with that drive to provide accommodation for T.B. patients, and the intensive efforts made so many years ago to provide sanatoria, was a splendid housing programme which covered the <Col N="682" /> whole country.  All the worst cases have been accommodated.  This is a matter that requires some examination by experts.</P>
    <P>The question of mental illness has been referred to by many Deputies.  I am glad we are all united in the efforts made to deal with that grave problem. I am sure it is a shock to most of our people to realise there are 22,000 people mentally ill here, mainly provided for in mental homes. Associated with that problem is the problem of mentally retarded children. It is estimated there are 24,000 of them, and some of them have not been adequately provided for yet.</P>
    <P>These are twin problems the Minister is grappling with.  I trust the commissions he has appointed to deal with them will produce something which will lead to the expediting of treatment.  As a member of a mental hospital authority for a number of years, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the energy he has devoted to that problem.  Apart from the setting up of this commission of voluntary people, experts from England and at home, he has gone around himself to see the conditions in our mental institutions.</P>
    <P>While a lot has been done in past years to improve conditions, much remains to be done.  Between Portrane and St. Brendan's in Dublin, there are over 3,000 patients.  They live in badlydesigned buildings and overcrowded conditions.  There is also the problem of inadequate staff.  But, despite all these difficulties, great progress has been made.  The establishment of clinics attached to these hospitals and also to some of the voluntary hospitals has helped to solve the problem. This problem will persist.  It can be dealt with only by energetic measures taken by all concerned with it.  I hope that the reports of these commissions will enable us to solve these great problems.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the question of aged people.  Unfortunately, there are a large number of them in our mental homes.  In Dublin, we have had the experience of transferring a number of them to such centres as St. Mary's and other institutions here. <Col N="683" /> However, the accommodation is inadequate and there is a waiting list. That is a problem that will have to be tackled too.  I understand that there are a number of private nursing homes looking after the aged and that these homes are not registered.  I understand that only maternity homes are required to be registered.  I have had representations about a number of these private nursing homes caring for aged people.  It has been represented to me that it might be no harm if the Minister would arrange to inspect these homes, see how these people are cared for, if they are adequately provided for and what treatment they receive.  That would help control these premises and see whether they are suitable for caring for old people.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for approving of improved conditions and salaries for nurses recently.  I was very pleased to see during the week that the chairman of the Skin and Cancer Hospital, Hume Street, referred to that fact and indicated that nurses who had emigrated to the United States and England were now coming back here because of improved conditions.  It is in the interest of the health services generally that that situation should arise.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to the school medical services.  One feature was brought to my attention in regard to the inspections carried out in the schools periodically.  If, for some domestic reason, a child is prevented from attending school that day, because he misses that inspection, he is not brought within the scope of the scheme. That is a matter that could be redressed if some attention were devoted to it.  It is a hardship on a family to find that a child, who perhaps could not attend school because of a cold, is denied medical treatment.</P>
    <P>Once again, I wish to congratulate the Minister on the wonderful work he is doing for the health of the nation. Progress has been made possible because of an improvement in our economic position.  We have had speeches asking for more.  We are all conscious of the shortcomings of our <Col N="684" /> health services, but ultimately these cannot be overcome until the economic situation improves to the extent that the necessary funds can be provided to improve our health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I think I should reply to the question put by Deputy Desmond as to what is the present position in regard to the work of the Select Committee. I am not the chairman, but I suppose I can inform the House that the Committee did meet before Easter.  There were some difficulties in the way of arranging a programme and it was decided that the Minister for Health should circulate a memorandum on the health services and, perhaps, on some matters relating to the operation of the Act and that, as soon as it had been circulated and the members had time to digest it, another meeting could be summoned.  The memorandum, I hope, will be in the hands of the members of the Committee early next week, if not, indeed, at the end of this week.</P>
      <P>I am very grateful for the manner in which the Estimate has been received and considered by the House. I think I can say that, with hardly an exception, Deputies addressed themselves seriously to the very serious problems from the point of view of the community with which this Estimate is concerned.  I have never said that our health services are everything we would wish them to be.  I have said, however, that taking them as a whole and having regard to our resources, they are as good as the moneys allotted to us enable us to provide.  If we had more money the services could be more extensive, perhaps, cover a larger number of people or enable a larger number of people to avail of them with less direct expense to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question then arises: where is this additional money to come from? It cannot come from any source but one.  It can come only from the people themselves.  It can be secured only by imposing additional taxation.  Whether we disguise the additional taxation as an insurance contribution or more accurately as a poll tax, it can only be secured by additional taxation, taking what is required from the poor as well <Col N="685" /> as from the well-to-do, saying to all alike: &ldquo;You may not spend all your earnings in your own way; you must hand over a larger share of them to the State in order that it may provide better health services, more hospitals, more doctors, more nurses, more drugs and medicines for all.&rdquo;  I detected no enthusiasm on the part of my critics or on the part of the critics of the Health Act for that policy.  Certainly it did not emerge from anything that was said by my predecessor or by some of those who spoke afterwards on that side of the House.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one Party in the House which is on record as saying that the health services as they exist have been proved to be inadequate. The Estimate before the Dáil proposes to provide £1,500,000 more for the maintenance of the health services and for their further improvement.  Of this sum no less than £1,160,000 will be given to local health authorities as an additional subscription towards the cost of the health services administered by them.  Last year the amount originally voted for these authorities was about £9,030,000.  This year it is £10,190,000 or, as I have said, an increase of £1,160,000, given to them to fulfil the functions which the Health Act imposes upon them. If Deputies really believe what they say, if Fine Gael Deputies really believe what they said in their motion last November, what they said during last year's general election and what some of them have been saying in the course of this debate, that the existing health services have been proved to be inadequate, one would have expected them to welcome the increase in the Estimate and to provide the additional money with alacrity.</P>
    <P>This, however, they have refused to do.  Fine Gael, in fact, if their attitude on the financial business of the House is any indication do not want improved or extended health services.  Their record in that regard would seem to be consistent.  For half a generation, the Party have opposed any reasonable development of community health services here.  Fifteen years ago, that is, half a generation ago, when I was Minister for Local Government and Public Health responsible for introducing the <Col N="686" /> Health Bill of 1946, that Bill was, as everybody knows, opposed relentlessly by Fine Gael.  The same Party opposed the Health Bill of 1947.  Four years later, they broke up the Coalition rather than provide a mother and child scheme under the Act and two years after that again they opposed the Health Bill of 1953.</P>
    <P>Now they would appear to have swung to the opposite extreme.  If Deputy Donegan speaks for his Party, then the Fine Gael policy in future is that we must have the same sort of health services here as they have in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland. That statement by Deputy Donegan this morning will come as a shock to the executive of the Irish Medical Association, but apparently that is the course upon which Fine Gael have embarked.</P>
    <P>I do not see any strong objection in principle to operating the health services here on the same basis as they operate in Northern Ireland.  There are sound sociological and economic reasons; however, why we should not adopt that as our model.  I have always understood the opposition on the part of the Fine Gael Party to the health policy of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; I may say the health policy of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party jointly with whatever slight divergence there may be on the part of the Labour Party from our policy&mdash; was precisely this: That they abhorred the idea that the State would assume general responsibility for providing health services for anybody, irrespective of the economic circumstances of the individuals concerned. Today, however, we had the same sort of somersault on their part as they astonished the people by twelve years ago &mdash; when those who had been the greatest proponents of the Commonwealth idea in Ireland suddenly decided they were going to become Republicans.</P>
    <P>Again we have no objection in principle to the fact that they did at last elect to march with the majority of the people on that issue and adopted the same sort of stand as the people had, in relation to it.  In this matter of health, however, let us at least be <Col N="687" /> guided by some settled rule of conduct. Let us refrain from making the health of the people a commodity that is to be trafficked in, bargained for in the political market place, that is to be held up for auction, that is to be held up as an inducement to people to vote for one Party or the other.</P>
    <P>I may say that our action in asking the House to set up a Select Committee to consider the health services was taken on the basis adumbrated here by Deputy Corry, that is to say, that the Act of 1953, having been in full operation since 1957, is due for review, that such imperfections as there may be in it &mdash; and certainly there are imperfections in it &mdash; and such defects as experience has shown exists should now be considered with a view to seeeing if they can be removed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the total amount of money which will be granted from his Department to the Dún Laoghaire Corporation during the current financial year for road improvements; the roads which it is proposed to resurface or repair in Dún Laoghaire Borough; the estimated numbers who will be employed on this work; and when it is expected that the work will be completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A road improvement grant of £62,250 has been allocated to Dún Laoghaire Corporation for 1962/63.  The Corporation have a <Col N="703" /> number of road improvement schemes under consideration, including New-townpark Avenue (continuation of current work), Rock Road, Glenageary Road Upper, Stradbrook Road and Carrickbrennan Avenue, but I cannot say whether these works or any of them will be proposed for execution under this grant.</P>
      <P>The streets and roads on which the Corporation propose to carry out road maintenance works in 1962/63 are set out in a tabular statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.  A road upkeep grant estimated at £11,000 approximately will be paid to meet 50 per cent. of the cost of such of these works as are on trunk and link roads.</P>
      <P>In regard to employment on road works in the Borough, the average monthly figure for 1961/62 was 76, and something more than this may be expected this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether there is <Col N="704" /> any legal authority which empowers a local authority to recover from the tenant of a vested cottage on the sale of such cottage any money which he received ten years previously as home assistance during illness or unemployment from such local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a public assistance authority is at any time of opinion that a person to whom public assistance has been paid is able to repay all or portion of the assistance, the authority is empowered by section 28 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, to recover the amount.</P>
      <P>I have no functions in relation to the exercise of this power of recovery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what the legislation provides for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It provides that if and when such a person is in a position to repay the amount, the local authority is empowered to recover it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position, as far as I can see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is a debt to a local authority, is it possible that it can be statute barred in the same way as an ordinary private debt can be statute barred?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for a local authority to recover money from a person who got it by reason of illness or unemployment ten or 20 years ago, while in similar circumstances a private debt owing for that long period could not be recovered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for decision by the courts.  If the person concerned was under the impression <Col N="705" /> that the Statute of Limitations applied, he could resist the effort of the local authority to get it back.  Section 28 of the Public Assistance Act empowers public assistance authorities to recover the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it is archaic, in this year 1962, that the local authority which gave money ten or 20 years ago should now be entitled to recover it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister does he not agree that it is archaic that a person can be compelled to repay to the local assistance authority money that was given to him ten or 20 years previously, that the local authority can recover the money out of the sale of a labourer's cottage?  In this year 1962, that type of mentality should have no place in the law of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>Revised plans for a scheme of 38 houses at Garryvicleheen were submitted to my Department by the Thurles Urban District Council on 16th February, 1962.  The plans required detailed examination, which has now been completed.  The housing authority are being informed of the technical advice which I have received and I am suggesting a technical discussion between representatives of my Department and the housing authority, with a view to expediting matters.</P>

      <P>Proposals for finally fixing the rents in respect of the scheme of 156 houses at Marian Park, Dundalk, for which provisional rents had previously been approved, were submitted by the housing authority for my approval on 5th March last. The proposals provided for a rent of 20/9d. in respect of 154 houses and 13/9d. in respect of 2 houses.  My approval to these proposals was conveyed <Col N="707" /> to the housing authority by letter of 19th March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether, in connection with the proposed amendment of the present scheme for the provision of contributory old age pensions, he will give sympathetic consideration to the position of unmarried or widowed female contributors under the Social Welfare Acts so as to enable those who would qualify on their own contributions to receive such pensions at 65 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the scheme of old age (contributory) pensions, the qualifying age for pension is 70 years for both men and women.</P>
      <P>The scheme has only been in operation since January, 1961, and experience has been too limited to enable conclusions to be reached as to the desirability of any changes in the scheme, such as in the qualifying age for pension for any class or group of contributors.</P>
      <P>I do not propose, therefore, at this stage to seek to have the scheme amended to enable unmarried or widowed female contributors to qualify for pension at 65 years of age. The point will, however, be noted for further consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that unless a person is chronically ill the likelihood of disability benefit being paid continuously between the ages of 65 and 70 is remote.  He <Col N="708" /> knows only too well the many inquisitions that would take place into the claims of persons for benefit over a period of five years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands (a) the number of local persons interviewed by the Land Commission Inspector who were applicants for holdings on the Crosby Estate at Hodgestown and Gilltown, County Kildare, (b) the number of acres allotted by the Land Commission on this Estate, (c) the names and number of resident dependants of each person to whom land was allotted, (d) the distances at which they lived from the divided land, (e) the number of acres which each person received, (f) the number of acres, if any, which such persons held at the time the additional land was allotted, (g) whether any of the applicants had any interest in lands previously sold, (h) whether an Old IRA man who was an applicant for land was excluded from the scheme of division, (i) why portions of the estate were not given to the local applicants who were uneconomic holders, and (j) whether he will make a statement on the equity of the scheme for dividing the estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) (for the Minister for Lands)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following are the replies to the various parts of the Question:&mdash; (a) 61 persons; (b) 201 acres, approximately; (c), (d), (e) and (f) these parts of the Question relate solely to matters affecting the successful applicants on this estate.  Whilst there is, of course, no secrecy regarding the identity of allottees of these or any other lands, I feel very strongly that there should be the least possible invasion of the affairs of private individuals &mdash; even when they are the recipients of allotments of land.  For this reason &mdash; and having regard to the fact that the estate has been entirely allotted &mdash; I reluctantly give the particulars sought but only <Col N="709" /> to such extent as will not disclose personal or family information obtained by the Land Commission on a confidential basis from the persons concerned.  The replies are in the form of a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report; (g) None disclosed for successful applicants; (h) No; (i) 4 portions <Col N="710" /> of the estate were given to local uneconomic holders; (j) The claims of all applicants were fully investigated and considered by the Land Commissioners before the scheme of division for this estate was settled and operated.</P>

      <P>A claim for increases in the pay rates for members of the Force up to the rank of Chief Superintendent, which were fixed on 1st November last and which were in accordance with an agreement of the Garda Conciliation Council, was submitted on 13th January, 1962, for consideration by the Conciliation Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim was discussed by the Council on 19th February and disagreement was recorded.  On 9th March a written claim was submitted by the Garda Side to the Ministers for Justice and Finance for reference to the Arbitration Board, and a counterstatement <Col N="718" /> was prepared by the Official Side.  On 31st March, the Joint Representative Body for officers and other ranks, which is the authority under the Garda Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the nomination of the Members of the Force to represent them at arbitration proceedings, went out of office.  Before that, the Representative Body for Guards had informed me that they felt that only Guards should appear in relation to claims for Guards at Conciliation and Arbitration proceedings.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it seems to me that the only practicable course to take is to have the Arbitration proceedings held-over until the three Representative Bodies for officers, non-commissioned officers and men have been elected and are in a position, separately, to nominate negotiators. The elections will take place early in June.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress, I was referring to what I consider to be a very important announcement made by Deputy Donegan in the House this morning.  It was important in so far as it seemed to <Col N="720" /> indicate a radical change of policy on the part of Fine Gael towards the manner in which the health services are to be provided for those of our people who may require them.  Until the Deputy spoke, I had been under the impression that the attitude of Fine Gael towards our health services remained what it had been heretofore. Indeed, I felt that attitude had been manifested by them in the course of the debate more strongly than ever, and particularly in the attitude which they adopted towards the proposals in the Budget.</P>
      <P>In that connection, however, one must remember that, as I have said, Fine Gael have been from the outset, at least since 1946, opposed to the general approach of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party towards this problem of providing health services for our people.  I indicated how they opposed the Health Bill of 1946, the Health Act of 1947 and the Health Act of 1953 and how they broke up the first Coalition because the then Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne, their colleague, had decided to try to introduce a mother and child service.</P>
      <P>As I said, that appeared to be the general approach of Fine Gael until just this morning.  They appear to be still opposed to health services for the people, and to the extent that the individuals concerned are unable to meet the necessary outlay to the policy of providing them at the public expense.  While clamouring for an extension of the service, they refuse, at the same time, to allow the Government to raise the necessary funds to meet the expenditure involved.  That, of course, is a rather more subtle approach than that which they had adopted hitherto.  In just the same way as they are clamouring for higher and more extensive health services, they have been clamouring for higher pensions, greater assistance for the farmers, more for civil servants, etc., etc. but they refuse to take the responsibility for financing their demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Fine Gael had their way on 10th April last and last night, there would have been no money for any of these <Col N="721" /> things which they advocated so vigorously yesterday afternoon and this morning.  There would have been no money to meet the additional £1½ million which is to be expended on the maintenance, improvement and expansion of the health services this year, for they voted against imposing the taxes to provide the money.</P>
    <P>Emphatically, I want to say that I do not think our health services in their present state of development are as extensive as they could be, if more money were made available for them; nor do I say that in some places and in regard to certain services reasonable ground for complaint may not be found.  But in my experience complaints are becoming less frequent, less substantial and less well-founded.  I am hopeful that the services as they exist will rapidly improve as experience is gained and the defects of organisation and procedure are remedied.</P>
    <P>The important thing to remember in connection with the debate which took place this morning is that the 1953 Act broke new ground and the defects in its operation can be dealt with only as they manifest themselves in practice. We had no previous models to go on when we introduced the present extensive service.  Much has been done to remedy these defects in most areas. The services, indeed, taken by and large, work smoothly.</P>
    <P>Our biggest problem remains, that is how to deal with those who do not know their rights under the Act or who, knowing them, in an endeavour to secure something to which they are not entitled, try to evade the limitations imposed by the statute.  I have no doubt that we shall solve that problem, perhaps, by imposing on all who administer institutions, functioning under the 1955 Act, the onus of proving that before a patient, who was entitled to hospital services under Section 15 of the Act, elected to avail of the private or semi-private accommodation available in the institution concerned, was informed as to what his precise obligations would be, if he did so.  Under a proviso of this kind, the &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; would have no chance, and the innocent would be safeguarded against exploitation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> But let me assert again that the 1953 Act broke new ground.  Indeed, that is, perhaps, an understatement.  In fact, so far as the middle income group is concerned, the 1953 Act represented in its special purpose a social revolution. This may appear to those who are not aware of the facts a sweeping statement and hard to justify.  Yet the truth is that before the 1953 Act, the State made no provision whatsoever to meet the special needs for hospital and nursing care of the middle class&mdash; perhaps lower middle and middlemiddle class &mdash; if one, in this classless society of ours, classless, that is, from a social point of view, may use such terms.  Before the 1953 Act, the State was concerned to provide only for the medical needs of very much the lower economic strata in society.  Outside that economic condition, only the most meagre, if indeed, any provision at all, was made for the needs of any individual who might be classified as otherwise than among the very poor.</P>
    <P>If such provision were made at all before the 1953 Act, it was made only in respect of individuals who were compulsorily insured under the National Health Insurance Acts, and then only to a very limited extent. Outside this limited sector, no provision whatever was made for the special needs of those who were definitely outside the pauper zone. There was no provision made at all for the farmer, for the small shopkeeper, for those in the less well-paid grades of the State and local authority service or for the self-employed person.</P>
    <P>The 1953 Act changed all that, so far as the hospital and specialist services are concerned.  It gave to persons in all the classes I have mentioned the right, if they should so need, to be treated in hospital at the merest cost of maintenance, or where his economic circumstances justify it, even for less or much less than that, tapering down indeed to no charge whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Before the 1953 Act, only persons in two special categories were entitled to the hospital and specialist services demanded by their physical condition. <Col N="723" /> The first of these comprised persons who were literally paupers or only a few shillings per week removed from pauperdom.  The second consisted of those who were engaged as employees, as wage-earners, in insurable occupations. Furthermore, while persons in the first category were entitled as of right to hospital and medical or surgical treatment for an indefinite period, for as long as their condition warranted it, persons in the seond category were not entitled to treatment free of charge for longer than six weeks.</P>
    <P>Furthermore still, the right to hospital and medical or surgical treatment was confined to the insured individual itself.  It did not extend to his wife or children.  The position of the insured person and of all those who come within Section 15 of the 1953 Act is quite different.  There is no statutory limitation under the Act on his stay in hospital.  He is entitled to remain there until his medical advisers consider him well enough to go home.  Next, not only is the insured person entitled to hospital and medical or surgical care, but if they should require it, his wife and children also are entitled to all this until they are fit and well again.</P>
    <P>Apart from the development and expansion of the specialist services which has been made possible by the 1953 Act for everybody, this is the radical change which has been brought about by that Act.  But again let me repeat that I regard the 1953 Act as having provided a foundation only.  I think it is a sound foundation and one on which with confidence we may build.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the Select Committee which the Dáil has appointed will accept that point of view; and that the recommendations which it will make for the further development of the services will secure the unanimous endorsement of the Oireachtas.  If the deliberations of the Select Committee meet with this general acceptance, then this issue of the health services will be removed from the political arena.</P>
    <P>Having disposed of the general position in regard to the health services, I should like to deal with some points <Col N="724" /> relating to the administration of the code which were raised in the course of the debate.  A matter to which many Deputies referred was the assessment of means and they complained there appeared to be a lack of uniformity not merely as between one administrative area and another but even as between one individual and another. On a number of occasions, I have indicated to the House that an apparent lack of uniformity or of consistency of treatment may arise.  But let this be quite certain: nobody outside those dealing with his circumstances knows what the real circumstances of any particular applicant are.</P>
    <P>The information is regarded as confidential. That is so because of the need to preserve a certain amount of privacy or secrecy in a matter of this sort.  Deputy Kyne complained that the county manager would not make available to him certain information about holders of medical cards in some instances, or the circumstances of persons who had been refused medical cards in others.  The position there is quite clear for reasons which arise out of the requirements of medical secrecy. Paragraph 2 4 (4) of the Medical Services (Amendment) Regulations, 1955, states:</P>
    <P>A document which is obtained or compiled under these Regulations (or part or extract from such document) which contains the name of a patient shall not be published save with the consent in writing of the patient.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Kyne had secured the consent of the persons about whom he was making the inquiry, and that consent had been expressed in writing, then perhaps the county manager, having been in a position to give him the information sought, might have done so.  However, there is a certain difficulty even in that connection and it arises from the fact that the city or county manager is bound by a provision of the City and County Management Act of 1955 in relation to health functions concerning any particular person who has availed himself of a service.</P>
    <P>This matter was raised in a query <Col N="725" /> from a local authority which asked whether the regulation which I mentioned under the medical, services would apply to persons accepted for services.  On legal advice, we indicated in a letter to the health authority concerned that to give the names of persons accepted for services under the Health Act would not be a proper procedure.  Deputies will understand that there is justification for that decision in so far as if people, who were really in need of medical care, and were unable to provide it for themselves, knew that their circumstances might be made the subject of an examination, even by a member of a local authority, they might be deterred from applying at all and might deprive themselves of the service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the assessment of means, as I have said, no one except the individual applicant concerned knows what his real circumstances are. Aftef full and careful investigation, it is for the home assistance officer to determine what they are.  And sometimes, naturally, people are not too revealing about these matters, and do not treat the home assistance officer with the necessary candour.  The home assistance officer may have other means than that of direct inquiry from the applicant, of ascertaining what his circumstances are likely to be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  It is a discharge of a public duty to prevent a person who is not entitled to it from receiving a service at the expense of the community, by what is after all fraud or false pretences.  That matter will be the subject of consideration by the Select Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be very hard, having regard to the structure of our society, to find a better way of discharging this rather delicate duty of determining entitlements than that which is now in operation.  We are, of course, as we would be in the case of any system, very largely dependent upon the integrity of the general body of home assistance officers.  I have received complaints making allegations against the home assistance officers and charging them with partiality <Col N="726" /> and being unduly influenced, but I have never yet &mdash; let me say this &mdash; been able to verify any one of those allegations.  We have to proceed on the assumption that the home assistance officers are as honest as the rest of us, and as conscientious in the discharge of their duties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne also mentioned the hard case of a man who apparently received a present of a motor car.  I take it that he drove the motor car, and for that reason, his application for admission to the general medical register was turned down.  It would be very hard for any one of us, if we were in the position of a home assistance officer, to issue a medical card to a person in possession of a motor car and able to spend money on oil and petrol.  Let us face it.  One could make a hard case about the circumstanes of the unfortunate man upon whom this white elephant was foisted, but he cannot have it both ways.  He can, if he likes, sell the car and get a medical card, but if he wishes to retain the car and spend money on petrol and oil, he cannot get a card. At least, that is how I would look at it.</P>
    <P>The question of the right of appeal was also raised by Deputy Kyne and others.  That is a matter which has caused me a great deal of thought.  I should like to be able to say that I can see some way of establishing a right of appeal which would not be too cumbersome, and would not impose on the Minister the duty of investigating every complaint that he may receive from persons who are turned down for medical cards.  It is a matter which I know will be considered by the Select Committee in due course, since it has been mentioned on several occasions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne has also raised the point about the person over 16 years of age who might be covered by a medical card issued to his parents.  That cannot be done automatically.  The whole circumstances of the family would have to be taken into consideration. There are families who have an income of perhaps £20 or £25 coming into the house each week, and it is reasonable to expect that they would <Col N="727" /> be able to provide general medical care for their children.  That is all that is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Does the Minister consider it fair that where two local authority areas adjoin and there are two applicants with exactly the same means, one man's application will be granted and the other man's will not?</P>

      <P>It does not seem to me that there is any question of equity or fairness.

That must apply to adjoining counties also.</P>

Indeed, if Deputy Dillon and other Deputies had read their favourite newspaper this morning, and yesterday morning, they would have read that the chairman of one of these voluntary hospitals had publicly thanked me for what I had done to improve the conditions of the nurses.  He said that the situation was now at the stage at which there are indications that nurses who had trained here and gone to England were now tending to leave England and return to their own country.  In connection with the plea which was made to grant a 90-hour fortnight, may I say that that has already been authorised?</P>

      <P>I hope easier.  I was saying that I understood that, in Dublin, the Health Authority has agreed in principle to the introduction of the 90-hour fortnight.  Of course it <Col N="729" /> has to be remembered that the initiative and the onus of putting this into operation lies with the local health authority, in the first instance, but they have got the all-clear from me, provided arrangements for giving effect to the decision are not extravagant.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leneghan referred to the position of student nurses.  The position there is that, corresponding to the increase granted to trained nurses, a revised scale is also being introduced for student nurses.  The scale ranges from £275 in the first year to £400 in the fourth year.  These are inclusive salaries, a deduction being made in respect of maintenance.  What is being done for the junior nursing staff of the hospitals is being done also in relation to the senior nursing staffs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon complained about the delay which takes place in filling vacancies for dispensary doctors.  The responsibility for nominating persons to fill dispensary vacancies rests with the Local Appointments Commission and I know that they do everything they can, within reason, to have the vacancies filled as expeditiously as possible.  It must not be forgotten in that connection that the Commissioners have some difficulties to contend with.  First of all, it is not easy to get Selection Boards together. People are not unduly eager to give up their time serving on Selection Boards and, at the same time, one does not want to have the same people always on the boards because that could create a very undesirable situation. In the early days these competitions were held more frequently than they are now.  This resulted in widespread complaints from applicants that they had to come to Dublin several times as individual vacancies were advertised and it would be far better if vacancies were not advertised until there was a sufficient number of them available to make it possible to offer appointments to a reasonably large number of persons who had been found qualified to fill them.  After the Selection Board procedure there are the usual inquiries to be made about character and record.  These all take time and it is not easy, with the procedure, to make the period any shorter than it generally is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> Deputy Dillon also asked how long could a county hospital be without a county surgeon.  The position, of course, is that the county hospital should not be without a county surgeon, if that is at all possible.  But county surgeons are like the rest of us. They are subject to human ills, they may need a holiday, or some family circumstance may arise to prevent them from being in constant attendance at the hospital.  In general, however, as I said, the county surgeon should not be away from his hospital for an undue length of time, but if he is, a substitute should be put in.  The difficulty lies in getting substitutes. We are giving consideration to that matter and we may as a result be able to secure <i>locums</i> upon some sort of regular basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Hogan made what was rather an extraordinary speech, in the sense that he seemed to be a long way out of date.  He was not aware, apparently, of what has been happening in the health services over the past four or five years.  For instance, he referred to combined appointments as physician-obstetrician in the county hospitals.  Over two years ago, a decision was taken that the county physician, so called, would be required to be of consultant physician status, that is with a higher degree in medicine. A higher qualification in obstetrics is no longer sought for county physician posts.  Since the time I have mentioned, county physicians have been appointed in six areas under the revised qualifications and therefore the case made by the Deputy had been anticipated by me and put into practice over two years ago.  I should add, however, that while the county physicians appointed under the new conditions are not expected to deal with abnormal maternity cases or to hold specialist obstetric clinics, they are required to deal with normal maternity cases.</P>
    <P>As regards the appointment of anaesthetists to our county hospitals, the Deputy's strictures were again completely unwarranted.  As a separate specially, anaesthesia is of much more recent origin than the 40 years mentioned by the Deputy.  Indeed, it can be said that the general acceptance <Col N="731" /> of this development in the administration of anaesthetics is post-war and the Diploma in Anaesthetics was instituted only about 1943.  Since then, I must say we have appointed specialist anaesthetists and there are 50 such at present employed in the local authority services, which seems to be a long way removed from the picture Deputy Hogan presented to the House when he was speaking here.</P>
    <P>Some of the Fine Gael Deputies are very anxious to pick holes in our health services.  They decry them and run them down and do it on the assumption that the people listening to them are as ignorant as themselves of the real position.  Deputy Hogan questioned the need for a regional orthopaedic service.  He tried to suggest that orthopaedic surgeons were required only for fracture work.  That does not seem to be the case because the orthopaedic surgeons deal with all congenital, developed and acquired deformaties and skeletal diseases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Hogan was also quite erroneous in his conception of the functions of the chief medical officers of health in the county services.  I do not want to detain the House unduly, but I think I have dealt at sufficient length with Deputy Dr. Hogan to show that he is not a Deputy to whom we should give too much attention so far as the existing health services go.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke in regard to the proposed fluoridation of water supplies in Cork and tried to imply, in one way or another, that the Minister for Health was engaged in a piece of smart practice in relation to the ascertainment of fluorine content of public water supplies.  He said we had sent down a list of public water supplies to be examined and had omitted certain supplies from the list.  There is not a scintilla of truth in that.  The position is that the Cork Health Authority were asked to analyse all their public piped water supplies for fluorine &mdash; all of them without exception.  There are, of course, piped water supplies which are not public supplies, and over them we have no jurisdiction.  The result of the analysis of these Cork water supplies shows that only a small number <Col N="732" /> of them contain any traces of flourine, and then only to an insignicant extent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also alleged that insurance companies were in a position to secure X-ray photographs at a fee that would be less than the economic one.  I think the Deputy has been misinformed. As far as I know, no insurance company can get an X-ray free or at the amount which would be charged to a middle income person.  A person is entitled to an X-ray only at the request of a medical practitioner and only for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.  If an X-ray is required for any other purpose, it must be paid for in full.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy Desmond and Deputy Corry criticised the Department because of the condition of a substanial number of dispensaries in Cork.  The position there is a very simple one.  In 1952 it was decided to provide grants to assist local health authorities to improve the condition of their dispensaries.  That service was continued for five years.  It was introduced by Deputy Dr. Ryan and withdrawn by my immediate predecessor, Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>During that period the predecessors of the Cork Health Authority, who had a total of 129 dispensaries &mdash; 49 of which, I think, are not in a very creditable condition &mdash; provided only about 12 new dispensaries with the aid of grants amounting to £6,600.  The Health Authority made financial provision for the erection of eight new dispensaries in 1961.  That leaves a total of about 40 dispensaries in need of replacement. A new dispensary nowadays costs about £2,000, so that to replace all the defective dispensaries an outlay of £80,000 would be necessary. The loan charges payable on a loan of this amount from the Local Loans Fund over a period of 35 years amount to £5,700 a year, which is the equivalent of less than a penny in the £ in the rates for the area of the Cork Health Authority.  I suggest to Deputy Desmond and Deputy Corry that if the dispensaries are in the pitiable condition they alleged in the House today, they should induce their local health authority to put another penny on the <Col N="733" /> rates in order to provide the people of Cork with decent dispensaries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch expressed his appreciation of what I was trying to do in respect of mentally sub-normal children. The boot is on the other foot. I should like to express my deep appreciation to Deputy Lynch and those associated with him in this magnificent work they are doing in Waterford.  I have no doubt that the work of these voluntary organisations is likely to be very rewarding from every point of view, from the point of view of the child, of the parents, of the State and of the community.  I should again like to formally put on record how deeply grateful I am to those in Waterford&mdash; and in Cork and Drogheda and Dublin &mdash;who are associated with these projects. I trust that groups will be found in other urban centres who will imitate their actions in this manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch, however, and Deputy Dillon were on rather shaky ground when they suggested that one of the main causes of cancer might be the exhaust from diesel engines.  Deputy Vivion de Valera, in a very useful and informative speech today, covered practically the whole ground in relation to this problem of the causation of cancer. He quoted an authority who said it was possible that the exhaust from diesel engines might be one of the complex effectors which apparently operate to give rise to cancer conditions, particularly lung cancer.  The report of the Royal College of Physicians issued recently entitled <i>Smoking and Health</i> has been most useful in directing public attention to this problem. It has this to say on page 23:</P>
    <P>The possibility that motor vehicle exhausts might be an important cause of the recent increases in the incidence of lung cancer can be rejected since there is no increase in the lung cancer death rate among road haulage workers, who would be expected to have excessive exposure to such exhaust gases.</P>
    <P>I am not quoting that as infallible.  I am merely quoting it to show that there is a pronounced difference as to what the real effectiveness of the exhaust from combustion engines might be in <Col N="734" /> causing cancer.  I do not think I should worry the House about some of the other things which have been referred to.  I could deal at great length with what Deputy Donegan said; I did deal with some of his remarks when he was not here at the beginning and I do not think it is worth while going over that ground again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilhawley says the State does not meet 50 per cent. of the cost of the health services, as loan charges on capital expenditure are excluded. The Deputy, of course, forgets in that connection to mention that any substantial works which have been done by the local authorities generally receive a grant of about 50 per cent. from funds at the disposal of the Minister for Health, from moneys out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  He cannot have it both ways.  If he gets the grant, he cannot expect the State to meet half the capital charges upon the moneys borrowed by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leneghan seemed to be under the impression that we do not spend a great deal of money upon providing accommodation for the mentally handicapped.  The fact is that to date capital grants amounting to more than £1,700,000 have been spent in the provision of accommodation for the mentally retarded and the two major projects which I mentioned as being in progress will bring that figure to over £2,000,000.  In addition £400,000 to £500,000 is paid out annually by the local authorities in capitation grants to the authorities in these institutions for patients maintained in them at public expense, and of course the State finds half of that sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is going to be made retrospective, the increase in salaries.  That must be built into the framework of the payment to relate back to 1st November last year.  On the Budget, we were told that pensioners were to be treated better. Pensioners were divided into two classes, one of which was what were called the service pensioners and the Budget Statement of 10th April, 1962, said that to bring the service pensioners up to an appropriate figure having regard to the depreciation of money required £1,300,000.  The Minister said that could not be afforded; what he proposed to do was to give a quarter of that sum as from 1st August of this year, and to give another quarter some time later.  All we were told was that the full year would cost £675,000, that is to say, bringing the pensions up half-way to what is required to meet the increased cost of living because of the depreciation in the value of money.  As far as Civil Service pensioners are concerned, basing them entirely on the cost of living, they will get one-quarter of what they should get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pensions are included in the Bill relating to judges. Surely the Minister understands that if a judge is to get two-thirds of an amount, and that amount is increased by £2,000, he has increased his pension rights?  It is in relation to that that I am making my statement.  Further, these Civil Service pensioners will get on a calculation based entirely on the cost of living, without anything for improved standards, or anything like that, one-quarter starting on 1st August of this year.</P>
      <P>With regard to what are called social welfare pensioners, we were told, in a generous burst by the Minister for Finance, that they were to get something, something which would not relate entirely to the cost of living, but there was a feeling that this section of the community should be allowed to share in the general increase in the national prosperity, and that share in the general increase in the national prosperity works out at half-a-crown a week.  The payment of that will not start until some time later in this year.</P>
      <P>I take this provision with regard to the judges; whatever the provisions are, they are to date from 1st November, last year.  That means we are giving them a bonus of half a year into their hands.  Why?  In the speech made by the Minister on Second Reading he said that the date proposed had emerged as the date from which payments were being made.  Of course, it has not emerged as the date where other pensioners are concerned &mdash; by no means.  While it has emerged as a date possibly for those who forced advances by industrial activity, as they will, of course, get whatever date they can secure by their own industrial strength. I have heard no argument as to why the members of the Supreme and High Courts should get a bonus of a half year's increase, but that is the bonus increase that is being given to them. The Minister said it was entirely due to the fact that this date had emerged as a proper date for these retrospective payments.  That was the way in which he tried to gloss over this whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> It is, of course, well known that the effect of this will be to give an increased pension to a retired judge.  I think I am right in saying that.  It will increase the pension this retired judge has acquired by a sum of some £400 per year.  I do not know why that should be put forward as something we should accept at this time.  The person concerned became a High Court judge in the first instance: he was President of the High Court.  He then became President of the Supreme Court.  The salaries offered in respect of both these posts were clearly sufficient to attract him to take them.  Having gone through many years' service, he retired on an age limit on a pension amounting to two-thirds of his emoluments at the date of his retirement. Any of the arguments used about attracting the best men to the post can be applied to him, because he had been attracted and had served in the High Court and in the Supreme Court and had taken his pension.  I see no justification whatever for antedating the payment to be made to that individual by way of pension and, of course, in respect of his pension only.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other matters which are all to be antedated, I want to single out the position of the Chief Justice under this new legislation. What I say now will not apply with the same accuracy to the other members of the Supreme Court or to the President of the High Court, who is the second senior judge of the whole group; but I take the Chief Justice as an example because one can make an argument of an individual.  I want to disclaim immediately any question of criticising that particular individual. As far as I know him, and I know him quite well, I do not think the financial motive would be of any great consideration to him.  I think he would be quite agreeable to continue on the old rate, and I cannot believe is an individual who would be, so to speak, demanding in an aggrieved way an extra amount of money.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do with regard to him?  We will give him £6,000 a year with effect as from 1st November, 1961.  His colleagues will get, the highest of them, £4,500, and <Col N="739" /> the other judges, £4,000.  He will be put on a basis of £1,500 more than the highest paid other member of the court and £2,000 more than any of the ordinary judges of the Supreme Court.  I took the opportunity of the delay that has occurred to make inquiries with regard to other countries. The President of the Federal Supreme Court in America gets a slight increase on the salaries his colleagues in the Supreme Court get; it is 500 dollars, a very slight increase, and that is the only addition made to the salary of the Chief Justice in America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The salary is 35,000 dollars, £12,000.  That man presides over a court which caters for 50 individual states and for about 180,000,000 of a population.  We propose to give, for our less than 3,000,00 of a population, and threequarters of a state, our Chief Justice £6,000.  We are proposing more particularly to give him £1,500 more than the next highest paid judge and £2,000 more than the ordinary judges of the High Court&mdash;£1,500 more than most of them and £2,000 more than High Court judges.  I cannot understand why that enormous increase has been suggested for this individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the debate ran, I found it hard to get any argument for the proposal at all.  The Minister skated away from the analogy based on the cost-of-living figure but, in the end, he was accepting that this was a cost-of-living matter. He related it to the salaries paid in the public service.  Of course, the salaries in the public service are also related to the salaries paid in outside occupations.  To my astonishment, I found the main argument the Minister had was that, of the 57 judicial persons concerned in this Bill, 52 have salaries which do not exceed those paid to the holders of certain posts in the Civil Service, who were chosen for comparison.  When one thinks of the way in which the 57 judicial people with whom we are concerned here achieved their appointments, and remembers the way in which the highest <Col N="740" /> posts in the Civil Service are filled, the fallacy of the analogy is immediately apparent.  Those who are heads of Departments, secretaries and deputy secretaries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There will be no duplication.  The Minister refers us to the highest salaries in the Civil Service but there is no comparison whatever there.  The people who are recruited to the judiciary do not have to stand an examination.  I had something to do with the Department of Finance when we were seeking to establish the Civil Service of the new State and I know something of the methods by which people were recruited to the Civil Service.  The examination adopted in that instance was similar to the examination for the old Indian Civil Service which was one of the stiffest examinations in the world ranging over a great variety of subjects.  There was tremendous competition and for some of these people we developed what has become known as the junior administrative officers' examination. I know very few of those on the Bench of this country at the moment who could have taken the junior administrative officers' examination and these people have to wait a great many years before they can obtain any of the higher posts in the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another one which can be made and I will come to that in a moment.  It has been said that we will not get the best unless we pay them and there was also <Col N="742" /> the confused statement made that people were making so much at the Bar that they would not take judicial posts at the old rates.  In the Second Reading debate, it finally emerged that there was one person who was invited to take a post and would not take it.  It was not stated that his refusal to take that post was purely on salary grounds.  Somebody else made the calculation that there were two or three people who were earning so much at the Bar that they would not take this office.  That argument defeats itself because, in the Second Reading debate, the Minister was speaking of earnings of £8,000 a year and upwards at the Bar.</P>
      <P>There are a certain number of people who are so earning, but to go on and say that unless we give the Chief Justice £6,000 a year, people would not be attracted to the post is not an argument that convinces me. No matter how high you put the salary to attract the best men, it is not the best men who are offered the posts.  I have a fair knowledge of those who have been at the bar and who have gone on to the Bench and I can only think of one person alone in whose case the statement can be made that the person concerned was the Leader of the Bar at the time he was appointed.  It is true to say that when a judicial appointment comes to be made, it is not a question of getting a suitable candidate but the trouble is that people who think themselves suitable are falling over themselves to get the appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absurd to consider this matter only in regard to salary.  I am taking this figure of £6,000 as an example.  The situation at the moment is that a judge must retire at the age of 72 and that he may retire at the age of 65 if he is lucky enough to have 15 years' service.  If he was appointed at the age of 50, he can retire on full pension at the age of 65 and the pension is two-thirds of the emoluments of the post at the time of retirement.  If I take £6,000 as the salary of a Chief Justice who has served for a number of years, it means that he goes out on a pension of £4,000 a year.</P>
      <P>I made inquiries at various actuarial sources and I discovered that no matter what a man's earnings might be, he would find it hard to set aside enough money to give him a pension of £4,000 a year at the age of 72.  I got calculations made as to what would be the price of an annuity for a person aged 72, taking the ordinary rate of expectation of life into account, and I was told that it would cost approximately a sum of £30,000.  What we are proposing to do now is to allow a person to serve for a number of years at £6,000 a year and at the end of that time, to provide him with the equivalent of a gift of £30,000.  That is a substantial sum and I do not know what the equivalent figure in the Civil Service would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are any number of people who take posts on the Bench who are not easily attracted by the salary.  I am quite sure that many <Col N="744" /> members of the Bar who are earning big sums of money would take half their earnings in order to get on the Bench.  A man making a very big sum of money at the Bar is living a very hard life.  It is a very inhuman profession in that way.  A man who gets to the top of the tree in the counsel's profession at the moment is not getting much in the way of relaxation during his working days.  Although the courts go on vacation quite often, the counsel has to work all the time.  Ease in life is a thing that counts.</P>
      <P>Recently there was a television show in England.  A Labour member of Parliament was put on against one of the big tycoons of industry.  In the end, the question turned on how much each was getting.  The Labour member of Parliament indicated his salary.  He had some outside occupation and he gave that, too.  He then asked the big industrialist what he was getting.  He received a very evasive reply.  He said he was paying 19/- in the £ income tax but he did not give any sum that he was paid.  He was pursued further. The question was put to him as to how much he took home weekly as opposed to the Labour Member of Parliament.  There was quite a controversy on that matter as far as television and radio were concerned.</P>
      <P>One of the English newspapers took up the point afterwards.  They said they thought it was quite a proper question to ask.  They asked if anybody refused a rise in salary because it went from 17/- in the £ to 19/-in the £ in income tax.  This Sunday newspaper went on to say that for a judge or a Prime Minister the salary must be realistic.  It was pointed out that one must also consider how many people would accept the post of a Prime Minister or a judge in England at a cut price rate because there were incentives other than money&mdash;power, importance in the public eye and forced adulation.  I do not know whether these things count with those who go on the Bench in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an honourable ambition to get on the Bench.  I am quite sure that ease in life, the fact that a person is not driven morning and night at his work, does count and makes many a man take for a judgeship a sum much <Col N="745" /> below what he was earning at the Bar.</P>
    <P>I can see no argument whatever at present for paying a Chief Justice in this country £6,000 per annum when to that is added the fact that, after serving for, say, 15 or 20 years he can go out with a pension of £4,000.  That is completely iniquitous in this country and it is particularly so when one knows of the recent Budget matter. The service pensioners of the State will get, from next August, only one-quarter of what it is agreed they should get, if their pension were paid in good money instead of bad money.  When we come to the social pensioners, the old age pensioners, and so on, we are told they are sharing in the national prosperity and in that way it is measured at 2/6 a week starting from next August.  Under these circumstances, to put a person on a level of £6,000 per annum with a pension of £4,000 per annum after a certain number of years' service is completely out of proportion.  I do not know what has inspired the bringing in of such legislation.</P>
    <P>I shall mention one other argument used on Second Reading because I want to put it aside.  It was said that if we did not pay these people enough, they might become corrupt.  That was denied but there was the quotation by Deputy Corish from what the Taoiseach said on the Courts of Justice Bill, 1959.</P>

It means putting them into a position in which they will be, as far as possible, immune from improper influence of any kind, and it is no exaggeration to say, in my view, that an adequate and, indeed, a generous basis of remuneration for judges is the basis of their independence.</P>
