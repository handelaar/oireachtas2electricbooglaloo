    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to reports stating that France was willing to keep Britain informed of the progress of the negotiations on political union among the member-countries of the EEC; and whether this country will receive information of a similar type on the course of the negotiations from Britain, France, or any other source.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach if in view of the recent decision by Dr. Adenauer and General de Gaulle to negotiate a political settlement prior to admitting further members to the EEC he intends to look for consultations as to the form this political union will take in order to ensure that Ireland's point of view on such a political union will be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, aware that Britain is being kept informed by the Six about the progress of these negotiations. In this connection I would refer Deputies to the answer I gave to Questions addressed to me in this House on the 2nd May.  We, naturally, receive information on these matters from our diplomatic representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact <Col N="2932" /> that there is nothing static about this and that, therefore, referring Deputies to replies given on 2nd of May has no point, would the Taoiseach not consider asking the British Government to give him information as to what the political implications are likely to be, in view of the fact that he has stated that if Britain joins the Common Market, we must also join?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the logic of that.  The reference is to a certain meeting which is to take place in a couple of months hence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the possible effect of European political union on this country if we adhere to the Common Market, would the Taoiseach consider the question of making some type of representation which might keep open the question of the concrete form of any political union until such time as we get an opportunity of expressing our views on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We must keep our sense of realities in this matter.  It is obvious that Britain's accession to the European Community raises political problems for the present members of the Community.  Our accession does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach try to keep in touch with the countries who are members of the EEC at present in regard to the likely political implications?  Have we any channel, direct or indirect, through which the Government could be given an indication of what form political union is likely to take, especially in view of the fact that this country was first in with its application to join EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information that we desire in this respect comes through our diplomatic representatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact we are applicants for admission as full members of EEC for a quite a considerable time now and, as the whole concept of the Common Market is based on equality, co-ordination and <Col N="2933" /> co-operation, would it not be regrettable if the political union took a definite shape almost on the eve of our admission and we were denied an opportunity of expressing our viewpoint on the character of that union?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (1)  on what grounds the Attorney General moved to have the trial of Senator Quinlan transferred from Thurles Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court, despite the expressed willingness on the part of Senator Quinlan to meet the charges brought against him under the Road Traffic Acts on the earliest possible occasion, i.e. the May Session of the Thurles Circuit Court, where he appeared in person and through his solicitor; and (2)  why it was necessary to allow four months to elapse between the date of the accident and the notice of decision to prosecute being served on Senator Quinlan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>(1)  The statutory provision for transfers of criminal trials from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court was designedly framed in a way which made it unnecessary to state to the Court the reason for a transfer, whether the application is made by the prosecution or by the defence, and it has not been the practice to state reasons to the Court.  It will be appreciated that in such circumstances it would be undesirable if reasons were to be elicited in answer to Parliamentary Questions.</P>
      <P>(2)  With reference to the second part of the question, the accident happened on 12th November, 1961, and notice of intention to institute a prosecution was served on 20th November, but as one of the two men injured in the accident was seriously ill it was not possible to take a statement from him for a period of two months.  The issue of the summonses followed the normal course after the Garda file was completed, and there was no unusual delay.</P>
      <P>It was so taken in this case.  I have</P>

    <Col N="2934" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not quite exceptional procedure in a case of this character, where the defendant expressed his ready willingness to defend himself at the earliest opportunity at the local venue, which in this case was the Thurles Circuit Court, for the Attorney General to move for a transfer of the trial to the Central Criminal Court when there were no exceptional circumstances surrounding the allegations preferred by the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is obviously trying to get me to answer a question which I have already indicated it would be undesirable to answer by way of Parliamentary Question.  There is a procedure whereby such cases can be transferred to the Central Criminal Court without any reason being stated and it is obviously undesirable that the purpose of that procedure should be negatived by way of a Dáil Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not see that there are reasonable grounds for the gravest misgiving when a person who is prominent in the public life of the country and who is associated with severe criticism of many of the Government's activities is kept in the unhappy situation in which Senator Quinlan found himself for a period of seven or eight months at a time when he was ready and willing to dispose of the charges against him, while others who are equally prominent in the public life were treated with special consideration by the Attorney General in respect of charges brought at his instance which resulted in immediate conviction and the imposition of penalties? When Senator Quinlan was brought before a jury, one of the charges was withdrawn by the trial judge and the jury took only about three minutes to acquit him of the other.  Does the Taoiseach think that this is an equitable discharge of the discretion conferred on the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to prosecute or not in cases of this kind can be taken by the Garda authorities without reference to the Attorney General. <Col N="2935" /> explained that there is a reason why the Attorney General assented to the transfer to the Central Criminal Court. In this case, no injustice was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not also clear that there was some reason why the Attorney General should decide that this case be transferred, despite the fact that the defendant was perfectly willing to have it dealt with at the local venue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to prosecute was taken by the Garda authorities without reference to the Attorney General.  As regards the decision to transfer the venue, the Attorney General agreed to the proposal of prosecuting counsel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not also a fact that the file was sent to the Attorney General and that there is grave ground for comment that one man was treated in one way and another man in another?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one was convicted and the other was acquitted.  The difference was that in one case penalties were imposed and in the other case, the judge threw out one charge and the jury contemptuously dismissed the allegation of the Attorney General in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the current revenue of general government as a percentage of gross national product at current market prices for Ireland, the United Kingdom and each member country of EEC.  Corresponding data are not available for Britain and the Six Counties separately.  The information has been extracted from the United Nations Yearbook of National Accounts 1961 in which the definitions used are those of the UN System of National Accounts and supporting tables.  The latest year for which the data are available is 1960.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has seen a report of the alleged seizure of certain foodstuffs from a troop of scouts; and if he will state the facts in relation thereto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>A party of boy scouts arrived on the mail boat at Dún Laoghaire on the evening of Monday, 16th of July. When their baggage was being <Col N="2937" /> examined by the Customs the leader of the party declared and produced, <i>inter alia</i>, 2 lbs. of bacon rashers and 2 dozen poultry eggs.  It was explained to him that in accordance with statutory instruments made by the Minister for Agriculture the importation of these goods was prohibited in order to guard against the introduction of swine fever and fowl pest.  Since the goods had been freely declared he was offered the option of re-exporting them immediately.  This offer was not, however, accepted and the goods were, therefore, seized and subsequently destroyed by burning.  The Customs have no discretion in relation to these prohibitions and they acted quite properly throughout.</P>
      <P>We all have the greatest sympathy with the scouts because of the predicament in which they found themselves. Nevertheless I should mention, though it will be poor consolation to the scouts, that many other people have had these sorts of goods seized by the Customs.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that in the case of these agricultural prohibitions any exception to the rule, however small, could go far to defeat the very purpose of the rule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that, with a view to promoting the tourist industry, a responsible officer of customs, having exercised his discretion and having destroyed, as he was bound to do, the 2 lbs. of rashers would have called in his junior officer and asked him to go up to Dún Laoghaire and buy some rashers so that these scouts would not have had to go without their breakfast?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a)  On 30th June, 1962, the number of people employed in the Shannon Free Airport Industrial Estate in manufacturing, processing, or in any way producing goods for export was 1,203 and (ii)  in factory building operations was 348.  The figures mentioned at (i) and (ii)  represent the greatest numbers employed at any time in these operations.  Employment is given by the following manufacturing firms:&mdash;Lana-Knit (Ireland) Ltd., Progress (International) Ltd., Rippen Ltd., Shannon Diamond &amp; Carbide Ltd., Sony Ltd., Spee Ltd., Standard Pressed Steel International Ltd. and Supersonic (Ireland) Ltd.</P>
      <P>(b)  As I indicated to the Deputy in my Reply to his Question of the 12th July, 1961, records were commenced on 1st July, 1961, and it had been hoped that export statistics would be available from that date onwards.  I understand, however, from the Central Statistics Office, by whom the records are being compiled, that complete returns have not yet been received.  I am not in a position therefore to say when export statistics will become available.  For the Deputy's information, the Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd. have estimated that the value of goods exported from the Industrial Estate in the financial year ended 31st March, 1962, was of the order of £3 million.</P>
      <P>(c)  Grants paid to industrialists under the Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd. Acts, 1959 and 1961, up to 30th June, 1962, amounted to £375,000.  No contribution was made to the firms for exports (i)  by the State, but firms qualify for tax remissions under the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1958, and (ii) firms in the Estate are entitled to the usual remission of rates for new factory buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  With the exception of the <Col N="2941" /> special factory constructed by Rippen Ltd. to their own specification, the factory bays in the zone are built to a standard design by the Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd. and are financed out of State capital invested in the Company under the Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd. Acts, 1959 and 1961.  As at 30th June, 1962, twenty bays have been completed and a further seven were under construction.  Expenditure up to 30th June, 1962, on the construction of factories amounted to £1.53 million.  At present nineteen bays and one special factory are occupied by firms engaged on manufacture for export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Total capital expenditure in the financial year 1961/62 on or towards (a)  Shannon Airport was £314,293, (b)  Dublin Airport was £349,613, and (c)  Cork Airport was £659,089.  The corresponding figures for the period from the inception of the airports to 31st March, 1962 are (a)  £4,929,235, (b)  £2,767,232 and (c) £1,116,572.  Receipts from the three airports are not allocated directly either to payment of capital or payment of interest but in calculating the operating results of each Airport interest on capital is debited at 5 per cent.  which is an average rate.  Depreciation on capital is also debited at an average rate of 4 per cent.  The Estimates for the current financial year provide for capital expenditure <Col N="2942" /> of £458,000 for Shannon Airport, £785,000 for Dublin Airport and £142,000 for Cork Airport.  The Estimates for 1963/4 and 1964/5 are not yet available.  They will be published in the official Estimates for these years.</P>

If a lender purported to appoint a Receiver in circumstances other than those to which the borrower had agreed, the borrower could take legal action to protect his interests.  The question of enacting legislation does not, therefore, arise.</P>

Is the Minister further aware that failure to interfere in such manner can result in the circumstances set out?  From that point of view, would the Minister not agree it might be desirable to consider amending legislation?</P>

      <i>(a)</i> The Social Welfare Act, 1948, revoked cash supplements with effect from January, 1949, and raised the maximum amount payable to an old age pensioner from 15/- per week in urban areas (10/- pension plus 5/- cash supplement) and 12/6d. per week in rural areas (10/- pension plus 2/6d. cash supplement) to 17/6d. per week in all areas. Pensioners with dependants who had been receiving more by way of pension and supplement than 17/6d., or other appropriate weekly rate payable from 7th January, 1949, did not gain any increase but were allowed to retain the greater amount.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i> Cash supplements were payable in addition to unemployment assistance up to 17th August, 1948.  The Social Welfare Act, 1948, revoked the provisions of Orders under which these supplements were paid and merged the amounts thereof with unemployment assistance as from 18th August, 1948.  The change did not result in any increase in the amount payable to recipients of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Might I ask if there is any explanation forthcoming from the Chairman of the Select Committee as to the reason why the period for reporting back is being extended to 31st March, 1963?  When the Select Committee was set up to examine into the health services, the idea was that the examination would be expeditious and that a prolonged and unnecessary delay such as seems to arise now would not be tolerated. The House was given an assurance that before November next, we would have some indication in the form of a preliminary report from the Select Committee as to their proposals.  Now, the Chairman of the Select Committee comes into this House and asks for an extension of time to March, 1963. Before the House gives authority for that extension, we must have the fullest possible information from the Chairman of the Committee as to the reason for the postponement and an indication as to when a final report will be ready.</P>

      <P>The Select Committee has met on a number of occasions since its appointment.  There was a meeting on 13th March, followed by meetings on 29th May, 19th June and 10th July.  Representations from interested bodies and persons who would be prepared to give information were invited by newspaper advertisement on 19th March.  In the advertisement, it was requested that these representations be received on or before 12th May.  In the event, a very considerable volume of representations was received by that date.  When the Select Committee was made aware that representations from a number of other responsible bodies were in the course of preparation and would not be available before 12th May, the Committee decided to extend the date to the 15th August, 1962.  It has transpired since then that a number of health authorities, including Dublin Corporation, would not be in a position to have their representations in by the 15th August.  Having regard to the desirability of having representations from as many representative bodies as possible, the Select Committee has decided that it could not possibly complete its work within the time assigned.  It was felt, and rightly so, that an extension of time was both necessary and desirable and it was unanimously decided that 31st March should be the extended date.  Accordingly, I ask that the motion be approved.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a little balm for the Minister.  Since the last day in respect of one of the cases in which I had a most unfortunate experience, <Col N="2959" /> the private firm in question rang me up and told me the delay was entirely theirs and not that of CIE.  Therefore, ventilation in the House provides at least that slight solace for the Minister. However, we adjourned on the last occasion with the Minister still going to see his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to discuss the question of the tabling of specific contracts. I notice in the Order Paper to-day there is no reference to such tabling.  Therefore, before we proceed further on the section, it might be advantageous to the House if we heard what the Minister's present view on the subject is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given careful consideration to the suggestion by Deputy Sweetman that the contract between CIE and General Motors should be appended to this Bill or alternatively laid on the Table of the House.  I can find no grounds for the assertion by the Deputy that this would be in accordance with normal practice.  The precedents he quoted did not refer to commercial contracts &mdash;one was an agreement between the Minister for Agriculture and the owners of Johnstown Castle for the taking over of the Castle as a gift to the State; the other related to an agreement about rents between the Dublin Artisans Dwellings Company Ltd. and their Tenants Association which was being given legal effect by the Rents Restriction Act, 1960.  I am aware of no precedent for scheduling to a Bill or tabling in the House a commercial contract between a State body and a private company.  Moreover, similar contracts made between Government departments and private companies are always treated as confidential and successive Governments have refused for obvious reasons of public policy to publish such documents or disclose details of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is not being asked to ratify a specific contract between CIE and General Motors Corporation.  If Deputies will look at Section 2 of the Bill, they will find that in the first place they are being asked to empower the Minister for Finance to guarantee contracts entered into by CIE and in the <Col N="2960" /> second place, to empower the Minister for Finance to guarantee this particular contract.  As I explained on the Second Stage, the reason for including this special provision was that the Government, in order to enable CIE to avail themselves of the attractive terms offered, undertook to provide the necessary guarantee, subject to the enactment of legislation.  Having anticipated the general authority of the Oireachtas to give such guarantees, the Government considered it only courtesy to the House to seek their special retrospective sanction for the authorisation by the Minister for Finance in respect of this particular contract.</P>
    <P>It is not strictly necessary to do so at all and I am advised that the Bill would be entirely effective, even if subsection (2) of Section 2 were deleted. If the Dáil preferred, I would be willing to delete subsection (2) of Section 2 and to move an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.  There is no question of scheduling future contracts which may be guaranteed under this provision or of laying them on the Table of the House.  Particulars of the guarantees will be reported annually to the Oireachtas as provided for in Section 6 and this is the normal provision of the kind.</P>
    <P>As I said, the object of the Bill is to give certain powers to the Minister for Finance to be exercised in his discretion and to give him, so to speak, covering sanction in the case in which he has already made a commitment in principle.  It is no object of the Bill to obtain Dáil approval for the contract.  The reason why CIE, with the encouragement and approval of the Government, decided to acquire these locomotives on the instalment terms offered was not, as insinuated by Deputy Browne, that they could not otherwise get the money.  It was because the terms were so advantageous, being better than those on which CIE can raise money at home. These terms are so advantageous because I understand the transaction qualifies in the United States for special export credit financing and this is also the reason why the Government guarantee is required.</P>
    <P>The merits of the contract do not <Col N="2961" /> arise.  The contract was entered into by the Board of CIE on their sole responsibility under the powers conferred on them by the Transport Act, 1950.</P>

      <P>CIE did not seek or receive any official approval of this contract.  I have not myself seen the contract nor the seven other tenders received by the Board and I do not propose to see them.  What CIE sought and were given was an assurance that the necessary guarantee would be forthcoming to enable them to secure the very advantageous financial terms offered.  It is the giving of that assurance to CIE that the House is being asked to endorse, not the terms of the contract nor the technical design of the locomotives, nor the arrangements for maintaining them, all of which are the sole responsibility of the Board of CIE, entrusted to them by enactment of this House.</P>
      <P>Neither I, nor my Department, see or approve contracts entered into by CIE, though they are, of course, open to inspection by the auditors of CIE in due course.  Indeed, if affairs were ever to reach a stage where I considered it necessary or desirable that contracts entered into by the Board should be submitted for official inspection or approval, I would obviously have lost confidence in the Board and should seek their replacement. I have not lost confidence in the Board or their Chairman.  They are, despite much unfair and misinformed criticism from both inside and outside this House, carrying out a very difficult and thankless job. They stand to make no private gain from pursuing the policy they have determined on and in which they are guided by a sense of public duty and the specific directives laid down by this House in the relevant statutes.  I can only describe as mean and unworthy many of the attacks which have been made on them and their Chairman.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Dr. Browne's innuendoes about the technical specifications of the diesel locomotives, I must again point out that these matters are the sole responsibility of CIE.  Under the legislation, I have no function unless it were established that CIE are operating these locomotives in a manner which contravenes safety regulations.  This is not the case and the matter does not, in any case, arise on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in the sermon the Minister chooses to read.  However, apart from that, he made one concrete suggestion.  He thinks it might be preferable to drop subsection (2) altogether.  Personally, my view is that when a contract is named in a Bill, it must be made available to the people concerned with the enactment of that Bill.</P>
      <P>I remember other occasions, in addition to the two I mentioned the other day, when the principle was negotiated and accepted after some discussion on both sides of the House.  My reaction, frankly, is that it would be better to drop subsection (2) altogether than to have the subsection without the contract being tabled.  I propose to consider that between now and Report Stage and to deal with the matter either by way of amendment to the section on Report, leaving the contract in, or by the method the Minister has suggested, deleting subsection (2).</P>

As reported at Column 2928 of the Official Report of Thursday, 19th July, 1962, I asked the Minister to clarify to the House whether he had power under the Transport Acts to disclose certain information that was asked for in this House, and, if he had that power, to disclose that information or, if he had not the power, to let us know.  The Minister comes in here today and reads out a statement that was prepared for him no doubt by some of the gentlemen in CIE who have been under criticism here.</P>

It was done in consultation with the Department of Finance, preserving the position in future in relation to State companies.</P>

      <P>The Minister made it quite clear that he will use this important speech, which he has just read and of which none of us has a copy, as a means of attacking Deputies for daring to suggest that information should be made available to the public.  The sum involved in this measure is six million dollars.  When Deputies ask questions as to the expenditure of that money on locomotives, surely it is not the Minister's function to come in here and to criticise the Deputies for asking for information on matters which every man in the street is anxious to know about?  Have we reached the stage in this democratic institution that it is an offence now for public representatives to query the expenditure of public money?</P>
      <P>Not alone are Deputies criticised by the Minister for their interest in the expenditure of money but they are criticised for even suggesting that the present set up as regards State companies in general is unsatisfactory. They are criticised for daring to suggest that the Minister and his appointees, the directors on the Board of CIE, are not doing their job in the public interest.</P>

      <P>This House is being asked by the Minister to guarantee a State body in connection with the expenditure of six million dollars on the purchase of locomotives.  I maintain it is my duty and my right in this House to question the expenditure of the guarantee that the Minister requests for this semi-State body.  It is a fundamental right of a Deputy to be in a position to question the right to guarantee it or the wisdom of guaranteeing it and to discuss, in the long run, whether or not the case put forward by the Minister in requesting the guarantee is strong enough to sway the House.  That is all I want to get clear on.  Arising out of the sum which the House is asked to guarantee, it would be no harm for us to consider that the Minister's action and his attitude in this House since this section came under discussion has done more to harm and discredit first-class State bodies or semi-State bodies than anything I have heard in a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has failed to disclose what, in my opinion, is information that should be made available to the House.  He has sought to suggest that he is not in a position to disclose it. As on other occasions, he has hidden behind sections and provisions of the Transport Act.  I have here to-day a letter from you, Sir, in which you tell me that it is with great regret&mdash;as usual&mdash;that you find you cannot allow <Col N="2967" /> a question to the Minister for Transport and Power regarding the agent who placed the contract and the firms who were asked to tender for the supply of the diesel electric locomotives for CIE.  &ldquo;The Ceann Comhairle states that the Minister has no official responsibility for these matters&rdquo;&mdash;that is what the Ceann Comhairle says.  The Minister comes in to-day and proceeds to give certain information in the form of a written statement to the House, information that would not have been made available, were it not for the fact that last week a number of Deputies, including Deputy Dr. Browne in particular, taught the Minister a lesson in Parliamentary democracy and forced him, as a result of their criticisms, to come forward and give information which is of interest to the public.</P>

      <P>This is the only section of importance in the Bill.  The whole discussion arises on this section. I do not intend to speak again.  This is the kernel of the whole matter.  If we have a situation arising that the House can be asked to guarantee the expenditure of £2,000,000 and put no questions, the questions of contracts, the question of the agents who placed the contracts, the question of other firms who were asked to tender, do not arise at all and the public have no right to information about money which they are asked to raise or guarantee.  That <Col N="2968" /> would appear to me to be the position that has arisen here.  All I can say to the Minister is that I hope he will have another look at this situation which obtains regarding the liaison or the understanding that exists between himself and CIE.</P>
      <P>The Minister the other day spent quite a considerable amount of time referring me to the Taoiseach's speech when I asked him, on this particular section, to explain the situation as to why he could not give more detailed figures and information about the way this money raised under this guarantee was going to be expended.  He said: &ldquo;I would refer the Deputy to the statement made by the Taoiseach to the Institute of Public Administration on the powers and liberties of State bodies.&rdquo;  That is no answer to the public or to me when the Minister is asked to give a straight answer.  When a Deputy asks a question of that nature, there is no use referring him to a speech made six or eight months ago, or two years ago, as the case happens to be, by a Taoiseach or any other member of the Government.  For the Minister's information, in that particular speech the Taoiseach made it quite clear that if there was a demand in this House for closer co-operation and collaboration between members of this House and a State body, he was prepared to examine such a suggestion carefully.  If such a suggestion had been adopted, I do not think we would have today the trouble which the Minister has brought on himself, as far as CIE is concerned.  There is, in my opinion, a feeling of contempt amongst the Government-appointed directors for this House.  When the Minister in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate your latitude, Sir.  I just felt that when the sum of money is of such magnitude it was not inappropriate to point out to the Minister that if certain suggestions made from time to time over the years in this House had been adopted this long discussion on the guaranteeing of £2,000,000 would not have taken place.  All I can say at this stage is that I will wait for a further opportunity to deal with the wider aspects of the policy of the Government and of CIE as far as railways are concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister now, before this section is put to the House, to let us know whether it is a fact that he has no authority as Minister to ask CIE for the name of the agent who placed the contract.  Has he the power to find out also what the position was in regard to the other companies who might be interested in tendering?  Has the Minister power to request CIE to give that information?  I know he has told a number of Deputies, including myself and Deputy Dr. Browne, to apply direct to CIE, to Dr Andrews and the directors, for information which he will not give in this House.  What are Deputies to do if they apply to the Chairman of CIE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He has nothing to say when serious matters in this connection are under discussion, and he comes in to interrupt a debate in which he evidently has no intention of taking part.  Will the Minister give the information which was asked for a half a dozen times last Thursday?

Is he or is he not going to make that information available to the House?</P>

      <P>I think everyone in the country except the Deputy knows who the agents for General Motors are.  Under the 1950 and the 1958 Acts, I have not got the power to ask CIE who the agents are for any particular company.  I would consider this matter in a different way, and I hope my successor would.  If a position were reached where I felt it was desirable to make a serious inquiry in regard to the giving of any particular contract, I would unfortunately have lost confidence in the Board and in the chairman of the company and I would have begun to make serious inquiries into the management of the company.  I am glad to say that that situation has not arisen as far as I can recall in the whole history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2971" /> So far as asking questions and receiving information are concerned, I would ask Deputies to read statements I made at the conclusion of the debate on the Estimate for my Department last year and at the commencement and conclusion of the special debate on the report of CIE.  They will get there a very fair indication of what I feel is the kind of information which is useful to the House, which it is essential that they should have for discussion in relation to the general operations of State companies.</P>
    <P>My successor may perhaps go a little further or he may not go as far, but there is no law which prescribes precisely the personal attitude of the Minister towards Deputies in relation to State companies.  A tradition has been built up that State companies should be able to operate without day-to-day interference from the Minister and without political interference. In relation to this transaction and in relation to State companies, I have given a great deal of information to the House at all times.  But there comes a point where serious interference with the day-to-day operations of particular State companies begins. We would then start creating precedents which would inevitably involve political interference or interference on behalf of the interests of one group or the interests of another.  If we start interfering, we may be quite sure that we will not get satisfactory directors for the board; we will not get a satisfactory chairman and we will not even get satisfactory higher executives.  The directors of State companies want to feel that they are working on a commercial basis and free from interference of a political kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister amazes me by his statement.  You, Sir, very properly ruled that Deputy McQuillan was completely out of order.  The Minister then gets up and replies to the statements which Deputy McQuillan should not have made and which he should not have taken cognisance of, according to your ruling. The Minister starts off with not a word about the section but tells us what he said in the debate on his Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>You are very generous, Sir, or else you are hard of hearing on one side.  What the Minister really dealt with in reply to Deputy McQuillan was his Estimate, and that Deputy McQuillan should not have been so ungentlemanly as to ask the questions he did.  You had already ruled that they were not in order and that they were not debatable.  The Minister opened up the whole thing again.  What I want to get at is the section itself.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the section is one in which we do two things.  We give the Minister power to go security for various sums and in subsection (2):</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the Minister may guarantee, in such form and manner and on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit, the due payment by the Board to the General Motors Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit he had already the power he wants to do that in subsection (1) and <Col N="2973" /> that he does not need this subsection at all.</P>
    <P>Having got this power, he now brings to the House details of a specific transaction, plus the name of a firm, and then he will not tell us what the contract is with that firm.  Neither will he put it on the Table of the House, but he wants to make the House a party to this contract of CIE so that at a future date no one of us will be able to say he was wrong because the Minister will be able to reply: &ldquo;You gave me this power and you did not even push it to a division.&rdquo;  That is what would happen if we gave the Minister this power without his giving us all the information we require.  All we want is that a copy of the contract be placed in the Library together with information as to who the agents are as well as the company itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister very blandly tells us that everybody knows who the agents of General Motors are.  I suppose certain people in this town do but I knock about quite a bit and I regret to say I do not.  That may be my fault, but surely when we ask the Minister who the agents are, confessing that we do not know, the least the Minister should say is: &ldquo;Everybody knows the agents are so and so&rdquo;. Accordingly, the Minister would be well advised to take out the subsection or, alternatively, give us the information we have asked for.  Only in those circumstances would we consider what we should do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised the very much wider question of State companies in general and not merely in relation to the particular section we are discussing.  Nobody will for a moment suggest it is not a vexed and difficult problem, but when we are considering State companies here we nearly always start out on the wrong foot.  The classic examples of State companies are to be found in Scandinavia&mdash;Norway, Sweden and, I think, Finland.  They have set a pattern of their own in this respect.  In Sweden and Norway the capital investment programme of the State company and the funds for that are not formulated by the State company itself but <Col N="2974" /> by Parliament.  The money is paid to the company out of Parliamentary funds and it is on that Vote that the capital investments of the State companies concerned are debated in Parliament.</P>
      <P>We must also know that in relation to the whole Scandinavian concept of the control of State companies it is against a background of an economic form of public administration, particularly in Sweden, where every journalist has the right to go into any civil service office at any time and demand to see any file for the purpose of finding out what is taking place.  It is for the civil servant to rebut the journalist's claim that there are grounds why the file should be shown to the Press.  It is, of course, the complete reverse of what has been built up here and we must, therefore, when discussing State companies&mdash;here I disagree completely with the Taoiseach's published address in <i>Studies</i>&mdash; have regard to the position in Scandinavia where the journalist has the absolute right to look at the files.  In Scandinavia it is the journalist's right that must be challenged.  When the Minister endeavours to put on record that the facts and views in this respect are far from being the unilateral ones he has expressed, when he agrees that, in fact, there are very wide differences of opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Minister, having put his views on record, to say, when somebody gets up afterwards, that the thing can be seen in the records of the House&mdash;that we did not challenge the approach to this matter.  In Scandinavia this type of capital investment would be discussed by Parliament because the funds would be made available by Parliament itself.  In relation to this section I feel very strongly that once you put <Col N="2975" /> a contract into a Bill, once it is named in the Bill, if we permit the Bill to go through in that shape, hereafter we will be told, if anything goes wrong with the company, that we had accepted the contract in the Bill.  It is the responsibility and the discretion of the Minister in accordance with the appropriate procedure in the State Guarantees Act.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister that it is not his responsibility to make certain investigations into the activities of a State-sponsored body before he gives his imprimature to a guarantee. He must be satisfied there is need for such a contract before he guarantees it and the fact that the Minister said here he did not make any such inquiries about a contract means he has not done his duty as a Minister. Although I feel strongly that this is a rotten Government, still when the Government are there they are the people to exercise the administrative powers under subsection (1) and as long as they ask the Dáil for the authority to exercise those powers they are asking for what is a proper and executive power for the Government. Under this section they are trying to part with their responsibility elsewhere.</P>

      <P>In relation to capital demands, we naturally examined in the Department the whole of the dieselisation programme of CIE and their general programme for the improvement of their stock, stations and so on. What we did examine was whether, from the standpoints of the Capital <Col N="2976" /> Budget and the commitments of the State now and in future, this particular method of financing this contract was one which was favourable to CIE and favourable to the Minister for Finance at the same time.  We decided it was and we then decided that this kind of contract was a good one, but we left to CIE the discretion of entering into the contract and the terms of the contract because, as I have said already, no Minister before me and, I should think, no Minister after me unless the rules have changed, discusses or debates with State companies the circumstances of individual contracts with individual firms.</P>

If the Minister had come here and said: &ldquo;I want security from this House to the tune of £2,000,000 to enable CIE to purchase locomotives&rdquo; there might have been some justification for the failure to disclose the type of information for which he has been asked in various questions here for weeks past concerning the type of locomotives involved, the number of firms asked to tender, the reasons why a particular firm received the contract and further questions of that nature arising out of the decision to buy locomotives from General Motors.</P>
      <P>The Minister changed the whole concept of the relationship between CIE as a State body and its work with this House and the Minister by that very sentence, namely: &ldquo;I want the House to endorse a particular transaction with General Motors.&rdquo; When the House is being asked to endorse one specific deal on behalf of the community I do not think it is for me to suggest that the members of the House should be furnished with full information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister has sought to suggest that that type of information could not be made available because it would then be a question of entering into the day-to-day administration of CIE but who sought to enter into it?  Was it not the Minister himself who came to the House and asked the House to intervene by suggesting we give the signature of this House as a guarantee to enable CIE to purchase so many locomotives from General Motors?

      <P>And whether he likes it or not, until such time as this House is satisfied, we shall insist on the right to speak and extract from a dictatorial little Government the information the public are entitled to have. The Minister himself, because of his <Col N="2978" /> approach, is responsible for any interference with CIE on a day-to-day basis that may have taken place in the House into the affairs of CIE.  It was his own attitude that is responsible; his impertinence and the impertinence of the Board of CIE in sending in an ill-thought out measure of this nature and saying to the Deputies: &ldquo;We want your endorsement so that CIE can purchase from General Motors.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Up to this, whenever a question of expenditure was involved in CIE or any other State company, the House was asked, perhaps, as follows: &ldquo;We want the sum of £2,000,000, or backing for the expenditure of £2,000,000, to enable CIE to buy equipment.&rdquo; Deputies had always been precluded from inquiring into the number of tenders, whether it was the highest or lowest tender that was accepted and precluded generally from interfering simply because we had no responsibility for the placing of a particular contract.  Instead we came here and were dependent on what the Minister described as a feeling of confidence which this House had in the directors of the different boards but in this case the Minister has come here at the behest of CIE and suggests that &ldquo;CIE want backing to the tune of £2,000,000 to buy locomotives from General Motors and we want Dáil Éireann to give an undertaking that they will back this business deal.&rdquo;  At the same time the Minister says: &ldquo;I am not going to give you any information as to whether there were German, French or British firms interested in this contract&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making the Deputy a fair offer.  The Minister, in his last intervention here, said: &ldquo;I shall judge the type of information which I think should be disclosed to the House in connection with CIE.&rdquo; The Minister is going to decide that while he is in that position, he will give to the House certain types of information about CIE but it is quite possible that another Minister <Col N="2980" /> who might replace him&mdash;and that is not outside the bounds of possibility&mdash; might have a different outlook and say: &ldquo;Deputies are entitled to this information which Deputy Childers would not give&rdquo;.  Is that not a very unsatisfactory state of affairs?  Surely it must be laid down clearly in the various Acts passed here what information a Minister is bound to give to Deputies?  It does not matter in those circumstances whether it is Deputy Childers, Deputy Booth or any other Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party who happens to be Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, I want to be reasonable. I have not adverted to this particular point previously.  I did mention the position in relation to State bodies in general, and I was ruled out of order.  I accept the ruling of the Chair on that.  I have not got a satisfactory answer from the Minister on this point.  The House is being asked to stand security for CIE so that a sum of six million dollars can be expended on the purchase of locomotives from General Motors.  Is that action on the part of the Minister not asking the House to move into the day-to-day administration of CIE and to assume responsibility for the expenditure of money?  If this House is to assume responsibility for the expenditure of six million dollars on the purchase of locomotives from General Motors, <Col N="2981" /> surely the House is entitled to know, first, whether the locomotives already purchased were safe and, if they were not, what changes have taken place in them?  Surely we are entitled to ask if it is a fact that first-class terms were available from other suppliers of locomotives in different countries?  Why could that information not be given when we are asked to affix the seal of this House to this purchase?  Is the Minister, even at this late stage, going to act the little dictator and say: &ldquo;I refuse to make this information available. I do not think Deputies are entitled to it.  I think that I, as Minister, and CIE are entitled to ride roughshod over the public in the matter of giving information in this House on the expenditure of public money&rdquo;. The Minister would help to shorten the discussion by now giving us the name of the agent who placed the contract and the names of the firms who were asked to tender.  Will he answer those two questions at this stage?  We know we cannot get them through the normal procedure of Parliamentary Question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not going to intervene but I feel I must.  When the Minister was introducing the Bill, he said&mdash;I can quote from memory&mdash;that diesel engines were profitable on the long haul.  I asked him where were these long hauls on the CIE system.  I also asked him if diesel engines were profitable on long hauls, did that mean they were unprofitable on short hauls. The Minister did not answer me when I asked him was it better for us to make good steam engines at Inchicore or import engines from the United States, Great Britain or Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also asked the Minister if he were sure that on the short hauls diesel engines were more economic than steam engines.  I asked him how the diesel engines measured up to the steam engines in the matter of maintenance. I asked him was it true that the diesel engines required a great deal of expensive maintenance.  I understand that a horde of very costly technicans must be employed to keep them running, and they are not able to run them successfully.  I also asked <Col N="2982" /> the Minister what was the record of these wonderful diesel engines so far as time keeping was concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell the Minister something about the experience of people who live in an area served by a short haul railway line, the Waterford-Tramore line.  This was before the Minister's time and, perhaps, before Dr. Andrews's time.  On this short haul the steam locomotive was able to haul 2,000 people at a time and get them out in 20 minutes.  Then we got an up-to-date diesel train.  As a matter of fact, we got two.  We could shift only 600 passengers with these wonderful trains and it took 15 minutes to get them out.  Even with the 600 in 15 minutes, we were able to take more than 500,000 people the last time that line was allowed to operate.</P>
      <P>None of the Minister's minions at Kingsbridge would listen to the local people.  A deputation was received and I had to listen to a young buck asking me what experience I had of transport. What experience had he?  I had 40 years' experience of being a fare-paying passenger on public transport. This fellow never had been on public transport in his life except as a free passenger.</P>

      <P>They put the diesel engines on the Tramore line in place of the steam engines.  I am telling you what happened.  Instead of being able to take 2,000 people in 20 minutes, they were able to take 600 in 15 minutes.  If the Minister thinks that is progress, I should like him to say so.</P>
      <P>Now they have done away with the steam engines and they have put buses on the roads.  These are not able to keep up the services.  Yesterday I was looking at people who had to wait up to 40 minutes for a bus and all that has been caused by putting diesel engines on lines that were paying, on short-haul lines.  I cannot say whether it would pay to have diesels on the long-haul lines between Dublin and Cork but there are short-haul lines all over the country and it looks now as if they are being threatened and that they are going to cut away more of the railway.  The whole cause of this is the introduction of the diesel engine. It is supposed to be a short haul from Waterford to Dungarvan and then on to Mallow but the Minister is going to cut that lifeline.</P>

If they made the decision to do it next Saturday, they might be smashing down the bridges and tearing up the lines on Monday morning.  We have had experience of that already in Waterford.  There was to be a children's outing to Tramore today, sponsored by the Mayor of Waterford, and they could not bring any more than 500 children there on this wonderful system.  The Minister and these great experts of his had no use for the <Col N="2984" /> railway we had there.  These experts were hauled off the bogs and dragged up to Kingsbridge and they became experts overnight.  They could tell us then that diesel trains would run better than steam engines.  They were so happy about getting a job that they became experts in it overnight.</P>

In my introductory statement, I gave some general information with regard to the Bill.  I said that I was duly satisfied that the contract was entered into according to the established practice of CIE; that tenders were sought; and that they made their decision on the proper basis.  I also told Deputy Lynch that I was satisfied that diesel engines were more economic for long and short-haul runs than steam engines.  I would make a rough estimate that if there <Col N="2986" /> had been no diesel engines and no intensified sales campaign by CIE, the loss for 1961-1962 would not be £1,600,000 but something over £3,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it unfair to ask the Minister to take into consideration the fact that there may be two different viewpoints about the amount of information which should be disclosed in this House?  It is on that basis that I am asking the Minister not to act here as the great know-all but to act in a much more humble way and give information to Deputies who are not as well armed with information as he is, information on a subject on which he has been queried so many times in Questions.</P>
      <P>He has stated that a Bill of this nature asking for £2,000,000 for CIE is a common occurrence in this House and that similar Bills in connection with other State bodies have come into this House in the past. I refer the Minister to his remarks here the last day at column 2909 of the Official Report of 19th July, 1962, when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the attitude of Deputy Dr. Browne towards this whole transaction. Enormous purchases have been undertaken by State companies, the ultimate responsibility being left on the State company for the choice of material or equipment. If one were to have this kind of discussion in regard to one hundred million pounds' worth of equipment <Col N="2987" /> purchased by a great board such as the ESB since they started, we could have an interminable debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister for Transport and Power explaining what he thinks is the foundation of the case he makes for CIE.  This House was not told where the equipment purchased by the ESB was being purchased.  We were not told whether it was X, Y or Z companies who would act as agents.  We were not asked to approve of one or the other. We were not asked to decide the type of equipment, the expenditure of the moneys involved, or the countries which would supply the equipment. We were simply asked to give the financial accommodation, to act as a backer, to give a guarantee so that the ESB could purchase the equipment wherever it wanted.  The measure we are discussing here now is a measure to give specific authority to CIE to purchase $6,000,000 worth of locomotives through General Motors.  Is there not a distinct difference in the type of approach here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>Deputy Booth is usurping the function of the Chair.  As I have said here before, it is often a wise move to count ten in this House when there is a Deputy like Deputy Booth in it because one might otherwise say things that one might possibly feel sorry for later.  At times, I feel sorry for Deputy Booth.  I want to know why all the secrecy?  Deputy Booth is not worried as to whether or not there is an agent.  He says he does not know if there is.  Evidently, he is not any more interested than a great many other members of his Party as to whether or not other firms were asked to tender.  He is not interested in finding out, even on behalf of his constituents, the names of the other firms who may have been asked to tender for the supply of locomotives to CIE.</P>
      <P>Yet he is quite prepared to give the Minister the backing of this House for a guarantee for the purchase of the locomotives through General Motors, and he wants no more information about the transaction.  He is quite satisfied everything is above board.  I do not know; everything may be above board.  I assume that, with the responsible element in Fianna Fáil, that is the case.  But that does not take away from the fact that there is imposed on members of this House a duty to extract the last ounce of essential information to which the public are entitled.  I do not know of any other way in which the community, the taxpayer and the ratepayer have an opportunity of getting the information they need and for which they now ask in relation to this expenditure.</P>

Is it not a fact that when Deputies, who are alleged to represent the public and who are presumed to carry some weight, write to CIE for information on the very matter we are discussing, the purchase of these locomotives, the Chairman writes back and says: &ldquo;I am afraid I cannot give you that information&rdquo;? Further, is it not a fact that when Deputies come in here and ask the Minister, the alleged boss of the Chairman of CIE to give the information, the Minister says: &ldquo;I have no power to do so&rdquo;?  Where is the general public to get the information then?  Are they not entitled to know how their money will be spent?</P>

The first is that, if there is a demand by Deputies for information as to who the agent is in connection with this sale, and the names of the other firms or companies asked to tender for the supply of the locomotives, and that information is not forthcoming, surely the public will take the view that this House is discredited and no longer represents public opinion.

Is it not a fact that the officials who are appointed to a company like CIE can tell the Deputies, `You have no authority whatever, even though you represent the people, to get this information'.&rdquo;?

      <P>I want information from the Minister and, even though it may be very painful to members of this House to sit here, I can, if I wish, go through the Minister's speech and keep well within the rules of procedure, as you happen to know, if I want to do that.  But I have no intention of delaying the House.  I want the Minister <Col N="2992" /> to answer two specific questions: Who is the agent involved where this sum of 6,000,000 dollars is concerned and, second, what are the names of the other firms asked to tender for the supply of locomotives?  The Minister is not getting this measure in so far as I am personally concerned until he gives that information.  Otherwise, the public, who are not used to the technical ramifications of debates in this House and that &ldquo;under subsection (d) of Section 5 the Minister cannot disclose the information,&rdquo; will ask, &ldquo;What is all the secrecy about?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Minister had come in here and, on the basis as I first suggested, asked for a backing for CIE of 6,000,000 dollars as a blanket purchase, without giving any information, there would have been some sense in his approach.  He did not do that. I object, and I am sure even in Fianna Fáil there are Deputies who will object, to allowing our names to be used as having sanctioned a transaction with a particular firm without knowing the names of the other firms also asked to tender.  Is it an unreasonable proposition that the people who are responsible on behalf of the public who are asked to guarantee this expenditure should know the names of the other firms?  Why should we merely be told that it is General Motors that got the contract and be prevented from knowing the names of the firms who were unsuccessful?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to hold up the House longer than it is being held up but there are a few things which should be said.  We have heard a good deal of talk about the principles involved here, as, for instance, the obligations on a Deputy to question the expenditure of public money. Deputy MacEoin mentioned that in his view the Minister was endeavouring to implicate the members of the House in a transaction which might turn out to be doubtful, so that nobody could complain about it.  Nobody seems to have adverted to what the Minister, in fact, said, that was, that subsection (1) would permit him to do exactly what he is asking to do in subsection (2), that he introduced subsection (2) merely as a courtesy to the House because these commitments had been entered into subject to the enactment of legislation.  The Minister went further and said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>All this talk has taken place and I will tell you why, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It does not suit certain Deputies to listen to that offer because they want to go on and on and on about things which they know cannot within the rules of order be discussed here and they know also that any State body, if it is to be operated in any normal way, cannot be subjected to scrutiny in this House in its day-to-day workings.  If Deputies paid any attention to what the Minister said and paid attention to his offer and <Col N="2994" /> were logical in their arguments they would say: &ldquo;Right.  Withdraw subsection (2) and that means we do not have to complain about these various things&rdquo; but nobody said: &ldquo;We will accept your offer&rdquo; because it did not suit Deputies to do so.  It is time that it was pointed out to the House that that is what is going on.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan that we should have detailed information in relation to this purchase.  The Minister has no authority whatsoever to guarantee State money without the approval of this House.  If he had such authority, I am very sure, being the type of Minister he is, he would not bother to ask us.  Does he expect this House to approve of the expenditure of more than £2,000,000 without detailed particulars as to how that money is expended? We have not got these detailed particulars here.  I may say <i>en passant</i>, that it is, indeed, peculiar that this Bill has been brought before the House at all having regard to the action of the Minister and of the State-sponsored CIE in removing the main bulk of branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite evident that the Minister and CIE have made mistakes in the past, have made serious blunders.  We as members of this House must be cautious that they are not making a mistake in this deal.  What did the Minister say in the House last year? On one occasion he told us he was assured by Dr. Andrews and the CIE Board that we were quite safe until 1964, that if the Tramore line, the West Cork line and the Clare line were wiped out, CIE would be solvent <Col N="2996" /> until 1964 and there was no danger of any move being made to close further lines.  Did the Minister not make that quite clear here in the House?  Did Dr. Andrews and the Board of CIE not make it quite clear?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant in this way.  I am asking the Minister for detailed information and I am pointing out that both the Minister and CIE have made mistakes in the past. I am recalling some of these mistakes, big blunders, to my mind, for instance, that persons such as the Minister and Dr. Andrews should make statements that there would be no further closures of branch lines until 1964.  That statement was made in 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to do so but at the same time, I think it was relevant.  This House is being asked to guarantee 6,145,330 United States dollars and that guarantee may have to be honoured.  How do we know CIE will not make further blunders, thus being unable from their own resources to pay this money? They have been subsidised by this House over a number of years and, despite what is in the Transport Act of 1958, there is a likelihood that they will have to be subsidised again.  Is that the reason we have this further closure of lines?</P>
      <P>What any business executive would be entitled to know how CIE or the Minister went about the purchase of these engines.  Did they insert advertisements in the newspapers in America, Germany or any other country selling this type of equipment, and ask for tenders, or did they, as is alleged here, get some of their agents to go to America to buy these engines and cut others out of it?  Did that happen?  We do not know whether it did or not.  The Minister is the person to give us the information.</P>

      <P>The Minister is the only person who can clear the air in this matter.  He must take this House into his confidence.  Neither he nor the Government have any power or entitlement to guarantee money without the approval of this House. The Minister has to bear in mind that he is Minister in a Party who have not a majority in this House.  It was quite all right for the Minister when he was discussing CIE matters a few years ago in this House.  He had a majority then and he was quite safe in the knowledge that if a vote were taken, he would win.  However, that majority is not in existence at the present time and he will have to change the dictatorial manner in which he has treated this House in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2998" /> I do not want to delay the House but I want detailed particulars from the Minister as to how CIE came about purchasing these engines.  Did the Board consult the Minister?  Did they ask him about this guarantee or did he, as Minister for Transport and Power, make any suggestions to CIE as to the best course to adopt to ensure that the equipment was purchased at the lowest possible price?  It has often been announced by the Chair that the Minister for Transport and Power has no function in the day-to-day affairs of CIE.  Numerous questions which I addressed to the Minister for Transport and Power have been disallowed by the Chair, on the ground that the Minister was not responsible for the day-to-day activities of CIE, the day-to-day activities of the ESB, or the day-to-day activities of other State bodies.  In fact, at one time I addressed a question to the Taoiseach asking if the Minister for Transport and Power had any functions at all because whenever a question was addressed to him, he told us it was a matter for the Board.  It is evident that he has functions, so far as Section 2 is concerned.  He cannot deny that and he should give us the information we seek in order to ensure that there will be no behind-the-scenes talk about this matter and that everything is above board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not in the House when this matter arose and when I stated that the subsection mentioning the name of the contractor was put in more or less as a courtesy to the House.  If it troubles Deputy Sweetman, Deputy MacEoin and other members of the Fine Gael Party that we should put in a subsection which clearly indicates the name of a specific firm without actually scheduling the section as part of the Bill, I am prepared to believe that might create a very awkward precedent in relation to future contracts of this kind and that it would be best therefore to delete that subsection and simply to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee a sum of money for purchases made under these special conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will mean that the Bill, if enacted, would be of no different character from many others where money is guaranteed to State companies and where there is no question of the Minister of the day giving details in regard to contracts entered into, giving the names of the firms that were not successful in regard to any contract, or giving the names of <Col N="3000" /> the agents for the firms in this country. The Bill will, then, be one of many measures of a similar kind where no one in the House ever thought of asking for such information.  On that basis, I am accepting the suggestion of Deputy Sweetman, so we need have no further controversy on this matter.</P>
    <P>I have complete and absolute confidence in the Chairman and the whole board of CIE.  I am confident that there is absolutely nothing whatever underhand in the arduous work they are undertaking in this country.  The Chairman and the Board are jointly responsible for contracts, as in the case of other State companies.</P>

      <P>The conduct of their operations is entirely satisfactory, as far as I am concerned.  I deprecate the suggestions and the criticisms impugning the character, particularly of the Chairman of CIE who is not able to answer for himself in this House.  The Board of CIE are acting under legislation passed by this House at various times.  I believe they are acting with a full sense of responsibility.</P>
      <P>Any charges made against any individual member of the board or against the Chairman should, in fact, be made against me who am responsible and against the Government who are responsible for the general appointment of the Board.  It will be quite impossible to get good men to act as directors on boards if they are to be attacked individually or by name in this House.  I am quite sure, however, responsible Deputies will agree with me in regard to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to Deputies criticising me and my conduct as Minister for Transport and Power, or to their criticising the Government for their overall responsibility for State companies.  Let us, however, not criticise men who are not able to answer. Deputies would be setting a very serious precedent.  I have answered all the questions that have been asked which seemed to me to be relevant to this debate.  I am proposing, as I have said, on the Report Stage, to eliminate the subsection referred to and <Col N="3001" /> so to get us out of a difficulty which, I agree with Deputy Sweetman, might cause us some problems in the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister is feeling he should not give us this information at all.  He feels that we should have got no details such as the few details set out in subsection (2).  He told us as well that the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, agrees with him.  I do not know whether or not that is the case, but I think it is the view from these benches, and it is my personal view, that we do not agree with that type of procedure.</P>
      <P>One would think, by the Minister, that he was taking us all very closely into his confidence and giving us some deep secrets so far as CIE are concerned. He is doing nothing of the kind.  Is every member of this House, who is a member of a local authority, not aware that these questions arise from time to time at local authority meetings when, say, the local authority would require money to purchase equipment such as we propose here? In scarcely no instance would it amount to the sum of money involved here.</P>
      <P>Would the members of the local authority not get, as of right, particulars as to the number of contracts, as to the other prices, as to the steps taken to secure the best value for money, as to the steps taken to ensure that the project was publicly advertised and that all people or all firms selling the type of equipment were quite well aware of the requirements of the council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to assume from the attitude of the Minister for Transport and Power, in relation to this Bill, that we should be satisfied to give him a blank cheque to guarantee a State-sponsored body such as CIE more than £2,000,000 without getting the information which we require?  Is that not the reason why we come from Cork, Donegal, Mayo Meath, and from every other county in the country, <Col N="3002" /> to inquire into the workings of this House, to inquire as to how our public money is expended, and to ensure that public money will usefully and gainfully be employed to the best advantage? Is that not the reason why this Parliament makes laws and regulations?</P>
    <P>There is a law and a regulation by this Parliament which provides that a Minister has no right to guarantee money, such as is being guaranteed under this Bill, without the approval of this House.  It is by virtue of that fact that we are here today seeking this information.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the remarks made by the Minister so far as the Board of CIE are concerned.  I think I have never abused the privileges of this House since I became a member by commenting on any person who had not the right of audience within the House.  Surely, however, a man such as the Chairman of CIE, or a board such as the Board of CIE, must be coming to that point here? There were occasions in the past when reference was made to the dictatorial attitude of CIE.</P>

      <P>I was refuting the Minister's assertion that members are abusing the privileges of this House in making unwarranted attacks on men who are not members of the House.  I am sure he was referring to the Chairman of CIE and to the members of the Board.  I maintain that no unwarranted attacks were made on any of these people, and no <Col N="3003" /> attacks at all.  The statements made were completely relevant to this discussion.</P>
      <P>It is well known that the majority of the members of this House are very dissatisfied with the courtesy extended to them by the Board of CIE.  It would be no harm if the Minister, instead of lecturing us, were to turn his attention to them and give a lecture to the Board of CIE.  A State-sponsored body should be courteous and helpful so far as the legitimate requirements of Deputies are concerned in the line of seeking information. It is very unfair for the Minister to sidetrack the issue involved by commenting unnecessarily on alleged abuses of privilege in this House.</P>

      <P>It is said that there is never smoke without fire.  I think there has been smoke in this House for the past two days and that smoke leaves a question mark in my mind. The Minister must take a lot of responsibility for that.  He fanned the fire himself by refusing to answer questions that were asked of him.  If there has been trouble about this Bill, the Minister must be practical and realise that the House has a duty.  The result of the discussion during the past two days has made me uneasy about the Minister.  His conduct in this debate has not filled me with any confidence.  Supercilious sermons are not quite good enough.  Whatever about the general judgment of CIE in the wider sphere, the position has not been helped by the fact that the Minister has sought to erect this screen more closely around this transaction.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested that Deputy Murphy was not present when he read what has been described as &ldquo;a peculiar statement&rdquo;. That was no excuse for trying to suggest that Deputy Murphy was not aware of the Minister's attitude all along the line.  Four times within the last hour within my hearing, the Minister has delivered a lecture to Deputies to the effect that they were irresponsible for daring to criticise the Chairman or the directors of CIE. The Minister stated that any charges <Col N="3004" /> that are to be made should be made against him as Minister and at that stage he stuck out that mighty chest of his and that was the first time I heard the Minister assuming responsibility for the office which he holds.  I have been listening to him for a number of years stating that he has no responsibility for this, no responsibility for that and that he would refer the Deputy to CIE for this, or he would refer the Deputy to the ESB for that.  While he was doing that, the Ceann Comhairle was preventing Questions from being tabled on the ground that the Minister had no responsibility.  I am not criticising&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not think he has the slightest responsibility for running this Department.  It has been shown before he is merely a rubber-stamp. Therefore we must criticise somebody.  There is no use criticising a rubber-stamp&mdash;it is an inanimate object.  As far as I can see the Minister is up a siding.  He has been shunted up one of these forgotten places where the grass is growing between the tracks, and perhaps derailed, from what we hear.</P>

      <P>The Minister, after a debate which has lasted a few days, comes in and quite casually says: &ldquo;I am going to drop subsection (2) of Section 2.  I am quite satisfied it will meet with Deputy Sweetman's approval.&rdquo;  I do not know why suddenly, after the House has been discussing all this secrecy and the lack of co-operation on the part of the Minister and has failed to extract information that should be made available, the Minister should think he can solve his problem by withdrawing a subsection, <Col N="3005" /> one young and well-meaning Deputy of his Party having said that the Minister brought in that subsection as a matter of courtesy to Deputies.  Is that all that is thought of the standard of intelligence of Deputies, that we can be hoodwinked on this measure?  Is it not a question of &ldquo;a rose by any other name&rdquo;?  The House is debating the matter and we are still being asked to endorse a cheque to CIE for the purchase of locomotives from General Motors.  There has been no change in that but the Minister is going to drop the subsection at this stage in order to meet the worries expressed by certain members of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I make the charge that the Minister is irresponsible at this stage and there is no question of the Minister suggesting that it is Dr. Andrews or the directors of CIE that I am attacking. I am criticising the Minister and saying that his attitude towards this House has been one of complete contempt.</P>

If in the course of trying to extract that information, some people's ears or noses are pulled or twigged and some of them get a little rough treatment, then the only person to be blamed is the Minister.  If his officials or his appointees feel hurt by the way they have been knocked about in this House, let them place responsibility on the Minister who failed to give the information he was asked for in the House, information which, in the public interest, he should have given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the position in relation to general guarantees which had to be made good by the Minister for Finance was that those guarantees had to be made good out of voted moneys and they had to come before the House for the purpose of being voted.  That is the general pattern in relation to most items of guarantees, the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, for example.  The Minister will recall that on many occasions Ministers have had to come to the <Col N="3007" /> House for the purpose of paying the amount due under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, where the companies concerned went into liquidation and were not able to meet their commitments.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is in exactly the same form.  What I am worried about is that I think it is all wrong for the House to pass a Bill providing for a guarantee, unless, at the same time, the Government of the day must come back to the House in one form or another, if that guarantee has to be met out of public funds.  I do not mind how it is done.  It does not matter to me whether it is done by the Central Fund paying the debtor and the Minister for Finance reimbursing the Central Fund.  I am satisfied that there must be, without question, a categorical arrangement in respect of any guarantee by the State, not merely in this Bill, that the control of this House over the fiscal arrangements is such that there must be a vote to make good what has to be repaid under the guarantee.</P>

      <P>I do not regard the amendment as necessary and therefore I am not prepared to accept it.  My reason is that administratively this is a matter of which we have taken note in the Department where contracts are coming up for approval.  We shall continue to do that in the future.  As I have said, it is a matter to be dealt with in an administrative rather than a statutory way.  The House can be quite satisfied that we will in all reasonable cases deal with the problem effectively administratively and that what is intended in the amendment will be effected administratively rather than by making it a statutory provision in the Bill.</P>

      <P>At the risk of being misinterpreted in this matter, as it refers to the courts, I should like to say I cannot agree with the amendment. I believe one of the essential things one should endeavour to maintain is an appeal from the administration to a court because it is the existence of such an appeal that very often makes an administration more wary about treading on the corns of individuals.</P>

      <P>That may be all right for Deputy Sweetman, but we all know court proceedings can be rather costly and possibly the difficulties involved here could be resolved just as well by the Minister and his advisers.  We assume that the people in the Department dealing with such questions on appeal are men of integrity, as well qualified as any judge or justice to deal with such matters.  It is only fair that the House should assume that they will be <Col N="3012" /> impartial.  I do not think it advisable that this House should throw too many matters over to the courts.  One can imagine a situation arising where an appeal would start in the district court and one of the parties would be dissatisfied.  There would be an appeal to the circuit court and eventually the case would wind up in the High Court and, perhaps, in the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for both sides of the argument here.  Neither side at any stage could be said to be entirely wrong but there is this to be said about the situation: this section involves procedure which is somewhat new.  The section makes provision for a fine and it is because of that that we suggest there should be an appeal to the district court. Should we find at any future time that our experience in operating the matter through the courts is not a success, we could quite readily at any time amend the situation and revert to an appeal to the Minister.  I should say that at the moment the district court plays some part in our sanitary services and in their administration.  Again, we have in Section 7 of the Fire Brigades Act of 1940 a procedure similar to what is proposed in this section and our experience of the operation of that provision in the 1940 Act suggested to us that we should adopt a similar procedure here.  As I said earlier, it should not be difficult to amend this <Col N="3013" /> later, if our experience suggests that is desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us who from time to time, have been members of local authorities have met the difficulties for local authorities which this amendment is designed to remedy.  I can think of many cases where local authorities have installed piped water and sewerage schemes at considerable expense and those by whose door the scheme ran had not connected with it. The danger there may be to health, quite apart from the cost in which the local authority is involved, is a matter that cannot be indefinitely ignored. Hence the principle that is behind this section is one I am personally prepared to support but I want to be quite sure that in its application the section does not involve hardship.</P>
      <P>I visualise considerable difficulty in certain cases where the owner of the premises might genuinely want to connect but has not the funds to do so.  I think these should be provided in some shape or other; that if it is an appeal from the sanitary authority's order to the district court, the district justice can take into account whether the owner of the premises has the financial facilities available.  I do not mean whether he has the money himself to do it but whether the money is being provided by way of grant or loan by the sanitary or local authority. If the sanitary authority is not prepared to meet the cost by way of grant and loan, it seems that great hardship could be brought upon an owner of property of modest means who has not funds to do the work required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see that it would be difficult to provide in the section itself that the sanitary authority must always make the funds available and it therefore seems that the appropriate way of doing it would be to provide that it is <Col N="3014" /> one of the factors that could be taken into account before contravention, as visualised in subsection (10) of this section, visits penalties upon the owners of property.  I do not think, as the section is drafted here, in subsection (10) or indeed otherwise in pursuance of a notice under subsection (2), it would be any defence for an owner to say: &ldquo;I should like to do this work but I have no funds and if the sanitary authority will make available to me on loan, on normal terms, the difference in cost between the actual cost of executing the work and the grants available, then I shall do it, but if those facilities are not made available to me, no matter how much I want to do it, I just cannot.&rdquo;  There would be many cases of that type of people of very modest means, owning little houses, people who may be involved in pretty expensive work under this section.</P>
    <P>It is desirable for the general good and for the sake of public health that these people should connect to the public scheme, whether water or sewerage, but it is equally desirable that we should endeavour to provide here that there will not be any injustice by allegedly forcing them to do it, without at the same time giving them financial means to do the work which we are requiring in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section applies to people whose premises are within 100 feet of the main water system. That being so, I do not think they qualify for a grant at all.  I am a member of a local authority and, as far as I remember, only those whose premises are situate at least 100 feet from a main water system are entitled to a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was 30 feet.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on that point in a preliminary way.  Is it 30 or 100 feet for a grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The 100 feet qualification is not quite relevant.  That arises under the Housing Acts, as we have known them and, as the House is now aware, we are for the first time segregating the payment of water and <Col N="3015" /> sewerage grants from the housing code. Within the framework of this Bill, there is no statutory provision which would prevent payment of grants to an owner within 100 feet or it might be administratively arranged that if the connection, whether to water or sewerage, were to exceed a certain cost, we might make that figure the bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there not such mention of 30 feet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not in the context of this Bill.  Generally speaking, as it is being discussed here, it is only cases of hardship about which we are very concerned or should have any cause to be concerned in regard to the provision that people shall make connections to these public services. In those cases, it is a question of the individual house or property-owner not being in a position to pay anything towards the cost of a connection, whether water or sewerage. The local authority, as well as the Department, will be in a position to contribute towards the cost of any such enforced connection or, indeed, if circumstances warrant, they may meet the full cost of the connection.</P>
      <P>The dangers that have been mentioned here of hardship arising in cases where even an appeal to the courts would not relieve the person concerned do not really exist.  There is ample power available to both the Department and the local authority to contribute all or part&mdash;certainly the local authority can contribute all of the cost&mdash;of any of these connections, even though it is an enforced connection, even though it may be subsequent to an order of the court made on appeal.  There is no real danger of hardship arising from the court saying: &ldquo;You must do it&rdquo; when the person clearly and obviously cannot do it through lack of funds.  Such hardships need not and should not arise.  I feel they will not arise and that local authorities will use their powers and discretion to ensure that a hardship case will be met adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the fact under the section, that the court was <Col N="3016" /> bound to take that hardship into consideration, then I should not have any difference of opinion with the Minister. I agree that it is only in extreme hardship cases I am interested but in Section 6, paragraph (b), the court has power to confirm the notice, subject to such modifications, alterations, or additions as the court thinks reasonable. I read that clause as referring to the physical alterations in a connection or the physical determination as to where a connection is to take place and so forth.  If that clause could take into account also the court considering whether there was any hardship on the individual concerned, then the Minister would have met the point I have raised without question.</P>
      <P>All I am worried about is that the individual who has not got the money to do this will have the opportunity of making the case on appeal to the court that he would like to do the work but has not the funds to do it, and that the court will have the right to say &ldquo;OK; we think this connection should be made in the interests of public health, but the appellant has satisfied us it would be a hardship to make him do it because he has not got the funds.  Therefore, we will make the order for the connection, subject to the sanitary authority either doing the work themselves or making the funds available to do it.&rdquo;  As long as the individual is able to make that case &mdash; he cannot make it, as I see it, under the section as it stands&mdash;then the element of hardship can be avoided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a case earlier pointing out that local authorities have in the past prosecuted site-owners because they did not make sanitary connections.  Fearing the effect of prosecutions, site-owners have actually removed the owners of temporary dwellings from their lands.  Am I in order in referring to site-owners who are likely to be prosecuted by local authorities but who may not have the means to make sewerage connections? The Minister was to consider that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not one on which I could generalise.  The Deputy knows that no two cases of this kind are the same.  Neither would <Col N="3017" /> the same circumstances apply in the case of occupants of sites, whether they be owners or tenant occupiers, individual tenants or groups.  What I said at an earlier stage was that I felt that within the framework of the Bill, there was ample scope for local authorities and such people to arrange a workable scheme, taking into account the ability of these people to meet the cost of the connection and the accessibility of the main, whether it be a sewer or water main.  It would be very difficult to cover statutorily all the cases that would arise throughout the country, but, as I say, the Bill gives sanitary authorities and such people sufficient scope to come together and work out an arrangement as to how connections, particularly those in the public interest, can best be made without putting an undue burden on the person being obliged to connect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are owners of bungalows who also own their sites. There are dozens of them in Portmarnock within 20 or 30 yards of the main road.  They have a stake there. Will they get grants to put in sewerage or water connections or will they be left without?  Is there anything in the Bill to help them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary way&mdash; I am assuming no enforcement is necessary&mdash;the people owning these bungalows can apply to the Department and, subject to the general conditions applying to everybody, they can get a grant.  If it is a question that the local authority, say, in Portmarnock, decide that these people must connect and are taking steps to enforce, the sanitary authority must first bring the mains to within 100 feet distance of where they wish the connections to be made.  There is in this Bill that provision of grants being available for all and sundry in ordinary cases, but if there is to be enforcement under Section 8, the sanitary authority has an obligation.  They cannot say to somebody: &ldquo;You must connect; if not, we will have the law on you.&rdquo;  They first have to bring the water main or sewer within 100 feet of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If at that stage the person being <Col N="3018" /> prosecuted can show it would be unreasonable to ask him make the connection out of his own resources, he cannot be forced to do so.  In that case, the sanitary authority have power under Section 9 to make the connection at the expense of the sanitary authority, either in whole or in part.  While the operation of water or sewerage grants has been limited to connection within 100 feet of a house, that is not contained in the Bill and is not, in fact, a statutory obligation.  It may well be that, when we come to make the regulations under this Bill for the administration of the grants, we may decide that in certain circumstances in future, the 100 feet will not be the yardstick but we may say that, if it costs more than £10, we will contribute by way of grant and that the local authority may contribute a similar amount or even more, as they are entitled to do under subsections 1 (a) and 1 (b) of Section (9).</P>

      <P>The Minister has informed me that a local authority can contribute in whole or in part to the installation of a water or a sewerage scheme to a house that is more than 100 feet from the main.  I think before an order is made forcing people to take the matter to the court, a local authority should be satisfied that the persons whom they are compelling to instal water or sewerage are not in a position to do the job themselves. I have in mind the case of a very elderly woman in my village who is not in a position to instal water or sewerage and, if she had to go into court, it would cost her more to assert her position that she was unable to do <Col N="3019" /> the job herself.  The local authority should satisfy itself that the individual is not in a financial position to do the job and then the local authority could do it themselves.  It would be a different matter if the local authority were satisfied that the person concerned was able to do the job.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the point made by Deputy Brennan.  I think that is the way the matter should be administered.  It is difficult to see how one can do it but, even if the Minister finds difficulty in writing something into the Bill, the point made by Deputy Brennan should certainly be written into the Bill in relation to subsection (6) clause (b). It could be put in there by a very simple amendment that of the modifications, alterations and renewals, the sanitary authority should meet such part of the cost as the court might think reasonable.  I agree with Deputy Brennan that it would be better to do it before you go to the court if that could be done but if you cannot do that you must not put a penalty on a person who is so lacking in means that he has not the funds to do the work.</P>
      <P>All of us in our own villages know of such cases where there would be people who would not have the funds to employ a contractor or a workman or to purchase the goods necessary. We must ensure when dealing with what is necessary as a general principle that we do not do it in such a way as to cause unnecessary individual hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter, the House will appreciate that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to write in every little safeguard we can think of.  What I would direct the minds of the House to is that we are now discussing difficulties which may arise or be brought about by the action of various sanitary authorities who are, by and large, the various local councils whose ambition and hope it is to have as many connections as is possible within their financial limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of safeguards to protect people against what is rightfully put into the section to ensure that this, <Col N="3020" /> that and the other thing will be done and, at the same time, to ensure that there will be no chance of hardship being inflicted on anybody is impossible. The danger of any of these hardship cases arising through the decision of a district justice or the action of a local authority without having regard to the financial circumstances of a person is not very great.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that under the section as it stands the district justice has no right to concern himself with the hardship that might be involved. If he had I would not argue so forcibly with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While not disputing the general assertions of Deputy Sweetman that the section deals with the physical possibilities rather than the financial position of the particular appellant, nevertheless, I think it is true that the financial circumstances of the appellant will enter into it and be a factor in the mind of any district justice who may be hearing the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister meet me to the extent of putting in the Bill on the next Stage that the district justice will have a discretion in such cases?  As the Bill stands at present, if a district justice was anxious to consider the financial circumstances of a person he is not allowed to do it and I do not think that is the Minister's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 is there and can only be there for one purpose and design and that is to help one type of person, the type which we are desirous of saving from undue hardship under Section 8.  That section would help to relieve distress that might be caused under Section 8 and it enables the local authority to make the connection in full at the full cost, or at part of the cost, or to subscribe to the cost if the person is not in the financial position to help out himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point about it is that we are inclined to regard the present situation as one that will apply in future as regards grants from the Department and supplementary grants from the local authorities in relation to making connections beyond one hundred feet <Col N="3021" /> from the main.  We are in no way bound by any of the terms of this Bill to any such limit of 100 feet.  It could well be that exceptional measures could be made available to recipients of old age pensions, widows' pensions, home assistance or unemployment assistance who are sought to make connections which obviously they could not pay for.  It can well be, and it is possible within the framework of the Bill, that, by administrative regulation, they can regard such people as being exempt from the 100 feet limit and the grants can be paid in such cases.</P>
    <P>In addition to our grants, in the ordinary course of events, supplementary grants should likewise be paid by the local authority, leaving a residue of a very small amount which, again, the local authority could themselves actually contribute, if the case were one of a sufficient degree of distress. As I say, we will normally find ourselves with practically no leeway whatsoever to make up in even the most financially embarrassed case one could possibly imagine.  With that latitude given by the House to the Minister for Local Government and to the local authority in relation to the operation, implementation and, if you like, manipulation of the grant provisions, the dangers that might arise in the ordinary course through the operation of Section 8 are so remote and so capable of control that they need cause no concern whatsoever.  These people will be safeguarded in the future operations of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should put it to the House that we have a wide enough and sufficiently flexible power as between Local Government and the local authorities to take on any and every case that may arise under the most unusual circumstances. To try now to improve on that situation might, in fact, throw up other difficulties that we have not yet foreseen, difficulties which we would only see when the change had been made.  I, as Minister, am anxious to see this work done with the greatest possible expedition.  I personally am satisfied that we have in this Bill a framework within which none of the difficulties mentioned need, in fact, cause any hardship to the occupant of <Col N="3022" /> any premises in any part of the country.</P>

The local authority would prefer to give a supplementary grant.  Up to now, the position has been that the people living within 100 feet of a water supply would not be considered at all. Do I take it that they will now be considered under this Bill?</P>

It is a method, or methods, whereby we can meet a great many of the difficulties outlined.  The regulations we will issue to the public and to local authorities will ensure that the position will no longer be dependent upon the verdict of the court.  It will not be subsequent to a court decision, and subsequent only to it.  Whatever benefit we can give will be available immediately.  There will be no such thing as need for an enforcement order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little worried about the very sweeping powers that are being taken in this section from the point of view of their possible effect on industrial employment.  While we are all agreed that it is desirable to control pollution of the atmosphere, and prevent pollution as far as we possibly can it is a matter upon which there are bound to be in almost every case two divergent views.  It will always be a matter of degree and, when things reach the stage of being a matter of degree, the point at which it is desirable to take action is always a matter of opinion.  I rather feel that the power of the Minister to make regulations <i>in vacuo</i>, and that is the power given here, is a power which will possibly have such wide repercussions that we ought to consider it a little more carefully.</P>
      <P>In normal practice, there are, of course, two types of regulation.  First, there is the type of regulation we have under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act whereby the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes a regulation&mdash;it is called an order, but really it is a regulation&mdash;and then comes and asks this House for a positive motion of approval.  The other type is the regulation which is made and power is given to veto it within the next 21 days after the House sits.  In relation to these matters, which will be, must inevitably be, matters of pure opinion, I feel it is undesirable for the Minister to have the sweeping powers conferred by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody knows better than the Minister that, when I want to be political in a Party sense, I am well able to be so; in this case I do not mean the &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in any Party sense; I am referring to the Minister in charge of the Department of Local Government. He is bound, so to speak, to be on the side of regulation.  We might be wise in this, therefore, to follow the practice in the Restrictive Trade Practices <Col N="3024" /> Act rather than the practices laid down here, certainly in relation to the main regulations made.  This is entirely new ground and we should have some form of positive motion of approval brought before the House.  I am not clear exactly what type of regulation the Minister has in mind.  It seems to me very difficult to determine in an absolute way the degree of pollution that will constitute an offence.  When we are starting off on an entirely new uncharted sea so far as regulation or legislation is concerned, it behoves us to consider very carefully where it could take us.</P>
    <P>I could visualise here under this a whole factory having to close its door, the people employed in it being disemployed, all arising because of a genuine misunderstanding and mistake as to the effect of a regulation made in relation to any industry.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable to provide some form of consultation.  I cannot see how we can provide a form of statutory consultation.  It seems to me, therefore, that the only way we can do it is to provide, as we do provide in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, the publicity that is involved by the Minister giving notice of his intention to come to the Dáil to ask for a motion of approval.  Once a Minister gives that public notice that he will ask the Dáil for specific approval, then the matters under discussion are brought in a very special way to the notice of persons who may likely be affected. Without that publicity, I cannot see how one can avoid the possibility of considerable damage and disturbance to industrial employment.</P>
    <P>After all, this is not a case in which the Minister can know of all the ways in which his regulation will affect individual industries.  It is impossible for him to know.  It is only the people who are in the individual industries who would appreciate what was involved in the regulation.  The Minister cannot get in touch with him, following publication by him of the appropriate draft regulation he intends to make.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that no Minister likes to bow to the view that it is necessary <Col N="3025" /> for him to come in here and seek time and a positive motion of approval, but in the line of country we are travelling in this section&mdash;this desirable section, let me say&mdash;we should, at least until we have fixed the pattern, make it the position that the House will have an opportunity of expressing a view before individual industrial employment could be affected, as otherwise it may seriously be affected without the Minister having the fainest idea in making the order that he was so affecting such employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has very rightly based quite an amount of his argument on the consequences of an order made by the Minister for Local Government without having sufficient knowledge to be aware of what the consequences may be on the various industries throughout the country and which the Minister probably would not be expected to have anyhow.  What should satisfy the Deputy and the House is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in all matters relating to industry under these provisions, must be consulted by the Minister for Local Government before the making of his regulations and only after that consultation may those regulations be placed before the House and the 21 days' provision come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that in regard to industry and the effects of any proposed order that the Minister for Local Government might wish in the general public interest to make, the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day would be in a position to ascertain, if he were not already aware, what the effects would be.  So that it is not really the Minister for Local Government whom we would have to rely on in these industrial cases; it would be, rather, the Minister for Industry and Commerce whose main interest in any Government is the improvement and extension of industry.  That being so, being in a position to be alive to any dangers that might emerge from proposed regulations of another Department, the Minister for Industry and Commerce certainly would be in a position to take active and positive <Col N="3026" /> steps to ensure that anything proposed by the Minister for Local Government would not have any injurious effect, or unduly injurious effect, on any industry.</P>
    <P>Naturally, if the two Ministers could not ultimately agree and if their views did not coincide as to the relative merits of the case, then, as in any Government, the final decision would rest where all these matters must really rest, that is they would have to go to their Government and the Government would have to determine on the pros and cons of the case.</P>
    <P>In that regard and in regard to the danger that might arise&mdash;and I do not disagree that there could be dangers in any regulations made by a Minister or Ministry not attuned to the various needs of various industries&mdash;while I agree that that could happen, I do not think there is any real cause for worry or any real danger of a regulation being made in this instance that would hurt an industry, due to the fact that there is a provision in this Bill for consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce whose real purpose in any Government is the welfare and promotion of industry.  That in itself is an insurance that nothing damaging will be done, through ignorance or otherwise, by any Minister for Local Government under the powers sought in Section 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept what the Minister says so far as it goes, I am not really thinking of the case where anything is done without advertence of that sort.  I am thinking of the type of case where only a person who is engaged in the particular industry as a practical matter realises the effect of the regulation will be harmful in the manner we have been discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion in subsection (3) of the proviso that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, indeed, also, the Minister for Health, shall be consulted in certain circumstances is to some extent a protection&mdash;with that, I agree&mdash;but it does not carry me the whole stage because there are the difficulties of a type which no Department&mdash;Industry and Commerce or any <Col N="3027" /> other Department&mdash;could possibly visualise and, indeed, where a person engaged in one industry would be unable perhaps to realise how it would affect another industry, even though the two industries were almost allied.</P>
    <P>I said originally that I appreciate that no Minister likes this method of positive approval.  Although it would be better to have that, at the same time, the Minister might be able in another way to come some part of the journey.  The section as it is provides that the regulation would be made and would automatically come into effect there and then, subject of course to the right of annulment within a period of 21 days but that right of annulment is, as normally, without prejudice to the validity of anything done previously.  I would prefer the positive motion of this House but I take it the Minister is not prepared to go so far with me. Would he agree that he would not make regulations except such as would not come into force for a period of, shall we say, three months?  Once the regulations are made, then that gives a person who will be affected an opportunity of considering them long before they come into effect and will give the person concerned an opportunity of contacting members of this House with a view to invoking the procedure involved in Section 11.</P>
    <P>The procedure involved in Section 11 is to some extent illusory, if the regulation comes into effect overnight.  If the regulation is one which will only come into effect a period ahead, then it gives everybody an opportunity of making representations to the Minister that the regulation, before it becomes operative, needs to be amended but if the Minister is not prepared to amend it, it does give the House an opportunity under Section 11 of considering it not merely as an <i>ex post facto</i> operation but as a genuine anticipatory criticism before it can do any possible damage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's viewpoint on this and I think he has come to see the difficulty there is in trying to legislate for the unknown which to a large degree most of this <Col N="3028" /> really is.  The suggestion of the three months' waiting period between the issue of regulations and their taking effect would, in one very serious aspect, conflict with the best interests that can be served by this section.  It was pointed out also on the Road Traffic Bill that although it may indeed be necessary at times to delay the coming into operation of a Bill, to delay the operation of a Bill for an extended period could in fact defeat the whole usefulness of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What we probably will do, and in fact there is no good reason why we should not do it because it should be very useful, is to set up an advisory committee or a consultative committee, if you like to call it that, representative of the various interests throughout the country that we would anticipate might be about to be affected by any proposed regulation.  We can do what we have been doing under the Road Traffic Acts, that is, have consultations with the interested parties in regard to regulations made and about to be made.</P>
      <P>We have also been practising something which is very useful, that is, giving the public notice in the press for three days running, indicating we are about to make this type of regulation dealing with this, that or the other, and inviting everybody interested or concerned in the matter, or who have any views on it, to communicate with us.  That practice which we have been pursuing only recently in relation to the Road Traffic Acts has been working reasonably well.  The public advertisements have been getting a pretty good response and people are coming forward to make their cases and are making very useful contributions to our knowledge in the Department in advance of these regulations being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to regulations which may be made under this Bill, we can follow this practice by inserting advertisements in the press, allow any delay which will make no difference to the effectiveness of the legislation, and <Col N="3029" /> use any other means we can use to the best advantage in the light of the circumstances obtaining at the time these regulations come to be made.</P>
    <P>I think that will meet the reasonable criticism made on this section and will allay any fears Deputies may have had.</P>

      <P>I submitted an amendment for the Committee Stage but the Chair has ruled that it imposes a charge on the public finances and, therefore, should not be moved.  I do not think it does.  The amendment was intended merely to get the Minister to operate the Bill as I think it should be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take a person who was granted a disability pension in respect of wounds received either pre-Truce or post-Truce and whose wife was in receipt of an allowance.  I hold that his widow should get the pension on his death.  I do not think it was ever intended by this Legislature, in the case of a pensioner who had a disability pension for wounds&mdash;not for disease, now, but <Col N="3031" /> for wounds&mdash;and who had an allowance for his wife, that, on his death, all would die with him.</P>
    <P>Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, a pension is given to all ex-Ministers. When the ex-Minister dies, there is a pension or an allowance for the widow.  That is the position no matter what he dies from and no matter how long it may be since he was a member of the House or since the pension was granted to him.</P>
    <P>Similarly, under the Pensions Acts, this measure not only continues the allowance for the dependants of those who died pre-Truce or post-Truce, on either side, in the Civil War, but now the Minister says it will carry on to one or more dependants, as he, in his opinion, thinks appropriate.  I think that is right.  Therefore, I submit that this is already in the Act and that the Minister could, by administrative act, give effect to what I want, without amending the measure at all.</P>

      <P>May I say, in conclusion, that I think the Minister could accept the amendment by moving it himself or amending it and then moving it.  Alternatively, he could see that the pension would be payable.  I just want to cite this extract before I <Col N="3032" /> sit down.  The file reference number is DP 3808.  It concerns an Army pensioner.  It was reported that death was not due to the disease in respect of which he was awarded the pension. Now, the disease for which he was awarded the pension was a disease of 14 bullet wounds, three of them pre-Truce and the others during the Civil War.  He was wounded in action. That is not disease, except lead poisoning.  Surely there is no reason in that?  Therefore, I respectfully sub mit that the Minister should indicate whether he accepts my point of view and my argument that the amendmen should be adopted by himself.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is allowable for me to dis cuss an amendment that has been declared out of order.  Let me say this to try to satisfy Deputy MacEoin.  I explained, the other day, that we were doing two main things.  We are removing the restriction on the number of dependants who can benefit and we are making married pensions available to two new classes.  Now, this amendment by Deputy MacEoin introduces a new principle.  I do not think I have had sufficient time and notice to examine his suggestion adequately.  He would be a wise man who would say that this will be the last Army Pensions Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not see any reason why they should get fed up with Army Pensions Bills any more than with any other sort of Bills.  I am not prepared, without the fullest consultation with the Government, to introduce a new principle.  The provision in these Acts that carries over married pensions after the death of the pensioner is that the pensioner should have died from the cause which earned him the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy MacEoin to challenge the certificate of a doctor, which he has just now being doing.  I am not permitted to do that.  I have to accept these doctors' certificates and to act accordingly.  I am in full agreement with the Deputy's <Col N="3033" /> sentiments on the matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  To tell the Deputy in the fewest possible words, the fact is that when the 1941 Act had come into operation certain people did not avail themselves of the extended time which it provides for applying <Col N="3034" /> under the 1937 Act.  What we are doing, in effect, is remedying the failure of certain people to take advantage, really, of the 1937 Act. That is all.  It is giving extra time.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I admit it is of some importance, but, as the Minister says, there are people who did not avail of it and they are now being given 24 months.  I submit, when the Minister is doing it this way, that he should give them a further 12 months from the passing of this Act. That will make sure that everybody has got full, ample and fair opportunity to make application.  We cannot lead them all by the hand but it does give them the opportunity to make their case now.</P>

In my opinion, they are entitled to an opportunity of applying.  I suggest they should not be excluded, if they want to apply.  I am not holding a brief for any particular person but in order to show that we are, so to speak, leaning backwards in order to be straight with everybody, we should give them that last opportunity.  I am not pressing the matter but the Minister should seriously consider 12 months from the passing of this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this House and the country will not suffer in any way by extending the period to give an opportunity to people who have never made an application, for one reason or another, to make that application?  If the Minister wants to press for specific cases, he can have specific cases.  I know that this matter has caused the Minister and many of his predecessors quite a headache but it is an undoubted fact, and the Minister must be aware of it, that within the recent past, with the amnesty, there are cases which, if they went before the board for the first time would succeed, as I have no doubt they would succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient to legislate for a specific known case.  I certainly would not approve of that.  I do not think <Col N="3036" /> the House or the country would disapprove at this late stage of giving adequate recognition for services rendered.  There are many people who did not apply down the years and it is now too late.  I have letters from the Department saying it is too late. I do not think it would cause any great trouble to the Department because I do not think there can be many cases left&mdash;and I am merely talking about military service pensions; not of disability or any other type of pension &mdash;and, therefore, I appeal to the Minister to make this gesture.</P>
    <P>I would be satisfied if he put it at six months or even three months, or if he said: &ldquo;We will reconsider it.&rdquo; I would not expect the Minister to say that we should legislate for known cases only.  There are other blatant cases.  I cannot see any reason why the Minister cannot make a specific date, say, the end of this year or three or four months' time, as the final date.  After all, the Minister is aware that many men who gave service were practically forced to emigrate, and some of them never came back.  Indeed, someone else may say that those who emigrated were treated much more favourably.  I merely ask the Minister not to say &ldquo;for known cases&rdquo; but to set a specific date, no matter how soon it is, as the final date for giving recognition of service rendered to the country to those who rendered it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a representation to the Minister?  I have been a member of two Governments, and during that time and in all the years I have been a member of the House, this problem of setting a time limit within which applications must be made has perennially recurred.  I never could understand why there should be a time limit.  If a man makes an application which on investigation is a just application, I am not particularly concerned, now that the past has receded into history, to worry about why he did not make his application earlier.  Human nature being what it is, men have all sorts of strange reasons for failing to comply with the letter of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should we shackle ourselves <Col N="3037" /> with a letter that does not seem to me to serve any useful purpose?  Would it not be better in respect of that diminishing body of men &mdash; whatever our views about their activities in the past may be on either side of the House&mdash;if they can bring forward applications which, in the judgment of the Minister, and even with the help of the Minister, can be brought within the scope of the general code of legislation entitling them to pensions or other rights, to let their cases be heard, adjudicated and determined?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me that there can be nothing more exasperating to an applicant who considers himself to have a good claim than to be told that its merits cannot be examined because the letter of the statute prescribes that he is a week, a month or three weeks late in formulating his claim.  So long as he knows his claim is considered on its merits, he may resent the fact that its validity is not acknowledged, but at least he knows that he has had a run for his money and that his application has been considered.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am wrong when I I say that my experience has been that whatever Government are in office, such claims are sympathetically considered.  I think it would be the wish of every side of the House that where an applicant did not formulate his claim correctly, the Minister would help him to re-formulate it so that it might be brought forward in the form most favourable to its prospects of success.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, if the Minister sought the authority of the House to drop this limitation on the date for the making of applications, we would be in favour of saying: &ldquo;Let the application go forward on its merits.  Whether it is old or new, or whether the person formulating it might reasonably have been expected to have formulated it long ago, does not matter.  We will examine it on its merits.  If it is valid, we will concede it, and if it is not valid, we will tell the applicant the reason his claim was rejected.&rdquo;  I know that in successive Military Pensions Acts, words of limitation have recurred.  Our <Col N="3038" /> experience has been that whatever words of limitation we put in back over the past 30 years, we have always had to come back to Dáil Éireann to change the words of limitation.</P>
    <P>May I make a radical suggestion? We should now drop the words of limitation, so that hereafter every application will be considered on its merits, and if it is good, it will be conceded, and if it is bad, it will be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, in fact, provided in a very effective and practical way for the very purpose outlined by Deputy Dillon.  I found it very hard to relate Deputy Carroll's remarks to what is proposed in the Bill, or in fact to relate them to what Deputy MacEoin was talking about.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to Deputy Dillon that if a man comes along now with an application for a disability pension and tells the Department that his disability is attributable to the service he gave 40 years ago, surely the Deputy will recognise that there are almost insuperable difficulties in relating back his disability now to the service he gave 40 years ago?  That is our difficulty.</P>
      <P>To meet that difficulty, and to meet the genuine cases, and cases perhaps not so genuine, a system of special allowances was brought in.  All that is asked by way of qualification is that the man can prove that he was a member of one of the organisations mentioned in the Acts.  If he can prove that&mdash;and there are a very large number who have done so&mdash;and if he is under 70 years of age and can prove that he is suffering from an infirmity which prevents him from earning his living, he can get a very generous allowance, much more generous than the average military service pension, and more generous, I think, also than many of the disability pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man is over 70 years of age, we do not ask him to prove infirmity.  All we ask him to prove is that he has not sufficient means to maintain himself. I do not think anything could be more reasonable than that, but Deputy Dillon would impose a task upon us that no set of doctors, in my opinion, <Col N="3039" /> could solve satisfactorily.  That is why it is not now a practical proposition to reopen generally the question of applicants for disability pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not expect me to swallow that?  In the first place, the special allowance is a thing in itself&mdash;really an extension of social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;operated by the Minister for Defence and the person who applies for the special allowance has to say what he will have for his breakfast the following morning and where he will get it.  The pension officer inquires and inquires.  It does not matter what age the applicant is. While I agree the special allowance is of great benefit, at the same time, it has no relation whatever with a disability pension because the special allowance is paid to the person who proves membership.  I am arguing on behalf of the applicant who has a disability contracted 30 or 40 years ago. The Minister is now, on the other hand, saying that provided that man applied within six months of the 1941 Act, he will be investigated now.  What will be investigated?  The Minister will be investigating something that happened 40 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The applicant will have the same responsibility to prove on medical grounds that the disability he suffers from was contracted 40 years ago and the Board will consider whether it really is something he contracted 40 years ago.  When the Minister said what he said here this evening, he must have had his tongue in his cheek.  What he said does not hold water and it is a pity he tried to make that case.  I have argued in office and out of office that if you contract a disability from a bullet wound, it is an easy matter to establish and it should not matter when the application for benefit was made.  There is <Col N="3040" /> no use in saying to such a person that he is six months late.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Dillon intervened in the way he did to advocate to the Minister and the Government that the qualifying date should be removed.  If the cause of the disability becomes too difficult to establish, then the phrase used by the Minister can be applied &mdash; that it has not been proved to the satisfaction of the Board that the disability was contracted due to service. The case can then be investigated and there is an opportunity for the person concerned to put forward additional evidence.  One cannot refer to the Military Service Pensions Act as having anything to do with this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister should tell us a little more about this section.  From what I can gather from my reading of it, I agree with the amendment it proposes.  I think it is right and I want the House to realise that the dependants of a person who dies&mdash;one or more&mdash;can receive the continuing pension under this section. At the same time, the Minister is excluding the widow of the person concerned&mdash;somebody who has died from bullet wounds, as in the case I cited earlier on a different section.  The Minister is continuing the pension to a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, is a dependant but he will not continue it to the widow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin sees the virtue in this section but again he has brought in the bullet wounds.  I want to deny categorically that in the case of a person who has his pension because of a bullet wound and whose certificate of death shows he died from that wound, his widow does not get an allowance after his death.  I want to repeat what I said in respect of an earlier section&mdash;that I have to accept the medical evidence submitted to me. I am not empowered by any Act to <Col N="3041" /> alter the effect of any such medical certificate.  In this section, we are deleting the phrase used by the Deputy &mdash;&ldquo;as the Minister may direct.&rdquo;  It is not now necessary for the Minister to direct who the particular dependant is who will get the allowance.  In other words, each one of the dependants of persons within the category provided for in this section can get an allowance. The section substitutes the one word &ldquo;any&rdquo; for the two words &ldquo;such one&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 26 of the Act of 1937 provided for final flat-rate pensions where disease attributable to service was below 80 per cent. &mdash;that was the degree necessary for an attributability pension&mdash;and not less than 50 per cent.  Sections 28 and 29 of the Act of 1937 provided for pensions in respect of wound or disease aggravated, accelerated or excited through service, pre-Truce or post-Truce.  Section 6 of the Act of 1941 made further provision for final flat rate pensions such as those provided for in Section 26 of the Act of 1937.  Section 6 of the Act of 1943 did likewise.  In these various sections there were distinctions in detail related to the time of service, etc. Section 12 of the Act of 1946 provided for pensions in respect of tuberculosis, aggravated, accelerated or excited by Emergency service.  Section 5 of the No. 2 Act of 1960 provided for final <Col N="3042" /> flat rate pensions where disease attributable to service with a United Nations Force was below 80 per cent, and not less than 50 per cent.  Section 7 of the No. 2 Act of 1960 provided for pensions in respect of disease aggravated, accelerated or excited by service with a United Nations Force.  The foregoing pensions which I have outlined did not so far carry entitlement to married pensions and this section now provides them.  That is the meaning of Section 7.</P>

      <P>Section 9 states that &ldquo;any pension or allowance granted by virtue of this Act shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, be payable as from such date as the Minister may determine not being earlier than the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  That means that although a person's application under the 1932 Act is accepted as being an application under the 1937 Act, although he will now apply and although he will prove a disease, he will get nothing retrospective and whatever he gets will be only from this date.  Even if he can prove to the satisfaction of a medical board that his disease is as bad now as when he applied under the 1932 Act and even though he can produce medical evidence in support of that he gets no retrospective payment for that disease or disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be the practice that when an Act is passed allowances under it only become payable from the date of the passage of the Act but Section 3 relates to the Act of 1937 and specifically states that if an applicant was an applicant under the 1932 Act and was <Col N="3043" /> refused, he shall, nevertheless, be treated as having made application under the 1937 Act.  Therefore, it is an application under the 1937 Act that is required and that he is going to stand on.  Although he will have another medical board and although he will be able to prove to the hilt that his disease is now as bad as it was when he applied previously, he gets nothing at all.  He is applying as if it had only happened yesterday: let us say that he was a serving soldier and became ill for some reason because of his service.  He would prove that fully even though up to the previous week he was in full employment and able to earn his livelihood.</P>
    <P>This section, however, states that although all the evidence is there a man could be crippled for 40 years but would benefit nothing on that account.  It does not matter if he has not worked for 40 years, was in debt up to his eyes for 40 years, he gets nothing.  Nevertheless, the basis on which he is going to prove his case is that he did apply under the 1932 Act and that he did prove his disability but that it was not attributable to service but was &ldquo;aggravated by service.&rdquo; Yet, it will be established that he did suffer from disease 30 years ago.  He has to establish that, in fact, he was a serious case 30 years ago.  He probably appealed and established it a second time but it was not &ldquo;attributable to service&rdquo;; it was &ldquo;aggravated by service.&rdquo;  Still, he is able to establish continuity of disease over a period.</P>
    <P>Let us say a person did apply under the 1937 Act and let us say, for argument sake, that he was turned down and appealed only this week.  Let us suppose he has new evidence and applies to the Minister for an appeal. Let us say he wins the appeal.  Let us say he has applied under the 1937 Act.  In this Act he will get his retrospective pension to 1937, or if he appeals under the 1937 Act but produces new evidence.  But the fact remains that it does not matter what a man has suffered he does not get a penny for his past and what he gets now will be limited to his life span, whether 10, 15 or 20 years.  That is all he gets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3044" /> When one considers the pension, including the new marriage allowance of 11/6d.  &mdash;he would want to be a complete cripple to get the whole lot&mdash;he would get £4 5s., approximately, per week and that a man on social benefit, without stamps, can now get £3 12s. 6d. if he has four children in addition to fuel allowances and milk, we find that even though he is temporarily unemployed he can get almost as much as an applicant under this Bill will now get.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the injustice of saying that any successful applicant under this Act will get nothing for his past injuries and that he will only get, if he can establish that he is a complete cripple, £4 5s. a week for his lifespan whether it be one year or five years and that will necessarily be limited in the case of those who were of an age to take part in the Tan War or the Civil War.</P>
      <P>It is completely unjust because the man's case is that when his application was made his disease was accepted and the only argument was that while it was not accepted as attributable it may have been aggravated by service. That was all accepted 30 years ago. The question of a man coming in after 40 years does not apply in this case.  This is a man who established a disease before a medical board. They have all the evidence.  This is not a case of a man coming along 40 years afterwards.  All the evidence is with the pension board, proved probably not once but twice.  This Bill gives the man nothing or gives him a little more than a man can get as a non-contributory allowance.</P>

      <P>This section is a penal section.  This is the section that says that no matter what disability you suffered prior to this, any pension payable before this Act will only be payable on the passing of this Act.  That is bad enough, but you are not allowed to apply at all once you did not apply before so many months passed.  That is a double penalty.  If <Col N="3045" /> the time limit were eliminated altogether, this section would be ample punishment for their failure to apply in time.  But it is there, however, and all appeals to the Minister to eliminate that have been in vain.  When you apply for a disability pension, it should be paid and all the circumstances should be taken into account in calculating the amount of retrospective pay.</P>

      <P>Section 3 may be of benefit to Deputy Sherwin and others, but I do not know if Deputy Sherwin made his point sufficiently clear.  Take the case of a person who applied for a disability pension in the '30s and narrowly failed before the medical board, but who now has evidence available to him which, if it were available at the time of his application, would have resulted in the application being approved.  Surely there is no reason in the world why retrospective payment should not be given in that case?  If the evidence originally submitted can now be substantiated with additional evidence pertinent to the case, which had not been available at that time, surely the Minister would consider that that person has suffered unduly and has not been recompensed in accordance with the Act?  I can give a specific case of an applicant who went before the medical board in the 1930s but was narrowly turned down because the medical evidence was not sufficient.  He now has evidence available to him which, had it been available to him at that time, would have resulted in the approval of the application without any question of deterioration entering into it. In that case it would be only equitable that retrospective payment be made.  Possibly I am wrong, but I took the Minister as saying that cases would be taken on their merits.</P>

      <P>I know the type of case referred to by Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Carroll.  They are asking me again to introduce a new principle. Deputy MacEoin asked me to introduce a new principle earlier on.  I do not feel I can concede that on this Bill anyway.  Retrospection there has not been, and the outstanding case of refusal <Col N="3046" /> of retrospection was, we all know, the 1934 Military Service Pensions Act.  All efforts, including my own, failed to succeed there.  It has never been conceded in any of these Acts.  At this short notice on this Bill I can hardly be expected to suspend the further passage of the Bill and go back to the Government with a request for a further examination for the introduction of two new principles.</P>
      <P>What I would say to the two Deputies is: Let this go through. Let us, as far as we can, in the quickest possible time tidy up all these Acts, get some sort of compendious view of them and see what further improvements we can make. All I can say to the two Deputies is that every reasonable case will receive a very sympathetic hearing from the Government.  I do not want to detract one iota from the case made by the two Deputies, knowing, as I do, the type of case they have in mind; but it is not within my competence at this stage to meet them.</P>

If the Minister makes inquiries from his Department, he will find that requests were made over the years as far back as 15 years ago for a section like the one he has now brought in, but that request was ignored for 15 years. Had that been done 15 years ago, there would be no point in making the appeal now.  I am not at all satisfied to accept letting the matter drop now and that it will be thought of again.  The people concerned will probably be dead by then.  The Minister has to bring this Bill through the Seanad and he can very easily make provision for this between now and then.  It is a fact that once a person applies under a scheme, he is finished.  It is like the people taking corporation houses, even dumps.  They say they are only taking them temporarily but the corporation say: &ldquo;You are permanently stuck with it.&rdquo; Applicants under this Bill will be stuck, too.

There is only a children's allowance when the pensioner dies.  A man who has his health and strength and who is temporarily unemployed can get £3 12s. 6d. for himself, his wife and four children plus fuel and a number of other things.  He can even go to the relief people and get another 10/-.  But to get £4 5s. including this 11/6d. you have to be a complete cripple.  There should be a stepping up of all these allowances.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Money Resolution, I would like to refer the Minister to the accounts of the ESB for the year ending 31st March last in so far as they are affected by this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to raise the amount for both the special fund and the general fund from £32,000,000 to £37,000,000 and from £120,000,000 to £125,000,000 respectively.  If the Minister will look at page 4 of the ESB accounts he will find this curious phrase: &ldquo;the total investment for productive use at the 31st March was&rdquo; and then follows a figure of £113,742,906.  I find that hard to understand. The implication to be taken from it is that there are funds of the ESB invested unproductively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood that the whole purpose and function of the ESB was to invest the money given to it in a productive <Col N="3049" /> fashion.  I may have missed something but the manner in which that is phrased suggests to me that there are some moneys invested unproductively by the ESB and I am not prepared to give the Board of the ESB any further money until I know what are the unproductive investments.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, I find the greatest possible difficulty in understanding the statement of capital contained in pages 22 and 23 of the Board's report.  Originally, on page 4, we are told that the total fixed capital is £118,700,000.  We then come to page 23 and we find that the outstanding balance of repayable capital is £79,889,000.  That figure is apparently carried into the capital account on page 22, Account No. 9, and then the total of capital is set out as being £126,834,000.  Again, I do not understand how the various figures are reconciled one with the other.  It would be easy for me to go into very many other aspects of the ESB accounts but I do not propose to do so, because I am taking the view that this Bill is for the purpose of dealing with the capital of the Board and nothing more.</P>
    <P>I should like to have some figures from the Minister before we give the Board a very substantial further sum of money or before we raise the permissive figure from £120,000,000 to £125,000,000.  I should like to have some comparisons between the position here and in other countries.  For example, let me take the position in the USA.  In the USA, I am informed that the installed generating capacity is 174 million kilowatts for a population of 177,000,000 people.  That is one kilowatt per person as I calculate the figures.  In Canada, where the population is 17 millions, the installed generating capacity is 18 million kilowatts. In the United Kingdom, the percentage is down considerably; the installed generating capacity is 35,000,000 kilowatts and the population is 52,000,000, so that in the United Kingdom, it is in the ratio of only about .7 kilowatts per person.  I do not know what our figures are here compared with our population.  I do not know whether we are anywhere near the United Kingdom figure which, in <Col N="3050" /> itself, is very substantially below that for Canada or for the United States of America, or whether we are at the other end of the scale, which would be, I suppose, Japan where the installed capacity is about 21,000,000 kilowatts for a population of 92,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister is coming to the House now for the purpose of getting substantially increased funds for the Board and it is, I think, essential we should know what our pattern is in relation to the rest of the world.  In view of the immanence of the Common Market discussions, I should like to see where we are travelling in relation to capacity per population as compared with the other countries in the &ldquo;Six&rdquo;.  The availability of our resources in this and, of course, in other respects are matters we shall have to take into account.  It is desirable we should have a picture showing where we stand in relation to these matters before this money is given.  I have no doubt that the Minister, when deciding these additional moneys were necessary, gave the fullest consideration to our comparison with other countries.  I hope he will give the House the benefit of the results of that consideration.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy looks at the balance sheet of the ESB he will find at page 24 the information he requires.  The greater part of the assets are productive in the sense that they are producing electricity.  There are also stocks of various kinds in hands and in transit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not be described strictly as productive.  It depends, I suppose, on the definition of productive.  This Table provides the nearest information I can give him at this short notice as to how the assets are distributed between the various items.  I think the Table gives the Deputy most of the information he requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The installed capacity of the ESB on 1st April this year was 723,000 kilowatts, roughly .25 kilowatts per <Col N="3051" /> head of the population.  Comparisons with other countries are almost impossible because the capacity required per head depends on the degree of industrial development and the character of the transmission.  It depends also on the different types of generation. A country with a vast proportion of water power held in reserve through the operation of dams requires a different type of installed capacity from a country which derives most of its power from coal or oil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to make exact comparisons.  There is also the problem of peak load demand.  That varies from country to country.  A country with a great deal of industrial shiftwork at night may have a different peak load factor as compared with a country with a less advanced state of industrialisation.  The latter may have a very high peak load occurring at certain times of the day due to the absence of an overall industrial usage. This country is not exactly comparable with other countries because here we have a combination of peat-fired thermal capacity, hydro capacity and coal or oil capacity.  At different periods of the year there may be sudden generation changes.  Sometimes a very bad peak year may be followed by an extremely dry autumn with a corresponding low hydro capacity. It is really impossible to make comparisons of an exact character with other countries.  I do not think I could do the exercise usefully for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has misread the figures.  It seems to me that, if one wants to have alternate capacity to switch from hydro to thermal, then the ration of installed generating capacity should be higher and not, as the Minister suggested, lower.  Be that as it may, it is highly desirable that we should have before us some figures if we want to make some comparisons in our own way in order to draw our own conclusions. I am not suggesting for a moment that <Col N="3052" /> everyone approaching the same figures with the same degree of objectivity would necessarily arrive at the same answer at the end, but it is desirable that we should have the information in relation particularly to our proposed competitors in the Common Market.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to Scandinavia is as the Minister indicated. They have a very high proportion of hydro facilities available.  I would urge the Minister very strongly between this and our resumption to obtain some figures from the other countries in the Six and from the Scandinavian countries in regard to the installed generating capacity in each, distinguishing them, if the Minister so wishes, between thermal and hydro, so that we can, when we are discussing his Estimate in the autumn, take account of the difference, if we so desire, between their potentialities and our potentialities from the point of view of their being our competitors. Only a Minister, with the facilities available through our diplomatic missions abroad, can get the information. I would be satisfied today if the Minister would give me an undertaking that he will endeavour to get such information as is possible during the Recess and I will put down a question to him on the resumption before his Estimate is taken so that he can give such comparisons as are available.</P>

      <P>Yes, surely.  He will find a great deal of comparative material there but I read the entire document from end to end and it is difficult to find something which is of real use because of the many differences <Col N="3053" /> in conditions.  All I can find out from these statistics is that we are making progress in the use of electricity; that we have a vast amount of progress to make still; that we are behind certain countries in the use of electricity for purely farm machinery purposes; that we are making considerable advances in the past two or three years in the use of farm machinery; that the installable cost of rural electrification compared with the main countries in Europe is extremely reasonable, even without making any&mdash;how shall I put it&mdash; financial allowance for the extremely scattered nature of households here; that the consumption per head is growing fairly rapidly.  I have not got these figures by me and could not give without some notice the comparative figures of consumption per head for domestic or industrial purposes.</P>
      <P>I do not think they will reveal anything of great significance except the fact that we are progressing but we have a long way to go in comparison with countries such as Sweden which had from the very beginning a very well developed hydro-electric system and where all the people have been traditionally associated with electrical development.  It would be very difficult to derive conclusions of a useful character in relation to this Bill but if the Deputy would read some of the material and then if he would like to ask questions for the next session I will endeavour to reply to them in the best way I can and will endeavour to ascertain whether there is anything of significance in the comparisons which would be of interest in regard to our whole development.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell me in relation to Sections 2 and 3 why there is a most peculiar quirk between the two?  Section 2 deals with the amendment of the 1958 Act by the substitution of &ldquo;thirty-seven million&rdquo; for &ldquo;thirty-two million&rdquo; in a perfectly normal straightforward way. Section 3, however, instead of being of the same straightforward drafting, says &ldquo;shall not exceed one hundred and thirty-five million pounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall be construed as if that sum were substituted for the sum mentioned there in.&rdquo;  Why could not the two sections have been drawn in exactly the same way?  The existing maximum provision which is being substituted by Section 3 is £120,000,000.  Why could not Section 3 be drafted in exactly the same simple manner as Section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 deals with the provision of moneys for electricity distribution systems in non-electrified rural areas.  Could the Minister say how many such areas there are at present?  I am rather surprised that this section and the following section contain no amendment of the nature we had hoped for which would provide for the abolition of special charges.  I am sure the Minister has had a number of representations relative to the special charges.  Everybody knows that electricity supply was a national scheme commenced some 38 years ago to provide electrification for every household in the country. Unfortunately, down through the years residents in remote or isolated areas are penalised to the extent that service is not provided for them unless they are willing to pay a special charge, which in my opinion is contrary, and even repugnant, to our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think that so much headway having been made in rural electrification we would now have reached the point where the section of the community living in remote areas would be dealt with.  It is most unfair and most unjust that a person living in an isolated or remote place or in an area where his neighbours are not willing or anxious to avail of the service should be penalised by the <Col N="3056" /> imposition of a special charge.  There is a big number of such cases in Cork south west and I am sure in other areas also.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that most of the people affected are usually of the low income group, farmers living in mountainy places or people removed from large centres of population. I should like if the Minister could give us any idea whether the moneys proposed to be expended under Section 4 will go towards the relief of such people, whether the Board has had any discussion with the Department of late in regard to representations made for the abolition of the special charge.  Before going further I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the special charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy evidently did not bother to read the Second Reading speech and probably does not know anything about the Bill.  I have noticed that in connection with a lot of what he has been saying today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tried that game before.  The Minister endeavoured to side-track issues.  This is about his third lecture today.  I do not want any lecture from him at all. Most of his speeches are not worth reading.  In any case, tell us all about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the Deputy does not think it worth reading I am afraid he will have to read it if he wants to get the facts.  Section 4 provides a special backbone grant of £90,000 which, in addition to the subsidy, will enable the ESB to complete the development of 17 areas in the country which are at present regarded as uneconomic because of the high proportion of households which will have to pay special charges. Of those areas there are three in county Cork&mdash;Doonpeter, Glendine and Dunbeacon.  That will result in about half the houses in these areas, which are mostly areas where the houses are widely separated, being able to obtain connection without a special service charge.  Another group of householders will be able to get connection by paying something extra.  Then there will be some who will be very remote <Col N="3057" /> and who will be able to get a subsidy of £10 for bottled gas as already indicated on the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill enables the ESB to go into these 17 difficult areas for the first time through the provision of the special grant of £90,000 to provide the main line carrying the current into the area so as to reduce the total cost of installation to the point where the householders would be able to have a connection at the ordinary charges.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some little relief in this measure but everyone expected that the next electricity Bill that would come before the House would deal completely with this section of the community who are paying special charges.  Would the Minister say whether it is lawful or justifiable to ask these people to pay special charges?  Was the supplying of electricity not a national service initiated by the Government some 38 years ago from which every citizen was to benefit?  These people have had to wait, and possibly rightly so, until the more populous areas were dealt with.  Quite a number of people connected in my own constituency in County Cork have had to pay the special charge, otherwise they would not get the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister propose to do anything about the special charge these people are paying?  There are some areas connected in Cork quite recently and they have all had to pay the special charge in order to get service.  I am making the claim on behalf of these people that that special charge is unlawful and unjustifiable.  The Constitution clearly lays down that all sections of the community must be dealt with equitably.  Everyone should be entitled on an equal basis to a <Col N="3058" /> national services such as the ESB. Unfortunately, a section of our people scattered throughout the country, mainly in the more remote parts, are penalised and must sign on the dotted line to pay a special charge to be supplied with current.</P>
    <P>I would make a special plea to the Minister to do justice to these people and to give them what they are lawfully entitled to.  I mentioned before that if the special charges were abolished someone would have to foot the bill, that the Minister would have to find the money from some source. If the special charges were levied on the general body of consumers throughout the country it would be an insignificant additional charge on them.  I suggest there would be nothing wrong in asking the community as a whole to foot the bill and I see no reason why the special charge should be in existence at all.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy is very vocal about these special charges.  They have always been an irritation to all of us and I have had as much experience of them in certain areas of County Limerick as Deputy Murphy has had in West Cork.

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce did something else which made it much more complicated and costly on the consumer. The Minister is going a good distance in the matter of special charges.  They have been a source of irritation to many of us who could not understand why these charges were made at all and why even people in remote areas could not get the same service from the ESB at the same charge as people in the most populous areas.  In any case, the ESB told us again and again they could not do it. The Minister is now coming to the rescue through the taxpayer in order <Col N="3059" /> to relieve the people who are paying special charges of a substantial portion of the burden.  We must wait to see how it works.</P>

      <P>Regardless of a ball being at anybody's feet, the fact, of course, is that the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass when he was sitting on these benches, gave a solemn undertaking that when Fianna Fáil went into Government in 1957 they would abolish the special charges forthwith. He has found, as the Minister has found&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that that is not a practical proposition in the present phase of the situation.  If Deputy Ó Briain wants to look up the reference where the Taoiseach said that in the most categorical terms I shall willingly give it to him.  Be that as it may, I should like to get some other information from the Minister.  Up to the 31st of March last in a total of 754 areas that have been completed for rural electrification, 264,783 consumers have been connected.  Could the Minister tell me has the board got an estimate, apart from new areas, of how many potential consumers there were in those areas who have not, for one reason or another, taken supply?</P>
      <P>It was unfortunate that, when the scheme for rural electrification started, the areas were started in circles rather than in grid squares.  If the country had been divided in grid squares, then there would not have been the difficulty in relation to pockets that has arisen in every constituency, even in the constituency where the percentage of connection has been extremely high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of starting by means of grouping the areas in an approximately circular distribution was one that, perhaps, made it easier at the time of doing it, but it certainly is the main cause of the difficulty and the annoyances that have arisen in developed areas of the country.  When the Minister was speaking originally, he referred to the position arising in <Col N="3060" /> respect of 6,000 dwellings.  I am not clear from his Second Reading speech whether that figure applies to existing areas already developed or whether it is outside, covering what I might call the pockets in developed counties, apart from areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to a total of 283,000 potential consumers, being another 19,000.  Where does he propose to get those in relation to development?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 6,000 householders refers to the 17 undeveloped areas.  I understand that about 286,000 out of 388,000 householders have taken current in the areas that have been developed up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board's report says 264,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The general position is as I indicated on Second Reading, namely, that when all the 275 areas have been developed and completed&mdash; leaving only 17 areas that have not been touched because, with the subsidy available, the charges were too high&mdash;there will then be 112,000 households for connection.  Of these, 77,000 should be able to secure supply without special service charge, and 23,000 should be able to secure supply with a service charge of up to 50 per cent. above normal but, in the case of a great many, not a very great amount of extra charge.</P>
      <P>The effect of the 75 per cent. subsidy is that there are virtually no householders left who will be paying between 50 per cent. and 100 per cent. extra service charge.  There are left, then, 12,000 who will be paying 100 per cent. or over; who live in remote areas and for whom the bottled gas subsidy is being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has misunderstood the figures.  The figure of 288,000 is the figure not of those houses that have been connected but the figure of the houses that have been connected, plus the ones it is anticipated will be connected under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of the Second Reading, the Board's accounts were not in our possession.  There is a very definite contradiction between the speech of the Minister as reported at columns 1926 and 1927 and the Board's account in Appendix 12.  It is that difference that I want to get clear. Appendix 12 says that we have 264,783 consumers already connected up to 31st March last.  The Minister has just said that 288,000 consumers have already been connected.  I do not think that is so.  I think the indication is that the effect of this Bill is to connect up another 19,000 consummers approximately and that, with these consumers, we shall have a total of 283,000.  I am dropping the odd figures.  That will mean, out of our total dwellings in the State, about 112,000 unconnected premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that these are the correct figures, trying in with that, and not the figures which the Minister has just given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I misread one: it should be 280,000.  The initial development will provide for the Deputy's figure of 283,000 out of 395,000 rural dwellings.  That is the correct figure to go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>It is a bad mistake. The Minister was endeavouring this afternoon to point out other people's alleged mistakes.  I should like to hear the Minister on this special charge.  It is not proposed to wipe it out now but could the Minister say if he has had discussions with the Board on this matter, or if there is any likelihood of its being wiped out this year or next year&mdash;or what is his outlook and that of the Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This was dealt with <Col N="3062" /> at great length at the time of the Estimates. The urban consumer is already heavily subsidising the rural consumer. On current account, the loss to the ESB for the rural area has been running at the rate of about £700,000 a year.  That is met by the profit from the urban areas.  It would be impossible to ask the urban area dwellers to do more than they are doing.  The basis of this Bill is to do the utmost the State can do without involving itself in too heavy a capital commitment.</P>
      <P>As I have said, it will result in 77,000 householders, out of a total of 112,000, being able to get current at normal service charge and another 23,000 being able to get current for a very modest supplementary charge. That should not have any really severe effect on the economics of the household concerned.  Therefore, we are doing our utmost.</P>
      <P>The capital contribution of the State towards this whole project is very considerable.  The total amount of capital required over the next 15 years to finance the adoption of all these proposals is about £10,800,000.  Of this, the State will be finding in subsidies of one kind or another, some £7,200,000 and the ESB will be finding the remainder by obtaining advances from the Exchequer or by issuing its own prospectuses asking the public to subscribe towards this development.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is possible to do more than that at the moment.  I think this increase of subsidy is a generous gesture.  I would remind the Deputy that, in 1955, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce abolished the capital grant towards rural electrification.  It was only renewed again in 1958.  That left a certain burden of permanent payment to the ESB.  By the terms of this Bill, we are doing the best we can and I do not think that what has been offered is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister or the board have ever had a look at the Department of Agriculture scheme for subsidising the <Col N="3063" /> distribution of lime, which could be related to the provision of electric current.  Take a scattered area like West Cork.  A man living at the end of the Berehaven Peninsula, almost 100 miles away from a lime quarry, gets his lime delivered at the same price as the man who is living only ten miles away from the quarry because the Department of Agriculture felt it was a national scheme and that everyone should benefit equally, irrespective of distance from the lime kiln.  Would it not be reasonable to assert that the ESB should do something similar? Why should a man living in a remote area be penalised?  The Department of Agriculture had to address themselves to that question.  I am sure some of the people availing of this scheme in areas remote from lime quarries are heavily subsidised and there does not seem to be any complaint in this House, by urban or rural members, about the subsidy because it was felt a man should not be penalised because of his remoteness from a quarry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Electricity Supply Board not act in a similar fashion and not penalise the man who is in a remote area?  It is a national scheme and the reason I am mentioning this for the third time is because it is seldom that we have an opportunity to discuss the activities of the ESB in this House. If questions are put down the Minister can shelter under the regulation that he has no function in their day to day activities.  Deputy Ó Briain, of County Limerick, which is a very compact county compared with County Cork, mentioned that he has had representations about the special charges.  It is a most aggravating charge for which there is no justification. Surely it is within the competence of the Minister or the ESB to devise a system whereby that charge would be abolished?  I know that charges cannot be abolished without getting the money from some other source.  I maintain it would not be unfair to balance that account from the general body of consumers.  I am not in possession of the actual figure derived annually from this charge but <Col N="3064" /> if it was abolished I am offering the Minister a suggestion.  As we want to make our State companies pay their way then if the charge is abolished the ESB must make their money from some other source, which I submit should be the general body of consumers. They should treat all those rural people alike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister mind answering a question which I asked some time ago and which was lost in the welter of discussion?  How many consumers are there unconnected in the geographical boundaries of the 754 areas which the Board in their report say they completed?  Another way of putting it is what proportion of the 112,000 is in that part?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not think I have the figure the Deputy requires because I have given the main figures upon which the whole Bill is based. There are still some areas uncompleted where work is going on later than it was thought would be necessary because of the storm damage of last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in a particular figure for a purpose.  In Kildare an area has been developed and at the time the area was developed certain houses were not in that area at all.  The Land Commission then came in and made a settlement in the area and there are some new houses <Col N="3065" /> there which were not there when the area was developed.  Those new houses up to this have been treated in a special way and penalised in a most unfair way by the ESB.  The reason I wanted the other figure was to ensure that I could see the actual extent of that problem, even though I know a great many individual instances of it.</P>
      <P>It does seem to me to be grossly unfair that where the State, in pursuance of State policy, put a house in an area which, fortuitously, may already have been developed, the occupant of that house, now there for the first time, should have to pay more than he would have had to pay if he had been there when the area was being developed in the initial instance. That is happening in virtually every case in Kildare where new Land Commission houses are erected.  It is a grossly unfair system.  I can quite understand that there would be a case that where a man was there and refused to accept supply at the time the area in question was being developed, and changed his mind at a later stage, he might have to pay more than he would have had to pay in the first instance.</P>

      <P>In so far as I know these people will have their service charges examined in connection with that part of the scheme whereby the <Col N="3066" /> ESB will adjust the charges of rural consumers who will remain paying special service charges and whose position will be less satisfactory than those who are now going to join the system under the 75 per cent.  Subsidy arrangement.  I understand there are about 15,000 rural consumers at present paying a special service charge which, incidentally, is not an enormous one.  Some 3,000 will have the charges eliminated altogether and in the case of the remaining 12,000 the charges will be reduced by about half. That group, I think I can say without asking further questions, will include these Land Commission houses.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to make further and better provision with respect to housing and, in particular, with respect to the provision of loans and grants by the State and by local authorities in relation to housing, for that purpose to amend, extend and repeal certain enactments, and to make provision with respect to other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct a few figures the Minister gave on the last occasion, particularly for the benefit of Deputy Dolan from Cavan who allowed himself to be codded by the Minister on that occasion. In reply to the Second Stage debate, the Minister gave certain figures at column 2247 of the Official Report, of grants outstanding at the date when Fianna Fáil came into office on 10th March, 1957.  He was wrong in that date because it was 22nd March, I think.  However, that does not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was perfectly clear to anyone who knew the facts that the grants to <Col N="3068" /> which he was referring were those given in the ordinary way in relation to conduit pipes.  I put down a question to the Minister asking him to give the figures for similar areas, similar dates and under similar headings, which he purported to give on 12th July.  He told the House that he had not got the figures in question and that to extract them from the records would take an amount of time which he was not prepared to expend.  I accept that it would take time to extract them under the various headings.</P>
    <P>In the absence of that extraction, we have ready to our hands a very simple method of comparison: the table published every week in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> of issues from the Local Loans Fund. The issues from the Local Loans Fund would be the total issues, and as the Minister would not produce the information in reply to the question, I cannot give the individual breakdown. Let me put the facts on record in relation to the moneys spent or, shall I say, the moneys paid &mdash; because &ldquo;spent&rdquo; might mean expended in another way&mdash;out of the Local Loans Fund during the various years for the same period of each year as was announced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The House is aware, of course, that both in relation to private individual housing grants and Local Loans Fund issues, the local authority issues the best information that can be given in the absence of a reply to my question. I do not suggest that the Minister was wrong in saying it would take a long time.  I know it would take a lot of time to get those figures.</P>
    <P>I have taken the date as near as I can on each occasion to the date the Minister gave, 10th March, 1959. From 1st April, 1953, to 13th March, 1954, the amount paid by the Government out of the Local Loans Fund was £7,450,000.  From 1st April, 1954, to 12th March, 1955, the amount paid by the Government was £6,400,000.  From 1st April, 1955, to 10th March, 1956, the amount paid by the Government was £6,350,000.  From 1st April, 1956, to 9th March, 1957, the amount paid, when certain Deputies alleged nothing was paid, <Col N="3069" /> was £8,550,000.  That is the date chosen by the Minister himself.</P>

      <P>If, as the Minister says, the money was in the concrete pipes, at that date it would have shown in the following years.  No amount of misunderstanding of the position by any Deputy can controvert the fact that these figures are all recorded in the weekly returns published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i> by the Minister for Finance over his signature.  Every Deputy who wishes to take the trouble <Col N="3070" /> to verify the figures can do so.  The amount paid in that year was never before exceeded or since.  The Minister did not feel entitled to put his staff to the trouble of segregating the matter out in detail and I have, therefore, taken the figures from this authoritative source&mdash;the weekly returns published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> under the Finance Acts.</P>

      <P>The only thing I should like to deal with, very briefly, is the fact that the figures I gave here the other day have been in no way controverted by anything Deputy Sweetman has now said.  I gave figures totalling about £3,000,000 rendered necessary by failure on the part of the then Government to meet commitments they had entered into and had encouraged local authorites to enter into under several heads, included in which were the financing of supplementary grants SDA loans, water and sewerage schemes and local authority building schemes.  Money had been committed to all those but was not paid out until Fianna Fáil came back into office and no matter what Deputy Sweetman may now say, the figures on record since the previous day have not been controverted.  They are, in fact, the correct figures of what was outstanding, to the tune of £3,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to tell us what is the position about the grants which are payable in respect of housing in the country at large.  This is the section which provides the scale of grants for the provision of houses.  The section sets out:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and subject to regulations under this section, make, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, to a person or public utility society providing one or more than one house in respect of which a grant under this section has not been made a grant not exceeding the appropriate sum specified in the Second Schedule to this Act if, but only if&mdash;</P>
      <P>and then proceeds to set out the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if complaints have reached the Minister in respect of the existing scale of grants.  A very large number of grantees throughout the country are experiencing unprecedented delays in getting housing grants and I should be glad to know if the Minister has received representations on that point.  I have received a good many from my own constituency but I am obliged to say that in respect of what I should imagine is one third of those, I believe that the fault lay with the grantee of the public utility society more than with the Department of Local Government.  I have discovered on more than one occasion that the Department has replied to me that they are taking steps to expedite the <Col N="3073" /> examination of the house for the purpose of paying the grant but that they feel bound to add that my representation was the first intimation they had received that the work had been completed.</P>
    <P>There remain quite a considerable number of persons who have complained to me of undue delay in the making of their grants and I have relayed these complaints individually to the Department.  What causes me concern, however, is that in discussing this with my colleagues, I find a great many Deputies of the Party have had the same experience and some have had more comprehensive complaints. I have heard it suggested that this may be due to the situation that has arisen as a consequence of the present Minister's decision to abolish what were known as appointed officers and the substitution of inspectors from the Department to do the inspection locally.  I do not know what the cause is but I should be interested to hear from the Minister if he has received many complaints of the kind I describe because, so far as my information goes, it would appear that a great many such complaints are extant and I think this is the appropriate time to clarify the position and let the House know whether there is substantial arrear of payments of housing grants in the various categories covered by Section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The general tendency in housing legislation is to improve grants as new Bills come along but this seems to be the exception so far as the provision of new houses is concerned.  There is no upward tendency in the scale of grants while everybody knows that building costs increase week by week.  It was always the policy of this House to encourage people as far as possible to provide their own houses and to encourage people in, say, low or middle income groups to provide their own accommodation where the local authority might otherwise be obliged to do so. A maximum grant of £300 for a five-room house where no facilities are available is not more than one-sixth of the total cost of building the house <Col N="3074" /> at present in a rural area.  It is rather peculiar that the Minister did not follow precedent by increasing the grants.  Is there any possibility now that he would consider changing the figures on the Report Stage?  What advantage is this Bill in regard to the provision of new houses from the point of view of State grants?  No advantage accrues.  The figures are the same as in the 1958 Act while costs since 1958 have increased sharply.</P>
      <P>I am sure that a house that could be built four years ago for £1,500 would cost £1,800 today and it is odd that the Minister has not given some encouragement to people to build their own houses by providing increased grants in this Bill.  I know that a number of people in my constituency anxiously awaited this Bill because they felt there would be a substantial increase in the grants and that with these grants and the loans they could possibly raise from the local authority they could build their own houses.  The Minister has sadly disappointed such people.  I regret very much that he has not increased the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed, and I have already said so, that the State grants remain at the existing level.  Many who wished to provide their own houses looked forward to this Bill, not people in the upper income bracket, not poor people, but artisans, tradesmen and factory workers.  They are now alarmed.  I received a large deputation before I left my constituency today expressing alarm and asking me to ask the Minister to reconsider this matter of State grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister wants to build more houses, get on with the housing programme in various parts of the country and that he wants to solve the housing problem, especially in regard to young people just married or about to be married.  I am not referring now to the backlog of people married some years ago and inadequately housed in flats.  If this Bill goes through with the grants maintained at the present level I believe it will bring housing activities to a standstill all over the country because, as many <Col N="3075" /> Deputies have said, costs have increased by nearly 25 per cent. in the past three or four years.  I strongly exhort the Minister to do as Deputy Murphy suggested and consider, between now and the Report Stage, increasing the grants for building houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the query by the Leader of the Opposition as to delay in the outpayment of grants and related matters, while what he said would be a true reflection of the situation some six, eight or 12 months ago, it is not so now.  We have no backlog in the Department and, judging from the manner in which the staff are now coping with the ever-increasing number of applications, it does not appear as if any real hold-up would arise in the foreseeable future.  Twelve months ago, due to a shortage of inspectors and a rising rate of applications, we were in a bad way.  That is now changed but if there are cases of delay arising, particularly in any one constituency or area, I would be very anxious to get details of them.  The general information in the Department is that there is no such backlog or undue delay and that there should not be any.  I would be obliged to any Deputy who finds such is the case to let me know so that we can see what is the matter.  We are not aware that it is the case throughout the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>As I explained on Second Reading, a very sizeable amount of money is being provided by the State for these very desirable grants.  Provision is also being made, as has been the case for some years past, for a system of supplementary grants, complementary to the Local Government grants. Depending on the type of scheme adopted, these may run as high as the total grant received from the Department. In respect of many new houses grants totalling £550 or £600 are paid out by the local authority and the Department, free, non-repayable grants. I assert that is a very considerable and pretty generous contribution towards the erection of new houses, no matter by whom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3076" /> The evidence that the grants are of considerable attraction is provided by the increasing number of people coming forward to build their own houses.  I take it from the manner in which we heard two Deputies speak a few minutes ago that they were referring to those in the middle income group or those slightly below.  They are the people about whom they are concerned and not the better-off people.  Although there is no increase in grants in this Bill, there is a new provision in which the income ceiling has been raised in respect of supplementary grants.  In addition, for the first time local authorities will not have to adhere to a table of grants laid down by the Department.  Where the local authority so desires, they can pay the full supplementary grant to any group of people provided their income does not exceed £832 per year. Where the local authority feel any group needs a little more help than they received in the past&mdash;the lack of which may have been decried by local authorities &mdash; they may now pay the full supplementary grant to each applicant, even in cases where the income is £830 per annum.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are in the best position to decide in these matters.  Where they are aware that certain classes in their area need added help, they are much more free to direct supplementary grants to them.  The only control on them is that the applicant must not have more than £832 per annum income. That change will, I feel, work to the advantage of the type of people Deputies are concerned with &mdash; those for whom the local authorities are not building and are not likely to build, those who wish to build for themselves but whose financial position is not strong enough.  That provision can be of substantial benefit in various cases.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have a similar position in regard to repair and reconstruction grants, which are also running at a very high level.  If they were falling off, it would be a clear indication that we had either reached the end of the road or that our people could not afford to repair.  Since we have the evidence that the allocation of grants is <Col N="3077" /> still running at a very high level, it is only fair to assume that the amount of the grants has been a sufficient inducement up to the present.  The fact that the demand for grants is growing would seem to refute the idea that the amount paid is too small.</P>
    <P>That is the background against which this matter should be examined. While quite a number of the Housing Bills introduced here in the past made provision for increased grants, that pattern was not followed in all cases. It is not true, as has been asserted, that a precedent has been established of increasing the grants every time a new Housing Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>This section contains another provision of value to our people.  Every other Housing Bill introduced here over a considerable number of years had a terminal date attached to it. People have been assured of the continuance of State grants only for a limited time, usually for two years. Deputies will note in this section that no terminal date is included.  Therefore, there is contained in the Bill an assurance of the continuation of grants rather than the two-yearly instalments that have been a feature of our housing legislation for many years past.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Local Government, I naturally would be only too happy to give double the grants.  But, having regard to all the other projects requiring money from the taxpayer and the ratepayer, I do not think in fairness that any worthwhile increase could be justified at present in this legislation. For that reason I have to tell the House that the grants are not being increased, but I point out to the House that any time an increase seems desirable, it can be brought about by way of a simple amendment.  Indeed, that is the way the matter will be dealt with in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was announced by the Government Party 12 months before it was actually introduced. We had special boxes in the daily papers announcing that a new Housing Bill would be introduced. Many people intending to build new <Col N="3078" /> houses believed the grants would be increased.  The Minister tells us now that the grants are sizeable.  If they are sizeable in 1962 were they not much more sizeable in 1958?  Instead of getting an improvement in this Bill we have got a reduction on a percentage basis.  I am giving a figure of £1,800 to build a reasonable five roomed house with sewerage and water.  The maximum grant for that is £300 which would be 16? per cent. of the total cost of the work. Four years ago £1,500 would build a similar house and the grant by the State towards the building of that house was 20 per cent.  Instead of getting a larger grant the builder of the house must now provide a greater percentage of the outlay than formerly.</P>
      <P>The Minister comes along to the House and deals with Section 2 and Section 12 together.  He states that a person building a house enjoying an income of £600, £700 or £800 can qualify for a supplementary grant.  He said that in the terms of Section 12 it was clearly implied that a housing authority may provide housing grants to applicants.  However, it is only optional on them to provide grants and we all know that a considerable number of housing authorities do not provide supplementary grants. Of the big bulk of urban housing authorities not more than four or five of them give partial supplementary grants and it is only very recently that they have been doing it.  If you take a person building in an urban town and another building in a non-urban town the man building a house within the prescribed limit of income in an urban area can only get £275 and in a town which has been de-urbanised, or which was never in that category, there is no grant available at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, new house grants are not paid by the Minister.  It is local revenue that must meet these supplementary grants.  Is the Minister now endeavouring to throw over from the Exchequer further burdens on to local revenues?  We hear a great deal of talk about the upward trend in rates but as a result of this Bill we will have <Col N="3079" /> a further upward trend in rates because the Exchequer and the Minister are passing on their obligations to the local authorities.  When the Minister tells us that a person within a valuation limit of £50 or an income limit of £830 can avail of supplementary grants it means that these supplementary grants are payable from the local revenue and it is unfair at this time to be passing over more burdens on to the local authorities.  They have sufficient burdens already.</P>
    <P>Housing is a national problem and I do not see why the Exchequer should not contribute much more to the provision of houses.  A decent house is the first essential for any man and his family and the local authorities are endeavouring to provide houses for people who cannot build them out of their own resources.  It is desirable that they should be relieved to some extent of that obligation, that the grants should be made more attractive and that people who otherwise would not be able to provide a house for themselves would be put in a position to do so with the aid of increased grants.  It is very disappointing to me that there is no increased contribution from the Exchequer in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put in a section dealing with reconstruction grants where, again, there is no increase.  He says that there is now no terminal date whereas formerly there was a terminal date of two years.  Everybody knows that that provision of a terminal date of two years was not effective at all. It was only a formality.  Was there ever a person who lost the grant by virtue of not having the work completed in the prescribed time?  There was not.  That provision in the Bill is of no advantage because several people who had not the work completed in the prescribed time had no difficulty in getting their money later on.</P>
    <P>From whatever point of view we examine this on behalf of people who are building new houses we must feel very disappointed.  The Minister says that the Bill will allow local authorities to give grants to people with <Col N="3080" /> higher incomes but there are not so many people who will benefit in that respect.  A man who was earning £500 in 1958 would now be earning £650 taking everything into account such as general wage increases since then and others matters.  The value of money has declined and is declining from month to month and the wage level must, therefore, be increased to offset the diminishing value of money. However, so far as the grants are concerned they are going to remain the same as they were four years ago.  I am terribly disappointed that there is no improvement in these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the information contained in the Minister's reply, because he has given us the opportunity of speaking now not only about the transfer of new houses but also about the supplementary grants given by the local authority.  It is in the Minister's power now to confer a great and lasting benefit on all the young people who want to build their own homes or who will be going into new council houses, because, when a grant is given, that reflects itself every Monday morning when the rent collector calls.  This grant confers the most lasting benefit of any grant given out of Government funds.  I do not think there is any more important duty on the Government and this House than to make provision for the building of houses for those who need them.  The Minister says there are a great many claims on the Exchequer. I submit there are very few more important claims than the claim that can be made for increased grants for housing.</P>
      <P>I want to point out to the Minister that, when the grants were £500 to £600 in the past four or five years, they must have been excessive; if they are sufficient now, they must have been excessive then.  I consider they were never excessive and they are not sufficient now.  I suggest to the Minister he should indicate to the House that he will consider between now and Report Stage the giving of some increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, a great many <Col N="3081" /> young people applied to the council for building sites.  They wanted to build houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  The Waterford Corporation said they would consider only applicants who had more than £12 per week.  Now the Minister has fixed a ceiling of £16 per week.  A State grant cannot be given to people with more than £16 per week.  In the past few months, a 40-hour week has been obtained by trade unions in various industries, plus a substantial increase in pay.  That has put up the cost of housing.  It has put up the wages of a great many young men who have only recently married or who are about to be married.  None of these young men with over £16 a week will qualify for a grant.  Since the money for the supplementary grant must be provided by the local authority I submit the matter should be left to the discretion of the local authority where a man is earning more than £16 per week, or £832 per year, as the Minister says.</P>
    <P>It used to be said at housing conferences all over the country that a day's pay was a fair week's rent for a house in urban areas.  Waterford city council are prepared to accept applications from young men, if their pay is over £12 per week, that is, £2 per day. That should be the standard for the week's rent &mdash; £2 per week.  That is a big rent.  But we cannot build houses at £2 per week under present conditions.  It is impossible to build them.  I have been making inquiries. I have been getting costings not only in my own constituency but elsewhere. I have gone out to see the houses advertised in Dublin, houses built by societies and private enterprise.  The houses are very nice houses, but the rents are colossal.  The rents are up to £15 per month.</P>
    <P>We will be facing a very serious situation I think if it goes out now from this House that there is no increase in the grants for new houses. Housing will inevitably slow down. The young people whom I mentioned earlier may have one child or may have just got married; they are anxious to get a house.  As it is, they have to go into flats.  They were hoping that <Col N="3082" /> the grants would be increased and that they would be able to build houses for themselves.  I am sure that is not just my experience but that it is the experience of many of my colleagues on both sides of this House.</P>
    <P>There are then the houses built under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  They would be houses built in order to clear slums or for the benefit of people in the lower income groups or those who have no fixed incomes at all.  The costings of these houses have soared also.  The best money this Government could lay out &mdash; and the Minister should put this to his colleagues in the Government &mdash; is money provided to offset substantial increases in rents.  That would be the most lasting benefit the Minister could confer on the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one figure to which we must address ourselves, particularly in relation to those who want to build modest houses for themselves, that is, the figure of £2,200. You will not build a small house for less than that.  Therefore, everything must be related to that figure.  Is the Minister satisfied that the income level inside which he is permitting borrowing is high enough in relation to that figure?  I do not think it is.  In this inflationary period, a great many people are moving into that income bracket.  The fact is £832 today represents only something like £280 pre-war.  The house that costs £2,200 to-day cost only £650 to build pre-war. Nothing makes sense unless one looks at that fact.  In the light of that, the whole conception of the present system of grants is wrong.  We must keep our eye on the high cost of building to-day.</P>

      <P>With regard to the higher ceiling of £17 per week, I do not think it should be really necessary for the Government to come immediately to the rescue with the taxpayers' money of a person with such an income.  There are many people who would be for years in Government jobs before reaching a maximum salary of £17 per week and they are fairly good risks for loans and are fairly well catered for by this ceiling.</P>

We are trying to do that within the meagre resources we have.  When building houses out of taxpayers' money, there must be some concern for the people who pay.  I have listened very attentively to the many pleas made from the other side for an increase in the grants.  The suggestion has been made that the people have been waiting for such increases.  I do not know who told the people on the other side that, unless they spread these rumours themselves.  I can speak for my own constituency.  While we might all like to see grants increased, there is one thing that the majority of people who reconstruct an old house or build a new one would be greatly concerned about, that is, will they get the money when the house is finished.  That is our primary concern.  It has been our experience in the past that people were <Col N="3084" /> not able to get the grants; they were caught between two stools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not necessary that we should arrive at some approximate figure?  Of course, it would depend to some degree on the cost of the land on which the house is set but we need not take that figure in.  Let us talk of what the contractor will charge for building the house.  Then we can regard the location of the house as an ancillary matter.  I am thinking primarily of the category of persons to whom Deputy Lynch referred, that is, the young married couple who want to build a house against their wedding day or, as he says, who having gone into a flat, when the family begins to come along, want to build a house in order to get a permanent home.  I admit at once that it must depend in some degree on the cost of the site on which you are going to build it but leave that out because that is a matter about which they can make their own election.  In any provincial city or town, if the land in the immediate vicinity of the city or town is too expensive, they can always move out a mile or two and they are in a rural area.  With the exception of Dublin and Cork, the suburbs do not stretch that far.  The suburbs are not so extensive around Limerick, Waterford, Clonmel, or the other provincial cities.  But it is interesting to find that approximately six Deputies, all professing to have a fairly accurate knowledge <Col N="3086" /> of building costs, all declare a substantially different figure as being the cost of such a house as I have described.  When Deputy Norton speaks of a £1,100 house, that would be something smaller than I have described?</P>

If that costs £2,200 today, I think it is true to say that five years ago, it would probably have cost £1,800 to build that house.  Is that not so?  Very well. We were giving £300, which represented one-sixth of the cost five years ago and if we are still giving £300, we are giving only one-seventh of the cost.</P>
      <P>That is a crucial figure.  I should have thought most people looked forward to this Bill as one which would maintain approximately the same percentage of the total cost as obtained on the last occasion when we fixed the rates of grants.  It is something the Minister must face if he is obliged to say that whereas we thought the State grant of one-sixth in the past was equitable, we now think a State grant of one-seventh is sufficient.  Let Deputy Dolan dismiss from his mind the question of figures and ask himself that question.  If he thought a sixth equitable five years ago, is it not still equitable?  If that is correct, should we not have increased the grant by £50?  The grant was approximately one-sixth five years ago.  The amount of the grant is the same but the cost of house building has gone up by about £400.</P>

      <P>I have always had the feeling that the allocation of supplementary grants is a very important factor in the building of private houses because it is the one thing that influences the person in going ahead, the difference between starting off with £300 or £600.  Up to the introduction of this Bill, which I hope will take effect as from 1st April last, very few people qualified for a supplementary grant at all.  For instance, the number of people in County Wicklow who qualified for a full supplementary grant as laid down in the Act of Parliament passed in 1953 was negligible. Any person in receipt of more than £416 did not qualify for a grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know that but as far as Wicklow is concerned, it was £416.  That meant that tradesmen, people who are on £8 a week &mdash; and these were the people likely to build their own houses &mdash; could not take advantage of this provision.  For the past four or five years, no one with an income in excess of £416 could get a supplementary grant.  Now the Minister proposes to allow local authorities to introduce a supplementary grant scheme whereby people earning up to £16 a week can benefit. Naturally, that will bring in a very large number of people.  That is the outstanding feature I see in this Bill and it is one thing which will, more than anything else, influence the building of houses.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the cost of building.  I am prepared to accept Deputy A. Barry's word for it that £2,200 is the price you will pay today for any sort of bungalow. As regards Deputy Dillon's reference to the number of rooms, I have some experience in this matter. Any person who decides to build a bungalow for himself tries to use the maximum floor space and the maximum floor space for a grant is 1,400 square feet.  If we take the figure mentioned by Deputy A. Barry on that basis, it works out at 30s. per square foot.</P>

      <P>No; I am not including the cost of the site.  I am speaking as a Deputy in a rural area where a site can be got for £50, £60 or £100.  I think we can take it that a house can be built for 30/- per square foot.  With regard to increasing the grant, if this were done, Deputy Murphy would be complaining about placing a further burden on the rate-payers. We would all like to see the <Col N="3090" /> grants increased but money is not so readily available.  I have no doubt that if this money were raised by imposing extra taxation, there would be a protest from the people opposite.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most unrealistic Bill.  The Minister and the Government have not increased any Government grants but they have created machinery under which the local authorities may increase theirs, with a consequent increase in the rates.  I do not think that that point has been stressed here.  As I have said already on this Bill, the cost of materials has increased and the cost of labour has increased but the Government grant has not increased.</P>
      <P>Various Deputies have mentioned different types of houses and how these grants operate in their counties.  I shall tell you how they operate in my county in the west of Ireland.  Take a five-apartment house, with water and sewerage laid on, not to the water main or to an existing sewerage scheme.  You get £225 per house, plus £75 per water and sewerage, plus £10 if you put your application through a building society.  Making in all £310 from the Government.</P>
      <P>Now, from the local authority, if you are under £12 10s. valuation, you get £ for £.  If you are between £12 10s. and £20 valuation, you will get two-thirds. If you are between £20 and £27 10s., you will get half and if you are between £27 10s. and £35, you will get one-third Government grant.  If you are over £35 valuation, you will get nothing.  That is how it works out in my county.</P>

      <P>The income group starts at £312 and ends up at £520.  I am coming to the income group.  I think, again, this is where the Bill is unrealistic.  So far as I am aware, the ceiling is £832.  Now, did the Minister consider for one minute a single man with an income of £832 and perhaps with a nice little nest egg in the bank?  The Minister has created machinery by which such a person can draw full grants.  Did he think of the married man with perhaps seven, eight or ten children and make any allowance for him?</P>
      <P>I would suggest that an effort be made to operate that section on the same lines as scholarship schemes are operated, namely that an allowance be made for each child.  It would be a very fair way of dealing with the matter.  I think it is rather arbitrary just to clap down on £832 and to say: &ldquo;There you are: that is it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like again to say that this Bill does not come up to what we expected in my constituency where there are 13,000 people under £20 valuation and where we expected quite a lot but have got nothing.</P>
      <P>There may be a reduction instead of an increase in the supplementary grant.  I shall explain to the House why.  In my county, we have paid supplementary grants up to £35 valuation for new houses.  When we meet again, due to the very high rates we are paying in my county, I can quite easily foresee the council saying: &ldquo;We shall pay nothing over £20 valuation.&rdquo;  I shall not subscribe to that myself but I can see it happening. Therefore, we shall be worse off after the Bill, if such an eventuality should occur, than we were before it was introduced.  I know that an attempt has been made to better the position, but I foresee a position arising in the west of Ireland which will be worse instead of better.</P>

      <P>Let me come back again to the grants for new houses.  Assuming this Bill is passed without any changes, let us consider the position of a man with an annual income of £850.  If he were to build a house costing about £2,000, or £1,800, or whatever it would take to <Col N="3092" /> build a five-roomed house fully equipped with water and sewerage facilities in a rural area, he would get £300 or roughly one-seventh of the cost of a £2,000 house.  Assuming that the Minister himself, who has a salary far in excess of £850, decided to have some repairs carried out to his house and got an estimate for such repairs at £420, what would the position be? I assume, of course, which I believe to be correct, that his house is located in a housing area where supplementary grants are payable.  It would mean that the man with £850 who is building a new house would have to be satisfied with £300 even though the cost of building it would be more than £2,000, while the Minister, with his greater income, would get £280, or only £20 less, for carrying out £420 worth of repairs to his dwelling.</P>
      <P>If the man with £850 had a water supply available in his house it would mean his grant would be still further reduced.  If water and sewerage facilities were available, his grant would be only £275.  The Minister with his salary, or if we take the man about whom we were talking so much not long ago, the person with the income of the Chief Justice, say, £6,000, could get his £280 for the £420 estimated repairs.  Surely that position should not be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned a while ago, a large number of housing authorities are not paying supplementary housing grants, particularly in urban areas.  I am sure that if we had a report of the number of urban local authorities paying supplementary grants we would find &mdash; as I found recently through some inquiries I made&mdash;that not more than 10 per cent. are paying them so that if a man is building a house in any of these areas he does not get a grant at all and it does not matter to him whether the income limit is £416 or £832 because, if I may refer to Section 12, it is optional on local authorities whether or not a housing grant is to be made available.  There is a good case for doing away with the income level so far as new house grants are concerned and I believe there is no justification for retaining an income level for new house grants when we abolished it some years ago for reconstruction grants.  If we take Deputy Gilhawley's case of a man with a family of six, seven or eight, the local authority is left with no power at all to deal with the special circumstances arising in such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making a plea that on the Report Stage we should abolish this income level.  I do not see any reason why we should retain it if people can get reconstruction grants without any qualification as to income limits or valuation.  I can see no reason why we should impose special limits in so far as new house grants are concerned. It gives rise to difficulty and hardship. If this Bill is passed, I can visualise people with large families who are just a little over the income level or, perhaps, a little over the valuation level whom the local authorities cannot help.  Between now and the next Stage <Col N="3094" /> the Minister and his advisers should consider the suggestions made on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage and bring in some amendments.</P>
    <P>I asked a while ago when was the increase in the grants provided by the State going to come into line with the percentage that was given four years ago.  As a result of increased building costs there is a good case for increasing the grants and I refer again to the disappointment among applicants that the grants were not increased.  I think the income and valuation limit should be abolished and let every person qualify.  Some might say that person with £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000 a year could then get a new house grant but there are certain limits on the size of the house.  I am sure that well-to-do people would not be availing of the grants because their houses would exceed the maximum specifications to qualify for grants.  These grants are confined to houses of a specified floor area and anyone building a family house within that specification should qualify not only for the State grant but for a supplementary grant without an income level.</P>

      <P>Listening to this debate, I was struck by the fact that the general tenor of the speeches from the opposite side was mainly that there had not been any increase in the grants, to meet, as they said, increased building costs.  We had Deputy Barry from rCork telling us that a house cost £2,220 and from him we switched to Deputy Norton who told us that a labourer's cottage in Kildare cost from £1,100 to £1,200, and then Deputy Murphy of Cork made a very serious complaint that local authorities were now being allowed a free hand and greater scope to increase the supplementary grants and he went on to deplore the fact that the Minister is passing on to local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The one point which, to my mind, Deputy Murphy <Col N="3095" /> missed is that every house that is built in any county is a national asset and it is being relieved of rates for a period of seven years in order to offset building costs.  After seven years, it is reversed and there is an annual charge.</P>
      <P>To my mind, we should not be interested in this Parliament in the type of house mentioned by Deputy Barry, the six-roomed house with a kitchenette.

      <P>There is the question of costings.  During the past two years, the utility society in West Limerick built over 40 houses for farmers and labourers who availed of the grants provided under the 1958 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers of what valuation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J. J. Collins Mr. J. J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Any valuation from £1 to £20 or £30.  In the utility society, we provided five-roomed houses for small farmers.  In my own parish of Abbeyfeale, we turned the key in the door for £1,485.  I do not know where Deputy Barry's figures fit in.  Deputy Murphy talked of a cost of £1,800 and Deputy Barry mentioned a figure of £2,200.  It is no wonder that the contractors can have a good time, <Col N="3096" /> and I do not begrudge it to them, if they can get away with it.  As I say, I know from my own experience that our utility society built over 40 houses within the past two years.  They are three-roomed, four-roomed and five-roomed houses.  Since the 1958 Act was passed, we have tried in a very energetic way to get the labouring man to build his own home, with the aid of grants from the central authority, the local authority and the £ for £ supplement. He can do that even on his weekly wage.  We have explained to him that if the local authority provided him with a cottage, his rent and rates would amount to over £25 a year, and that the cost of paying back the advances over the years would not be anything like that.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Minister has given sufficient money by way of grants.  Deputies who have spoken here and who are members of local authorities should be consistent.  If the Deputy from Sligo really felt that the Minister had not given sufficient money for housing, it would be his duty, as I would feel it to be mine, to ensure that we will give £ for £ to everyone who qualifies for a housing grant, whether there is a ceiling of £832 or a valuation ceiling of £49 19s.</P>
      <P>The Minister has done a good job in this Bill and I do not believe that the criticism which has been levelled from the Opposition benches is in any way deserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Every member of the House seems to take a different costings figure.  The Minister has the answer and he must have the answer for Deputy Collins as well, because in the Department, the cost of any local authority house is known because it has to be submitted for sanction.  If there is any dispute about costings, the Minister has the answer.  He has the answer in connection with Limerick, Sligo, Cork and everywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Back in 1948, a Labour Minister fixed a ceiling of £600.  It was a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Smith, who introduced the new system in 1952.  The Minister can check that, if he wishes.  I remember putting down an amendment and I think it was in <Col N="3097" /> 1952 that a Fianna Fáil Minister introduced the means test.  If we are getting away from the means test, Fianna Fáil probably realise that it was a bad system.</P>
    <P>When we speak of these grants, whether we like it or not, we are speaking of the middle income group, the white collar workers, who will not qualify for local authority houses. Deputy Barry and Deputy MacCarthy know that there are a large number of those people in the suburbs of Cork who must try to build, or purchase from a builder.  They got the grants and the loans but how many of them had to give up their houses?  In every issue of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> we see advertisements for the sale of these houses in surburban areas setting out the rates of interest payable.  That happened in the past, irrespective of whether Fianna Fáil or an inter-Party Government were in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The people I am speaking about were unable to meet the commitments.  I am not trying to score points for one Government as against the other.  The difference between the grants they were able to get and the amount they had to borrow was too great and they were unable to carry on paying.  The Minister knows that costs have gone up during the past three or four years by upwards of £300 or £400, and that this will nullify any increase in grants.  He knows also it will be very hard to convince local authorities that they should avail of the powers given to them here to give the full supplementary grant as allowed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us on local councils would like to do that but it is the majority vote that counts.  Deputy J. J. Collins told us about the difficulties in Limerick.  We have them in Cork, too.  It is not enough for us to say we hope the local authorities will put the Bill into operation in this respect to its fullest extent.  The increased <Col N="3098" /> cost will make it impossible for the white collar worker to build a house even with the aid of increased grants from the Exchequer.  We must be able to tell such a worker that he will get the increase also from the local authority.  How many authorities in urban areas will be able to finance supplementary grants?  The money must come from the rates.  I would ask the Minister that between this and Report Stage he would consider giving a little more help to the local authorities by increasing the State grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear what my colleague from Limerick, Deputy J. J. Collins, had to say on the housing question.  As I understand the position in Limerick, there is in addition to the supplementary grant a means test in operation in respect to the amount of such a grant.  Subject to correction, the £1 for £1 grant is only payable to people with an income of £6 a week or a £35 valuation and that when these figures are exceeded there is a scaled down grant as the applicant moves up in income or valuation.  There is a £1 for £1 grant in respect to those below the £6 and after that it is scaled down.  As a matter of fact, I think that once an applicant passed the £10 a week figure, no matter who the applicant was or what his circumstances were, no grant was payable.</P>
      <P>There is another factor in respect to the housing of the working classes. The Limerick County Council have been having a difficult time in providing houses, in getting contractors to build serviced houses at the £1,000 limit.  We have had to seek from the Minister approval for sums of over £1,000 and £1,500 for serviced houses. At the present time, a scheme of houses proposed for Askeaton will cost in the region of £2,000 per house. Another factor, which Deputy J. J. Collins mentioned, is the question of the utility societies.  I have been told that some people working through such societies have been contributing something in kind by way of labour in the matter of house construction. The problem there is to estimate the cash value to be put on that labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take a person of moderate <Col N="3099" /> income who obtains a State grant of, say, £300 and a scaled-down local authority grant of half that amount towards the building of a house, you will find he must borrow something in the region of £1,000 and the rate of interest which is being charged by the local authority on that loan is approximately £7 1s. 9d. per £100 over a period of 35 years.  That would mean a person would have to carry a burden of approximately £70, or over 25/- a week.</P>
    <P>In the new legislation aimed at the provision of sanitary services, the Minister envisages house building in the future without the addition of the ordinary sanitary facilities.  Another thing to be aimed at, of course, is the provision in every house of sufficient bedroom accommodation for growing families.  That is something we should not skimp on.  If you take the normal rural family in this country and you confine yourself to a three-bedroomed house, irrespective of the size of the family to be housed, you will be up against social difficulties.  You will have the father and the mother seeing children of different sexes, perhaps, having to occupy either the same room or be bedded in overcrowded conditions. We should not confine ourselves to building that type of house exclusively for that type of family.</P>
    <P>Another consideration that I think is necessary in that case is to have a minimum of three bedrooms, a kitchen or living room and surely one other room with normal toilet and wash-up facilities.  It is essential that whatever water supply is available should be installed and there should be a bathroom in the houses we build in future.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction but I wonder &mdash; possibly time will show this &mdash; if the limits we are introducing at present will be effective.  In the schemes we have had, everybody knows that people seeking loans and grants have been trying in every way possible to get around the regulations. We should not put them in that position. We should leave the legislation flexible enough to ensure that there will first be an inducement to people to build houses for themselves as this <Col N="3100" /> is very necessary.  I agree with other Deputies in that respect, that every house properly built and every family properly housed is an addition to the nation from the social and financial points of view.  In relation to the Housing of the Working Classes Acts. and local authority housing, we should not be hamstrung by legislation which at the moment circumvents building the type of houses we would like to provide.</P>
    <P>The amount the State is making available is normally an inducement to people to build houses but the local authorities&mdash;and there is no use in closing our eyes to it&mdash;have a problem of rates.  That is the factor that decides what amount of money will be made available locally.  If they feel they will run into difficulties through not having sufficient money available to implement these £ for £ grants, you will find the regulations will be changed to scale down these grants.  In passing this legislation, I think we should see to it that we do not circumvent our good intentions in any way in regard to housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what I said on the Second Reading.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands is here to give us the benefit of his wisdom concerning the constituency which he and I have the honour to represent. A survey of housing conditions in rural Ireland has been carried out in the past 18 months by the local authorities on behalf of the Department of Local Government and the report is now available to the Minister.  As Deputies from various parts of rural Ireland are aware, housing needs vary considerably in different counties.  Without knowing the contents of the report going to the Minister, I can imagine that as regards some of the western counties, the analysis available in that report shows that the group who need rehousing are within the category already covered by the full State grant, plus the full supplementary grant, but in spite of the fact that they have available to them £275-£300 and a similar supplementary grant from the local authority, these people are not able to build their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3101" /> The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister must admit that this big element in the western counties is not catered for in this Bill.  I am not taking away from the value of what is given in the Bill in saying that.  Undoubtedly the increased supplementary grants will help a certain percentage of those who want to build their own houses, but, speaking from what I know of my own constituency, there is not the slightest doubt that people who are in the category of the £6 to £20 valuation are not going to build houses as a result of any incentive in this measure.</P>
    <P>I know that Roscommon County Council on numerous occasions in the past 12 months requested its officials to emphasise to the Department that in any legislation introduced it was imperative that serious consideration be given to a plan to solve the problem of the small farmer in the valuation group ranging from £10 to £20.  There must be at least 200 small farmers in County Roscommon at present who have not made application to the county council for housing grants because they feel that the housing grant and the supplementary grant leave a gap too wide for them to bridge.  If they apply for the loan, they need two sureties.  Very often, they have great difficulty in getting a guarantor in order to get a council loan but they are afraid to take on the burden of the loan at all on account of the repayment charges and the low income which they receive through carrying out the wrong type of farming.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies here realise that small farmers in the west want to go in for store cattle.  That is not their fault and I do not want to discuss that now; the point is that they have not the income to enable them to repay the interest on the loan.  What has happened is that Roscommon County Council is assuming responsibility at the moment for the housing of people who should be in a position to take on the job themselves and employ a contractor to do the work.  That is wrong.  As I explained before, it leads to a very roundabout procedure before the council can do that.  They must acquire the plot from the small farmer, buy it from him with all the legal <Col N="3102" /> formalities involved.  Then they build and rent the house back to him.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to solve that problem and, as the Minister knows, quite a large number of applications are awaiting sanction in Roscommon at present.  They are no better off as a result of this Bill.  There is nothing better than the idea of the farmers having their own houses under their own control, making them independent, but we all know the position today is that there is gradual moving away from the land off small holdings.  I do not like to make it a charge against the Government, but if the Minister reads the inter-Departmental report on conditions in the West of Ireland, he will find housing mentioned as one of the things needing attention.  This Bill does not meet those recommendations in any way.</P>
    <P>In today's <i>Irish Times,</i> the leading article stated that further ruthless depopulation of rural Ireland is necessary if we are to compete in agriculture on the Common Market.  Is it not a fact that this Bill is making no provision to improve building facilities for the small farmer &mdash; a sign that the Government is preparing the ground for wiping out the small farmers of rural Ireland?  If the Government were really serious about consolidating the position of the small farmer, this is not the type of Bill they would have introduced. I am afraid the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> was much nearer the truth than its author realised.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Mayo and Galway County Councils have done exactly the same as Roscommon County Council. For the past two years they have been urging the Department to bring in some new provision to enable the small farmer to build his house with the aid of grants and loans or, as other Deputies have mentioned, to allow him build on the same lines as the Land Commission have been building houses and allow the repayment charge to be part of the annuity.  There is no sign of that so far.  Is it the intention to wait until they are gone?</P>
    <P>The Minister may give us all sorts of facts and figures that the cost of building houses has increased.  We all know that the cost of materials has <Col N="3103" /> increased.  But irrespective of any increase in costs that has taken place, there is no provision in this section for the large number of small farmers in my constituency waiting for years to build a house.  This Bill is a danger signal.  It would lend proof to the belief prevalent that there is no hope for the small man to hang on any longer and that the sooner he gets out, the bigger the relief will be to the Government to have him gone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must welcome the debate on the question of increasing the grants that has taken place for the past hour and a half because no one knows better than the Minister the necessity for increasing the grants because of the increased cost of building.  The Minister has already pressed the Minister for Finance and the Government to give larger grants but has not been successful. Therefore, I imagine the Minister will welcome this debate because it will strengthen his hand in going back to the Government to look for increased grants.  I firmly believe that the Minister, with his specialised knowledge of housing conditions and costs, will go back to the Government and get increased grants, as he has been urged to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now received the estimates from the various local authorities.  I am sure he will agree that, in general, a fair ratio for labour and materials is 60-40.  As a result of the last round of wage increases, there is 10 per cent. on labour. That is an incontrovertible fact and is mathematically correct.  It eliminates immediately any suggestion that there has been no increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the estimates received by the Minister's Department for the building in the metropolitan area of what are termed cottages, I think I am correct in saying the figure is around £2,000 or £1,900.  I am sure the Minister is anxious to alleviate the housing position. I know nothing about the rural areas, but I am afraid the Minister is not aware of the awful situation existing in Dublin.  I would suggest that apart entirely from this proposed <Col N="3104" /> increase in grants, which may help in its own way, local authorities should be able to take advantage themselves of the facilities available to private persons for building an additional room to existing three-roomed or two-roomed houses.  Many of these tenants are anxious to do the work themselves with their own labour.  I understand from a very high churchman in this city that on one occasion during the period of the Coalition Government a guarantee was given by the Department that nothing but three-roomed houses would be built in the Dublin area.  This was to avoid undesirable overcrowding and avoid the necessity of children of different sexes having to occupy the same bedroom accommodation. The present situation is pathetic, and, indeed, that adjective is hardly adequate.  The problem could be eased considerably if the local authority could get grants similar to those available to house owners for the erection of an extra room.  Many people living for years in the one area now find that, with a growing family not yet working, the accommodation is entirely inadequate.  That problem could be eased by the type of extension I have referred to if the grants were available to the local authority. Indeed, we might even go a step further.  If the Minister wishes to help local authorities meet this problem, he might even introduce legislation providing for continuing subsidy but allowing the local authority to sell the houses to tenants who wish to purchase their own homes.  In that way the maintenance cost to the local authority would be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>Any increase such as that suggested is to be welcomed, but it should not be stated that there have been no increased costs.  A flat in Dublin costs over £2,000.  Deputy Collins referred to utility societies, but that comparison cannot be made.  A utility society works on a non-profit basis.  Utility societies help meet a great need, but no quantity surveyor in the Department or anywhere else would suggest that a five-roomed house could be built at present for £1,400.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Following Deputy <Col N="3105" /> Carroll's contribution, I should like to point out to the Minister how his efforts to improve the housing position can often be frustrated.  The position in Dublin now is that Dublin Corporation will not do business with utility societies.  Two years ago, a certain utility society applied for eight sites out of ten available in Captain's Lane. Two years later, two houses only are being built because the Corporation will not do business with the particular utility society because they are of the opinion that the utility society are making a profit.  This has never been proved to my satisfaction but perhaps it is true.  Since the principle of doing business with the utility society has been done away with, the building of private houses on Corporation sites has been slowed down.  The period from the time a person applies to build his own house to the time he gets sanction is so long that they have either been housed under the Housing Acts or have got other accommodation.</P>
      <P>That is bad policy on the part of the Corporation.  I understand that in respect of the ten sites mentioned, the Corporation are now receiving applications up to next Friday at 12 o'clock. They were all to have been allocated when I was a member of the Housing Committee and that was a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>The last of them was allocated last Friday.  The Deputy should have remained a member of the Housing Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk here about the housing position generally and suggestions that the Minister should go on giving ever-increasing grants without any regard to the real needs of the country.  When you consider the type of house Deputy Gilhawley has mentioned, I think the Minister has done a magnificent day's work.  He said that heretofore you got a grant of £310 and an additional pound for pound for the valuation up to £12 10s.  The Minister has now extended that to cover a number of <Col N="3106" /> people who felt they were not getting a fair deal.  A wide category of people are brought up to an income level of £830 and a poor law valuation of £50. That will go a long way towards solving the problem that exists in my own constituency of Sligo and throughout the whole country.</P>
      <P>Everybody will agree that, inasmuch as no two houses are alike, you can argue for a year and get no agreement as to the building costs in any particular area.  It would be foolish to say that because of the recent increase in wages, there has been no increase in housing.  Of course there has been an increase in housing, and to say that the percentage increase in wages warrants a like increase in grants is unreasonable. Deputy Gilhawley says the Bill is unreasonable because it will mean an impact on the rates if the local authorities use the powers being given to them but I would like to see the man anywhere in Ireland with eight or nine children who would take on the responsibility of providing a house for his family when they are at the stage when they are most costly, particularly from the point of view of their education.</P>
      <P>When the Minister replies, I am sure that the figures will show that there has been a tremendous upsurge in the applications for grants.  If the Deputies here who are county councillors go back to their councils and implement the provisions of this Bill, they can bring about a great increase in the number of houses being built in their areas.  Deputy McQuillan makes an appeal for the people who are unable to bridge the gap between the two grants, but if you increased the grants by 50 per cent. there would still be people who would be unable to bridge the gap.  We all know the countryman's disinclination to borrow money from any source because of his fear that somebody might, in some way or other, get a hold on his farm.  I think that is a case where the local authority could go in and build a house and give it to him on a rental basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputies suggest that there should be a provision for the smaller house and another provision for the larger house.  There is nothing <Col N="3107" /> to prevent a man starting off with three rooms and adding on two rooms to make it a five-roomed house, if he so wishes.  There is provision in the Bill for reconstruction grants, provided a man increases the floor space of his house.  There is something for everybody in this Bill, something for the newly-married man, something for the salaried man and something for the man with his family reared. I welcome the measure and there is nothing more I wish to say except to wish it all good luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it has ever been my experience to listen to a more pleasant lot of complainants. They have complained for the past two and a half hours but in a most pleasant way, as if they enjoyed the whole position.  That is not really an uncharitable view of the expressions from the far side of the House as to the inadequacy of many of the provisions of this Bill.  I say that not only from the expressions visible on the faces of the people complaining but also from the facts that speak louder than any of the words that have been used here tonight.  The fact is that, despite the alleged disappointment on the part of those people who are said to be standing around for the past three months awaiting improved grant facilities in this Bill, we have had in that period a new record level of applications for and allocations of grants.  Can anybody reconcile that fact with the statement that there were disappointed queues waiting around for improved grant facilities?  The increase over the past three months was a 25 per cent. increase over the same period last year, and the three-month period last year was also a record.  If we add to that percentage increase the alleged queue, we should now be showing a 50 per cent. increase.  I doubt if we could expect such a large percentage increase as that at any time in either local authority or private enterprise housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite that fact, we had Deputies in this debate wailing and moaning, making all sorts of comparisons and dragging in all sorts of figures to prove <Col N="3108" /> that this Bill is fundamentally defective because grants have not kept pace with building costs and the increase in the cost of living.  The same arguments have been advanced ten times over. The fairest way to approach this matter is to ask oneself the question as to what the response is from the public where these grants are concerned.  The answer is that there has been a record response.</P>
    <P>The argument was also advanced that the level of the grants would have a disastrous effect on house building.  I come now to the real test as to whether or not the grant provisions provide sufficient encouragement to people to build their own houses.  I should like this to sink in between now and the Report Stage because it is of the essence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will.  There were all sorts of arguments about building costs.  Costs, as everybody <Col N="3109" /> should know, have increased under three heads and not under two heads as was asserted here.  There has been an increase in the cost of materials, an increase in the cost of labour, and an inflationary increase due to lack of competition.  The contractors have so much building work to do, and not enough operatives to do it, that they are naturally not anxious to seek more contracts.  There is more work than the building industry can handle.  That means that there is a lack of competition.  That is noticeable in the few tenders that are now beginning to come in for the more recent contracts advertised.  Are we to add to this inflationary tendency by increasing the grants?</P>
      <P>Another matter mentioned here was that the person in the middle income group, or the person with £850 a year, is entitled only to the Local Government Grant.  Nobody denies that that is true.  There is another direction from which to approach the matter.  An urban dweller with £625 is not entitled to a supplementary housing grant. Neither is the rural dweller with an income of £521.  Now the complaint is that if a person has £850, he cannot get a supplementary grant.  The fact is that everybody up to £832 not only can get a supplementary grant but, for the first time, can get a 100 per cent. supplementary grant if his local authority thinks fit.  In the past it was a graded scale and if an applicant in a rural area had £10 a week he was entitled to only one-third of the amount paid by the Department of Local Government by way of supplementary grant.  If he had £9 a week he was entitled to one-half; if he had £8 a week he was entitled to two-thirds but if he had not more than £7 per week then, and only then, could he get the full 100 per cent. supplementary grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the situation as we have known it up to the moment. That was the situation wherein during these recent months there has been a record allocation of grants for people building, repairing and reconstructing <Col N="3110" /> their houses throughout the country. That was achieved in that rather limited situation.  Yet, although we have taken away many of the bars that existed in respect of local authorities using their discretion in paying supplementary grants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in spite of that the complaint is made that we are not increasing the grants in this Bill, which is giving a higher amount from the local authority than we have been giving in the past.  I do not agree with this sort of talk.  If the only fault the Opposition can find with our housing legislation as now put forward is based solely on that aspect of the matter, I am quite happy.  The argument is all in favour of this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like for the benefit of Deputy McQuillan to repeat what I said at an early stage, that this grants and loans Bill is not even suggested as a remedy for the problem as he has outlined it as existing in the West and in rural Ireland generally.  It is not even suggested as a remedy.  I cannot yet indicate to the House what the remedy may be to eradicate what has become known as the rural slums.  I do not know what the remedy will be, for two very good reasons.  First of all, this Bill was prepared and was in draft before the report on the small farmers was received from the committee who studied that aspect of the situation of small farmers.  Any suggestion that what is contained in the Bill is put forward as a remedy for the problems thrown up in that report is completely off the mark.  I want again to emphasise that this is in no way being suggested as a remedy for any problem thrown up by the committee's report nor am I at this stage able to give any indication as to what may be the ultimate remedy for those problems nor will I be in a position to give full consideration to the problems as indicated in that report until I have got that which I have been begging and beseeching local authorities for the last two years to give me, that is, the full return of their unfit housing problem in each of their functional areas.  That would appear to <Col N="3111" /> have been a not over heavy burden to ask local authorities and housing authorities whose members have at heart the welfare of people in bad houses to undertake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy something now.  There are certain figures that I as an individual, not as Minister for Local Government, not as having access to any documents, have mentioned to certain people, not only in this House but outside it, a figure that I arrived at long ago, as to the extent of the problem of unfit houses that are unlikely to be repaired or are incapable of repair.  Although I had that figure on the tip of my tongue purely as an assessment in my own personal way years ago, I think that figure will turn out to be very near the mark when we have the final returns from housing authorities. Nobody would suggest that such a figure arrived at by any individual should be the basis on which one would get down to cure the problem that figure might show.  In regard to the figures the committee dealt with, quite a number of them could have been assessments rather than factual but those assessments have been near enough to the mark to give a fair picture so as to enable those people to come to the general conclusions they put before us in their report. That they are anything more than that I would not care to say but I do feel that the assessment is near enough to the mark so as not to confuse the issue.  Most of the returns we now have from local authorities on unfit <Col N="3112" /> housing would seem to confirm that the figures that may have been used by the committee are not too far off the mark to be unreliable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is merely having a little say amongst all the says here to-night by various people who were not satisfied with having one say but had to talk two or three times and repeated the same thing for fear we might lose the point.  The point generally made is one with which I entirely disagree, that the amount of grants being outlined for the future is too small.  I am going on the very real figures of the record number of allocations taking place in the last three months compared with the record number that took place twelve months ago.  That is the true test and a test to which we must give some credence and regard when we come to examine the matter as to whether or not the grants should be or require to be increased at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other thing that must be realised is that a large proportion of the people who would normally attempt to build their own houses are people who during the past few years, in their normal occupations, have enjoyed and are now enjoying an improved standard of living as a result of the rounds of wage increases which have taken place, the <Col N="3113" /> last one of which was not related in any way to an increase in the cost of living.  That must be taken into account when we come to consider the ability of our people to build houses for themselves.  Further, I can tell Deputies of the people whom I know who by their own self help and through co-operative organisation have in the very recent past succeeded in <Col N="3114" /> building houses with only the grant money at a cost to them of nothing but a bit of labour on their part.</P>
