      <P>Proposals for the revision of the salary scales of certain members of the administrative staff of Our Lady's Hospital, Cork, have been received in my Department and have now been examined.  My decision on the proposals referred to will be conveyed to the health authority in the course of the next few days.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, add that such delay as has occurred was due to the need to consider the proposals in relation to proposals regarding comparable hospitals.  The revised scales will operate retrospectively.</P>

A grant was paid to the Committee of Management last February for the purchase of the cots and bedding necessary for the additional patients who are to be accommodated in the unit which caters for severely mentally handicapped patients.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received an application from Mr. John Sheeran, Bunsallagh, Croghan, Tullamore, County Offaly, on behalf of a number of turf-cutters for the cleaning of a bog drain from the Yellow River at Mr. Christopher Maguire's land to Mr. Matthew Killian's boundary at Derrycoffey, Croghan, County Offaly; if he is aware that this bog drain is one requiring urgent attention, and that it should have been included in the current scheme of grants for such work; and if he will now undertake an immediate examination of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to answer Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.  The road and drain serve the same bog owned by two families.  Full-cost grants amounting in all to £490 have been expended on the development of this turbary area in which some lettings are made to local farmers and in which the annual production in former years ranged from 700 to 900 tons of turf.  When inspected in 1956 production was down to 120 tons by four families and when last inspected in December, 1960, only three tenants and the two owners produced 100 tons &mdash;their domestic supplies of turf&mdash;not-withstanding the fact that a drainage grant was expended in 1957.  The applicant and owner was advised on 30th November, 1957, and again on 13th July, 1960, to submit the road application for consideration under the Rural Improvements Scheme as no further full-cost grants could be justified. The road and drain would serve the lands and bogs of two farmers and the lands of three other farmers.  Owing to the small turf production no further full-cost grants can be made for either the road or drain under Bog Development Schemes, but if the farmers concerned submit the proposals under the Rural Improvements Scheme which requires a contribution from the <Col N="1774" /> beneficiaries, I shall have the matter sympathetically considered.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities may carry out works of reconstruction and sanitation in houses owned by them.  They are not empowered under the Housing Acts to incure expenditure for works to houses which are vested in the tenants, but such tenants are themselves eligible for grants and loans towards works of repair and improvement.  Issues from the Local Loans Fund are normally reserved for the financing of major capital works, but in so far as houses owned by the local authority are concerned, applications for sanction to borrowing from <Col N="1783" /> sources other than the Fund are considered in the normal course.  It is a matter for the housing authority who have incurred expenditure on the works in question to review the rents charged for the houses concerned if they consider this course desirable.</P>

As the grant in this case is being dealt with under the provisions of Section 12 of the 1954 Act, payment cannot be made until all the works proposed by the applicant have been satisfactorily completed.</P>

      <P>216 valid appeals under Section 18 of the Labourers Act, 1936, have been received from vested tenants in County Meath since 1st January, 1961.  Of these, 144 have been inspected.  Further repairs have been determined to be necessary in 117 cases.  Responsibility for ensuring the execution of the repairs specified in the determinations is a matter between the housing authority and the vested tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that since the appeal is against the condition of houses which, in the first instance, the housing authority stated did not need any repair, is it not an inequitable way of doing it to have the same people declaring that the houses are now fit for human habitation and will he not take some other steps to see that the repairs are carried out as laid down by his Department?</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure that some other steps are really necessary in cases such as these.  The volume of information laid before me does not indicate that this is a general <Col N="1785" /> complaint or, indeed, a very frequent complaint.  While it is so that the Minister for Local Government finally determines when a dispute arises as to the condition of the house at the time of vesting, as between the local authority and the vesting tenant, it is also so that, the repairs having been certified and those repairs furnished to the tenant, the tenant, in the last analysis, if he has got no satisfaction from the local authority, may take the ordinary common law course to have his right established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest it would be preferable that a tenant should take the local authority into the court to have the repairs carried out rather than have the inspection carried out by an inspector of the Department who would know what was laid down by his Department and should be able to know whether those repairs have been carried out?</P>

      <P>My Department does not engage directly in mussel transplantation but An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have made grants exceeding £700 both this year and last year towards the cost of transplantation schemes in particular parts of Castlemaine Harbour. These schemes have been undertaken on a rotational basis and, to derive benefit from them, it is necessary to suspend mussel fishing until October, 1963, in the area transplanted last year and until October, 1964, in the area transplanted this year, while leaving other beds open for fishing.  I hope that local contributions will again be forthcoming next spring for transplantation of another area where fishing would then be suspended.  During the next few months An Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not propose to make an additional grant but if local interests&mdash;who are primarily concerned in this matter&mdash;are in a position to undertake further transplantation, it is, of course, open to them to do so.</P>

I cannot at the moment give a clear indication of when the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will be in a position to deal effectively with the waiting list of applicants because I am not in a position to know when the trunk cabling schemes which are in hand at the moment will be completed but it is expected that by next spring we will be in a position to deal more effectively with the waiting list and keep it within manageable proportions.</P>

There is a priority list but recently I have taken a decision to have the Department of Posts and Telegraphs Engineering Branch connect phones that are easy of connection, that is, phones that do not involve long lines, and that may mean that later applications will be taken in advance of applications that are longer in and it may be regarded as an order of priority also.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;&mdash; (Deputies Donnellan and T. Lynch.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Office of Public Works and the man in charge of it are people most held up to ridicule in this House.  No matter what he does, it is not right in the eyes of some people and, as one who has much more experience of that office than the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I had the honour to be in control of it for six and a half years&mdash;I can say that there is not a man in any Department, either Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, who is subjected to as much abuse as the man who controls the Office of Public Works.  It happens here and it happens outside.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his office, trying to do the necessary work, or in his home, and particularly when he comes into the Dáil, is harassed by every individual who thinks he has a grievance about this, that, and the other appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> Unfortunately for the man who holds that office, particularly for the present Parliamentary Secretary, he has to make these appointments and from my experience in the Office he will get damn little thanks from anybody in respect of any appointment he makes.  Reading the debate, I found in it a charge that the Office of Public Works is being used now as a political headquarters for the Party to which the Parliamentary Secretary belongs. From my experience of the officials of that Office, from the Chairman down, I can say that even though the Parliamentary Secretary might wish such a situation to exist&mdash;I do not believe he does&mdash;the officials would not lend themselves to any such abuse.</P>
    <P>May I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment? My experience is&mdash;indeed I trouble him as little as I can, but quite often I have to do so because the people I represent more or less compel me&mdash; anything the officials or the Parliamentary Secretary can do within reason I find is done for me and for the people I represent.  I therefore wish the Parliamentary Secretary many long years there.</P>

      <P>I believe that while he is there, he will be fair and carry out the work that is required of him.</P>
      <P>I also read in the Official Reports a suggestion that apparently there are damnable objections to the name &ldquo;Donogh O'Malley&rdquo; at the bottom of a letter.  To my mind, he is a great man who can accept that responsibility, who can find the time to send out all those letters to Deputies and Senators.  While I was there, I had not the time to do it&mdash;I could not do it. I think it is a great honour for any Deputy or any Senator to get a personal letter from a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main points concerned with this Estimate as far as I am concerned is arterial drainage and while I have said those nice things, and meant them, about the Parliamentary Secretary, I must refer to a <Col N="1816" /> remark he made that 12 times as much is being spent now on arterial drainage as was spent in 1948.  My friend, Deputy Carty, seems to agree, but I am afraid that neither the Parliamentary Secretary nor the Deputy was here at the time and consequently could not be aware of what the peculiar position was in 1948.</P>
    <P>We brought in the Act in 1948 and Fianna Fáil need not say they were responsible for it.  Is it not strange that there was no move towards arterial drainage until 1948?  When I went into the Department in February, 1948, there was no machinery in the Board of Works, except one or two excavators.  The inter-Party Government had to start from the very foundation.  Fianna Fáil did not intend to go ahead with drainage in 1948, but we went ahead with it.  Along with the then Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, I had the honour of opening the first arterial drainage scheme, the Brosna.  In the following year, we opened the Glyde and Dee in Louth and amongst those present was the Minister for External Affairs.  Before we left office after three years, we opened the Feale catchment in Kerry. That was one scheme every year.  The next scheme was one very dear to myself in my native spot, the Corrib.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil went back into office for nearly three years, but the Corrib scheme had to remain there until we got back on the job again.  During those years of Fianna Fáil Government, there was no progress in arterial drainage, but in our period of six and a half years, we can claim to have opened four of the largest drainage schemes in the country.  It was a nice crack from my good friend, Deputy Carty, to say there are twelve times as much being spent now.  If there had been proper progress, there should be 24 times as much being spent now because, at the present rate, it will be Tib's Eve before arterial drainage here is finished.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to try to get things moving more quickly.  In 1948, we had to build up the staff and surely it is built up now?  From my own experience, they are well equipped throughout the country and <Col N="1817" /> the work should be going ahead a little faster.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary opening a minor drainage scheme in my constituency.  Deputy Carty says it is in his constituency.  I do not know whether it is or not.  It is in a place called Dunkellin.  It is a very important area around Athenry and Craughwell which is subject to flooding.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to start surveying in the Dunkellin area so that when the present scheme in Killimor is finished, the machinery can be transferred to Dunkellin.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, Deputy Brennan, made a promise that the Corrib-Mask scheme would be carried out.  I know the survey party are on it&mdash;I see them working hard every day&mdash;but, somehow, the people on the land are not satisfied with survey parties.  They want to see machinery working.  That was the scheme I was supposed not to have finished, but later on, as a result of a deputation of which Father Keane and I were members, it was revealed very plainly what was the cause of the delay.  It is a very important area and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to expedite the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  On the Galway-Mayo border in the Shrule area, there is a channel about three miles long which would drain over 150 acres of land.  I understand the Board of Works engineers are at present surveying that and are inclined to carry it out and put it in with the Corrib-Mask scheme.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that.</P>
    <P>I was very sorry to get a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary some time ago stating that the portion of the Corrib scheme which included the lakes at Glenamaddy and Cashel could not be carried out.  Do the Office of Public Works realise how much money has been spent on the Glenamaddy Lakes? To my own knowledge, there was an excavator at a swallow hole there for at least two years.  What was the result?  The Glenamaddy Lake used to dry up every summer.  As a matter of <Col N="1818" /> fact, I attended race meetings there but since the swallow hole was dealt with by the Office of Public Works, the lake has not dried up.  I know there was a suggestion that a channel could be made there in another direction.</P>
    <P>I was very sorry to get that letter from the Parliamentary Secretary. There is no good in saying that it is impossible to do certain things.  Nothing in this world is impossible.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials to have another look at it and see if anything could be done because a huge area is involved.  Actually, it is the foundation of the Corrib River, so to speak.  That is where it starts.  The people there are very disappointed that the job is not being done.</P>
    <P>I shall finish as I started, by saying that tirades against the Parliamentary Secretary achieve nothing.  The Lord have mercy on the late chairman of the Office of Public Works.  During my time there, he said to me: &ldquo;Ah, we cannot please anyone at all.  We are skivvies for every Department of State.&rdquo;  Truer words were never spoken.  The Office of Public Works and the Parliamentary Secretary have to take all the kicks.  It is very easy to be free with those kicks.  I got quite a number of them myself during my six and a half years there and I must be a good judge.  The present occupant of that office is as decent and as honourable a man as there is in Dáil Éireann.  I thank him for what he has done for me and I am sure he did nothing that was not within the rules and regulations.  I am very grateful to him for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arterial drainage is a big feature of this Estimate but it is not a matter which affects Dublin so much.  I shall just touch on it as it affects the city and perhaps touch on other minor matters which are the responsibility of the Parliamentary Secretary.  As I understand it, the Office of Public Works do what they are requested to do by other people and do not initiate anything themselves. They just do what they are told.  I do not know whether or not that is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to refer to this <Col N="1819" /> House.  Now that construction work is going on, I hope indicators will be put in all the Party rooms and at vantage points around the House indicating what subject is being debated and who is speaking.  I should like to emphasise the point about who is speaking.  I do not see why there cannot be panels in all the Party rooms with the names of the members of the House and numbers beside them. It may not be necessary to light up the speaker's name but his number could indicate to members of the House who is speaking.  It is very important to know who is speaking in the House.</P>

      <P>There are certain people who are worth listening to and others, perhaps, who are not.  If we knew who was speaking, we could come to the House to hear them.  I get a great kick out of listening to certain people, especially my friend, Deputy Dillon, the Taoiseach, and others.  Others feel the same way about it and would not like to be having a chat somewhere in the House when someone was speaking whom they would like to hear.  I am glad that is being done.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter of the pond in St. Stephen's Green on another occasion. If the Parliamentary Secretary goes to St. Stephen's Green, he will see that there is a steep incline at the edge of the water and there is grave danger of children falling into the pond.  I asked for the provision of a rail because while there has been no such accident recently, I believe such an accident did happen at one time and it could happen again.  Early in the mornings, when there are no adults around, a child might want to throw bread to the ducks and if he fell in, he would drown. There should be a rail there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see a gymnasium provided as part of any future school construction.  The emphasis has been somewhat on academic knowledge, to the exclusion of physical culture. In my opinion, physical culture is <Col N="1820" /> very important.  If a gymnasium were attached to each school, it would be an encouragement to the formation of physical culture classes.  A beginning has to be made.  Physical culture is essential to the development of the body and the mind.  It gives children a chance to develop along the right lines at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The most important item to which I wish to refer is the Garden of Remembrance. I have already expressed the hope that it will be finished by next April.  Next year is the 50th anniversary of the formation of the Volunteers and I believe there will be quite large celebrations on that account.  Not the same interest is taken in the annual celebrations but every man who was in the movement will take part in the 50th anniversary celebrations next year.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary, or whoever is responsible, has not yet decided on the nature of the Garden of Remembrance.  There were to be busts of the various leaders but now I understand there is to be some sculpture of the Children of Lir instead.  The story of the Children of Lir is fictional.  It does not interest me very much because I do not read fiction.  This sculpture is supposed to be more symbolic of what the Garden commemorates than busts of the leaders.  That is the sculptor's opinion. My opinion of a Garden of Remembrance is something like Westminster Abbey.  I visualise something in stone, and I believe that if the busts of the leaders are eliminated, the Garden will be meaningless in 50 or 100 years, whereas it should be something which 1,000 years hence the man in the street will appreciate for what it symbolises.</P>
    <P>The story of the Children of Lir is a story of children being turned into swans and back again into old folk. That is what I am told.  I have a rather historical mind and every time I visit London I make for Westminster Abbey.  It appeals to me.  There are those great figures and one can read their names.  One gets the feeling that they are some of the Immortals.  I should like to see something like that in Parnell Square.  We have a habit of burying our great men instead of embalming them as they do in Russia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> To illustrate my point, the head of Blessed Oliver Plunket is in a church in Drogheda.  Every visitor to Drogheda goes to see that head.  If it were only a statue, no one would bother.  Everyone who goes to Moscow visits Lenin's tomb.  Everyone who goes to Paris visits the tomb of Napoleon.  The Arch of Titus has stood since the time of Christ.  All our great figures should be represented in the Garden of Remembrance. It should not be just a collection of meaningless stones.  If their bodies cannot be placed there, at least their statues should be there.  There should be something to revive the memory of the men.  Now sculptors have their own peculiar ideas. Epstein's ideas meant a great deal to him, but his sculptures do not mean a great deal to the man in the street. Before any final decision is taken, I want the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the whole matter and give us something that will have meaning for the man in the street in a thousand years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My first duty is to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the excellent work being done by the Office of Public Works.  In particular, I welcome the acceleration in the arterial drainage scheme.  I am particularly gratified that, as prophesied by the Parliamentary Secretary some short <Col N="1822" /> time ago, at column 1072 of volume 195 of the Official Report, work has started on the Killimor drainage scheme.  Within a fortnight of that prophecy work commenced.  The estimated cost of this scheme, which will benefit a large number of my constituents, is in the region of £900,000.  A few pertinent figures will reveal the extent of the scheme.  Over 200 miles of waterway will be widened and deepened; 750 bridges will be either replaced or reconditioned.  At peak periods it is hoped that 250 men will be employed.  It is expected that no fewer than 25 of the larger machines used in work of this kind will be utilised.</P>
    <P>The important aspect of the scheme, however, is the benefit it will confer on farmers in my constituency.  The area involved in the catchment is something like 100,000 acres&mdash;55,000 acres in the Killimor catchment and about 45,000 acres in the Cappa catchment. When the scheme is completed, some 13,000 acres of marginal land will have been improved.  Over the years there has been a constant demand to have this area dealt with. One of the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessors, the late Deputy Beegan, who also represented that constituency, worked very hard indeed to have the scheme brought to fruition. It was particularly fitting that, when the Parliamentary Secretary came to Killimor to initiate the scheme, he should pay tribute to the memory of the late Deputy Beegan.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was criticised a few days ago for the lack of progress in arterial drainage.  That was a most unfair criticism because more money is being spent today on arterial drainage than was ever spent before, and more money was spent under Fianna Fáil on drainage than was spent by any other Government.  Some of the people who criticised conveniently ignored the facts and the figures, speaking as if nothing had been spent or was being spent on arterial drainage.  They conveniently forgot also that it was Fianna Fáil who pioneered arterial drainage and who introduced the measure that has made arterial drainage possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> One other matter to which I should like to refer is the changes contemplated in school building.  Since the foundation of the State over £18,500,000 has been spent on replacing old schools.  We are all agreed that the progress has been very good but, nevertheless, has not been up to expectations because in many parts of the country the children will be without new schools for many years to come if the present rate is not accelerated.  The Parliamentary Secretary has hinted at a dramatic change in the school-building programme.  Because of his professional qualifications he is experienced in improved building techniques and new ways of coping with problems of this nature.  I congratulate him on his courage in breaking out into new country.  He is giving serious attention to the problem of dilapidated old schools, old schools that are an eyesore on our landscape.  The Parliamentary Secretary has hinted at prefabrication as a solution to the problem. I hope that we will shortly hear from him something about the adoption of new methods to replace the old schools we would all like to see disappear from the landscape.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin referred to the scheme for the improvement of Leinster House.  Every Deputy will agree that this Chamber and its environs are not very pleasant places either in mid-winter or mid-summer.  My experience is that it is too warm in winter and it is also too warm in summer.  Whatever else the Parliamentary Secretary does to improve this building, I hope he will give serious attention to ventilation and to the installation of some system of thermostatic control of heat in the Chamber and the adjoining rooms where we must spend some time.  When the Parliamentary Secretary was concluding his introductory statement at Column 1076 of the same volume, he said:</P>
    <P>The Board of Works, which is the usual expression to describe my Office, often comes in for more criticism than many Government Departments combined.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was prophetic when <Col N="1824" /> he made that statement because in the ensuing debate he was subjected to what in my opinion was a great deal of unfounded criticism.  I do not intend to deal with that at length but as far as I am concerned and as far as many Deputies on the Opposition benches with whom I have discussed the matter are concerned, we have received nothing but courtesy from the Parliamentary Secretary since he assumed office.  He has been most prompt in replying to letters.  If he has gone to the lengths of signing letters that issue from his Office I am sure he has a good reason for doing so and he himself will give the reason.  It is the hallmark of a gentleman to reply to a letter promptly.</P>
    <P>The allegation was made here that since Deputy O'Malley took over the Office of Public Works, it has been a clearing house for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I deny that most emphatically. It was said here that every time an Opposition Deputy wrote to Deputy O'Malley he summoned the Fianna Fáil members of that constituency to his room and informed them if the news was good so that they would be first off the mark.  That would lead me to the conclusion that Deputy Donnellan, who is an Opposition member from my own constituency, had written no letters to the Parliamentary Secretary since he assumed office although I find it difficult to believe that, because Deputy Donnellan, as I know to my misfortune, is very active and is the harbinger of good news in many parts of my constituency.  I am sorry that Deputy O'Malley did not send for me and let me know when he was releasing the good news to Deputy Donnellan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carty's protestations <Col N="1825" /> of angelic innocence are edifying and, I need hardly say, gratifying. However, speaking with some experience, I do offer this word of advice to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  It has been the practice here that members of this House can make their election as to whether they address themselves to the political head or the permanent head of the Department for the ordinary routine inquiries which it is their duty to make as the representatives of their constituency.  Certain Deputies habitually address themselves to the political head of the Department and ordinarily expect to receive a letter from the political head or the private secretary in reply.  Other Deputies habitually address the permanent head of the Department and ordinarily expect to get a reply from the secretary of the Department giving the information required.</P>
      <P>That practice obtains in every Department of State.  For reasons which the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to communicate to the House, he has seen fit to suspend that arrangement for the Board of Works, with consequent grave misunderstanding on the part of certain Deputies.  I think he makes a mistake to depart from the universal practice.  It may be of assistance to him to know that in all my Parliamentary experience, I have never or very rarely addressed a Minister in regard to ordinary constituency representations.  I address the permanent head of the Department and ordinarily get my reply from him.</P>
      <P>It is quite manifest that if every Deputy corresponded directly with the political head of the Department on matters that it is the duty of a Deputy to raise with a Department, the political head of the Department could not do his work of administering the Department or Deputies would not get a reply.  In fact, we know that if the Parliamentary Secretary purports to answer every individual inquiry raised with the Board of Works by every Deputy, it is the merest formality which involves masses of letters being placed before him every evening which he signs without knowing their contents. I do not know why he does it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> I have had experience as a Minister in two Departments.  It would have been quite impossible for me personally to investigate every matter raised with me.  At the same time, there was a very large volume of inquiries being addressed to the permanent head of my Department.  As it was, when any Deputy addressed me personally, my private secretary conducted the necessary inquiries, placed the resultant correspondence before me, and I signed it out of courtesy to the Deputy who had addressed me personally.  I felt that was a courtesy to which any Deputy was entitled, if he addressed a personal letter to me as Minister.  Of all the inquiries addressed to the Department of Agriculture when I was Minister for Agriculture, 60 to 70 per cent went to the permanent head of the Department, to the secretary, and were dealt with from his office.  The ordinary convention was that the Secretary addressed a personal reply to the Deputy who addressed the letter as I did the personal letter to any Deputy who addressed me.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may feel this is a desirable procedure.  I assure him that his departure is ill advised and calculated to create misunderstanding and unnecessary difficulties. I urge on him, in his own interest and in the interest of proper procedure amongst all in the common discharge of their obligations, that he should resume the practice of leaving it open to Deputies to correspond either with him as the political head of the Office or with the Chairman of the Board of Works, the permanent head. I am quite satisfied that if he reverts to that procedure, whatever his intentions may have been in establishing a new procedure, he will create a better atmosphere and unnecessary difficulties will be laid aside.</P>
    <P>A principle is here at stake.  Any Deputy has a right to make his election as to whether he will correspond with the political head or the permanent head of the Department.  I do not think it ought to be the discretion of the political head of the Department to require Deputies to correspond with him alone.  The public service is at the disposal of all representatives of the <Col N="1827" /> people, no matter what side of the House they sit upon.  It should be open to any Deputy either to avail directly of the service of the Civil Service by writing to the permanent head of the Department or to requisition the assistance of the political head of the Department, at his own election.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary, whatever his personal opinion may be, to recognise that he is not the only person concerned in the matter.  The political head of the Department, which he is, is entitled to his view but there is also an individual Deputy who is entitled to his view.  It is not fitting or becoming, if Parliamentary methods are to function smoothly, that the political head of any Department should seek to impose his will in a matter of this kind upon Deputies who do not share his outlook and who elect themselves to have recourse to the permanent head of the Department in preference to dealing directly with the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary himself.</P>
    <P>I could elaborate on that at some considerable length; I do not choose to do so.  I think it is important to us all that decent Parliamentary institutions should function in this country.  I do not believe that debate in this House should become a childish pastime.  I expect it to be trenchant, vigorous and even on occasions violent in its language. That is as it should be.  That is the way a decent Parliament functions. Side by side with that, a great deal of public work must be transacted which depends on all of us playing the game according to the rules.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that one of the well-established rules of the Parliamentary life of this country has been that it is for an individual Deputy himself to determine whether he transacts his business with a public Department through its political head or through its permanent head.  It would be a great misfortune if a political head of any Department of State sought to change that arrangement on his own initiative without any regard for the preference of the Deputy concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1828" /> I am not primarily concerned to speak on this Estimate for the purpose of dealing with the matter which I have just mentioned.  There are two other matters, one of which Deputy Carty mentioned, to which I should like to make reference.  The replacement of dilapidated national schools in rural Ireland has made considerable progress during the past 10 or 15 years.  However, as Deputy Carty says, the progress made does not appear to be sufficient to catch up on the arrears that await attention.  I think one of the methods by which we could expedite the solution of this problem would be to change our approach in certain areas.</P>
    <P>At present, we seem to be obsessed with the idea that if there is a small school in a remote area in rural Ireland, which has become dilapidated with the passage of years, we must put another small school where the old small school was.  I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he might with propriety suggest to the Minister for Education that very much more rapid progress could be made if the Minister for Education could agree with the manager that in suitable situations if there were three or four small schools in a parish which were in a state of dilapidation requiring replacement or extensive repairs, instead of attempting their several replacement by individual new schools special facilities would be made available if the manager would consent to accept a parochial school. That would involve the Minister for Education in agreeing to transport the children to the school.</P>
    <P>I believe that in a scattered rural parish where you may have five schools at the present time, if the manager would agree to a parochial school with a bus service bringing the children into the centre of the parish in the morning and leaving them home at night, as is the universal practice all over the United States of America, we could get far better schools than we at present can have dotted about the country.</P>
    <P>We would have the advantage that instead of having a number of small schools with one or two teachers in <Col N="1829" /> them, as is so frequently the case, we would have one parochial school where there would be seven or eight teachers, which would operate to create a kind of academic life around the school.  We could afford to give the children far more amenities in the kind of building that would accommodate a relatively large number and the children could be brought in in the morning in the school bus using, if necessary, the old schools as points of assembly for collecting and leaving them back to the old schools in the evening from which they could proceed on foot to their respective homes.</P>
    <P>If we do not do that, I apprehend that very large sums of public money will be wasted in building a multitude of small schools where we shall perennially be up against the problem that the number of children attending them make it possible to have only one teacher.  It does not matter how excellent the teacher is: he or she cannot teach all the boys or all the girls in all the standards in one school.  Yet, in my constituency in Monaghan there are now quite a number of rural schools where there is only one teacher because there are not sufficient children to justify the appointment of more.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary might discuss this matter with the Minister for Education. I believe that if such a scheme were once embarked upon, a great many managers throughout the country would recognise its advantages. The adoption of such a plan might help materially in catching up on the arrears of school building that at present harass us all.</P>
    <P>The last matter I want to mention is one which has been a perennial source of anxiety to many of us.  It is the in adequacy of that division of the Office of Public Works which deals with monuments.  Everybody expresses benevolent interest in ancient monuments but, when it comes down to the tin tacks of doing something about it, it appears to be nobody's business. There are two problems relating to ancient monuments.  The first is to schedule and effectively preserve those <Col N="1830" /> that we can see.  Unfortunately, in my lifetime I have seen many precious ancient monuments physically disappear as the stones of which they were constructed had been carted away.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that on occasions I approached the Office of Public Works, notably under the Parliamentary Secretary's immediate predecessor and under other Parliamentary Secretaries, and in the vast majority of cases, effective steps were taken to preserve these monuments.  The trouble is that the staff of the Office, which itself should be taking the initiative in this matter, is not adequate, never has been and, I suggest, should be greatly strengthened. Some of the most precious ancient monuments in this country are not visible to the naked eye at all. Archaeologists, I understand, believe that this island of Ireland is probably the richest in archaeological sites in Europe and it has the unique quality that it is the only part of Western Europe which the Romans never entered.  As such, it has a unique archaeological quality.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Agriculture, I was anxious to promote an aerial survey of this country primarily for certain agricultural considerations which I believed it would serve.  Various difficulties arose and I failed to get it carried out but I asked the Government of that time that apart from the immediate interests I sought to serve, there were very important interests from the point of view of mineral deposits and immensely valuable archaeological considerations which could only be served by aerial survey because without that, their very existence could not be determined.</P>
    <P>In the process of presenting that view to the Government, I got certain sample surveys made.  One of them was an aerial survey of Croghan of the Kings in County Roscommon.  It illustrates most dramatically the point I seek to establish.  When the aerial survey of that restricted area had been made, I submitted it to a competent archaeologist and he compared it with the peripatetic survey which exists of the Croghan area and which contains such sites as they have been able to discover.  But when you compare the aerial survey with the peripatetic <Col N="1831" /> survey, it reveals the existence of some 20 archaeological sites which the peripatetic survey was wholly unable to reveal.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he might, with advantage, consider this matter.  I believe that over and above the archaeological value of such a survey, other Departments would be prepared to support him on the ground that it would serve their interests too.  The great tragedy of the failure to have an aerial survey made is that with the passage of every year and the more intensive agricultural operations become, the more these sites will be obliterated and lost to history in our time.  Every time there is an extension of a town or a village, interesting archaeological sites are obliterated and gone forever.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary looks into this matter, he will find that the Department of Defence has an extremely obscurantist approach to it. I was surprised when I found that they wanted to do all the work themselves but later I found that they did not give a damn about the survey.  What they really wanted was to get new aeroplanes which the Department of Finance would not sanction.  They thought they could wangle the aeroplanes on the ground of doing the aerial survey.</P>
    <P>The survey was never made.  The objection was made by the Army that if the survey was to be made, it should be made only by the Irish Army as, if it were made by anybody else, our most hidden secrets might be given away.  This was the time that the U2 plane was floating over the USSR without anybody being aware of it and, for all we know, a U2 plane may have been stationary over this country.  The U2 plane was the one used by the Americans for taking aerial photographs.  They said that our secrets might be discovered by an alien Government, despite the fact that our ordnance survey maps have been drawn by the British Government and are on file in London.  In fact, if you want some of these maps, you must apply to London for them, but <Col N="1832" /> at the same time there must be no aerial survey of this country.</P>
    <P>That kind of thing goes on in Governments.  If similar representations are now made to the Parliamentary Secretary, I would suggest that he look on them with an incredulous eye.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee, so long as the aerial survey of the country is made. Unless and until it is made, a great wealth of archaeological knowledge is in grave danger of being lost.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary that he play his part in ensuring that it will be preserved.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary is doing his job as well as he can do it.  I wish him nothing but good luck.  I hope he will be there for as short a time as it is humanly possible for a political appointee to be in power and I intend to do everything possible to dislodge him and his colleagues as quickly as I can but, subject to that, I hope he will do a good job.  I think he is competent to do it, if he tries.  I sincerely hope that he will try and that no action on his part will stir up any unnecessary opposition which will facilitate neither him nor anybody else in the transaction of public business.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an Meastachán seo.  I am particularly interested in the problem of drainage.  My constituency is drained by the Shannon, the Erne and the Boyne.  I am pleased to learn that something is being done on the Boyne but part of the Erne flows through Northern Ireland and it will be necessary to have some negotiations with the Northern Government so as to facilitate the carrying out of drainage work on this river.  Tremendous flooding has been caused for as long as I can remember and nothing has ever been done to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The upper part of the Shannon also causes serious flooding and effective drainage could be carried out from the source of the Shannon to the point of entry into Lough Allen, if the necessary surveys were carried out.  We in Cavan have no harbours and do not <Col N="1833" /> benefit from sea fisheries and I feel that we are entitled to priority in relation to drainage schemes.  I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary said that it is his intention to start work on four major arterial drainage projects each year.  That is a very definite advance on which he is to be congratulated.  I mention these matters because they relate to places in my constituency.</P>

      <P>I always keep between the ditches.  Up to recently, it was true that we could say that the fairies and the ghost stories preserved many of our ancient monuments but with the advent of electric light, modern machinery and bulldozers, many of the monuments are disappearing almost overnight. It is something in which the Board of Works should interest themselves and endeavour to have them preserved.  If it were at all possible, an annual stipend should be given to farmers on whose land the monuments are located to induce them to preserve these monuments in the condition in which they were when the farms were acquired.  I should like in particular to mention Lough Oughter Castle which is one of the few pre-Norman castles in Ireland and which has never been taken over by the Board of Works. Nothing has been done about it. Recently a new approach road was made to the edge of the water and now it could be tackled as the road is there and certainly the manpower.  With regard to small rural schools, I agree with what Deputy Dillon said up to a point.  I think a case could be made to have one simple building in each parish where perhaps we might have a secondary class to the national school and <Col N="1834" /> in which children would have an opportunity of getting two or three years of secondary education.  This would result in a considerable saving in the cost of secondary education. Another matter is that all national schools should have proper playing fields.  It is ridiculous to see these schools being built without adequate facilities for the recreation which is a very important part of children's education.</P>
      <P>The rural improvements schemes, the minor relief schemes and the bog development schemes are working satisfactorily.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that where an area has been found ineligible for a minor relief scheme, if two areas adjoin, they might be taken into consideration in order to qualify for a grant, in cases where valuations are small and where it is almost impossible to get them to subscribe to the rural improvements scheme.  Cases have been brought to my notice of areas which failed to qualify but which, if an adjacent area had been included, would have qualified.  I have nothing further to add except to say that I have the utmost confidence in the Parliamentary Secretary and in the work he has undertaken and that drainage is being tackled in an effective manner.  I am quite sure it will bring good results and reclaim thousands of acres of arable land which will add considerably to the prosperity of the country.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the speakers who paid tribute to the Chairman, Commissioners and staff of the Office of Public Works and who wished me well in my term of office.  In particular, I should like to thank Deputy Donnellan. I did not think that I would be so fortunate as to be called so quickly and there are some points which I should like to deal with specifically. Deputy Tully raised some interesting matters.  First of all, there is the question of rates of wages.  The rates of wages paid on drainage work have always been regarded as a national drainage rate payable on all arterial drainage throughout the country. While it is not based on any particular <Col N="1835" /> rate, regard is had, when granting increases, to the rates paid to agricultural workers and county council road workers.  Increases recently given were 4/- a week, or 1d. an hour, from 6th February, 1961, and 10/- a week, or 2½d. an hour, from 6th November, 1961.  The present rate is 2/8½d. an hour or £6 10s. for a 48-hour week. In the summer months, regular overtime of seven hours a week is worked, bringing the total to £7 14s.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The main agricultural rate for a 50-hour week for the greater portion of the country from 4th June, 1962, is £6 and the county council rates vary around £7 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Exceptionally, slightly higher rates are paid for special work in Galway, the Ballina urban district and the Broadmeadow scheme in County Dublin.  The Government are not prepared to pay a rate of wages for drainage that would have the effect of drawing men away from other essential productive employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will bear with me until I conclude. There is difficulty in securing labour for agriculture.  I may say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I am going into this matter in as much detail as possible because when I came into the Office of Public Works, I also could not understand why this differential should exist whereby an able-bodied man is paid £6 a week, while his counterpart with a union card, who gets a position as a builder's labourer in a city, gets very substantially more. I asked the question: &ldquo;Would this not be one of the reasons for the flight from the land and surely the ambition <Col N="1836" /> of all Governments should be to have parity between rural and urban areas so that the rural dweller might be encouraged to stay in rural Ireland?&rdquo; I am still of that opinion, although I do appreciate the unique position which obtains.  There is a vicious circle.  In this matter I am giving my personal opinion.  At the present time to a great extent, farm prices are depressed and the farmer is just not in a position to pay any substantially increased wages to his agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not right, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, with the advent of the Common Market and increased prosperity, I hope, for the Irish farmer, that may be the first real stepping-stone in an approach to parity between urban and rural workers.  As I say, after grave consideration of the whole matter, we are not prepared to pay a rate of wages for drainage, that would have the effect of drawing men away from other essential productive employment.  Deputy Tully will appreciate that successive Governments, including Governments in which representatives of his Party had very prominent key positions, appreciated the national issue involved in this matter.  I say that in all sincerity.  There is a difficulty in securing labour for agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will bear with me.  As I say, I have gone into this matter in fair detail. There is difficulty in securing labour for agriculture, the rate for which is 10s. a week lower than the drainage rate, that is, the minimum rate.  The local authorities are engaged in providing important local services.  The Government are providing over £1,000,000 this year for arterial drainage work.  That is in addition to the various other aids to agriculture.  Every penny an hour granted by way of increased pay means an addition of £20,000 a year to this figure.  An increase of 10s. a week would mean an additional <Col N="1837" /> £50,000.  The economics of drainage have been questioned by many and undue inflation of wage rates could conceivable put those in favour of arterial drainage out of court, out of the market altogether, so to speak.  I impress this: I do not suggest that the workers should for that reason be asked to accept an inadequate wage. The wage, by comparison with other country rates, is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary will have to take the responsibility for what will happen as a result of his statement.  We know his Department have not even concluded negotiations with the union, but just broke them up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that point.  I do not attribute an untrue statement to the Deputy but I do not think that statement is actually correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the matter also.  As I say, the wage, compared with other country rates, is not unreasonable.  Only last month, the Agricultural Wages Board, which is an independent body&mdash;and I need not remind the Deputy of the composition of the Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A minimum rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an undoubted, incontrovertible fact that the advent of a drainage scheme is hailed by all in the catchment area, not only by the farmers, but by the people who see a chance of fair employment over a period of years.  So far, in the history of arterial drainage, there has been no great difficulty in recruiting labour in rural areas, but there is one thing that it would be as well to say in order to clear the air.  Deputy Tully must surely agree with me that in recruiting <Col N="1838" /> labour for such schemes, we must give prior consideration to the names sent to us by the local employment exchange.  Were the Deputy a contractor with a profit motive, I think he would agree with me as a reasonable man that a large percentage of the men sent from employment exchanges are not really capable of fully working or adequately giving the output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  On a point of order, I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary should make such a statement because it is just not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Needless to say, as the Deputy should appeciate, I am not casting any reflection on the type of worker we get but what I do say is that we have to accept <i>in toto</i> the names submitted to us by the employment exchange.  I have no hesitation in saying that we do get quite a large percentage at times of men who, through no fault of their own, are not able to give the full output.  I just bring out that point <i>en passant</i> to show our difficulties.  We are not in the same position as ordinary contractors who can pick and choose and, as the Deputy knows, some of them do pick and choose very ruthlessly.</P>
      <P>I think everyone on every side of the House appreciates that we would like to see a very substantial increase in the rates being paid but Deputy Tully, I understand, is not agreeable to accept as an answer to a wage claim, the suggestion, even in part, of an incentive bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy agrees that such a scheme, however, would step up production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable, but not an answer to a wage claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but it would also step up the weekly earnings of the workers.  That is correct? Will the Deputy agree?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Tully is of interest to very many members on both sides of the House.  It is not a question of settling a trade dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will come to aeroplanes later on and Deputy Dillon will then be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think it a good way to settle a trade dispute, to argue it across the floor of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that we are about to initiate a system of a type of incentive bonus for drainage workers.  It is not as easy a matter as one would think.  Such incentive bonus worked very well in the case of forestry workers.  They are very satisfied. The analogy could be classified as being rather strained.  Nevertheless, I think we will be able to produce some scheme and we will give it a trial in certain areas.  Perhaps we may try it out on the Broadmeadow in Dublin.  If it is a success, we might apply it to other areas.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of the differential in pay increases given to drivers and labourers.  Since the close of the seventh round of wage and salary increases, labourers employed by the Office of Public Works have got increases amounting to 22/- a week.  I am not at all happy about the arguments for a 45-hour week for drainage workers.  In saying that, I would point out that I am not against the principle.  It is all right and works easily enough in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And in local authority employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is a questionable concession in rural areas.  Our <Col N="1840" /> agricultural workers are still tied to a 50-hour week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not milk cows on drainage schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be in the national interest to reduce the working week on drainage.  We would have a serious loss in output and a substantial increase in costs.  It is essential that in all drainage work advantage would be taken of the long hours of daylight and low water levels in the summer, and it is found that a 48-hour week, spread over the six days, with overtime where possible, is a very satisfactory arrangement.  However, we are always willing to examine such a position.  We have always been perfectly willing to do everything possible for employees.</P>
      <P>It is not today or yesterday that the question of incentive bonuses arose. With the help of consultants we have been examining this possibility for quite some time.  A number of difficulties have arisen in devising a suitable basis for such a scheme, but within a few weeks we shall be initiating an incentive bonus scheme.  It is too soon yet to say much about the details.  I hope, however, that if it succeeds it will enable us to speed up drainage work and to increase the pay packets of our employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will consult the trade unions concerned beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are always willing to have discussions with the trade unions concerned: we have done so in the past and I see no reason why we should not do it in this instance.  Mention was made about the effect of drainage work on fisheries.  That is, of course, inevitable but I would point out that the policy of my predecessors and of the Office of Public Works has been to keep in close touch with the Fisheries Division and make them aware of many of our proposals.  We work in harmony with their officials so that as little damage as possible will be done to the spawning beds and so forth.  One Deputy mentioned that a letter of his, dated 3rd March of this year, had not been replied to.  It was a <Col N="1841" /> request for a five-day week for members of his union.  That letter was acknowledged&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there were a number of complex matters in the background of which the Deputy must be aware.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, perhaps, have dealt at the outset with this question relating to my personally replying to letters.  As the House is well aware by now, objection was taken by two members of the Fine Gael Party to that procedure.  They were the only members of this House who objected to the fact that I made a regulation whereby I would sign personally all letters to Deputies and Senators.  A mountain has been made out of a molehill in this matter, for reasons best known to Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  Of course, the Deputy is quite entitled to raise these matters and to put down as many questions as he wishes, and it is my duty to reply to them to the best of my ability.  I shall continue to do so, but in all sincerity I must tell the House that when I made that regulation, it was not an effort on my part to do the big fellow or to throw my weight about or because I had any lack of confidence in the officials in my Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in the Office of Public Works for many months before I made that regulation.  There were several reasons for my doing so, one of them being that in certain instances I found, to my embarrassment, if you wish, that certain letters from Deputies were not replied to for anything up to four months.  This was possibly due to an oversight, human nature being what <Col N="1842" /> it is, but it happened on a number of occasions.  While the delay was not always four months, nevertheless, it was quite considerable in many instances.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will know what an embarrassing thing it is for a Deputy to have to return to his constituents and, when asked what reply he had to a representation he said he had made, to have to say that he has had no reply&mdash;that he cannot produce any evidence, in fact, that he has made any such representations. Consequently, when a week runs into a month and a month runs into two, such delays can reach serious proportions. Deputy Flanagan may not accept this, so I should like to read an extract from a memorandum in my file showing how genuine I have been in this matter.  This is what the extract says:</P>
    <P>It has come to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary that a letter from Deputy Oliver Flanagan, dated such and such, was not answered until such a date.  Mr O'Malley deplores the delay in the issuing of a reply in this instance, asks for an explanation and trusts that in future when a reply cannot be forthcoming immediately, an acknowledgment at least will be issued to the Deputy's letter.</P>
    <P>I can give many other instances.  That was one of the main reasons why I issued this directive.</P>
    <P>The two objectors were Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Flanagan.  We heard Deputy Donnellan state today he was very glad that I dealt with these matters personally and to receive a letter with my name on it.  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, has made the point, however, that it is usual for the permanent head of the Department to reply if someone writes to the officials.  I do not wish to be contentious or to aggravagate unpleasantness in any way.  I propose, therefore, to look into the matter again and see if an equitable decision can be arrived at.  I think it has been exaggerated out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that he himself <Col N="1843" /> and members of his Party, if they wrote to the permanent head of the Department, would wish to get a reply from him.  The numbers of letters which the Chairman of the Office of Public Works gets from members is infinitesimal.  I have consulted him personally. He might get one or two in a couple of months.  In the main, letters from Deputies would be addressed to, possibly, the Special Employments Schemes Office or to other officials and not to the Commissioners.  I have no objection to a letter going to the Commissioners but I do not think it is right that the onus should be put on engineers and architects to reply.  Maybe that reply is used in the local newspapers and it might carry certain implications that might embarrass me and the Office itself by revealing certain information which it would not be appropriate to reveal.</P>
    <P>I hope the House appreciates my point in all this.  I have seen letters&mdash; admittedly not from any of the Commissioners&mdash;from my office and I would not agree with the phraseology and the information given in them.  On the whole, it is no pleasure for me to have to sit down and sign letters.  I do not sign hundreds of letters a day.  If I had to, it would be a farce because they would be just put before me for signature and I would not know what was going on.  I would not sign more than 40 or 50 letters a day.  It is not an awful lot but it enables me to become conversant with the affairs of my Department.  The House will appreciate I am new to this.  There is quite a lot I have to learn&mdash;I do not mind admitting it&mdash;and I will continue to have to learn.  Deputy Donnellan said he was six and a half years there and, although he learned a lot, he still had a lot to learn when he came out.</P>
    <P>That is the position in a nutshell.  I get letters from members of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and from Deputy Donnellan and Independents as well as Deputies on my own side of the House.  There are two Deputies who are complaining.  I have to take notice when the Leader of the Opposition gets up and says it is his opinion I should re-examine the position out of courtesy <Col N="1844" /> to him and to show some spirit of co-operation. I shall look at the matter again and see if some amicable solution can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>People who know Deputy Flanagan well might not take a lot of notice of him because they know he might go in for wild statements which might be a bit exaggerated, but I wish to go on record as emphatically refuting the suggestion that we indulge in political appointments in the Office of Public Works and that it is another Mount Street for Fianna Fáil.  When a Deputy makes any representations in regard to appointees on drainage schemes and so on, the usual phraseology is &ldquo;I will bring the representations to the engineer in charge for his favourable consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the usual procedure in regard to the representations of Deputies, no matter what side they are on.  I appreciate getting representations on behalf of an individual. If you make representations to certain State companies, they knock the client straight away on the grounds of canvassing.  I am of the school of thought that appreciates representations on the grounds that some individuals are not able to express themselves adequately, particularly in writing, and that a Deputy often brings home certain salient features or background of a case which are very helpful to the engineer in charge or to those charged with making the appointment. So much for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  We have read quite a lot in the papers from time to time down the years about the position with regard to university education, the inadequacy of the number of scholarships available from local authorities and the plight of parents who may have brilliant children but who cannot afford to send them to a university.  That has all been very <Col N="1845" /> true.  I have a pleasant announcement to make.  It is, if you wish, rather revolutionary to emanate from a Government Department and I submit it for, I am sure, the sympathetic approval of the House.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to announce the initiation by my Office of a scheme for trainee architectural assistants in the Civil Service.  The purpose is to provide a basic training in architectural draughtsmanship, building construction and materials mensuration and surveying over a five-year course, on the successful completion of which the trainees will be advanced to the grade of architectural assistant.  For a start, it is intended to recruit 20 trainees this year through open competition among candidates between 16 and 20 years of age who have obtained the intermediate certificate or the day junior vocational group certificate. The successful candidates will undertake a whole-time day course of instruction in the College of Technology, Bolton Street, during the first year.</P>
    <P>During their further period of training, they will obtain practical experience in a Government office and attend part-time courses at the college.  The college fees and cost of equipment will be paid for by the State and the students will be paid during their course of training a salary to cover subsistence and personal expenses.  This will enable students from all parts of the country and from all walks of life to compete.  The commencing salary proposed to be paid, although modest, will cover the cost of the student's lodging and personal expenses, so that children from the poorest families can participate.  To give an indication, a child arriving up here in Dublin from the West or from Limerick for the commencement of the training course at the end of 1962 until passing the examination held at the end of the first year will be paid £4 per week; from the date of passing the first examination to the date of passing the second examination, 105/- a week; from the date of passing the second examination to the date of passing the third examination, 150/- a week; from the date of passing the third examination to the date of passing the fifth examination, <Col N="1846" /> the final examination, £10 4s. a week.  After passing the final examination, and if he is considered to be otherwise a suitable trainee for appointment as an architectural assistant in the Civil Service, there is another scale for the next grade: £10 4s. a week rising to 305/- a week.</P>
    <P>The scheme is open, of course, to girls as well as boys.  It will provide a great boon in view of the general demand throughout the country for university and other forms of higher education.  The State and the local authorities are doing their best to cater for this demand by providing scholarships, but the scope of such assistance is limited by the available resources which are subject to various other pressing demands.</P>
    <P>This scheme is an additional means of giving earnest students an opportunity to advance themselves.  I understand that the Dublin vocational education authority in future years intend to provide classes of this nature to cater for the general public.  I should like to take this opportunity of thanking them for their co-operation with the Commissioners of Public Works in the initiation of this most interesting scheme.  I may say that investigations are proceeding into the possibility of instituting a corresponding scheme for the training of engineering technicians. It is too soon yet to say what will be the outcome of these investigations but I am hopeful that they will result in some easement of the difficult situation which has arisen from the very substantial expansion of our engineering programme.</P>
    <P>I might mention also that a first group of apprentices is at present being recruited for training in the Central Engineering Works at Inchicore.  I mentioned to the Chairman of the Commissioners that I thought this would be one of the most interesting documents to emanate from the Office of Public Works.  One can see a very interesting precedent in it.  I feel that a barrier has been broken.  I mentioned also to the Commissioners that it is reasonable that in regard to those children who are brilliant students and who pass their Intermediate Certificate but cannot afford to go to Matriculation or Leaving Certificate, if they <Col N="1847" /> have their Intermediate Certificate or have passed the day junior vocational examination they will qualify for this scheme.</P>
    <P>This is in Bolton Street.  I suggest to those interested and to members of vocational committees in Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Sligo, Roscommon or elsewhere where there are vocational schools there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why such a scheme should not be adopted and adapted by those committees.  Certainly the Commissioners will be only too glad to help them and I am sure the Dublin Vocational Committee will be helpful too.  That would mean that a lot of the students could stay at home and take the courses in their home town, or near their homes, instead of having to come to Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The public may not be very interested, but I think the House would be interested to hear of the developments which are taking place in <Col N="1849" /> Leinster House.  As Deputies probably know the work has started.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not know anything about that.  First of all, I should like to tell members of the House that we hope to come to a final decision very shortly on the acoustic treatment and sound reinforcement of this Chamber.  Most of the information is of a highly technical nature.  With regard to sound reinforcement a low level multi-speaker system is proposed. We investigated and found that would require a control operator, and would comprise 29 microphones, suspended from the main ceiling of the Chamber, with nylon cord suspensions; one table stand microphone for the Ceann Comhairle; 40 speakers, mounted under desks for Deputies; 12 speakers, mounted under the desk for the Press Gallery, including monitor for control panel operator; nine speakers for the Public Gallery mounted on the inside face of the Gallery; two amplifiers for speakers; and two pre-amplifiers located in the Press Gallery corridor; and one control panel located in the Press Gallery overlooking the Ceann Comhairle's Chair.  The microphones will be of the Cardioid single-sided type, designed for maximum intelligibility rather than for high quality.  The Control Panel will incorporate group selection of microphones and speakers, with pre-set volume control, and compressor limiter to ensure constant volume level.  I think we might have to get the sanction of the Minister for Finance for that&mdash;I am not too sure about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of interest, it is appropriate, I think, to give some information about the work so that Deputies and the general public &mdash;it is the general public who will pay for the work&mdash;may be aware of the type of contract involved.  The nature of the work is such that it could not be catered for adequately in an ordinary bill of quantities and the method of contracting which we adopted was that known as a &ldquo;cost plus basis&rdquo;.  Our <Col N="1850" /> quantity surveyors advised us that a reasonable figure for the cost of these new buildings and the extension to Leinster House would be of the order of £375,000 completed, all services included.  By notice in the public Press, we invited those who were desirous of tendering for this work to submit their names.  We got 17 names, and 16 of those submitted a tender.  The tender consisted in charging a fee.  As I have said, it is a cost plus basis.</P>
      <P>This is a type of contract which has already been employed satisfactorily by the Commissioners of Public Works on two other major construction schemes, the Central Bank and the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  It is designed to provide for reimbursement of the contractor for his outlay on materials, insurance, the hire of scaffolding, plant and machinery, and the payment of a fee which would include for the contractor's profit the profit on subcontractor's work, overhead and establishment charges.  The contract also provides for the payment of a bonus to the contractor, in the event of his completing the job within the estimated figure of cost, namely, the target figure of £375,000.  If he completes the contract within this sum, he will get a bonus of a percentage. If he exceeds the cost, there will be appeal clauses for every £100 in excess of the target figure.</P>
      <P>The determining feature in awarding the contract was the amount of the fee quoted.  The quotations received varied considerably; £39,000 was one fee; there were two at £17,000; some at £25,000, one at £12,000, two at £11,000, three at £5,000.  The successful contractor charged no fee.  This might give one to think furiously.  In actual fact, the answer is that the very reputable firm in question is particularly well organised and is in a position to carry out this work.  With the plant they have and their organisation, they feel that, if they do the job under £375,000, they will be well paid on the bonus percentage as compared with charging a fee.  This method of contract should be of interest to the building trade.  It should be of interest to the members of this House generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work has started.  I should not imagine it will be finished until the <Col N="1851" /> Autumn of 1964, unfortunately.  The extension will consist of six storeys over a basement.  The ground floor will comprise the restaurant and bar accommodation, while the upper floors will provide Party rooms and offices for members of the Government.  It is also intended to carry out certain alterations to Leinster House itself with a view to providing improved accommodation for the members.</P>
    <P>Initially, a certain amount of internal rearrangement of accommodation has had to be, and will have to be, made.  This will be followed by the demolition of the structures which stand on the site of the new extension. It is hoped the demolition work will be completed and the excavation for foundations will be in hands before the House reassembles in the Autumn. The execution of the contract will involve some inconvenience to the members and staff of the Oireachtas, but every effort will be made to keep such inconvenience to the minimum and I am sure all concerned will gladly suffer the inconvenience for the sake of the ultimate considerable improvement which will be effected in the accommodation position in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have from time to time criticised the appearance of the stonework approaching Leinster House from the Kildare Street entrance.  I am glad to say we have placed a contract for the cleaning of the stonework and we expect the work will be carried out during the Summer Recess. I am not sure whether Deputies are aware that it is intended, when the job of reconstruction and the new works have been completed, that the new entrance will be by Leinster Lawn.  That very beautiful part of Dublin has never been utilised.  To all intents and purposes, it is going to waste.  It is intended that Leinster Lawn will be the new entrance for Deputies, Senators and distinguished visitors.  While car parking may not be allowed initially, those coming in can be dropped at the gate.  I do not think it would be feasible, without destroying certain of the aesthetics which exist, to provide car parking at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1852" /> Deputy Dillon mentioned the question of national monuments and said that, in his opinion, successive Governments had not done enough.  We had here, he said, more reserves of interesting architectural&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Archaeological.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We had, he said, more archaeological reserves than any other country in Europe.  I am in complete agreement with that.  For the information of Deputy Dillon and the House, I should like to quote a letter I wrote to Dr. Lucas, the honorary secretary of the National Monuments Council on 4th May last.  I had invited the members of the Council to meet me.  They very kindly came and we had a very interesting discussion.  This letter was written as a result of that discussion.  It will indicate to the House what my feelings are in this matter.</P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>I write as arranged at the meeting I had on the 1st instant with a deputation from the National Monuments Advisory Council in order to get the views of the Council on the matters mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the discussion, it was only recently on reading the files in the Office of Public Works that I began to appreciate the importance from the national and tourist point of view of the proper treatment of our monuments.  Primarily, it occurred to me that enough is not being done to preserve our heritage of monuments and make them attractive and instructive for our own people and for visitors.  I find that arrangements are in train for an expansion of the work being done by the Commissioners of Public Works&mdash;additional staff is being recruited, some, indeed, have already been taken on, and the amount provided in the annual Estimates for maintenance and preservation work has this year been increased to £37,000 as against the £20-£25,000 that has hitherto been spent annually.  That is a step in the right direction but I think it does not go far enough.  There is also a proposal, which has been agreed to between your <Col N="1853" /> Council and the Commissioners, to embark on the second stage of the Archaeological Survey at a cost of about £7,000 a year.  That proposal is being considered by the Department of Finance and I hope that it will soon be sanctioned and the work put in hands.  Certain moneys are provided by Bord Fáilte for Monument work&mdash;mostly improvement of amenities, signposting, car parks, etc.  Some local authorities too spend money, not very much, on monuments and I think that recently the Department of Local Government made a grant of £1,000 in relation to Rothe House in Kilkenny. The Special Employment Schemes Office provide money for archaeological excavation work.  It seems to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is my own opinion&mdash;</P>
    <P>that it would be a good thing if all these separate interests were to be channelled into one authority &mdash; a semi-State body, perhaps, which would be autonomous with adequate powers to review the whole position regarding our monuments and to carry out the necessary works of preservation and presentation and in certain selected cases, to do restoration work such as was done in Bunratty Castle.  That Body would also undertake the archaeological survey and perhaps finance and control archaeological excavations in some sites.  I visualise that they would formulate a short term programme to put into a proper state of repair all the monuments already in State ownership or guardianship and that they would also take into their care the other deserving monuments of which there are still many throughout the country which merit attention. To do that it would be necessary to increase very much the money allocated to the National Monuments service but I believe that, if the facts of the case were put before the Government, a sufficient grant of money would be made.</P>
    <P>There again I am expressing my own opinion.  I am not speaking for the Government.  They might throw out the suggestion.</P>
    <P>I feel that such a body devoted to <Col N="1854" /> one service only would produce results which cannot be expected from the various separate organisations at present concerned, particularly when National Monuments as such form only a very small part of the wider interests with which those organisations are concerned.  I realise that there are different aspects of our National Monuments, e.g., earth works from pre-historic times, mediaeval structures, and more modern &ldquo;big&rdquo; houses all of which have their advocates and to some extent competing demands.  I would hope to have a Board of Directors composed of persons who would provide a balanced outlook on all the various facets of the service and that they would have enough money, perhaps a couple of hundred thousand pounds a year, and skilled executive staff to make big strides within a few years towards a presentation of our monuments of which we could all be proud.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate the advice and opinions of your Council on this project and would like to have them as soon as you can.  You will remember that the middle of June was mentioned at our discussion and I hope that I may hear from you by then.</P>
    <P>That is self-explanatory and I think we all agree what an important aspect of our historical past the national monuments are.  We all realise that, unfortunately, many of our national treasures have been lost to us irrevocably for certain reasons.</P>

I do not know whether Deputy Leneghan's helicopters will be of any assistance in that regard but, to answer the Deputy, I propose to have the matter re-examined and I shall let him know what is the outcome. Deputy Thaddeus Lynch referred to the question of the erection of a new Garda Station in Waterford <Col N="1855" /> City.  It is intended to build a new one at Ballybricken.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin mentioned that when the new buildings here are completed some system of communication should be installed in Party rooms so that one could know what business was on in the House.  We propose to install closed circuit television so that everyone will be aware of what is going on.  I think it is feasible to have a smaller indicating board giving the particular number in the Order of Business which could be installed in each Party room or other appropriate places such as the restaurant and bar.</P>

Finally, I have taken careful note of the points raised by Deputy Michael Donnellan in regard to the Glenamaddy lakes and the Canal about three miles in length near Shrule.  I shall see if anything can be done and communicate with him.  I have heard figures for expenditure on arterial drainage since the Act was passed up to the present day.  I do not see the point in reading out figures as to who spent what.  I think all Governments are agreed unanimously on the necessity for arterial drainage.  I think everyone did his best.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned school building and suggested that instead of having four or five schools in a parish there should be one central parochial school.  Of course, that is not any function of the Office of Public Works.  The only way we would come into it would be were we asked to advise the Miniister for Education.  However, as I said in my introductory speech, this question of prefabricated schools is being examined.  It has aroused a tremendous amount of public interest.  I should like to place on record a most interesting observation, from what might be termed a cross-section of opinion, from the man in the street.  This was expressed in a very interesting sub-leader in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> I was very glad to see that a national newspaper would go to the trouble of expressing itself in this way.  It was rather encouraging. Since I announced this question of prefabricated schools my commissioners and myself, the Minister for Education, Dr. Hillery, and his secretary and assistant secretary, have had several meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just a question of pressing a button and starting off such a project. It is one of seeing the best systems.  We are satisfied and so is the Minister for Education that, aesthetically, there is nothing objectionable about prefabricated schools.  They have their attraction. <Col N="1857" /> The speed of erection and the maintenance offer no difficulties.  Economically, it appears from the information which I have gleaned up to now that there would be a certain saving on prefabricated school building <i>vis-à-vis</i> the existing orthodox method.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will not have the ignorant-looking water tanks on top of every one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A mission went from my office to England.  It consisted of two representatives from our office, the Chief Architect and a member of Establishment, and then there was a member from the Department of Education and a nominee of his Lordship the Archbishop of Dublin who was, indeed, most helpful.  They were all, I think, very pleased with what they saw.</P>
      <P>I think that the word &ldquo;prefabricated&rdquo; is a misnomer.  I conjure up and the ordinary man in the street conjures up by &ldquo;prefabrication&rdquo; something like a cross between Nissen huts and temporary timber buildings.  Someone at some time will have to come forward with a different word.  So far, it has not been found or certainly is not used in ordinary parlance.  I want to stress that there is in prefabrication nothing of a temporary nature. They are just as lasting, if not more lasting in certain instances, than the orthodox schools and the maintenance costs are negligible.</P>
      <P>I think most Departments of State like to put their cards on the table and not to indulge in self-praise.  My Commissioners are very acutely conscious that for the first three or four months of this year we are behind in our school building programme compared to last year.  That is very disturbing.  Possibly it affords a certain amount of gratification to say that last year we spent more money than ever on schools.  That may well be.  Wages and materials have gone up.  The number of pupil places which have been provided is the true record, not the number of schools.  One school can cater for 20 students; another can cater for 400 students. The number of pupil places provided each year is the criterion.</P>

      <P>Yes.  As I was saying, it is a disturbing feature.  We have to do something to rectify it.  I know I shall get the assistance of all Parties in the House in that co-operation. I should mention also that the Minister for Education&mdash;I am sure he will not mind my saying so&mdash;has gone on his own to Britain to examine some of these schools.  He was very impressed. Further meetings and conferences will have to take place until we see if we can solve this very difficult problem of trying to educate our young people in proper conditions and do away with this very serious backlog of insanitary and unhealthy schools.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible, too, that it might be cheaper to scrap some of these schools which we might have under consideration for an improvement scheme.  It might be more economical to do so and rebuild quickly.</P>
      <P>If I have left out anything, I shall read over these debates again and communicate with the Deputies in question about any problems or matters to which I have omitted to refer.

      <Col N="1860" /> Section 4 (2) of the Control of Imports Act, 1934, provides that any Quota Order made under the Act and any Order similarly made amending a Quota Order shall cease to have effect on the expiration of six months from the date on which it is made unless it is approved by each House of the Oireachtas by resolution passed before the expiration of the said six months. The Order to be confirmed is the Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic and Artificial Fabrics) (Amendment) Order, 1962.  The effect of the Order is to bring foam-backed material within the scope of the Quota Order No. 13.

      <P>Not much of it is sold at the present time.  At the time the Order was made, it appears that makers-up were being particularly attracted to it because it has all the qualities of a heavy cloth normally made by our woollen mills&mdash;heat but not weight.  A light woven textile attached to a foam-backed material would have the qualities of heat which a heavy woollen cloth would normally have.  There is evidence of makers-up being attracted to this type of cloth. It was considered necessary, on the representations of millers, to have this Order made so as to ensure the protection to the millers that was already given by Quota Order No. 13.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm Orders which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, relating to trade <Col N="1861" /> practices affecting the supply and distribution of motor spirit and motor vehicle lubricating oil.</P>
    <P>Deputies have already received copies of the Commission's report, but it may be helpful if I give here a summary of its contents.</P>
    <P>Petrol is distributed in this country by six wholesale companies, Esso, Irish Shell, Caltex, Shamrock, McMullan and Munster Simms.  The three first-named are the major distributors and supply over 80 per cent. of the market. They are subsidiaries of large outside organisations engaged in all phases of the petroleum industry.  These parent organisations jointly established, in 1959, the refinery at Whitegate which now produces the country's full requirements of motor spirit.</P>
    <P>Consumption of motor spirit rose from 60 million gallons in 1950 to 80 million gallons in 1959.  In that period the number of retail sites rose from 1,630 to 3,470.  This increase of 113 per cent. in the number of retail outlets compares with an increase over the same period of 73 per cent. in the number of motor vehicles and 45 per cent. in the sale of motor spirit by retailers.  It is significant that the average annual &ldquo;throughput&rdquo; of spirit per site fell from 30,000 gallons in 1950 to 20,000 in 1958.</P>
    <P>Up to 1950, the bulk of retail sales of motor spirit was through &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; sites, i.e. sites which sold the brands of more than one petrol company. Towards the end of that year, the formal exclusive dealing arrangement, commonly referred to as the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, was introduced, and was eventually adopted by all the petrol companies.  By 1959, 98 per cent. of retail outlets were operating on the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system.  Briefly, the principal feature of this system is that the retailer, in return for a monetary payment (known as the solus rebate), and other considerations, agrees to purchase from a particular company his full requirements of petrol for a specified period.  The rebate, of 3/8ths of a 1d. to 1/2d. per gallon of the retailer's total gallonage for the period covered by the agreement, is usually paid in advance.  The other considerations include loan facilities on favourable <Col N="1862" /> terms, aids to sales promotion, and free uniforms and training for staff. The earlier &ldquo;solus&rdquo; agreements were usually for one year, but more recently their duration has been extended to five, ten and sometimes twenty years.</P>
    <P>The six petrol companies distribute their own brands of motor vehicle lubricating oil.  In addition, there are four companies which specialise in lubricating oil.  The retail outlets are the same as for motor spirit, and the sales represent about 1 per cent. of total sales of petroleum products.  The &ldquo;solus&rdquo; agreements of the petrol companies also contained provisions imposing varying restrictions on sales by the retailer of motor oil supplied by competitors and in later years special agreements, operated in conjunction with special rebates, were made, the object of which was to encourage the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealer to purchase all or most of his requirements of lubricating oil from the company which supplied him with petrol.</P>
    <P>The majority of retail sites are owned by independent dealers.  Up to 1954, the petrol companies did not own or operate any such sites, but since then some of them began to acquire their own sites&mdash;mostly service or filling stations&mdash;and by 1959, 113 such sites which are normally leased to tenants, had been acquired.</P>
    <P>In 1958 the Fair Trade Commission received a request from the Irish Motor Traders' Association for the holding of an inquiry into the conditions operating in the supply and distribution of petrol and lubricating oil, and, having received observations and comments from interested parties, the Commission decided that it would be appropriate to hold a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>At the inquiry the Irish Motor Traders' Association, the only trade association which expressed an interest in matters affecting the retailing of motor spirit, stated that they had opposed the introduction of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system in 1951, but claimed that the manner in which the wholesale price of petrol had been manipulated had left traders with no option but to accept the system.  While not pressing for its abolition, they considered that a "solus" dealer should <Col N="1863" /> be free, on the expiration of his contract, to select the system of trading which he prefers; also, that the agreement should contain a "break" clause which would allow a dealer to terminate it on equitable terms.</P>
    <P>The Association also asserted that, following the introduction of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, the strenuous competition between the petrol companies for control of retail outlets had led to an uneconomic multiplicity of sites, with the result that, although the overall sales had increased substantially, there had been a significant drop in the average sales per outlet.  They objected also to the situation where independent retailers would be in competition with the company-operated sites, and called for the establishment of an independent licensing authority to regulate the growth of new retail outlets on the basis of public need.</P>
    <P>At the time of the inquiry, the major petrol companies pursued a vigorous policy of inducing "mixed site" dealers to change to the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; arrangements, but the small number of "mixed" dealers who had not accepted the new system continued to be supplied on a "mixed" basis.  New entrants, however, would be supplied only on a &ldquo;solus&rdquo; basis, and although a &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealer was free, at the termination of his agreement, to change to another supplier, it could only be on a &ldquo;solus&rdquo; basis, and supplies would be withheld if he wished to revert to &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; trading.  The minor companies, while they also followed the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; policy, would generally supply, on a "mixed" basis, both new entrants and persons who had formerly operated on a &ldquo;solus&rdquo; basis.</P>
    <P>The wholesale price of petrol is uniform, with, of course, the special rebate already mentioned as allowed to &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealers.  Price changes were usually initiated by one or other of the two largest companies, who notified all other companies in advance, and ascertained before announcing increases that the others would make a corresponding increase.  Price competition at retail level was discouraged, and the recommended retail prices were generally observed.  It was <Col N="1864" /> apparent from the evidence presented at the inquiry that, because variations in the price and quality of the product were insignificant, the competition between the petrol companies as wholesalers was limited to advertising and methods of distribution.</P>
    <P>In the supply of motor spirit to commercial users no exclusive dealing arrangements were practised, but prices quoted in reply to tenders from large commercial users were related to a common schedule, resulting in identical quotations from all the tendering companies.</P>
    <P>There were no uniform wholesale prices for lubricating oil at the time of the inquiry, and none of the distributing companies took steps to enforce recommended prices.  Retailers' profit margins varied between the various companies and grades.  Prior to the introduction of the "solus" system for motor spirit, the trading terms of all companies distributing lubricating oil provided only for quantity discounts, with deferred rebates on an equal scale for all traders.  As I have already mentioned, the petrol companies have introduced, sometimes in conjunction with their &ldquo;solus&rdquo; petrol agreements, supplementary agreements providing for exclusive dealing arrangements in lubricating oil.  The four specialist companies continued to trade on the old basis, and three of them complained at the enquiry that the lubricating oil arrangements of the petrol companies were unfair to them and contrary to the public interest.  Figures submitted to the Commission showed that those four specialist companies failed to maintain their proportion of a rising market in lubricating oil between 1951 and 1959, while the share enjoyed by the petrol companies rose from 63 per cent. to 72 per cent. in the same period.</P>
    <P>In their submissions at the inquiry, the main advantage claimed by the petrol companies for the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system was that it had achieved considerable savings in distribution costs which, in an inflationary period, enabled prices to the motorist to be kept at a lower level than would have been possible otherwise.  The major companies claimed that the retailer, <Col N="1865" /> too, found the system advantageous to him.  He benefited from the free training facilities provided for his staff; the advice and assistance afforded expanded his sales and increased the efficiency of his business, and all his requirements in equipment were available to him on hire-purchase terms which were much more favourable than those charged by finance houses.</P>
    <P>In their report, the Fair Trade Commission accepted that the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system has been a satisfactory method of distribution from the standpoint of the wholesaler, and that it lends itself to greater economies in distribution than the system of &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; trading. They pointed out, however, that it stimulated entry into the retail trade to an extent not justified by the rate at which the overall consumption of motor spirit was increasing.  The Commission expressed the opinion that the economic benefit of the system can be retained if its effect on entry can be damped down, and they recommended that incentives to new entrants in the form of advance payment or rebates or the giving of loans at less than commercial interest rates should be completely discontinued for the present.  Further, as regards company-owned stations, they recommended that any petrol company proposing to build or acquire new outlets should be required to notify the Commission in advance and furnish any information required by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission made a number of other recommendations designed to prevent unfairness in the operation of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system.  They recommended that the small number of dealers who are at present receiving supplies on a "mixed" basis should, unless they change to &ldquo;solus&rdquo; trading at any stage, continue to be supplied on a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; basis by their existing wholesalers.  At the earlier stages of the "solus" system, it was not made clear to dealers that they could not revert to &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; trading on the expiration of their agreements, and the Commission, therefore, recommended that any &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealer who had been supplied on a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; basis at any time in the period 1950 to 1956, and who wishes to return to that form of <Col N="1866" /> trading, should be enabled to do so on the next expiration of his &ldquo;solus&rdquo; agreement.</P>
    <P>The Commission considered that &ldquo;solus&rdquo; agreements of prolonged duration are unnecessary and undesirable in that they tend to produce a rigid division of the market between the companies, and, accordingly, they proposed that any future agreement providing for exclusive dealing in motor spirit should not exceed a period of five years and that any loan, mortgage or hire-purchase arrangements or agreements should not be linked in any way with provisions for exclusive dealings for longer than five years.</P>
    <P>While there is no suggestion that entry to the wholesale trade in motor spirit has been limited or controlled by collective arrangements, the Commission considered that a new wholesaler would find it more costly and difficult to obtain outlets under the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, and, accordingly, they recommended a prohibition on any concerted action by wholesalers to restrict entry or to eliminate unfairly a competing wholesaler.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Commission the system of prior consultation between the petrol companies on price changes is a form of price regulation and restraint on free competition in pricing, and should be prohibited.  So far as the supply of motor spirits to large-scale commercial users is concerned, the Commission took the view that tendering based on an arrangement or understanding between the petrol companies concerned frustrates the function which the system of tendering was devised to perform and should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>Apart from the rebate paid to &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealers, the Commission considered that there should not be any price discrimination between retailers, and they recommended accordingly. The Commission recommended also that the price differential between &ldquo;solus&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-solus&rdquo; retailers should be reasonable, and be justifiable having regard to the functions which the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; retailer is required to perform. The Commission proposed that <Col N="1867" /> the petrol companies should lodge their terms and conditions with them, so that this and other relevant matters can be kept under review.</P>
    <P>In 1954, the Fair Trade Commission made Fair Trading Rules relating to entry into the retail trade in motor spirit which prohibited suppliers from refusing supplies to any person who fulfilled the normal conditions required by the supplier as to payment, minimum purchases, etc.  These rules will not be necessary if effect is given to the Commission's recent recommendations and in that event the Commission propose to rescind them.</P>
    <P>As regards lubricating oil, the Commission were of the opinion that, if the companies which specialise in this commodity are to survive, they must have access to "solus" sites which now represent the vast majority of retail outlets.  They considered, therefore, that the supply of lubricating oil to retailers should be the subject of a separate arrangement not related to any arrangement for the supply of petrol.  The Commission expressed the view that special incentive rebates and other arrangements tend to limit the public in its choice of lubricating oil and are contrary to the public interest. The terms of sale should not provide for exclusive purchase, display or advertising.  All terms and conditions should be applied to all traders without discrimination and should be furnished to the Commission.  The Commission further recommended that a trader should not be refused supplies of motor spirit or lubricating oil solely because he is or is not a member of a trade association.</P>
    <P>The Commission finally recommended that collective fixing of prices or margins for lubricating oil and collective enforcement of resale prices for motor spirit or lubricating oil should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953 provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill now before the House is the Confirmation Bill which is necessary to give force of law to the two Orders concerned in this case.  I would like to mention at this stage that the second <Col N="1868" /> Order merely made a simple drafting amendment of the first Order and was designed to define, in a manner more in keeping with the Commission's recommendations, the types of trading agreements or arrangements which will continue to be permitted under Articles 12 (2) of the first Order.</P>
    <P>In the case of Confirmation Bills, the arrangement is that the Orders which it is proposed to confirm would not be capable of being amended by the House but would be accepted or rejected as they stand.  The matters dealt with in the Orders have been the subject of a detailed public enquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Orders are set out in the Commission's Report. I have no hesitation in commending to the House this Confirmation Bill which, on enactment, will, I hope, lead to improvements in the supply and distribution of motor spirit and lubricating oil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this Order will be as the Minister has stated.  To some extent, it will probably be a disappointment because when the inquiry was held some years ago, many people were under the impression that it might result in cheaper petrol.  Motoring is a very expensive business and this inquiry was probably looked on as necessary in order to get a full picture of the manner in which the sale and distribution of petrol and oil were carried on.  The effects of the activities of the Commission and of the Order do not appear to bring any immediate benefit to the public in the form of reduced prices for petrol.  The Order appears to be beneficial more by way of preventing abuses arising in the future than in remedying any existing abuses.  It will probably prevent, as between various wholesalers and retailers, the continuation of practices which were considered unfair in their operation, certainly so far as certain traders are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the remarkable developments which has been referred to by the Minister is the increase in the number of retail sites.  In less than ten years, the number of retail sites has <Col N="1869" /> gone up by more than 100 per cent:&mdash; in fact, by 113 per cent.  Over the same period, the number of vehicles has increased by about 73 per cent. and the sale of motor spirit by 45 per cent. The result has been that the through-put of petrol per site has dropped from 30,000 gallons in the same period to 20,000 gallons.  While in some of the newly built-up areas, there is a considerable case for new sites, it does seem to many that there is no great value in a lot of new sites, some of them in close proximity to existing sites, selling petrol at the same price as their competitors.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing about the petrol and oil trade is that, by and large, the prices are identical.  With a few exceptions, where there are occasional slight differences, there is a uniformity of price throughout whole districts and indeed largely throughout the country.  I hope this Bill will have the effect of avoiding or eliminating any abuses which may have existed and that we can look forward to some reduction in the price of petrol and oil.</P>
    <P>As I have said, motoring is a most expensive business.  The cost of petrol is high and the cost of repairs is considerable. In addition, people have to face continuous increases in insurance premiums.  If this Bill has the effect of preventing any unfair competition and provides a remedy against abuses arising, it will be welcomed, but there will be some disappointment that, although the inquiry proceeded for a considerable time and although the Commission produced a lengthy report, the effect on the consumer appears to be negligible, in fact, non-existent, so far as any reduction in price is concerned and the Bill is really for the purpose of preventing abuse in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this measure but it ought to be said in relation to it that the recommendations may appear to be disappointing for the ordinary motorist but I am afraid the Restrictive Trade Practices Act was not framed to do what Deputy Cosgrave thinks might be done for motorists throughout the <Col N="1870" /> country.  The recommendations will not provide for any direct price reduction. As a matter of fact, I do not think the motorists of this country can look forward to any reduction in the price of petrol in the immediate future judging by what signs there are, because, as the Commission has pointed out, there is in effect a ready-up on the price of petrol.  There is an artificial sort of competition between the petrol companies in this country and I suppose the position is no different in most countries in the world. As has been stated by the Minister, quoting some of the evidence given by the Motor Traders' Association, the only competition there appears to be amongst the petrol companies in this country is in advertising.  The five or six companies decide among themselves whether there will be an increase and, very seldom, if there will be a decrease.</P>
      <P>Of course, the only effective way to bring about a decrease in the price of petrol is for the Minister to exercise the functions he has under the Control of Prices Act.  That legislation is available to him whereby he can cause an inquiry to be held into the price of petrol and then decide whether or not the price is justified or whether any proposed increase is justified or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his predecessor, the Taoiseach, always led us to believe that free competition would provide for keener prices.  There is the freest competition there could be within the petrol industry and still the same price is charged by all the various companies. If you talk to a petrol man about this, he will give you all sorts of reasons but none of them will convince the ordinary motorist to whom motoring has become so very expensive in recent times.  There have been two or three increases in the price of car insurance.  There have been various increases in the price of petrol.  Even though there was a small reduction recently, the price of petrol has steadily risen.  Sometimes the petrol companies justify an increase by some extraordinary happening in the world, as they did during the time of the Suez crisis.  They increased the price of petrol <Col N="1871" /> by some pence but, when the Suez crisis was completely over and ceased to have any effect on petrol supplies, we did not get a reduction to the price prevailing before the price was increased when we were in the middle of what was then called the Suez crisis.</P>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;perhaps the Minister can explain to me and to the House &mdash;how the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission can be given effect to.  On page 6 of his speech, the Minister quotes the Fair Trade Commission as follows:</P>
    <P>In their report, the Fair Trade Commission accepted that the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system has been a satisfactory method of distribution from the standpoint of the wholesaler.</P>
    <P>All of us have an interest in the wholesaler in the petrol business, but we are also concerned, and primarily concerned, with the ordinary motorists and the ordinary business houses that have to buy the petrol.  The Fair Trade Commission seem to me to have made no comment as to how the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system operates as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>Tremendous efforts were made in the early 50's to sell the idea of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system.  All sorts of inducements were handed out not only to the petrol people but to the ordinary motorist.  He got free sponges and free dusters.  Men wearing fancy coats came around to him as soon as he appeared at a petrol station, and proceeded to wash everything but the face of the motorist.  As soon as the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system was established, all that service disappeared and there was a return to the old and the ordinary method whereby you got your petrol and paid for it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that whilst the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system may be fair and justified in the case of the wholesaler, it is certainly not so in respect of the unfortunate motorist who has to pay such a high price for his gallon of petrol.</P>
    <P>On page 7 of his speech, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Commission the system of prior consultation <Col N="1872" /> between the petrol companies on price changes is a form of price regulation and restraint on free competition in pricing, and should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>I believe it should be prohibited.  The Minister, I am sure, believes it should be prohibited.  The Fair Trade Commission believes it should be prohibited. Will this House, will the country, get any guarantee that it will be prohibited or are we to have a continuance of prior consultation between the six petrol companies who will fix the price of petrol, fix the increase or, if the occasion arises, fix what the decrease is to be?</P>
    <P>The Minister may not have ample powers to ensure that there will be no such ready-up between the petrol companies but, in any case, perhaps when he is replying, he will elaborate on what he has said in his opening speech.  I say that bearing in mind that he can depend only on the recommendations that were made to him by the Commission and on the powers he has under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.</P>
    <P>It may not be entirely relevant to this debate but I honestly believe that the only way to secure fair prices for petrol in this country is for the Minister to exercise the power he undoubtedly has to have a public inquiry into the price of petrol and to decide himself whether or not the price being charged is fair and equitable or whether or not any increase proposed is fair and equitable to the general public.</P>

      <P>In a business in a commodity like petrol that in less than a generation has multiplied its volume and sales by four, the laws of competion should operate and the price should become progressively lower. Of course, that will not happen in this instance.  There are too few hands in the first place and it is complicated by the fact that we are distributing such vast amounts of petrol by too few hands.  Deputy Corish used the expression that the next thing these filling stations will be doing is wiping the motorists' faces.  Whatever is being done for the consumers, I do not think <Col N="1873" /> there is very much danger of that happening.</P>
      <P>Because of the competition between these big distributing groups, this great growth of places for the sale of petrol in this country has taken place, a growth which is completely out of proportion to our needs.  The approaches to our towns and cities, and, indeed, even the middle of the country, are cluttered up with these very large service stations, most of which are not in good architectural taste, being raw and garish, but apart from that, there are far too many of them and somebody has to pay for them&mdash;inevitably the consumer, of course.  These big distributors changed a situation here whereby the distributors of petrol were free to handle any spirit they liked, and the purpose of measures such as the one we are now discussing is to weaken that.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the small retailer of petrol became less and less a free individual and became more and more just an agent and part of the machinery of the big distributing firms.  There was a strong element of danger in that situation.  It had no benefits for the public.  In their insensate seeking after turnover, these great petrol companies were able to squeeze out the small wholesalers, the smaller distributors of petrol, and give them a smaller piece of the market.  The great amount of advertising being done by these big firms seems to be a fantasy almost, because even in earlier years, as we know now, they were all dealing in the same product.</P>
      <P>Of course, again somebody had to pay for the fantastic advertising.  The situation contained all the evil parts of the capitalist system.  I approve of the capitalist system but with checks. This thing was too big and it got out of hand, the results being what we are now trying to set right.  In Britain I understand there is a cut price war going on among the petrol companies so that you can buy petrol in one station a few pence cheaper than in another.  That obviously cannot take place here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another from of distribution with which I am associated, the retail grocery trade, the headache the operators <Col N="1874" /> have to combat is the growth of the supermarket whereby these great stores can distribute goods to the public at cheaper prices than the smaller people.  I should like to see that system getting into the picture in the petrol trade even if housewives had to carry the petrol home in tins.</P>
    <P>This whole business of distributing petrol is a closed borough.  The gate is being somewhat opened by what we are doing this evening but I should like to see fewer of those great stations in this country.  If the Minister has the figures on what the capital investment of these groups in this country has been I should be glad to get them from him.  I feel sure the figures in respect of investment in these petrol stations is frightening having regard to the size of the country and the number of motorists in it.  Although I doubt it very much, I hope this measure will be of some benefit to the motorists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that if the public expect from this enquiry an immediate reduction in the price of petrol, they will be disappointed, but I do not think the public seriously expect the enquiry would have that result.  Its purpose was to stop what appears to be an abuse arising in the trade, and while it may not have an immediate effect on prices, in the long run, it is likely to have if we examine what the position was in 1951 when less than half the number of sites had a much greater through-put, as they call it, than they have now.  That indicates that double the number of sites have a much smaller through-put per site. Therefore, there must be a higher cost of distribution involved in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission observed&mdash;and the evidence was there for them&mdash;that the "solus" system proved to be an economical means of distribution and, therefore, that the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system should have had the effect of reducing somewhat the price of petrol.  However, unfortunately, by reason of there being so many outlets, the favourable trends were offset by the unfavourable.  In other words, there were too many &ldquo;solus&rdquo; sites and they are selling less and less quantities of petrol, thereby offsetting the <Col N="1875" /> economies that the system would have otherwise provided.  Therefore, if this enquiry and the Order, made in consequence of the enquiry, will not have an immediate effect on prices, I submit it is bound to have an effect in the long run.</P>
    <P>In some sense we now will have control over the number of sites acquired by the petrol companies who, therefore, will tend to have a more economical system of distribution. Speaking of the number of sites, and the architectural criticism levelled at them by Deputy Barry, I agree to a large extent with what he has said in respect to the structures.  I would suggest that, instead of putting up garish structures, these companies would have regard not only to the sale of petrol and lubricating oil but also to the convenience of the public. There are far too many of these petrol retail sites which have beautifully painted exteriors but in which the motorist cannot get the benefit of an ordinary convenience.  I have travelled somewhat extensively on the Continent and I can say that Irish petrol sites compare very unfavourably with what the Continent has to offer in this respect.  That is one suggestion I should like to make to the petrol companies, over and above what was discussed at the Fair Trade Commission or what is contained in the Order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish quoted the view of the Fair Trade Commission, as stated in the report, that the solus system had been a satisfactory method of distribution from the standpoint of the wholesalers. He stopped at that.  I do not believe he intended to mislead the House in any way, but, in fairness to the petrol companies, the Commission went on to say that it lends itself to greater economies in distribution than the system of mixed trading.  As I said, however, the multiplicity of sites tended to offset these economies.  That is one trend we are trying to stop here today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also stated that the Commission had expressed the view that prior consultation between the petrol companies about prices should <Col N="1876" /> be prohibited but seemed to suggest that they did not go on to do anything about it.  In fact, they did.  Every expression of opinion of what should happen or of what practices should be discontinued is reflected in the Articles of the Order this measure seeks to enact.</P>

      <P>Article 12 of the Order we propose to enact states that wholesalers "shall not enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or do any act, that has the effect of providing for or facilitating, or is designed or intended to provide for or facilitate" the fixing or regulation in common of prices or discounts or notifying another wholesaler of an alteration or proposed alteration in the price of motor spirit.  Prior consultation, either formally or informally, will now be made illegal.  There are in the parent Act, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, pretty hefty penalties to ensure that the terms of the Order are carried out.  I might mention the penalties provided for in Section 14 of the parent Act: on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £500 and £50 for every day on which the offence is continued, and, on conviction on indictment, a fine of £5,000 and £500 for every day of a continuing offence.</P>

      <P>I do not expect it will happen immediately but by curbing the number of outlets, we hope that the greater economies we are told the solus system makes for will be reflected in the price of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the main points raised. The inquiry revealed that hitherto, as has been stated, the petrol companies placed greater emphasis on competition for outlets than on prices, but the Commission's recommendations provide for a check on intensive competition for outlets and the promotion of <Col N="1877" /> price competition by providing for the elimination of the collective arrangements I have referred to.  The prime cost factors in the price of petrol are, unfortunately, determined outside this country.  The distribution expenses and profits over which the Irish companies have control are relatively small and do not provide for a very wide field of major price changes. However, it is hoped that the long-term results of the legislation we now propose to enact will be, first of all, to deter an increase in outlets and, as a result of that deterrent, that ultimately this economic method of distribution, the solus system, will have its effect on prices to some extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dundalk Gas Order, 1962, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 6th June, 1962, under subsection (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dundalk Gas Company is a statutory company set up under a private Act of 1887 and is not subject to the ordinary provisions of company law.  Any alterations in the statutory provisions relating to the company have to be effected by means of a Special Order under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which enables me to grant additional powers to the company.  Before the Order is made it has to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft Order in <Col N="1878" /> the form submitted or may approve it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given I may make the Order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
    <P>The Dundalk Gas Company has applied to me for a Special Order. Notice of the proposed Order was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and a local newspaper.  Copies of the draft Order were sent to the local authorities in Dundalk and other public bodies who might be concerned.  No objections to the proposed Order were received.</P>
    <P>The object of the Order is to bring the Dundalk Gas Company into line with the other gas undertakings in the country.  Its main provisions are to authorise the capitalisation of undistributed profits of the company by way of bonus shares so as to bring the capital of the company more into line with its capital investment; to enable the company to deal in other fuels such as liquid petroleum gas so as to improve its competitive position and to remove existing restrictions on the appointment of officials of the company as directors of the company.  The other provisions of the Order consist of a number of minor amendments in the legislation under which the company operates.</P>
    <P>Gas undertakings no longer enjoy the monopoly position they had at one time and they now have to meet stiff competition from other types of fuel. It is desirable therefore that outmoded restrictions should be removed.  If the company were a non-statutory company, the changes being effected by the Order could be made in the normal way in its memorandum and articles of association under the Companies Acts.  I am satisfied as to the need for this Order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I therefore recommend the Order for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the existing <Col N="1879" /> statutory powers of guarantee vested in the Minister for Finance in respect of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be already aware that there is provision in existing legislation covering the borrowing of moneys for capital purposes by CIE and the guaranteeing of such borrowings by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (2) of Section 30 of the Transport Act, 1950, the Minister for Finance is empowered to guarantee the repayment as to principal and interest of moneys borrowed by CIE under the provisions of that Act.  Guarantees under subsection (2) of Section 30 of the Act relate to guarantees of borrowing for long-term capital requirements.  CIE may also borrow for short-term requirements and the Minister for Finance is empowered also under subsection (1) of Section 30 of the same Act to guarantee such borrowings.  The maximum amounts which the Minister for Finance may guarantee have been amended by the Transport Act, 1955, and the GNR Act, 1958.  Under those Acts the upper limits of borrowing by CIE which might be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance were raised to £12m. for long-term and £1½m. for short-term borrowings.</P>
      <P>The present Bill is intended to serve a purpose rather different from the existing statutory provisions governing guarantees by the Minister for Finance.  The existing provisions empower the Minister for Finance to give guarantees only in respect of borrowings. The present Bill is designed to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee, in addition to borrowings, the payment by CIE of moneys due by the Board on foot of contracts entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE had received an attractive offer of extended payments at favourable terms for the purchase of new diesel locomotives.  The terms of contract provided for payment in instalments over a period of five years, with interest at the rate of 5½ per cent. per annum on the balance outstanding subject to a Government guarantee. As the law stood, the statutory powers <Col N="1880" /> of the Minister for Finance did not enable him to give a guarantee in the terms required.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the Government that acceptance of favourable credit terms such as were offered in this case should not be prejudiced by the absence of a statutory power enabling the Minister for Finance to give the required guarantee when the Minister for Finance is, in fact, already empowered to give a guarantee in respect of borrowings.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory limit for borrowing for long-term purposes by CIE has been reached by the recent £2m. stock issue and it is not intended to propose a new upper limit for such capital borrowing by CIE until the position of the whole organisation comes to be reviewed towards the expiry of the five-year trial period provided for in the Transport Act, 1958.  In any event, it was desired to accept the particularly favourable extended credit terms which were obtainable in the present case.  A payment scheme of this kind amounts, in fact, to a pay-as-you-earn scheme which is a wholesome arrangement for an organisation faced, as CIE is, with the obligation to pay its way.</P>
    <P>While the Bill gives general powers of guarantee in order to cover possible future cases of a similar type, it also makes specific reference to guaranteeing the payment of instalments specified in the contract already referred to.  The reason for the taking of power to give this specific guarantee is to implement an undertaking given by the Government to CIE that power would, in fact, be sought from the Oireachtas to guarantee this specific contract.  It was necessary to give such undertaking in order that CIE could enter into the contract and thus secure the early delivery of the locomotives which they require.  I should say, of course, that the Government were fully satisfied that C.I.E.'s decision to acquire the locomotives is commercially sound. These locomotives are indeed essential for the maintenance of an effcient railway system even if the system has to be on a somewhat smaller scale than at present.  The locomotives will, in addition, enable CIE to achieve substantial <Col N="1881" /> economies in operation and thus help the Board to achieve its statutory obligation to pay its way.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of C.I.E. to dispense with all steam traction.  The number of diesel engines that will be in commission when the 37 new engines have been delivered relates to the maintenance of the main arterial rail renewals.</P>
    <P>The position here is similar to that in other countries.  Railways provide an economic satisfactory service for long haul fast passenger traffic when the trains do not have too frequent stops, and for certain types of long haul goods traffic.  They also fill a need in certain suburban areas while the arterial services are able to deal satisfactorily with special peak traffics and with the influx of tourists during the holiday period.</P>
    <P>The order for these diesel engines indicates the confidence that a main line railway system has an important part to play in the public transport section of our economy.  Much will depend on the growth of productivity within the system and on definite agreements between management and staff that an intelligent attitude will be taken on the question of increases in costs in relation to productivity.</P>
    <P>In view of the interest which many Deputies have expressed in the future policy of CIE, I have asked Dr. Andrews to send a copy of his recent address to the Institute of Public Administration to each member of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum is substantial, and in his remarks introducing the Bill the Minister seemed to be somewhat inadequate in that I would have imagined he would have taken the occasion to say to us that, in ordering this machinery for which the House is supposed to provide the necessary guarantee, he could give us a specific assurance that competitive tenders were sought and that the most advantageous tender was accepted.</P>
      <P>So far as I can learn from the Minister's statement, we have no information of what preliminary precautions were taken to ensure that the best possible bargain was made. When one is spending 6,000,000 dollars of public money and inviting the Oireachtas to under-write the transaction, I think it is not a desirable procedure to tell us: &ldquo;We have made a contract which gives us long term credit with General Motors to buy 6,000,000 dollars worth of equipment for this enterprise from them&rdquo;, without going on to say: &ldquo;And this agreement was made after tenders had been sought from a variety of firms equipped to provide this kind of equipment and when those tenders had been fully considered it was determined that what General Motors had to offer us was the cheapest and the best.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome any expansion of Irish-American trade but I am not blind to the fact that the great bulk of our exports go to Great Britain.  May I assume that manufacturers of like equipment in Great Britain and elsewhere were afforded an opportunity of tendering for this equipment?  I gather from the Minister's nod of assent that that is so, but he might with advantage have said that to us in asking us to consent to a guarantee of this size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably this proposal for the dieselisation of our railway system is the proper policy to pursue, bearing in mind that I can remember the time in this House when from the Fianna Fáil benches it used to be loudly and acrimoniously proclaimed, when we commenced this dieselisation process, that we were selling the country into <Col N="1883" /> the servitude of foreign fuel.  In the past, the view of Fianna Fáil used to be that we should not operate any form of transport in this country that could not, in the last analysis, be operated by domestic fuel.  We are now passing right away from that concept to the point where the internal transport system of the country will be based entirely and exclusively, both as to road and rail transport, on imported oil.  That is a new departure and it is an interesting departure.  It is worthy of note.</P>
    <P>I believe the dieselisation of our railway system is inevitable and, accordingly, on the assumption that with these peculiar observations, the Minister will give us specific assurances on tenders, where they have been had from other sources, and the tenders it is now proposed to accept and guarantee that this offer is the best, we will not oppose this Bill.  But I think, Sir, due to the fact that this is another transport Bill which is providing for Córas Iompair Éireann a further amenity to assist it in its operations, it is not irrelvant to ask at this stage: where are we going?</P>
    <P>We began this whole programme of transport legislation on the proposition first, that Córas Iompair Éireann should have a monopoly of transport on the basis that Córas Iompair Éireann was a common carrier in the technical sense of that term: that is to say, it had a statutory obligation to accept any traffic tendered to it and to carry it to its desired destination; secondly, that Córas Iompair Éireann had a statutory obligation not to provide differential rates; that is to say, if they made a specific rate for anybody, that rate was to be accessible to everybody else; and, thirdly, that Córas Iompair Éireann continue to have the responsibility of providing adequate transport in a form acceptable to the people in every part of the country.  That was the original basis of all our transport legislation conferring a monopoly on Córas Iompair Éireann, providing annual grants to help them to meet their costs and guaranteeing to meet their deficiencies, whatever they might be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1884" /> Then came the 1958 Act and under that Act we started on an entirely new basis because we abolished the obligation of common carrier.  We withdrew from Oireachtas Éireann its discretion to determine what the obligation of Córas Iompair Éireann to provide adequate transport of an acceptable kind in every part of the country should be and we acknowledged and sanctioned the right of Córas Iompair Éireann to provide exceptional rates for individuals on foot of <i>ad hoc</i> bargains that might from time to time be made without any corresponding obligation to make these rates available to competitors.</P>
    <P>I think the question now arises, when we are asked to provide for Córas Iompair Éireann any substantial guarantee of the kind submitted to us today: should Córas Iompair Éireann, in addition to all these advantages we have bestowed upon them in the 1958 Act, continue to enjoy the monopoly? They are not now labouring under any of the old obligations a transport authority used to have.  Why should we continue to prescribe that there should be no competition in the field of transport?</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to a very remarkable fact. Under the general scheme of monopoly existing, we have also perennially provided certain private transport contractors with the right to operate limited transport facilities and these right have been associated with the issue of a plate which is associated with a particular vehicle; anyone operating a plated vehicle is entitled to operate transport within a circumscribed area or sometimes within the whole of Ireland.  Within recent times, these plates have become the subject of commercial transaction; they have been sold by one licensee who is retiring from the business to another and when the market value of these plates falls to be determined by the ordinary process of commercial competition, you find sums of over £1,000 and even far greater sums being paid for a plate. That suggests that the right to engage in limited transport operations is a very valuable one.  I have heard it suggested that sums of between £5,000 and £10,000 have been paid for a plate. <Col N="1885" /> Now, observe what this means: it means that the people of the country are paying for transport rates which make it worth a man's while to pay between £5,000 and £10,000 for the chance of getting into the business. Now that we have relieved Córas Iompair Éireann of all the old burdensome obligations they used to have and have left them to operate in an industry where any entrant is prepared to pay between £5,000 and £10,000 for the chance of participating with one vehicle, is there not a very strong argument for saying that the business should be thrown open to free competition and that anybody who wants to engage in business as a transport contractor should be free to do so?  What is the justification for the continuation of a monopoly?</P>
    <P>I could understand it if Córas Iompair Éireann had said: &ldquo;Well, we admit we have asked to be delivered from our obligations as common carriers; we admit we have asked to be freed from the obligation of giving preferential rates to everybody if we give them to anybody; but we have retained the obligation, which we continue to discharge, of operating a number of branch lines throughout the country, branch lines which are uneconomic, and if our monopoly position is to be ended, one of the consequences must be that these branch lines will have to go.  So long as you want to keep them, you must leave us the monopoly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we are told by the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann that he is not in a position to maintain the branch lines any longer and that he proposes to do away with all the branch lines in due course.  He is quite prepared now, unlike the previous occasion, to discuss the matter with local interests, but he gives a clear indication in advance that, unless much more influential arguments than he can possibly conceive at present, are advanced, the company proposes to close all the branch lines in Ireland.  Now if Córas Iompair Éireann is no longer a common carrier, if it no longer is obliged to give everyone the same rate, if it no longer intends to operate <Col N="1886" /> branch lines, what is the justification for its retaining the transport monopoly? I should be glad to hear from the Minister his answer to that proposition on this occasion when we are asked to provide a State guarantee for a six million dollars purchase of new equipment for this enterprise.</P>
    <P>How different this proposal would be if the Minister had come in and said that he proposed to throw the transport industry open to free competition in order to put what is the national transport authority in a position to compete with allcomers and in order to do that we want to start a new career as a company operating such a free enterprise and to equip them with the best possible rolling stock which money can buy and that, therefore, we are asking Dáil Éireann to guarantee 6 million dollars which is necessary to get the best rolling stock.  Having got that, we could then compete with allcomers and let the best man win.</P>
    <P>Does the House not think we ought to be told the reason why the transport authority is not prepared to compete if it is operating in a business in which people are prepared to pay £5,000 or £10,000 for an opportunity to operate one vehicle?  I think that is a matter that the Minister ought to deal with and explain because I do not understand it with the information at my disposal.  People are too readily prepared to forget that transport costs are as truly costs of the agricultural industry and every other branch of business activity in the country as raw materials are the cost of the manufacturer. We all read in the paper a couple days ago of the indignation and alarm created in the livestock industry by an announcement on the part of cross-Channel companies of their intention to increase their costs by 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the effect on transport charges inside this country would be if transport was made subject to free competition but I do know that all the livestock that travels from this country to Great Britain travels on Córas Iompair Éireann transport at the present time, or at least the greater bulk of it.  Córas Iompair Éireann is <Col N="1887" /> in a position to make its own charge on every head of that livestock free of competition from any alternative service.  Conscious of that fact and conscious of the fact that the total cost of transporting all the livestock of this country, not to speak of the cost of conveying feeding stuffs for the stock through the country, not to speak of the cost of moving wheat and beet and other products of the agricultural community, forms the income of CIE, I cannot help asking myself how far that burden of cost would be relieved if this industry was open to competition, when one remembers that under present conditions individuals are prepared to pay £5,000 and £10,000 for the right to operate one vehicle in the transport industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us face this fact&mdash; I mentioned a figure of £1,000 for a plate of limited value.  You referred to the figure of £5,000 and £10,000 for plates with a right to travel over the whole country.  Every vehicle of CIE can operate all over Ireland.  There is no restriction on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But as the Minister himself says only a microscopic number of them have the advantage of operating over the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are all competing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be very few entrants into the industry if it was as competitive as the Minister seems to believe.  The only information I have is with regard to the plates that can operate all over the country and my information is that up to £10,000 has <Col N="1888" /> been paid for them and that there are very few of them.  I was a member of a Government which sustained Córas Iompair Éireann as a transport monopoly.  I was Minister for Agriculture in that Government and I was very conscious of the burden on the agricultural industry because at that time Córas Iompair Éireann were in a position to say that unless they had a monopoly large areas would be left without transport which they were providing at a loss.</P>
      <P>At that time one was prepared to say that was the price to be paid for having at our disposal a transport authority that did not quote differential rates and that provided rail facilities where otherwise they would not exist.  That is no longer true.  Now we have not got any of those things but we still appear to have the costs. On the occasion when we are now being asked to guarantee the cost of the most modern rolling stock that money can buy, will the Minister tell us what is the justification for maintaining this transport monopoly any longer?</P>
      <P>The Minister will find more and more people are beginning to ask why should there not be free competition in this business and why should anybody who believes he can give as good or a better service not be permitted to compete instead of confining it to a relatively select company, some of whose transport plates are worth £1,000 and a very few of whose plates, corresponding closely to the rates enjoyed by the transport company, can be sold for £10,000 to hardheaded men who consider they are good value at that price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not object to helping the transport authority of this country to buy the best equipment on the assumption that the Minister is in a position to guarantee to us that this is the best equipment but we have a duty, representing not only the transport industry but every other section of the community as well, to raise the question and to expect an explicit answer from the Minister as to why under the new conditions the monopoly that used to be justified by the obligation of the common carrier to provide equal rates for all and to maintain <Col N="1889" /> uneconomic branch lines in existence, should continue to exist when the monopoly is no longer a common carrier but charges differential rates and has announced its intention of closing all the branch lines in the country.  That is a reasonable request to make of the Minister for Transport and Power on this occasion and we would expect an answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Labour Party in connection with transport is well known and there is no need for me to dwell upon that.  Under all circumstances we are in favour of a national transport system, and if we had not to consider this Bill against the background of some of the misfortunes that seem to be creeping in through the instrumentality of CIE, with the full co-operation of the Minister, then this Bill would sound very good, its purpose being to purchase 37 new diesel locomotives from General Motors of America.</P>
      <P>The Minister asks us to agree with him that everyone in this country be a party to guaranteeing the payment of over six million dollars for these locomotives.  These locomotives will bring the total number of CIE diesel units up to 269, including 93 rail cars. As a genuine improvement of our transport system this proposal should be welcome but to me the tragedy behind it is that in the board of CIE we have a body of autocrats and a Minister who apparently assumes he knows all about transport and that nobody else knows anything about it. This proposal is made at a time when the dictatorial policy of the board of CIE is leading to the closing of further branch lines although it was stated in this Chamber by the Minister that the closing of the branch lines in West Cork and other places was to be the final act of the curtailment of rail services in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many members of this House as well as many people outside have disagreed with the Minister's policy in connection with the closing down of the West Cork and the Waterford-Tramore railway lines.  Nevertheless, the Minister decided that, with the autocratic powers which he insists the <Col N="1890" /> Chairman and the members of the board of CIE must have, the members of this House are to be treated in the same manner as the general public and that CIE may do what they like in connection with transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is sheltering himself as the chairman of CIE sheltered himself in the publication of this recent statement on the closing down of more branch lines. From where did that statement come? What consideration was given to the people in those areas before it was decided that those areas would be denied rail services?  This proposal to provide additional locomotives would normally be regarded, as we of the Labour Party would wish it to be, as a help to the people in rural Ireland as well as to such cities as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there not a touch of irony in the provision under Section 3 whereby the Minister can ask CIE to give him security for repayment, security at a time when they are closing down, one by one, every branch line in the country, when they are coming to the stage when we shall have, perhaps, only a few main railway lines in the country?  Are we depending on the security of those lines and the profit that is to be made by CIE from those lines for the guarantee that is being sought?  The Minister knows that CIE, through its board of management, found it convenient, at a time when they have closed down railway lines in West Cork and other places, at a time when they are persisting in closing down further lines, to tender for the catering at Cork Airport.  Is CIE to be the transport service for the people or is it now considered that the best we can expect from CIE. is to have it go into the market as a catering <Col N="1891" /> establishment and seek contracts from our air service?</P>
    <P>It is absolutely useless for us to argue such matters here so long as the present Minister holds the position he does in connection with transport and power.  I am not taking from him the fact that he is a person of ability. I am convinced he is availing of his position and his intellectual powers not to help the community, not to help CIE on to the right road to provide rural Ireland with a transport system essential for the well-being and economy of the country.  I am convinced he is insisting on adopting an attitude which ultimately will bare rural areas of all forms of transport.</P>
    <P>We know the attitude of CIE.  We were told that, in the closing down of West Cork and other lines, we did not have to worry as we would get an alternative service.  Yet, strange, we find, in relation to any request we ever made to CIE for an improvement in the bus services and the freight services in different areas, that CIE are very quick to come along with a convenient excuse.  I would not wish at this stage to go into individual items except one line and Cork Deputies, at least, will be able to bear me out in what I say.</P>
    <P>Some few years ago we asked CIE to provide us with a bus service for the people in an area beyond Kinsale, in Sandycove area.  We were told they were prepared to give a service once a week there provided the county council would bring the road up to proper condition.  That was done.  Of course, CIE had no intention whatsoever of co-operating in giving a service in that area, any more than they have in relation to the many areas in the Cork district about which I have from time to time made inquiries.</P>
    <P>We are now guaranteeing CIE this money which they will hand over to an American firm&mdash;for what?  It is true it is supposed to be for up-to-date locomotives which, normally, we would desire and which we in the Labour Party believe are essential to build up a proper transport service.  On the other hand, while that is being done&mdash; providing this money&mdash;we are confronted <Col N="1892" /> with the position of knowing that most, if not all, of our branch lines will disappear.  Many a Deputy who was not affected last year when we were fighting in connection with West Cork&mdash;even a member of the Government Party&mdash;now knows that in his own locality the branch line will be a thing of the past.  That policy in my opinion will be the ruination of the CIE transport service.  That policy will be the ruination of that service. The Chairman and the members of the board know that they have the full support of the present Minister for Transport and Power in adopting a completely dictatorial attitude in their dealings with the public.  We have to provide this money: it is essential. However, the Minister must understand that the day will come yet when some other member will take over office in the Department of Transport and Power.  There is many a good man in Fianna Fáil who could handle it and who may not be prepared to adopt the attitude of the present Minister.  So long as this Minister is there he will, in relation to transport and power, damn Fianna Fáil and damn every Party in this Chamber and damn the people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I shall not damn anyone when I am speaking. This door labelled CIE, is closed all the year round.  We cannot open it except on an occasion like this when those behind it open it and ask for money.  Then we can get a foot inside the door and talk about what goes on inside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is quite right that the affairs of CIE should not be discussed in this House.  I think CIE should stand on its own legs and that the intentions of the House in the past were the proper intentions.  Sometimes when there are proposals that are wider than commercial proposals, or what I would call balance sheet proposals, I think we could take a quiet look at them and wonder if the train we are on is going in the right direction.  Maybe it is one of those mystery tours and that we are not quite sure where we shall arrive. Therefore, I should like to make some brief and general observations on policy.  Of course, it refers to the <Col N="1893" /> recent speech of the Chairman of CIE.</P>
    <P>Dr. Andrews is not an autocrat, I am sure, by instinct or make-up but this House has made him one.  They have given him power and imposed on him a very difficult task.  Of all the 144 Deputies in this House who have spoken on this matter in the past&mdash;men who have come and gone from here&mdash; very few of them would have exchanged with Dr. Andrews the job we gave him to make a railway in a rather depopulated country in the year of our Lord 1962 run as a solvent concern.</P>
    <P>If I were Dr. Andrews and the House gave me that job I should do exactly as he has done.  I should close down the branch lines.  I should lop off the losers and keep the winners and the ones that remain in balance.  In that way, I should probably get somewhere towards doing what this House asked me to do when the Transport Bill was before the House, namely, to make the whole balance sheet come into balance.</P>
    <P>However, I am not Dr. Andrews and no one of us here is.  I think we have to look at a slightly more diffuse and general picture.  We have to regard what is happening and what Dr. Andrews has promised he will try to bring about.  We have to regard, from the community point of view, whether the kind of balance sheet Dr. Andrews must obey is the sensible balance sheet for the Irish community.</P>
    <P>The general picture is this.  Take the large section of railway line which was taken up in West Cork.  It was losing so much money every year that it was a relief of some kind to the CIE balance sheet to cease operating there.  It was also a relief of a curious kind to that balance sheet in another way, to which I would ask the Minister to refer when replying.  I have in mind how the assets were used and used even from an accountancy point of view.  But, from the community point of view, roads had to be provided, built, widened, strengthened.  Bridges had to be constructed. Changes had to be or will have to be made in the small towns that now take the transport that used to travel on rails.</P>
    <P>Take even the city of Cork.  The imposition of this freight and big vehicles <Col N="1894" /> in the city streets has created its own problems.  There is the question of the provision of vehicles alone.  These things must be added together.  I do not think anybody tried to do so, but we should.  If this House is sensible, we should start looking at the wider picture.  We should wonder if, in the long run, a citizen is any better off because a red figure in the balance sheet has become a red figure on a wider balance sheet and whether he, as a ratepayer and taxpayer, has not to pay the same or maybe a bigger amount.  It is only by looking at the wider basis that it makes sense.</P>
    <P>Looking at it from Dr. Andrew's point of view, I say quite honestly that if I were he, I should do what he is doing now.  Whether it is wise from the point of view of the community to do it, whether it is wise that all this expenditure should be incurred, that all this traffic should be thrown on to road networks that are not always competent to carry it, whether it is wise that all these valuable assets should be dissipated, even if they make an impact of a curious kind on current balance sheets, whether the direct disemployment that results is worth it all, whether the ultimate bill will be greater or lesser, and whether the ultimate service will be better or worse, are all matters that must be considered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent proposals, I will ask only one question of the Minister.  For many Sundays of the summer season, as many as 4,000 people are carried to the town of Youghal from the city of Cork.  How is it proposed to carry them in the future or how will the economy of Youghal survive, if they are not carried there?  There is a wider balance sheet than just the CIE balance sheet.  We would be wise to look at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important Bill in so far as it is an important amendment of the 1958 Transport Act and it is introduced at an important time in the light of transport services generally in the country.  Its main shortcoming is, of course, that it is such a limited amendment.  It is one of the odd anomalies of political life here that the most conservative amongst us in public life should be put in charge of a semi-State monopoly like CIE.  It is not surprising that we should get from someone so completely hostile to the type of operation he is put in to supervise and control such a complete misunderstanding of the proper functions of a public company like CIE.  According to the statement made by the Minister for Transport and Power, he has virtually no power at all.  He seems to want to run CIE as if it were a private joint stock company whose affairs and operations are so secret and confidential that they should not be made known to the general public except in the broadest general terms.</P>
      <P>I, as everybody knows, am one who advocates public ownership in virtually every sector of our economy.  Consequently, I deeply regret the fact that we have an organisation, such as transport, controlled by a semi-State company, developing over the years such an undesirable reputation for callous indifference to the needs of the people.  I deeply regret that it should give a bad name to the whole idea of public ownership.  It does not surprise me that the Minister is not concerned in this aspect of policy, but it is regrettable because people tend to judge the whole idea of public ownership by the results they see in CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> I do not think we should delay long with the tentative suggestion put forward by Deputy Dillon with regard to private enterprise and the desirability of giving more control of transport to private enterprise.  Whatever defects there may be in CIE, they are clearly remedial.  There is, too, the advantage that even with a consevative Minister like the present Minister for Transport and Power, we are at least allowed to discuss the relevant matters here.  That is an advantage we have as compared with the predecessors of CIE&mdash;the GNR and the GSR&mdash;in whose operations or affairs we had no say.  Because of that, we could not at any time apply any kind of corrective.</P>
    <P>The situation is not quite so bad here.  It is four years since the 1958 Act was passed and in those four years, we have had an opportunity of watching its operation.  The minor change proposed here will not achieve the objective the Minister put forward. I am prepared to wager with the Minister that the company will not break even by 1964 and the country still have a transport service in operation. It is a fact that in many countries transport services are run at a loss. That is something that it is difficult for some people to accept, but it is quite reasonable that a transport service in certain circumstances should be run at a loss in much the same way, as, say, a hospital, a fire brigade, or any other essential public service is run at a loss. That is essential in order to establish and retain the particular kind of social fabric we have in our society.</P>

If, as a result of that, people decide not to live in West Cork, one gets a gradual drift from rural Ireland, with people tending to move in to the more populated areas.  In that way, a very undesirable trend is manifested in the social pattern of our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Minister is amending this very important 1958 Act and is giving us to believe that this is important, first of all, in consideration that CIE will pay its way by 1964, and in postulating that he assumes that it is essential and desirable that it should pay its way by 1964.  What I want to suggest to the Minister is that a very much bigger amendment is needed.  He has seen the operation of the 1958 Act and he <Col N="1898" /> has seen what has happened because of the inclusion in that Act of subsection (2) of Section 7, that this company must pay its way by 1964.  I am reminding him of the repercussions of that and I am suggesting to him that in asking for this money and using as one of his arguments that it will help us to break even by 1964, he is concerning himself with something which is not of major importance.</P>
      <P>In the past four years, we have seen the operation of this provision in the Act and we have seen a development whereby fares have risen astronomically and there has been widespread redundancy.  Admittedly, it was compensated redundancy but there was widespread redundancy.  There has been the closing down of many branch railway lines and it is proposed to close down other branch railway lines.  We have seen many services restricted and the repercussions have been so widespread and so serious that the Minister should reconsider the whole question of extending the provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>If he wants these engines, if he thinks they are the right thing mechanically, that is quite another question.  Whether he should commit himself to this insistence that CIE should pay its way by 1964 is the point on which I would like to take issue.  We can honestly say that there was never greater dissatisfaction with the activities of the company.  The relations between the workers and the management are, as far as we can see, constantly on the boil and on the edge of explosion.  We have had the experience of having a national transport strike nearly precipitated by this one-man bus question &mdash;the argument again in favour of the idea that the company must pay its way by 1964.  The whole picture over the years since 1958 has been that the company is not moving in that direction at all.  It is misleading to the Dáil to come here and say that this latest proposal is the key to the problem and that if we have these 37 diesel electric locomotives, it will be possible to achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the proposals made here, the Minister has treated the House on a number of occasions with <Col N="1899" /> complete contempt on the question of providing information.  From time to time, I have asked him questions about these very locomotives and he refused to give me any information, adopting the most astonishing attitude that the management of CIE had made a particular decision and this decision could not be questioned or should not be questioned.  In fact, they sent out a purchasing commission to General Motors in America; they bought a number of locomotives at considerable cost and when they got these to Ireland, it was found they were not suitable for the railways&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a debate about the purchase of these locomotives which I am talking about.  I am questioning the advisability of paying six million dollars for these locomotives because apparently when we got them here, the purchasing commission was found to have made a very serious blunder.  They had spent a lot of money buying locomotives which could only be driven safely in one direction.  In fact, the insistence on continuing to drive the locomotives other than in one direction lead on one occasion to the possibility of an accident involving two men on a bogey who were not seen until the last moment and who nearly lost their lives. Later, indeed, a man lost a leg and an arm.  It is possible for everybody to make a mistake.  I do not think people at that level should make a mistake&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having asked questions in the House about these locomotives, the Minister adopted the attitude that we should not question the decisions of CIE and that these people were above criticism.  That seems to be the complete antithesis of the correct approach to the operation of a public company.  We are sent here by the public who have put a lot of money into these various concerns and we have a right to come in and say to the Minister: &ldquo;Are you spending it properly?  Are you getting value for our money?  It is not your money but our money and if you are not getting value for our money, something should be done about it.&rdquo;  The attitude of the Minister is that having made this colossal blunder, having come back here with these engines which can only be safely driven in one direction, the Minister closes down and acts on the instructions of whoever it is in CIE who wants to cover up the blunder and refuses to give us any information.</P>
      <P>The Minister then says he proposes to buy more of these locomotives.  It is clear from the specifications of these new locomotives that the charges I made were valid and sound charges which the Minister should have investigated, charges which should not have had to be raised by a private Deputy. The Minister should have had whoever was responsible on the carpet.  He should have asked who are these people?  Are they still in CIE?  Were they disciplined for making this great blunder in the expenditure of public money?  He should not have covered up for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has only himself to blame if there is any doubt <Col N="1901" /> about the usability of these locomotives. When he came in and told us in regard to these 37 new locomotives purchased from the same company that it is intended that they shall be what he called bigger or heavier, he did not disclose at that time that they were bigger and heavier, simply by virtue of the fact that they had a second observation car attached.  The impression he created here at Question Time was that the specifications had been altered in some other very important way.  In fact, the specifications were hardly altered at all, except for the addition of this second observation cabin, and in that way increasing the safety margin in the operation of these locomotives.  Why could not the Minister come in and say that? Why could he not admit: &ldquo;Yes, we made an error in the first instance but we are putting it right&rdquo;?  Instead, he gave the impression here that they were buying single cab and double cab locomotives just because they felt like it; that it was just a whim or a fancy; that they liked having the single and double ones.  He must see that the double cabins are safer on the railways for one reason and another and he must admit that in not disclosing that these people had made a blunder in the first instance he was betraying his responsibility to the public.  In that way it seems to me that he is completely undermining the confidence of the public in the company.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties that, I suppose, we have all found here when asking the Minister for Transport and Power for information is that he will not give any, that he will say: &ldquo;It is not my job or not my responsibility&rdquo; or &ldquo;I cannot give the information&rdquo;.  One or other formula is put forward by the Civil Service for him to read out and he reads it out.  If that is so, it must be most unsatisfactory for the Minister to be in a Department in which he has little or no influence.  It seems to me a bit high-handed for the Minister to come into the House and ask for six million dollars for the purchase of one kind of locomotive and not to give us information that we ask for in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various people who provide <Col N="1902" /> these locomotives.  The Germans have one; the British have one; the French have one and the Americans, of course.  I put down a number of questions for the Minister and they were ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  So, then, I went to the Chairman of CIE and asked him questions similar to the questions I put down here.  These were questions which would add to our information here and help us to make up our minds on the case put forward by the Minister that these were a desirable buy.  I asked if they would help in the getting of a financially viable transport service by 1964, and I asked Dr. Andrews to answer certain questions concerning the managerial to executive type of staff in CIE when he took over in 1959 and at present: the amount of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour in 1959 and at present; the companies asked to tender for supply of the diesel-electric locomotives; when tenders were put forward, how many replies were received and when were General Motors informed that their tender was accepted; the total number of diesel-electric locomotives at present in use; the expectation of life of each type of these locomotives in the use of CIE when purchased; their actual life of use under CIE conditions; the total mileage handled by CIE locomotives of each type in each year since 1955 to the most recent date; the amount allowed for depreciation in respect of diesel-electric locomotives in each year since purchase; the percentage rate of steam to diesel-electric locomotion in each year from 1955 to the most recent date and then the intended proportion of diesel-electric locomotives when the whole process of dieselisation of steam locomotion is completed and then the significant changes, if any, in the specifications put forward to General Motors when asking for the supply of the new diesel-electric locomotives.</P>
    <P>I think all of those are reasonably pointed questions or useful questions, which would be of help to this House if they were answered.  I could not get any answers from the Minister on these points and, strange to relate, the head of CIE, Dr. Andrews, wrote back and said he would not answer me either. <Col N="1903" /> So, we are now in the situation that we are asked for six million dollars worth of money and the public are not going to be given this basic information upon which they could make up their minds whether their six million dollars will be properly spent or not. Remember, the public have and must have in the back of their minds the fact that the last purchasing commission came back with a number of engines which when put into use were found to be seriously defective.  Now we are not told in the Minister's speech nor are we told in reply to Parliamentary Questions nor will we be told in reply to letters sent to the head of CIE.  We are not going to be given the simplest fundamental information which anybody would require before advancing money on this scale.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that the Minister tried to raise this money in other ways.  It is quite clear that when he tried to get money from the public the money was not forthcoming, that most of it had to be taken up by the insurance companies, that the Government guaranteed the rest and a very little amount came from CIE.  The financial rating of CIE is extremely low.  The Minister does not seem to be aware of that fact.  He comes in here and asks for six million dollars on the trite invocation that it will be all right by 1964 if we have 37 more of these diesel-electric locomotives, so hand out the six million dollars.  Either the Minister does not have any regard for the standards of intelligence or understanding of this House or else he could not care less what they think; he is going to use a steamrolled majority to get his six million dollars and he is not concerned with what reaction the public may have in regard to it.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I should like to say that there is nothing in the Second Reading speech which suggests that if we pass this Bill, there will be a guarantee that CIE will be a paying organisation by 1964. It requires a great deal more than the purchase of diesel engines to ensure that.  Deputies may not have had an opportunity of hearing my speech.  I <Col N="1904" /> should not like to have the debate continue on the basis that there is any guarantee of the profitability of CIE and its paying its way on just these purchases.  Of course, a lot more is required.</P>

      <P>This is being used as a very important attraction to the public to subscribe six million dollars. But the public should be given information about the operation of these diesel-electric locomotives.  It should be explained to them why it is believed this diesel-electric locomotive is better than, say, the Vickers Armstrong or the French locomotives, all of which are readily available.  Why can we not be given some information about the question of tendering?  Could we not be told what firms asked to be allowed to tender?  Were these firms given the specification or was the specification given solely to General Motors, and if so, why?  Were the tenders offered only to one company and if so, why?</P>
      <P>The Minister must understand this is a very serious thing to do.  It is permissible but there should be an explanation for it.  Were these other companies told that, if they gave us the benefits of this curious and rather undignified proposal from a State Department that we buy engines on the never-never system, they would be considered?  Were these other companies told that if they gave us these conditions of purchase, we would consider buying 37 diesel-electric locomotives from them or was this offered solely to General Motors in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when fares have been increasing so considerably, when there has been widespread redundancy, when there is great management-worker conflict, <Col N="1905" /> when there are very defective services from the passengers' viewpoint and when they are becoming worse, it is a bit hard for the public to be suddenly presented with a bill for six million dollars, on the assurance that this is going to help us realise our target of breaking even in 1964. It is quite obvious that all our transport services are inadequate, that there is need for democratic changes following the serious alteration in our transport services.  There is the fact that people in rural areas, in the backward areas one might say, feel themselves being more and more isolated.  There is no attempt to help them to continue to stay in rural Ireland.  That is a serious thing for a country which is primarily agricultural.</P>
    <P>Particularly in the West of Ireland, the fares are outrageous for people with small incomes.  Take the fare from Galway to Spiddal as an example. It is beyond the pockets of most of the people who live there.  It all adds up to a persuasion to the people: &ldquo;You can get out; you must get out&rdquo;.  That follows the basic example of the suggestion that the transport services must at all costs be made to pay.  Rail services are being curtailed and it has been said that satisfactory bus services are being provided as an alternative. That will have very serious repercussions on road transport because of the fact that there is not, at the same time as the curtailment of rail transport, an integrated road building policy.</P>
    <P>If one is to throw more and more public transport on to the roads, it is imperative that a very widespread road building programme be commenced. We all know what a very serious financial commitment that is, since it is nowadays so expensive to build roads. I understand a mile of proper road costs in the region of £1,000,000.  It is conceivable that this whole approach to public transport, which so far has been so bad, will add further to road chaos generally and that it will force even greater gatherings of people in built up areas since it will make it so much more difficult for people to live outside cities.  We may try to restrict that growth in the heart of our cities <Col N="1906" /> by advising the people to live in the suburbs, but once we get them there, we increase their fares and they find it is more expensive to live outside than inside our cities which will consequently get bigger and bigger.</P>

I am not suggesting we should run our transport services at a loss for the fun of the thing.  I am saying they should be run primarily as a social amenity, an essential public amenity in order to facilitate people in rural Ireland, to make it possible for them to stay in rural Ireland instead of driving them out of it as we are doing at the moment.  That could be done by amending the Bill at subsection (2) of Section 7.  I should like to know from the Minister the type of locomotive he is proposing to buy, the way in which it differs from the existing diesel-electric locomotive, how many companies were asked to tender&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There was vast publicity some days ago of the fact that practically the whole of <Col N="1907" /> County Cork is now being wiped out as far as rail transport is concerned.

I want to know from the Minister whether these diesels are convertible for road transport now that the railway lines are being wiped out.  That is the only use I can see for this equipment for which we are asked to pay six million dollars.  If, apart from the Dublin to Cork line, all the other lines are to be wiped out, I do not believe in paying 6,000,000 dollars for special engines for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I have come in late on this, just like the CIE trains.  I would like to know the performance of these diesel engines with regard to the simple matter of hauling trains on time.  I have seldom travelled from Kingsbridge to Waterford without finding the train late.  I have gone to meet people coming up at Kingsbridge and I have seldom found the train not late.  I had to listen to Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde tell me last week that he was late for Dáil Éireann because the train had broken down. Since we went over to diesel engines I am constantly hearing of trains breaking down.  I seldom heard of trains breaking down when we were hauling them by steam locomotives built in Inchicore by Irish craftsmen.  The type of engines I am speaking about are the great engines built for the American mail.  I am not talking about &ldquo;Are you right there, Michael&rdquo; mentioned by some Fianna Fáil Deputy over there.  I am very serious about this because it is a very serious business and is costing us six million dollars. I have already expressed my views about the policy of Dr. Andrews and CIE.  This policy of dieselisation is once more a question of rushing into it.  It has been said that the diesels have proved themselves more economical on long runs.  This is a small country.  Maybe they got their figures from the United States where there are thousands of miles from coast to coast.  The longest run here is from Cork to Dublin.</P>

      <P>You may bet they are because they are shipping the people out.  I do not know how much one of these diesel engines costs.  Whatever they cost, the whole lot will be starting more than six million dollars &ldquo;in the <Col N="1909" /> red&rdquo;.  I should like the Minister to tell us what is the life of a diesel engine.  People may even mock at these great locomotives built at Inchicore, but they will not mock when the time for adding up comes.  These engines ran for years.  They did not require one-fiftieth of the maintenance the diesels require.  They hauled their trains on time.  The trains running between Dublin and Waterford and Dublin and Cork were always on time. They were on time for years.  The people would be made if the train was only a minute or two late.  Now the people are used to CIE delivering them at their destinations a half-hour or an hour late.  You go to the station and you are told that the train is running 25 or 30 minutes late.  That happens, and not necessarily in holiday time. When the train comes in you discover, even in holiday time, that it is only half-full of people.  Yet it is an hour or a half an hour late despite these highly priced locomotives.</P>
      <P>My information is that these locomotives cost an enormous amount to maintain.  They need a highly technical staff to act as nursemaids to them.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating, they say, and we can see the constant number of breakdowns. We just rushed off into this.  Somebody came across and sold us on the idea.  Everybody else was getting diesels and we would have to get them, too.  Perhaps, if they were tried out on the main lines and the fuel consumption per mile measured, it might work out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I think appealed to the so-called experts in CIE was the fact that there was a fireman on the old-fashioned locomotive and he could be got rid of or declared redundant, and passed off with the small pension which CIE were able to pass off on some of their fine servants.  His wages were put down as a saving, and no one said that these engines might cost £80,000 or £90,000.  No one said they are as reliable as the old engines, and no one mentioned that they are foreign articles, made in foreign workshops. It was the policy for years of various Governments that if a good enough article could be made in <Col N="1910" /> Ireland, by Irishmen, it would get a preference.  Great craftsmen and great fitters in Inchicore were dispensed with and pushed out when it shut down.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Burke had better stick to the <i>bona fide</i> publicans in North Dublin and leave the engines to me.  I asked the Minister a question about a railway that was once in existence in my constituency but is no longer there.  The Minister brushed me aside and would not tell me about the service he is running there now.  We are sent here from the various constituencies and we have the right to question the Minister.  I have read this <i>pronunciamento</i> that the diesel engines are the best on the long runs.  The longest run seems to be Dublin to Cork.  I have seen no convincing figures in regard to weight of fuel per mile and so on.  I have never got the costings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you have a turbine steam engine, let it be oil or coal driven, can it be shown that that engine is less efficient than a diesel engine, or that the diesed engine is the more efficient? Is it a fact that the diesel engine has a reputation for running to time?  Did the Minister's advisers &mdash;if he has anything to do with it&mdash;or did Dr. Andrews' advisers tell Dr. Andrews that the steam engines were costing too much to maintain? Did the steam engine cost too much to manufacture in the first place?  Could the Minister tell us how much wage <Col N="1912" /> content there is in the building of a steam engine?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us the average life of a diesel engine?  Will he tell us what is the average cost of maintenance of a diesel engine per year over five years?  Will he tell us the average cost of maintenance of a compound steam locomotive per year over five years?  Will he assure the House that as the responsible Minister for fuel and power, he will reply to Parliamentary Questions about the railways?  Will he tell us that if he is asked the costings of a certain CIE operation, if it is a reasonable question, he will get that information from CIE for the House. I am not satisfied when I ask the Minister certain questions to be brushed off and told to go to CIE or have them write to me.</P>
    <P>I am drawing the attention of the House to some of the ramifications of CIE.  These people gave favourable credit terms.  With the exception of dealings with the State in the matter of houses &mdash; people buying houses in Ireland will get favourable terms from the Government and there is no catch in it&mdash;when a firm, any big firm, without giving a competitive tender offers favourable credit terms to CIE and when CIE buy these diesels, then I think there is a bit of a smell and a bit of high pressure salesmanship there. Maybe what CIE are actually doing is falling for the favourable credit terms and not maybe buying the best engine.</P>
    <P>The Minister said&mdash;I have it here at last &mdash; that railways provide an economic satisfactory service for long-haul fast passenger traffic when the trains do not have too frequent stops and for certain types of long-haul goods traffic.  All right.  I agree with the Minister on that but on how many lines have we got long hauls?  We cannot fool ourselves.  We cannot compare ourselves with the Union Pacific Railway which has runs of 500 and 600 miles between stops.  We should take a pull at ourselves before any of the six million dollars goes down the spout for this.  These 37 new engines have been delivered and it is the intention of CIE to dispense with all steam traction.  The Minister should have a care.</P>
    <P>I have even something for Deputy <Col N="1913" /> Burke, too, who seems to be always on Ministers' right or left hands when they are in difficulties.  I have the word of working railwaymen who have had to work the trains that the steam engine is the best engine for short runs and for slow runs where they have to stop at every station, shunt and make up their train, especially a goods train.  Why scrap perfectly good engines to take on expensive diesels and maintain them? The only thing the Minister can prove to me here is that they give so many miles to the gallon and dispense with the wages of a fireman.  I was at a dinner a few years ago and I was in horror listening to a pompous gentleman telling us about the wonders of these engines, especially when he came to gloat over the fact that a fireman would be no longer necessary.  I do not know for how much we are stuck. These engines may be bought on these favourable credit terms and we have to put up the money but I say to the Minister as the Bill is going through the House and CIE are getting their six million dollars to buy diesels, that when Deputies come in here to ask about running the diesel engines, running the trains the diesel engines draw and the profit or loss the trains make, then I hope the Minister will be prepared to answer us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to hear the Minister confirm what the chairman of CIE has indicated, especially when he states in his introductory speech that the system may be operated on a somewhat smaller scale than at present because it was intimated by the Minister and by those responsible in CIE that the effect of closing the West Cork, the West Clare and the Waterford lines would be sufficient to save the whole system from the financial embarrassment that then presented itself.  It is at least welcome that in the present circumstances the Chairman of CIE has condescended to invite consultations with the interested parties in those areas now scheduled for closure.  That is something which was denied to the people in the constituency I represent at the time when the West Cork railways were removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that those interested who will <Col N="1914" /> be given this opportunity which was denied to very strong interests who sought an opportunity of making representations at that time will avail of it effectively.  If, however, they get assurances from the Chairman of CIE that they will be provided with alternative services at rates comparable with those they enjoyed from the railways, I would ask them to insist on a firm undertaking because that was indicated before in the region where railways have been removed and freight charges have been increased alarmingly. Road freight charges compared with the terms available for rail deliveries have increased to the point that firms which gave their entire business to rail freight have now purchased fleets of their own to provide their own transport because, in their opinion, it would not be economical to pay the huge increases in road freight charges for which they have been billed.  I can provide documentary evidence if anybody is in doubt about these drastic increases.  These increases, may I say, have had again to be transferred to the shoulders of the ordinary consumer. The firms involved were not in a position to carry the additional impost of the increased charges and it was the ordinary man and woman purchasing goods over the counter in retail shops in the area who were obliged to pay for the increased charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was designed to provide additional moneys to purchase locomotives to operate, the Minister says, in a system on a somewhat smaller scale than at present and I want to avail of the opportunity to appeal to the Minister to permit these locomotives to operate on the part of the line which has not yet been ripped up in my area.  So far, the lines have been removed west of Bandon, but they are still intact between Cork and Bandon.  There are ideal opportunities for storage and for the distribution of goods from Bandon terminus.  I appeal to the Minister to retain that portion, at least, of what <Col N="1915" /> we regard as the main line.  The Minister said that, in his opinion, rail activities in CIE should be confined to main lines.  If he accepts my plea, that would in some way abate the displeasure and dissatisfaction in regard to passenger movement and the transport of goods in areas affected by rail closure.</P>
      <P>The company for which this money is being voted are abandoning practically every obligation on them to operate services, except those that are obviously financially attractive.  I believe the time has come to liberalise transport and allow some competition. The first essential is to remove the straitjacket which confines licensed hauliers to the precise areas defined 20 odd years ago.  CIE cannot cater for many new transport demands and that leads to a very heavy impact on the cost of the agricultural industry. There is, for example, a charge of 30/-per hour for waiting, when a wheel does not turn, in relation to the transport of livestock at cattle marts. Remember, dealings are protracted over many hours and that has a very serious effect on those who avail of Córas Iompair Éireann services.</P>

      <P>I regret if I have deviated from the actual matter to be discussed.  I was not present when Deputies were reminded that certain details could not be discussed but, unless I avail of this opportunity to make this last appeal to the Minister to permit the engines he proposes to operate to operate on that section of the line still intact between Cork and Bandon, then I am afraid that, because of the rapidity with which the lines are being ripped up, by the time another opportunity presents itself, we will have no mile of line left in the whole of that area.  It is in those circumstances I have availed of this opportunity to make that appeal to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With some exceptions, Deputies have, I think, received this Bill fairly well.  A number of questions were asked about the value of diesel traction.  A good many statements in general terms were made about this by my predecessor.  After allowing for all expenses it is estimated that a modern diesel engine yields a return of five per cent. on the capital invested.  All transport administrations in Europe have, generally speaking, come to the conclusions that diesel traction and electric traction are far more economical than steam traction. The experience of CIE has been that it costs roughly three times as much to run a steam engine as it costs to run a diesel engine.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that he recognised the necessity for the change over to diesel traction when he, with his colleagues in Government, was responsible for transport policy.  I can assure Deputy Lynch that he need have no fears in regard to this matter.  Whether it is short haul or long haul, the steam engine has had its day.  Moreover, the existing stock of steam engines have reached the natural end of their careers.  Most of them are not worth while repairing in the kind of fundamental way which would be necessary if they were to continue to be used.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch referred to some of the unsatisfactory experiences he has had in regard to train punctuality.  It is true that CIE have had some unsatisfactory experience with some of their diesel engines from the point of view of breakdowns.  I am told that they have been making a tremendous effort to make quite sure that all their diesel engines will operate satisfactorily. The General Motors diesels that were purchased, and which are the subject of this Bill, are, I am told, operating very satisfactorily and fulfilling their specification.  That is one of the reasons that lead CIE to purchase a second group of diesel engines of the same type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that CIE gave an opportunity to eight different firms to tender for this last contract and their selection was based on the type of locomotive which, for its price, would be the most satisfactory for this <Col N="1917" /> country.  I do not think I need say anything more than what I have already said in reply to questions about the cab forward and cab rear diesel engines.  The engines that are now operating, which for purposes other than shunting have to be reversed, are working entirely satisfactorily.  With their turn around at the end of their journey, they operate economically.  I do not think there is anything more to be said on that subject.</P>
    <P>I was asked what the life of these diesel engines is reckoned to be.  It is very hard to get a precise figure because this particular type of engine has not been very long in existence. Certain types have been operating for longer periods, but the smaller diesel engine used for rail purposes has not been operating very long.  However, CIE reckons one can count on 20 years for depreciation of the engines and 40 years for depreciation of the chassis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry asked whether these new engines could be used on the roads.  I think he already knows the answer.</P>
    <P>The only general matter of an important character outside the scope of the debate was that raised with, I think, complete validity by Deputy Dillon.  He said we were now going to advance the large sum of six million dollars for these locomotives and that I should say a few words about the extent to which CIE has a monopoly of transport and the bearing of that on its future operations in relation to State policy towards transport.  I want to make it absolutely clear that CIE face enormous and continuous competition from nearly 81,000 vehicles of all descriptions.  Its rail services are reckoned to carry only about three per cent. of the country's total traffic. Indeed, that figure was estimated before these recent lines were closed. They have, too, to compete with traffic which avoids double handling. When one examines the different types of traffic it will be seen immediately that double handling for many types of traffic is absolutely out, no matter how efficient the handling may be. CIE will have to compete for that kind of traffic which can be moved from the premises of the company or <Col N="1918" /> the individual by a vehicle on to the rail, and moved again a second time when it reaches the end of its journey. The fact is that CIE have certain monopolistic privileges has to be measured against that first and irrevocable form of competition that CIE face both in relation to their rail passenger services and the carriage of goods.</P>
    <P>Although it may be true, as Deputy Dillon suggested, that licensed carriers can sell their licences for a good price on occasion, a great many of the licensed carriers do not observe in the same strict way the conditions of employment that are provided by CIE. Their overheads are inevitably less. Many of them operate family concerns and, above all, they are not obliged to run regular services from one place to another.  As long as there is any purpose in having a public transport company, one of its obvious obligations is that it should, in addition to running special services whenever these are convenient or proper, run regular services, either by road or by rail.  That constitutes a perpetual overhead expense so that there is no comparison between outside concerns and CIE which runs road freight services some of which may be profitable but the profit from which has to be used to cover in many cases either actual losses or profit that would not really pay the full cost of the transaction in the case of the regular services around the country.  This has been discussed a great many times in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How can you have a profit that does not pay the full cost of the transaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant was there might appear to be a book profit but if you apply the overhead costs of the whole system in a fair proportion to a particular service there would be no profit.  I do not think I need say anything more about that.  Competition with CIE is growing apace.  If the numbers of private cars increase at the rate they are at present increasing they will very nearly be doubled in ten years and in that time there will be one car for every ten people in the country.  CIE has to face all <Col N="1919" /> that competition and I do not think it can be said it is in a monopolistic position in the sense that Deputy Dillon suggested.  It has certain privileges and certain rights but it has to face the most ferocious competition from all sides.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any point in my going over the ground that was covered at very considerable length on the subject of the closing of branch lines in the course of the special debate that took place here on the report of the last accounts of CIE Few Deputies have raised the matter in any controversial way.  Most people know the facts already.  The only point I should like to make to the House is that since I last spoke in very great detail on the subject, I have not simply waited for the next group of railway lines to be examined.  I have studied the matter still further and I have had the opportunity at a recent international conference of speaking at some considerable length with the directors-general of no less than six European railways and have compared my experience with theirs.  I have also read reports of railway administrations throughout Europe and I find it is generally accepted in the modern world that railways will be confined to certain purposes and to certain types of traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing that interested me was that at this conference where practically every person had a personal, selfish vested interest in preserving every single mile of railway on his particular line, they all felt and expressed the view publicly that in order to advance the general cause of railway administration, in order to ensure that the railway system should be efficient and in order to attract the right kind of people into its service, the purpose of a railway must be re-defined, as it has been here.  There is, therefore, very little difference of view as a whole among those who are responsible for railway administration.  In fact, some of the heads of the railways said things to me that were most disquieting, such as the head of one railway who said that in the future railways will have to be entirely concerned with high speed <Col N="1920" /> express traffic.  I think he was exaggerating when he spoke in that way but nevertheless he was a person of very great experience.</P>
    <P>I also had an opportunity at this conference of collecting data and the circumstances in which railways close in other countries.  It is rather hard to get these facts unless you meet the people who are preparing reports of railway administrations in general.  I found, for example, that the French Government in its wisdom has allowed some 8,000 miles of railways to be closed for passenger services in the last few years and some 1,360 miles to be closed for goods purposes, and that they have a standard there which is much harsher from the standpoint of the railway lover than that adopted here when they make their first decision to close a railway.  Their standard is that if there are less than 350 passengers per day counting over the whole system it is no longer an economic railway and should be replaced by a road service.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need stress all the facts again because Deputies will realise they can always discuss CIE policy in general at the time of the Estimate.  They can if they wish at a later stage have a special debate on the annual report in accordance with the suggestion made by the Taoiseach some two years ago.  Because of that I think the question of the future of CIE was not raised significantly. We are half-way through the period of operation of the present Act, that the whole question of the future of CIE will again be examined by the Government and that further proposals for legislation will be placed before the House.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should deal with one more question which I think is a fair question to ask: why is it that the Ceann Comhairle does not permit many questions of a very detailed character to be answered on the running of State companies?  I should like to remind the House that at the end of the discussions on last year's Estimate I made a detailed statement on what I regarded the work of my Department to be in its relation to the Dáil and nobody <Col N="1921" /> since then has questioned what I said. Apparently people did not bother to read it but I did make an effort to adumbrate and expand to some degree on another much more important statement made by the Taoiseach on an earlier occasion when he was speaking &mdash;I think I am right in saying&mdash;to the Institute of Public Administration on the general relations of State companies to the Dáil and to the Ministers concerned. It is a highly controversial subject on which one could talk for hours but I think it is true to say that quite as many socialists as conservatives consider it important to allow these State companies a good deal of freedom in their operation.</P>
    <P>If perpetual Dáil questions were to be continually asked on the revenue and expenditure of every single branch of every single State concern, it would be impossible for the companies to get on with their work.  There would ensue a kind of lobbying in respect of individual areas and a making use of information which, by itself, might not give a really accurate picture of the position because it would be far too limited in scope.  It would not relate to the whole set of facts required in relation to the complete operation of the company.  The result would be that it would be impossible for State companies to operate efficiently.  I think most people in the House understand them.</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny, in connection with previous debates that we have had on rail closings, that I gave a sufficient amount of information on the whole subject.  Therefore, it should not be said by any Deputy that the operation was being carried out under a sort of cloak of darkness so that no one knew what was happening and no one had any idea, except from the general statement of CIE, what particular line was losing money.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can be accused of refusing to give that type of general information.  Some of the questions asked by Deputy Dr. Browne &mdash; and which were turned down by the Chair &mdash;first of all, of me; and, secondly, of Dr. Andrews, would, if we were to answer a whole collection of questions of that kind, mean that we should <Col N="1922" /> literally have to set up a board in this House to run CIE.  It would be quite impossible to allow companies to proceed with their day-to-day business if they were to be inquisitioned in matters of the utmost detail in relation to their operations.</P>
    <P>I do have conferences with the chairmen and boards of these companies.  I discuss a great many matters with them.  I discuss their annual reports. When there are repetitive complaints of any kind, I deal with them.  Nevertheless, we must observe some reasonable balance in relation to the extent to which a State company should operate freely and without interference from day-to-day in its affairs.  I do not pretend to be perfect myself in this regard.</P>
    <P>If this kind of perpetual inquisition were to take place, I am perfectly certain that one of the results would be, in the case of any Government, the beginning of real political interference, in the worst sense, with the operation of the Company.  There would be pressure groups working their way for some specific purpose. Then political discrimination would enter automatically into their operation, which all of us would deplore. That is my answer to Deputy Dr. Browne.  There are plenty of socialist-minded people who think it is very important, nevertheless, to allow companies to have a great degree of independence in relation to the sorts of matters raised by Deputy Dr. Browne.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) to authorise the increase to £135 million of the existing statutory limit of £120 million on capital expenditure which the Electricity Supply Board may incur for general purposes, that is to say exclusive of capital expenditure <Col N="1923" /> on the electrification of rural areas.</P>
    <P>(2) To authorise the increase to £37 million of the present statutory limit of £32 million on the expenditure which the Board may incur on the electrification of rural areas.</P>
    <P>(3) To provide statutory authority for the payment of increased subsidy for rural electrification.</P>
    <P>The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1961, authorised the ESB to incur capital expenditure for general purposes up to a total of £120 million, that is, an increase of £20 million on the then existing statutory limit of £100 million.  The Board's generating plant programme announced early in 1960 was based on an estimated rate of growth in the demand for electricity of 7 per cent. per annum and provided for the raising of the Board's generating capacity to 1,148 megawatts by 1968/69.  The Board subsequently found it necessary to accelerate this programme because of the continued increase in the rate of growth in demand for electricity.  The rate of increase over the previous year during each of the last three years was as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The present total installed generating capacity of the Board is 723.5 megawatts; this includes 90 megawatts of old plant at the Pigeon House now available only for stand-by purposes and the four small turf fired stations on the western seaboard representing 20 megawatts. Under the revised programme, total capacity would be increased to 1,109.5 megawatts by 1966/67.  The decision to accelerate the generating plant programme was dictated by the need to avoid power cuts, particularly for industrial uses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board recently reported to me that on the assumption of an estimated annual growth of at least 8 per <Col N="1924" /> cent. in the demand for electricity over the next five years, and taking account of plant retirals in the meantime, it will be necessary to provide further new generating capacity in 1967/68 in addition to the capacity in the programme already approved.  The Board propose to provide a coal/oil station of two 60 megawatt sets in the Waterford region, the first to be commissioned in the Autumn of 1967 and the second in the Summer of 1968. The target, for 1968 is, therefore, now raised to 1229.5 megawatts excluding retirals.  As it takes over five years from the time of the decision to build before a generating station can be commissioned it will be necessary for the Board to enter into commitments for the Waterford station in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Board's expenditure and commitments for general capital purposes to 31st March, 1962, amounted to £119 million.  The Board's capital expenditure for general purposes at that date amounted to about £84 million and work in progress or work approved represented about £35 million. The addition of the projected new station at Waterford, estimated to cost £7.8 million, to the Board's existing programme would, therefore, raise the total of their approvals above the statutory limit of £120 million on capital expenditure for general purposes. In addition, over the next two years it will be necessary for the Board to authorise capital expenditure on transmission and distribution systems and on buildings to the extent of about £7 million.  The Bill, therefore, provides for the raising to £135 million of the existing statutory limit of £120 million on the Board's capital expenditure for general purposes which on the basis of present estimates should be sufficient to cover expenditure likely to be authorised during the next two years or so.</P>
    <P>The installed capacity for hydroelectric plant at 31st March, 1962, was 219 megawatts.  All the important rivers have now been harnessed for electricity generation.  While the development of other rivers would in present circumstances be uneconomic, <Col N="1925" /> the Board are continuing to collect data and investigate other rivers with a view to possible development later for hydro-generation.</P>
    <P>The Board's generating programme provides for the absorption by 1968 of the annual output of all the bogs which are at present considered economically usuable for the generation of electricity. This will mean an increase of 202.5 megawatts on the Board's existing peat-fired generating capacity of 205 megawatts.  The programme provides that coal/oil-fired stations will be sandwiched between peat-fired stations so as to ensure maintenance of electricity supply in a year in which weather conditions would be very adverse for either peat or hydro-generation of electricity or both.  To ensure continuity of bog development and employment by Bord na Móna, the coal/oil stations will be used only to the extent that hydro and peat generation will be insufficient to meet demand.</P>
    <P>The investigation into the possibility of utilising deposits of low grade semi-bituminous coal at Arigna in an additional electricity generating unit is still in progress.  It has been established that there are sufficient reserves of lower ash content coal but before any decision could be taken in this matter it must be first established that the coal can be extracted economically on a regular basis over the life of a new station.  The necessary investigations are still proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Board experienced a record peak load in January this year when to meet a load of 606 megawatts the Board had in operation 40 out of the 44 generating sets in their system.  Two of the remaining four sets were out for overhaul and two small sets, one each at the North Wall and Poulaphuca were standing by leaving the Board with just enough capacity in reserve to cover breakdown of the largest single generating unit in their system, which is 30 megawatts.  The system peak load of 606 megawatts experienced in January last, compared with peaks of 540 megawatts in December, 1960, and 476 megawatts in January, 1960.  The addition of the 40 megawatt Bellacorick station to the system later this <Col N="1926" /> year should help the Board to meet the peak loads next winter.</P>
    <P>From the end of the present decade onwards, the contribution made to electricity supply by native resources is bound to grow proportionately less. The Electricity Supply Board are keeping in touch with the work being done in various parts of the world in the application of nuclear energy to the production of electricity.  It is clear so far that conventional fuels are cheaper than nuclear power for electricity generation.  A nuclear station would not be commissioned in this country until the base load has increased to a point where a nuclear station of the minimum economic size could be given continuous night running of reasonable magnitude together with full load day operations.  It is not expected that this stage will be reached in this country for at least ten years and even then the choice of a nuclear station as against the conventional thermal station will still depend on the relative economics of the two types of stations.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government recently decided that increased State assistance should be provided for the extension of rural electrification. Under the existing rural electrification scheme which was started in 1946 and is due to be completed this year 775 out of a total of 792 rural areas will have qualified for development.  The remaining 17 areas failed to qualify under that scheme because the total fixed charge revenue from them would not have been sufficient to meet the minimum return on the capital cost of development required under the scheme.  These areas are mostly remote areas with low density of population and correspondingly higher costs of connection and low average return per house.  A special subsidy of £90,000 is now being provided under the Bill to meet the cost of the necessary &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; lines in these areas so as to enable them to be developed and it is expected that as a result connection can be offered to about half of the estimated 6,000 dwellings in these areas at normal rates of fixed charge.  Other dwellings can, of course, obtain supply but they will be asked to pay some extra charge.</P>
    <P>The initial development of all the <Col N="1927" /> rural areas, including the 17 areas at present undeveloped, is designed to connect some 283,000 out of a total of 395,000 rural dwellings.  Of the dwellings connected some 269,000 or 68 per cent will have been connected at standard rates of fixed charge compared with the target of 69 per cent. which was set when the rural electrification scheme was initiated in 1946. Some 112,000 rural dwellings throughout the country will still remain unconnected when the development of all the rural areas is completed.  The initial development scheme, on completion, is estimated to cost about £32,000,000 of which the ESB will have contributed £25½ million approximately and the State £6½ million.</P>
    <P>The ESB is now incurring very heavy annual losses on rural electrification despite the State subsidy towards the capital cost of rural electrification. In recent years these losses have grown to around £700,000 and are expected to continue at a very heavy rate for some years thereafter, and, thence, to reduce gradually.  In order to avoid further increases in losses in rural electrification, the ESB have been connecting houses for electricity on post-development only on the basis of a minimum return by way of fixed charges of 7.3 per cent. of the capital cost of connection, this being the economic return on the investment after taking account of the State subsidy of 50 per cent of the cost of connection.  The return required by the Board for initial development has been 4.7 per cent but even after taking account of the State subsidy this has been very uneconomic as can be seen from the losses of the Board on Rural Account.</P>
    <P>With a view to stimulating a more rapid rate of connection in the areas already developed, the present Bill provides that over the next five years the existing subsidy of 50 per cent in respect of connections in areas to which a supply has already been extended will be increased to 75 per cent, subject to a maximum of £75 per house.  The increased subsidy is designed to permit of about 77,000 of the 112,000 unconnected premises in rural areas being in a position to obtain the electricity at <Col N="1928" /> the normal rates of fixed charge.  About 23,000 premises would have to pay a special service charge but except in very few cases, the special charge will not add more than 50 per cent to the normal fixed charge.  There will still remain some 12,000 households mostly in remote areas which could be offered electricity only at rather high rates of fixed charge because of the very high cost of connecting such premises.  The average cost of connecting these premises would be about three times the average cost of connecting other premises and, in the circumstances, these householders are being offered, as an alternative, a subsidy of £10 per house to enable them to install bottled gas.  The bottled gas subsidy will cover the cost of two full cylinders, two blanked-off points, a regulator and the necessary pipes.  A further announcement will be made in regard to this scheme shortly.  Following on the provision of increased subsidy the ESB will adjust the charges of ruaral consumers who are already paying special service charges.</P>
    <P>Of the 15,000 rural consumers at present paying special service charges, some 3,000 will have these charges eliminated altogether and the charges in the case of the remaining 12,000 households will be reduced by about half.</P>
    <P>The ESB have reported that due to unforeseen circumstances such as severe storm damage there has been delay in completing the development of the economic areas but it is expected that all these areas will have been developed within a few months. The ESB will then start on the development of the 17 uneconomic areas and expect that work on most of these areas will have been completed before the middle of 1963 and that the development of the few remaining areas will be completed before the end of 1963.</P>
    <P>Most other European countries had made considerable progress with rural electrification before our rural electrification scheme was started in 1946. The provision of rural electrification in these countries did not, however, present the same problems as in this country because most of their rural <Col N="1929" /> inhabitants live in villages and hamlets thus making connections easier and cheaper whilst in this country most rural dwellers live in scattered farmsteads thus adding to difficulty and cost of connection.  When these factors and also the differences in social and economic conditions are taken into account this country's rural electrification scheme is a noteworthy achievement.</P>
    <P>The ESB has an excellent record of public service and efficient administration since it was established 35 years ago.  The country has every reason to be proud of this enterprising state organisation which has played such an important part in the economic development of the State.  I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Board and their staffs on their achievements over the years and of wishing them continued success in the future.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mark you, there are not a few people who are coming around to agree with me.  Ask some of your own colleagues.  I want to ask the question which I asked before.  One of the proposals in this Bill is to make provision for the problem of remoter areas and the extension of electricity <Col N="1930" /> supplies to them.  When I was considering the Connemara scheme, one of my problems was to supply power and light and I remember approaching the ESB to inquire of them whether in view of the long distances over which main lines would have to be carried if we were to bring electricity to Connemara, would it not be possible to tap some of the mountain lakes in Connemara and to treat these remote areas as self-contained areas for the supply of power generated locally. What I wanted to know was if you had a mountain lake, could you not artifically create a fall of water to a power station situated at the foot of the hill or mountain on which the lake was situated and by operating the station at night as well as during the day to use the surplus power generated at night to pump water back into the supply lake from which you are drawing water when you operate the station.</P>
      <P>I was told that the laws of dynamics made it impossible to conceive such an operation.  I accepted that on the ground that it was an informed, expert opinion, only to discover that it is being done in Canada and is now quite common.  I want to suggest again to the Minister that in these remoter areas where such sources of power are available, instead of concentrating on the possibility of linking those remoter areas to the national grid, we should consider if there is a local source of power available such as I have referred to and supplying the districts from that local source of power, quite apart from the national grid.  I believe it could be done.  I often thought we missed a great opportunity when draining the Moy.  Anyone knowing the geography of that part of North Mayo would realise that if a channel had been cut from Lough Conn back to the coast at Killala, you would have enough power there to generate all the electricity required for the whole of that north-west Mayo area and you would also substantially solve the problem of the Moy drainage. I believe that that principle could be operated in certain areas in Donegal, Connemara and probably certain areas in West Kerry.  It certainly is worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> I notice that the Minister in the course of his speech said:</P>
    <P>The programme provides that coal and oil fired stations will be sandwiched between peat-fired stations so as to ensure the maintenance of electricity supply in a year in which weather conditions will be very adverse for either peat or hydro generation of electricity, or both.</P>
    <P>How would you get a year that was adverse to the generation of electricity by either peat or water?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister is right.  I suspected he just put in the words &ldquo;or both&rdquo; in order to round off the sentence and, in fact, it makes nonsense, but it is not very significant. It is just a faulty construction, in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> No estimate has ever been made, and I think it ought to be made, of what the comparative cost is of generating electricity from oil with the cost of generating it from turf.  It is fundamentally unsound to be living on illusions.  I can see a case being made that it is worth paying more to generate electricity from turf if you can use up native resources.  I believe it costs more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the unit sent out is in the ESB Report, as the Deputy knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The comparative cost of units as sent out is in the Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I observe these words &ldquo;as sent out&rdquo;.  When you get into these questions it is very difficult to get a true basis of comparison.  I believe it is a fact that if all the power generated at turf stations was, in fact, generated at the most efficient oil stations that could have been constructed the cost of the electricity would have been less.  It would be useful if an honest appraisal were made of that so that we might know what this cost is and what it involves us in.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the fraudulent misrepresentation that increased costs were due to withholding the State subsidy when it was possible to meet is out of the profits of the ESB has been dropped but I want to repeat that that fraudulent misrepresentation has been made on more than one occasion by the Minister for Transport and Power.  He has never yet answered the query: if he thought it was not right to withhold the subsidy in the years when we withheld it on the ground that the profits then being made by the ESB were sufficient to meet the subsidy cost, why he has never provided retrospectively a capital sum to cover whatever subsidies were then withheld?  If it was wrong from the point of view of the national interest to withhold those subsidies in the years we determined to do it, why does not the Minister put it right?</P>

If you believe the whole nation is labouring under a burden&mdash;which, of course, you know damn well it is not &mdash;why do not you put it right?  The answer is, of course, that the subsidy the Minister speaks of was never necessary.  It was met out of current profits of the ESB and for that reason the Minister does not introduce proposals which he has a clear duty to do if he believed his own story.</P>

      <P>If you believe your own story, you ought to appropriate money to relieve the whole nation, the whole industrial life of the country, the whole agricultural life of the country, of a burden which you believe is unnecessary. It is because you know damn well the story you told is a travesty of the fact that you make no attempt to change the policy which we considered reasonable at the time and which I am quite satisfied was right in the circumstances then obtaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because you know perfectly well that if this story you told were true you have a clear duty to put right that which you could perfectly simply put right. The reason you do not attempt to provide retrospectively the subsidy to which you refer is that you know it was unnecessary and in fact involved no additional charge on the consumers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the tendency for the demand for electricity to rise should be sustained.  I notice that the ESB take the view that there will be an 8 per cent. annual increase for the next five years.  These estimates are hard to make.  I hope the ESB estimates are correct.  It would be an evidence of a sound economic situation <Col N="1934" /> if they are.  However, I imagine that if these estimates prove to be excessively optimistic it will be possible to adjust the programme to meet any such eventuality whereas if the estimates were pessimistic it might be extremely difficult to bring the additional generating capacity into being unless steps were taken in good time.</P>
    <P>We have no objection to the appropriation of capital for the provision of the necessary power.  I endorse what the Minister has had to say about the ESB.  It has been a well-run concern, it reflects credit on those who established it.  It has been a source of education for those who denigrated it in their day and it has conferred very material benefits on our people wherever they may be.</P>
    <P>There is a constant tendency to speak of the losses that the ESB are suffering in the distribution of electricity in rural areas.  I do not know, I often wonder, on what basis these losses are estimated.  I do remember that for a long time after the ESB was first established these rural areas paid their share of the cost and got no benefit at all.  They may be getting back a little more now than the bare economics would entitle them to but there can be no doubt in the mind of any reasonable person that it is a salutary thing to make power and light as universally available as it is reasonably possible to do with the resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I think the bottled gas idea is a good idea and can provide a very reasonable substitute for electricity in the very remote areas although it must be borne in mind that while bottled gas can provide light and, indeed, cooking facilities in those areas, it does deprive the rural dweller so situated from access to power which is becoming more and more important even on the smallest holdings but I am prepared to say that I think the bottled gas scheme is a reasonable compromise bearing in mind the exceptional distances over which power will have to be transmitted to individual houses in some of the more scattered populations.  But, I would be interested to hear from the Minister if the ESB would give due consideration <Col N="1935" /> to the proposal of local generation of electricity where mountain lakes constitute an available source of power.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I am very pleased that the Minister is relieving a number of electricity consumers who were paying the high extra charges, particularly those rural dwellers who live away from the line of the ordinary rural electrification circuit.  There are quite a few of them and they will be very glad of the relief they will get under this Bill.  I hope the day is not far distant when the Minister will be able to bring in a further measure to relieve all the people in the country who are paying these extra charges.  A number of people in my constituency have not yet taken electricity because the special charges are too high.</P>
      <P>I realise a lot has been done in this respect and I want to join with Deputy Dillon and the Minister in congratulating the ESB on the wonderful work they have done.  While they may be suffering from a deficit at the moment, nevertheless, in this Bill the Minister is doing a good deal to encourage them.  The Fianna Fáil Party as a whole have always been anxious to see that the people of rural Ireland should have electricity.  A lot of good work has been done in my constituency since rural electrification first came there in 1946.  With the exception of the short period when the inter-Party Government were in office, things have been going along very smoothly.</P>

I was delighted to hear about the scheme to provide bottled gas for people in remote areas to whom it is not yet possible to extend electric current. It is a scheme which will be very welcome to those people, and is further evidence of the Minister's aim to light up the dark portions of rural Ireland.  Another problem in Dublin <Col N="1936" /> city at the moment is in respect of old age pensioners.  They have been complaining to me and to other public representatives of the high charges they have to pay and I was wondering what it would cost if the ESB were to provide special meters for poor people.  If this were done it would be a wonderful relief to many of them.  I know this is a matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very gratifying in this House to hear compliments being paid to a State body.  Generally, when Deputies speak about large <Col N="1937" /> State controlled organisations they do so in critical terms for the purpose of lowering in the public eye the value of anything done by the State for the good of the public.  Therefore, when we hear the praise lavished on the ESB it is good to know that Deputies have begun to appreciate that work of the magnitude of that carried out by the ESB could not have been successfully accomplished if it were not that the ESB are a State body charged with great responsibility.</P>
      <P>When replying to the debate on an earlier Bill, the Minister commented on the desire of Deputies to interfere in the day-to-day administration of State bodies and suggested Deputies should read the Taoiseach's speech made to a group outside this House on the place of State and semi-State bodies in our society.  The Minister admitted that the Taoiseach, and even the Minister himself, realised there were many points of view on the extent of the control that should be exercised by the Oireachtas over the functions and administration of the different State bodies.  It is no harm when dealing with the ESB to emphasise that there must be power vested in the elected representatives of the people to extract information of public importance.  The public are paying for the services and, as the people who have to pay the Bill, they are entitled to information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may not be desirable that the information be given directly through Dáil Questions.  Undoubtedly, there may be a strong case put forward that the activities and efficiency of particular companies might be interfered with as a result of undue interference in their day to day administration.  At the same time, there is a public demand for more information.  It is a matter for the Government to decide how best to meet that public demand. The Minister should have this question reconsidered and brought again before the Government.  If it is to be decided at this stage that Parliamentary Questions are not the best way to deal with matters of importance, it is highly desirable that a Committee of this House be set up which would be empowered to meet the directors or <Col N="1938" /> higher officials of the various State bodies and consult with them on matters of public importance.  Such bodies function in the British House of Commons.</P>

      <P>This measure marks another step forward by the ESB, which has shown itself to be an enterprising and progressive organisation.  It was well established and seems to have followed very good traditions.  This measure deals with the steps to be taken in future for the extension of rural electrification which, on the existing basis of cost calculations, were considered to be uneconomic and had not much hope of getting electricity. When we examine the history of the ESB we find they have made a dramatic contribution to the national well-being.  As the Minister said, if they <Col N="1940" /> had not been established in 1927, we could not have had the industrial development which occurred in the years that followed.  As a result of industrial development based on the power provided by electricity, a great measure of employment was provided in the industrial field and it was possible for the workers to enjoy a good standard of living.</P>
      <P>The original Electricity Bill provided for this rural electrification scheme.  It is regrettable that for nearly 15 years after Fianna Fáil came into office they took no steps whatever to provide electricity in the rural areas. The year 1946 was mentioned, but I think that in that year only initial discussions for a rural electrification were held.  It was started in 1947 and in my own constituency actually a pilot scheme was inaugurated which included the areas of St. Margaret's and Oldtown.  In fact, it was established in a cloud of doubt and in trepidation, as to whether the economics of the scheme would justify the electrification of the rural areas.  It was not long until that scheme demonstrated that it was quite possible, and that the extension should be embarked upon immediately.  It is regrettable that the necessary finances, and the adjustments for the provision of capital, were not made available in the early Thirties after Fianna Fáil came into office, to provide some of the rural districts with electricity much sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural electrification has enabled industries to be spread out through the country, instead of being concentrated in the centres where electricity was readily available.  We can now see factories which were established in remote rural districts, thanks to electric power.  In those remote rural districts, employment is provided in the various industries and factories for residents of the locality who would otherwise be faced with the necessity of seeking a living away from their native district.  This measure which proposes a further extension of rural electrification into areas not already serviced is very welcome.  The history of the ESB for the past 35 years has demonstrated what a valuable asset <Col N="1941" /> electricity is to organised society.  It has certainly made a valuable contribution to our national economy.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the figures given by the Minister of the number of houses not yet connected.  I could not believe that over 100,000 dwellinghouses in the rural areas are not yet connected. The Minister went on to say that the proposed adjustments in the measure before the House would come to the rescue of approximately 77,000 householders out of the total of 112,000 not yet connected, leaving approximately 33,000 people still with no immediate prospect of getting electric power and light.</P>
    <P>It is certainly very welcome that this new arrangement will result in connecting up over 77,000 householders. There was some kind of prejudice against being connected with an electric grid when rural electrification was first embarked upon when the inter-Party Government were in office in 1948.  The scheme seemed to spread like wildfire and the necessary finances were provided. It has continued to spread and has resulted in only very remote areas being left without ESB power and light. For economic reasons, it was necessary to leave a number of householders in the rural districts without this power.</P>
    <P>In County Dublin, there are quite a number of pockets, if you like, of isolated households and farmsteads where there is no immediate prospect of having electric power and light connected to the homes.  This is an amenity to which people have become accustomed but the prohibitive cost of an extension to those places prevents the householders and the owners of the farmsteads from having power and light.  Those who have witnessed it can speak of the remarkable transformation which has taken place, particularly in and around the farms. There are the electric pumps, possibly milking machines and various other types of machinery providing the amenities for the householders, and cutting out the drudgery which has been for so long associated with farm life.</P>
    <P>There are a number of those isolated farmsteads still without those <Col N="1942" /> amenities and I am glad that this measure will come to the rescue of at least some of them by reason of the financial adjustments to which the Minister referred in the course of his statement.  Quite a number of people have got quotations from the ESB for an extension from an existing transformer in the area where they are resident, but the high cost of wiring and carrying the service to the homestead prevents them from availing of it.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of county council cottage tenants have not got electricity, although they want to be connected and it is necessary in their houses for one reason or another.  I came across one case where the wife of a tenant really needed electricity because she had, I think, lumbago and needed the type of treatment provided by electricity to relieve her suffering. When the cost of having electricity connected to the cottage was calculated, it was found that her husband, in his circumstances, could not afford to avail of it, although there was a transformer only a few hundred yards away from the cottage.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the case made earlier by Deputy Dillon about mountain lakes and the possibility of small local schemes being devised.  In our hurry to provide rural electrification, we embarked on turf-powered, coal-powered and oil-powered stations, in addition, of course, to the hydroelectric scheme.  In the long run, I think the hydroelectric scheme is the best.  The turf-powered scheme can be carried on as long as turf is available, but the quantity of turf which is consumed at the generating stations is remarkable.  At the rate of consumption, we could almost calculate the time when we will not any longer be able to feed in the vast quantities of turf required to provide electric power in the grid.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the use of coal and oil must be a costly way of providing electricity compared with the hydroelectric scheme.  Certainly, we have noticed that in the past ten or 15 years the ESB have harnessed a number of swift flowing rivers which, of course, have put a vast amount of power into <Col N="1943" /> the national grid.  But there is a number of mountain lakes, I believe, and swift rivers which could be harnessed by engineering ability to enable power to be provided in the locality, as distinct from the national grid.  I am sure that engineers have considered these matters and they probably are in favour of the kind of efficiency and economy which a large scheme can assure them, but at the same time if we can devise smaller hydroelectric schemes in the remote rural areas economically, then I think we should try it.</P>
    <P>A number of people in rural areas at the moment who have electricity connected to their homes and farms feel the fixed charges and bi-monthly rent to be rather heavy and I hope a new system of charges will be devised to cut down the heavy expense of electricity to so many people and bring the cost down nearer to the cost to the average consumer resident in a more convenient district.  He has not the heavy fixed charge to pay which the others have.  I do not want to mention any figures here because there could be figures much higher than I could mention and much lower too, but it is remarkable to see the heavy fixed charge some farmers are paying in order to have electric power and light in their homes.  It is an essential amenity these days.  It cannot be replaced by the kind of local windmill some of them tried to use and which certainly was not a success compared with the light and power available from the national grid.</P>
    <P>I would ask the ESB through the Minister to examine the very high fixed charges which apply to so many people resident in remote areas.  They certainly have to pay very heavily because of the location of their homes and in fairness I think more general consumers should be asked to bear an equal burden of the cost of this national service.  It should be available equally to all citizens.  At this stage, I can appreciate that we must take economics into consideration and observe priorities in providing the service, but when the service is provided <Col N="1944" /> to 90 per cent. of householders or even less I think the burden should be spread more equally among those who enjoy its amenities instead of the people in remote areas paying so heavily.  There is also, of course, the question of meter rents and that is another kind of fixed charge imposed on consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this is not the appropriate time for a detailed discussion of the ESB and will, therefore, confine myself to one point in connection with the improvements offered in this Bill.  Even with the increased subsidies I notice that of the 112,000 householders who are at present suffering certain disabilities because their localities are remote, 35,000 will still be outside the ambit of the benefits offered in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to get information on the position of those people who have already installed ESB current and are paying the special service charge.  I am not satisfied with the special charges imposed by the ESB.  I am not going so far as to suggest that there should be no extra charge because I know the extension of the service to some of these areas is a financial imposition on the ESB but what I am objecting to&mdash;and apparently it is to continue under the Bill&mdash; is the usury employed by the ESB On many occasions I have seen people presented with the contract to be signed in order to get ESB current into an area.  It makes clear that an extra charge will be imposed upon them.  That is all right, but there is <Col N="1945" /> no indication whatever of the possibility of these charges at some time in the future being reduced.  Apparently under the Bill the ESB will continue to provide for themselves a way out of this dilemma as they have done in the past and are doing at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes it clear to us that approximately 77,000 householders will benefit from the increased subsidies. Had it not been a question of an increased subsidy, they would, I presume, have to pay increased charges when they got the current installed in their households but what will the position now be for those people who have already signed these contracts with their special service charge? Surely the ESB are not going to continue to ask a special service charge imposed through the contract offered to the various householders?</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that in future the special service charge in order to provide more people with electricity in that area may be reduced.  That reduction will depend apparently on a reduction in costs.  We all know that economic trends in this country, and elsewhere, show clearly that there is no sign of any reduction in costs.  The ESB, therefore, have apparently no intention of making any reduction in the special service charge.</P>
    <P>It is not so long since an important Bill dealing with hire purchase was passed in this House.  We all know that if any one wants to avail of certain appliances by buying through the ESB on hire purchase, that purchaser is told, and rightly so, the cash price and the price if he or she wants to avail of hire purchase, together with the period of time over which those hire purchase instalments will have to be paid.</P>
    <P>Apparently the intention now is to continue in operation the policy of service charges.  I know that in certain cases extra poles and extra wire are necessary in order to connect up homes, but surely the ESB cannot contend in all honesty that the special service charge to cover the extra cost of the two, three or four extra poles and wire should go beyond a certain period of time, a period of time in <Col N="1946" /> which the costs of the materials involved and the labour employed will be covered.  There is no provision in this Bill amending the present unsatisfactory position.  I would like the Minister to clarify this matter for the House.  The present policy deters people from connecting up with the ESB. They object to the special service charge continuing forever.  Some 35,000 householders are affected by this charge The Minister will have to clarify the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 15,000.  Of that number, 3,000 will have their charges eliminated altogether and the other 12,000 will have their charges reduced by half.  That is fair enough. The figure 15,000 is the total number paying extra service charges in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that, while he said there would be a reduction in some 15,000 households, he did not state whether or not that was the total number involved. When the ESB were extending rural electrification in Cork, they did not do as they did in Wicklow; there they covered all the different areas. In Cork, they left pockets unattended to because they considered it would not be economic for them to deal with them.  I am entitled to assume that a fair proportion of the 35,000 households which will still be outside the <Col N="1947" /> scheme are in County Cork.  If that is so, and if these people have to meet a special service charge, I want the ESB to tell these people that that charge will be imposed upon them only until such time as the ESB recoups the expenditure involved in the provision of extra poles and wire and the labour costs in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It is certainly a step in the right direction.  It shows the great progress in rural electrification. Some Deputies on the other side of the House have criticised the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to rural electrification.  Perhaps they are unmindful of the fact that it was the Fianna Fáil Government who initiated rural electrification.  It was the Fianna Fáil Government that provided the money to bring it to every corner of the country and every homestead in the State.  That is not something I want to boast about.  It is a statement of fact. It is a statement of fact that must be made because of what has been said by Deputy Rooney.  I do not wish to denigrate or to take credit from those who initiated rural electrification in 1926. To bring electricity to every home in Ireland has always been the dream of Fianna Fáil.  I am very happy to notice the progress that has been made.  I am happier still that the Minister is now providing money in an effort to link up isolated pockets, pockets which were more or less inaccessible from the point of view of providing current because of the costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know how important electricity is.  In this modern world in which we live it is very useful on the farms. It is commendable that we should make all haste to provide this amenity for the people in the rural areas.  The Minister referred to some new stations. Part of my constituency is a coal bearing area and I would ask him to consider that as a possible site for a second coal burning station attached to the Arigna mines.  The station erected in that area some years ago has been very beneficial.  It provides a good deal of employment.  I hope it may be possible to extend it further.  The ESB deserves great credit for the fact that <Col N="1948" /> the new projects have been designed by Irish engineers.  It is an education to many foreigners when they come to this country and see these stations designed completely by our own engineers, which is a tribute to the advance which has been made here.</P>
    <P>Rural electrification also helps the establishment of rural industries in some of these backward areas that already have had the benefit of the Undeveloped Areas Act but who may not have had electricity heretofore. People in their criticism often forget the fact that the subsidy towards rural electrification was withdrawn during the time of the Coalition Government and that that definitely did slow up very considerably these rural electrification projects.  I would ask the Minister to continue the policy he is pursuing in this regard and, whatever he may have in mind as regards bottled gas, he should make every effort to get electricity itself into every home in the country.  On the mainland in particular, bottled gas might not be any substitute for electricity, and I hope that when he has this scheme pushed through, he will go back over some of the areas left out and include them if at all possible.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the suggestion to recoup those people in backward areas who were willing enough to come forward in the past to pay the extra installation costs involved in securing the benefit of electricity.  I congratulate the Minister on this Bill and wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience, I have always thought the ESB considered the local authorities and the ratepayers fair game in regard to what I call extortionate charges.  We have found that in South Cork and other areas in respect of housing and sanitary services.  However, I have a particular reason for speaking on this Bill.  Last October, there was a revision of constituencies and a whole new area was thrown over to me.  I was horrified to find districts there completely without electricity, districts within 12 miles of Cork and within five miles of Mallow. I was horrified to go into one of those districts to find children there having <Col N="1949" /> to do their homework under lamps. That should have been ended years ago.  I have been hammering the ESB since last October and I am glad to know they are about to deal with this.  If they do not, they will be hearing pretty often from me in the future.</P>
      <P>Anybody who looks into the present position of any rural community in regard to water supplies, milking machines, grinding machines, and so on, will realise that they are absolutely essential to any farm but they cannot be used without electric current.  I cannot understand how an area within five miles of Mallow and within 12 miles of Cork has been left completely without electricity up to the moment.  I hope it will be the first area that will be done.  I have a habit of seeing that the things I want are done.  I cannot understand why it was not done previously but now that this area is in my hands I intend to see that electricity is provided immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the members of the House for the cordial way they have received the terms of this Bill.  We all agree more light is needed in houses.  First of all I should like to refer to what Deputy Dillon said about making use of mountain lakes and pumping the water at certain times of the day for storage purposes.  I understand this is a new method of generation which has been adopted in certain countries, including Great Britain.  Here we can use our own existing hydro resources to help meet the peak loads and we have not got the same case here for the pump storage method.  We are also able to supply the night load from hydro sources at virtually no fuel cost so we have not yet reached the position where this method might be useful to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also told that the catchment area of mountain lakes is normally rather small and it would be inadequate in relation to the amount of water that would be required to sustain even a small hydro station.  Unless one could find a very large mountain lake rightly positioned and with the right features, it would be difficult to carry out the <Col N="1950" /> system in any event.  However, I recently asked the ESB to consider all possible methods of producing power which are economic.  I know they examine all the different systems in operation elsewhere and keep continually in touch with world electric power developments.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Dillon, the Board reports do show the cost per unit for oil and coal in various stations.  Last year, the House was furnished, in reply to a question, with the cost per unit in each station on an equal priority basis.  This does indirectly disclose the relative costs of turf and oil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry raised the interesting question of the use of overhead lines in urban areas and pointed to the fact that they spoil the amenities of housing areas.  I quite agree with him.  I hope that when the Town Planning Bill is introduced it will be possible to use influence with the ESB to try to persuade them to change their method. I know that underground cables in certain areas in rural districts are very much more costly than overground cables.  I hope we can do something about this because I agree with Deputy Barry that it does spoil the appearance of an otherwise attractive housing scheme to see a tremendous number of poles with hanging wires all over the place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney misunderstood the terms of the arrangement for rural electrification subsidy.  He suggested that some 23,000 out of 112,000 households would never be connected, that they are outside the scheme.  First of all, there are the 77,000 people who will not have to pay any additional service charge.  Then there are 23,000 people who will have to pay an additional service charge but not more than 50 per cent.  I understand that in the case of a great many of them the extra charge would be nothing like 50 per cent above the normal.  Then there is a balance of some 12,000 people who would have to pay 100 per cent or over additional service charge.  If they feel they are unable to do that, they can take advantage of the bottled gas subsidy.  If their circumstances improve later on, they may join the district on <Col N="1951" /> condition that they return the £10 gas subsidy they were given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond raised the question of the special service charges and how long they would last.  As I already pointed out in an interjection, there are 15,000 people now paying extra service charge and in respect of quite a number of them the extra service charge would be completely wiped out and in respect of another number the extra service charge would be cut by half.  They will be placed in line with those who are now to get cuts so that they would not be discriminated against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Appreciating that the charge on the 12,000 would be reduced by 50 per cent that charge would have to be paid in perpetuity. Is that not right?  That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The ESB have said that where there is a significant increase in the numbers taking a supply in an area they will review the special charges with a view to reducing them.  That is because the more people who take supply in an area the less costly are the overheads to the ESB.</P>
      <P>One or two Deputies expressed disappointment that certain areas are not connected.  Deputy Corry mentioned an area near Mallow.  That is because the ESB in order to be fair and equitable and to have a system of administration for rural electrification which would bear examination here and involve absolutely no discrimination or unfairness, had to adopt a yardstick in respect of the areas which would qualify for connection and those which would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The yardstick is related to the amount that could be collected in service charges as a percentage of the total cost of installation of the system in the area plus the maintenance and depreciation charges.  As Deputies know, the fixed charges are based on the area of the house concerned and, by adopting an absolutely strict method of calculation, the ESB can proceed on its way fairly and squarely, knowing no one can say they show <Col N="1952" /> any discrimination in any charges whatever.</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme, the 75 per cent subsidy, I hope the people in the Mallow area will decide to join the system.  I should state, however, that there are many thousands of people at this moment who could be connected, who would not have to pay any extra service charges, even with the subsidy of 50 per cent., and, for one reason or another, they have felt they could not do so.  These are not necessarily people of very low incomes.  You will see in any area people with equally small incomes who decide to take current.  I hope that now that the subsidy has been increased they will all start applying for current because the more people who apply at once for current in an area the easier it is for the ESB to do the job and the less expensive it is to bring a gang of people to do the installation.  That, in turn, will redound to the whole economics of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The future of the ESB on its economic side depends to a considerable degree on householders in rural districts using electricity for many more purposes than they do now.  In that respect, I was very glad to see that the increase in the use of electricity for farm machinery and ancillary purposes has gone up by 40 to 80 per cent in respect of different classes of apparatus as between 1959 and 1961, showing a very much greater appreciation of the value of electricity-run farm machinery in a very recent period.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered all the points.  One Deputy spoke of the high cost of electricity in the country districts.  I should like to remind the House again that the rural electrification operation loses money and that in that sense the urban consumers are subsidising the rural consumers.  I am quite certain from all the reports I have examined that the cost of installation and connection here is low in relation to the problem of connecting may scattered houses that are not grouped together in villages.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to hear from the ESB that experts have come over to <Col N="1953" /> see how they do their rural electrification and that they have acquired valuable information on installation procedures.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
