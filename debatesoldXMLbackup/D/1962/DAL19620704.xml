      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could have some enlightenment for the benefit of travellers coming in here. What are the present concessionary arrangements in relation to travellers bringing things into this country, first of all, as regards people who do not live here and who are bringing in presents for the people with whom they propose to stay and, secondly, the people who live here and are bringing back things which they have bought either on the Continent or in Britain? I think there is also an additional concession in respect of America.</P>
      <P>Apart from the concessions allowed here, I wonder is the Minister aware whether the same concessions are general in other countries as well and particularly across the water for travellers going to Britain, that is, whether the arrangements are reciprocal or unilateral?</P>

      <P>There is a practice growing up that Irish people can bring back presents up to a value of £5.  A foreigner would be allowed more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the £5 restricted to any one type of thing or can a person coming from France bring in a bottle of brandy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, but they must be declared, of course.  That is where many people get into trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole matter should be reviewed.  I know a lady who visited London recently and bought a new coat and who had to pay duty on it when she returned to Dublin, even though she was wearing and needed it.  I would like to have the Minister's view on such a matter.  If I go to London and I get a new outfit, as happened in this case, is that liable to duty when I return here, even though I am wearing it?  It has happened on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Murphy in this matter.  It is a fact that when Irish people working <Col N="1437" /> in England bring their parents over for a holiday, they like to treat them well.  It is commonplace for a chap working in England to buy his mother a new coat or a new outfit when he brings her over there.  These unfortunate working people can ill-afford to pay the duty or have these goods seized when they return.  In Dublin Airport, as Deputies are aware, there has been a very considerable tightening up.  At Christmas time especially, surely it is not right that the Revenue authorities should act the role of Scrooge in depriving people of their Christmas presents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the trend this debate is taking.  It reminds me of an amusing case some time ago when a person was going to England for a celebration in her family and decided that she would be the be-all and end-all of fashion by buying a coat when she arrived in London.  Imagine her surprise when she did not have to pay duty on coming back to Dublin because she discovered that the article was actually made in Dublin.</P>
      <P>We have been building up a very big export trade in clothing here and Irish goods are now regarded in London as being better finished and of better quality than their counterparts made in England.  Any Deputy who would encourage people to buy clothing in England and thus keep Irish workers out of employment should be ashamed of himself, particularly the member of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right for Deputy Lemass to talk because when he goes to England, he is armed with a cheque book, but I have in mind a number of people who have no cheque books and who are not in a position to buy first-class clothing at home.  A lady went to England recently to the wedding of a member of her family.  She was presented with a coat for the occasion by members of her family, possibly because they did not consider her clothing good enough. When she came back to Dublin, some official of the Revenue authorities asked her where she got it.  As it had <Col N="1438" /> been bought in England, she had to open her purse and pay out the few pounds she had, even though she explained the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>She could have bought it as good here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass can buy what he likes but I think that on such an occasion the duty should be remitted.  I intend taking up this case with the Minister.  I have great respect for the Minister in so far as dealing with cases like this are concerned and I have no doubt that he will remit the duty even though it is not a function of his.  That type of action by the Revenue authorities is not warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, Deputies should remember that it is wrong to blame the Revenue Commissioners or their staffs.  They are carrying out the law and if there is anything not right with the law, we should change it.  The Revenue Commissioners are compelled to carry out the law as it stands.  This concession, however, has grown up over a long period.  I remember years ago you were allowed to take 200 cigarettes in and out.  That more or less lasted.  For a long time also, if you had a bottle of spirits, you had to have a drink out of it in order to get it in.  It had to be broken.  You did not like to pour it out, so you had a drink instead.  That has grown up by custom.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot go further than that, unless we change the law.  If there is anything wrong, therefore, we must blame ourselves here.  The custom now is that a person coming back from England can bring £5 worth of articles and get them in free, provided he declares them.  I very often get letters from Deputies and others complaining about being charged and in practically every case, the article was not declared.  In fact, in many cases, it was denied.  That is what led to all the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to look with particular sympathy on the importation of old clothing and shoes from our emigrants abroad to their loved ones, since gifts of this kind are particularly welcomed by the <Col N="1439" /> poorer families in the community? Might I ask the Minister what the law on this is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that the concession of taking out 200 cigarettes has lapsed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The British authorities do not object to 200 cigarettes, as far as I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do customs officers use any discretion in regard to regular visitors who travel, perhaps, monthly and in respect of persons who perhaps visit a member of their family once a year and who may bring back some article of clothing given to them as a gift by members of their families? Are the regulations applied rigidly in each case?  Surely there should be some discretion on the part of the customs officers?  Surely it was unfair to ask a person more than 200 miles away from home to open her purse and pay out or else have the coat taken off her back?  In this case, there was no question of denying the purchase of the item concerned.  In fact, when asked if she purchased anything, she replied, &ldquo;My coat.&rdquo; This is not on a par with the cases mentioned by the Minister earlier where there were denials and an endeavour to bring in the goods illegally. If the Revenue authorities have not the discretion I referred to, they should have it.  More leniency should be extended to the person on a visit perhaps once a year than the person who is a regular visitor.  Is there anything in this Bill to give discretion to an officer in such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reference to that at all in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the next session most Deputies will put down questions about Christmas presents.  Most parents find it impossible to accept the average Christmas present to their children from America and Britain. Is there any mechanism to allow the admission of <i>bona fide</i> Christmas presents for a limited period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the law to deal with these things.  Again, <Col N="1440" /> it is customary to allow in a certain amount.  What we are dealing with here are goods coming by post or by boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping to hear the Minister reply to my plea in regard to restrictions on the importation of old clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has always taken a very strict view in that matter of second-hand clothing.  I would prefer if the Deputy would get on to him for his views on that point.  The Revenue Commissioners administer the law as it stands.  That is all they can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say is there any ceiling in price with regard to the allowing in of Christmas presents?  The Minister has just stated it is £5 at the customs.  Is there a ceiling for Christmas presents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a man brings in a coat worth £10.  That is the only article he has declared.  It is worth £10 and he gets the £5 concession.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As a matter of fact, it would have been easier to understand if Section 8 had come before Section 7. There is at present a minimum charge. They must pay 2s. 6d.  For some time back that was charged and there was a charge of 1s. in the case of anything coming from Great Britain or Canada. Now we are doing away with that minimum charge completely.  In addition, Section 7 lays down that if the duty on an article is less than 2s. 6d. it is remitted.</P>

      <P>On subsection (3), could the Minister indicate how the repayments will be made?  It just says that the Minister for Local Government will do it.  The majority of people will have paid their tax on the tractor from the beginning of the year.  As I read it, this Act became operative on 1st July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities have been authorised by the Minister for Local Government to make the refund, charging them on the £8 rate up to 1st July and charging for the other half year on the lower rate. There are some extra charges depending on whether you pay quarterly or half-yearly, but generally speaking that is the decision.  The refund can be made any time after 1st July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <P>10.  The Imposition of Duties (No. 108) (Used Omnibuses) Order, 1961, and the Imposition of Duties (No. <Col N="1442" /> 123) (Tobacco) Order, 1962, are hereby confirmed.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is agreed, it will have the effect of deleting Section 10, because it embodies what is in Section 10 already, that is, an imposition of duties on used omnibuses.  Now we have also an imposition of duty on tobacco.  The second duty which was put on tobacco on 14th June operates from 14th June until 9th August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has doubled the rate of initial allowances in respect of capital expenditure which was recommended some time ago.  Under the 1956 Act which is referred to in subsection (2), these allowances are made available only to new and not secondhand plant and machinery.  I want to suggest to the <Col N="1443" /> Minister that it might be worth while considering making the allowances available to secondhand plant and machinery, by reason of the fact that if we enter the Common Market, it may be possible that someone in Europe or Britain might decide for one reason or another to transfer his entire plant to this country.  One hears precedents for movements such as that. In the textile trade in particular, it is quite commonplace for the entire equipment of, say, a cotton mill in Lancashire to be moved <i>in toto</i> to Australia, New Zealand or some such place, and opened up there as a working unit.</P>
      <P>When we visited the Shannon Free Airport some weeks ago, that struck me very forcibly.  In one of the factories, all the machinery had been moved from South Africa in a matter of days by air freight to this country. Most of it was not brand new when first brought in.  The balance of advantage which an industrialist has to weigh up when deciding to move to this country may sometimes be so fine that the availability or not of this initial allowance in the first year might be a deciding factor.  The Minister may consider it worth while to take some discretionary power to make these allowances available to second-hand plant and machinery.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, the whole idea of this concession is to try to induce manufacturers to bring their factories up to date as far as possible.  That would mean the use of new machinery, the most modern machinery and the most efficient machinery.  I think it would be a mistake, at the moment anyway, to allow this concession to be given to secondhand machinery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>Before section 15 but in Part III to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In connection with any assessment for liability for income tax where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure by way of fares on public transport in travelling between his normal residence and the place where the income is earned he shall, subject to a maximum of £52 in any one year, be allowed such expenditure as an expense wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by him in earning such income.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to amend the tax rules and provide that the taxpayer will be permitted to charge up against his assessable profits on earnings the expenses of travelling to his place of work.</P>
      <P>It is a cardinal principle of the tax code that no one in any circumstances whatever is entitled to claim expenses for travelling to his place of work for income tax purposes.  In the case of the wage earners and salary earners, the rule in question which is Rule 9 of Schedule E goes back as far as the Income Tax Act, 1853.  That rule is quite unsuited to present-day requirements and quite unsuited to a situation in large cities such as Dublin where people can live eight, ten or 12 miles from their work and have to incur very considerable expenses in travelling to their places of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why it is a cardinal principle of the tax code that this expense should not be claimable in any circumstances.  It may be that in 1853 when the rule was first drafted, everyone lived near his place of work.  The tax code does not anywhere specifically define taxable income but it is generally regarded, as a matter of commonsense, as a surplus of the receipts from any classified source of income.  Particularly for the wage earners and salary earners living in the dormitory suburbs of Dublin, transport expenses can be a very significant item in the family budget.  While the amendment is designed to embrace <Col N="1445" /> all taxpayers&mdash;which includes business people and professional people&mdash;I feel that the case for the amendment is a good case in respect of the wage and salary earners who are taxed under very rigid rules.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned yesterday, it has been condemned very severely by the judicial authorities as unfair and inequitable. The Dublin worker has little or no choice in his place of abode.  Dublin Corporation are sending people out for housing to places as far as eight or ten miles from the city.  The most recent development envisaged by Dublin Corporation is the development of the Coolock and Raheny area which, to some of our city workers, really means bringing them away out into the country. Transport expenses can amount to as much as £1 or 25/- a week for many of them.  Dublin Corporation is faced with the problem that people are very reluctant to go to these very far-out places because of the hardship the cost of transport imposes on them.  The rule has not been changed in Britain any more than here but, in my opinion, circumstances here are very different because our dormitory suburbs, places like Ballyfermot and Coolock and so on are not, in fact, self-contained units where people work in their own locality.</P>
    <P>The amendment is a very reasonable one and it is restricted.  It proposes that this expense be confined to fares spent on public transport subject to a maximum of £1 per week.  In so far as some people working in Dublin may live out in Greystones, Skerries or Drogheda there is an element of personal choice involved and if their travel expenses amount to 45s. or 50s. that, to some extent, is because of their own preference but in the case of workers sent to outlying housing estates, they have no personal choice in the matter.  If they had a choice they would much prefer to stay in the city area.  The constantly increasing cost of public transport further strengthens the case for this amendment which I suggest is a very reasonable one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, the Minister was not strongly inclined&mdash;to use two <Col N="1446" /> flattering words&mdash;to accept the amendment which was in similar terms but over the past year the Government's mishandling of the whole economic situation, particularly in regard to industrial relations in transport and in the public services, has considerably increased the cost of availing of these services so that there is a much stronger case on the grounds of hardship for the acceptance of the amendment on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The Minister used the old Tory argument that people had a choice as to where they lived but the facts of the situation in Dublin are that in the area of Ballyfermot which is situated from five to eight miles from the city centre &mdash;I use those distances accurately because it is so vast in extent that it is almost three miles in width&mdash;there are 900 to 1,000 seeking a transfer out of that area to some place nearer their work.  Many of the people in Ballyfermot, for instance, are people who worked for years in the docklands in the city of Dublin but who were transferred when the unsuitable or dangerous dwellings in the dock area were demolished.  These unfortunate people have to commence work at an early hour and they are forced to use public transport because of the long distances they must travel and the situation arises where the bread winner alone, in order to begin earning, must spend up to £1 a week or more in travelling expenses.</P>
      <P>It is axiomatic in the income tax code, except in relation to Schedule E persons at any rate, that money necessarily expended in obtaining income is allowable for tax purposes and if a wage-earner is able to establish that it is necessary for him to use such transport for the purpose of getting to his work and if he can establish that he spends or is likely to spend up to £52 a year for that purpose, that sum should be allowed to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a social argument in favour of the amendment.  It is better to distribute the population in the suburbs in separate dwellings rather than in high flats in the centre of the city.  At present the State is subsidising the building of local authority houses all over the country but in <Col N="1447" /> Dublin, because of the high transport cost imposed on workers and the reluctance of workers to go to outlying places, Dublin Corporation is forced to build flats in the centre of the city. There has been argument in favour of flats of ten storeys high or thereabouts, but for the time being these flats are four storeys high and the average cost of providing flat dwellings in Dublin for the average family is from £400 to £500 higher than the cost of providing similar accommodation in the suburbs.  The point then is that the State is supporting the situation which is compelling Dublin Corporation to build dearer dwellings when dwellings with better amenities could be built in other places at lower cost if the workers were ready to go to these places.  Any member of Dublin Corporation &mdash; and there are many on both sides of the House&mdash;can testify to the fact that quite recently people in urgent need of houses because they are living in overcrowded conditions or in insanitary accommodation are unwilling to accept offers of houses in the suburbs because of the tremendous imposition which would lie upon them in relation to transport cost.  It is not only the breadwinner whose travelling expenses have to be paid but there are also the expenses of various members of the family who may be attending schools in the city.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is another argument in favour of accepting this amendment which is worthy of consideration and that is that the acceptance of it might encourage people to use public transport and abandon their private cars which at present are cluttering up the city.  If the use of private cars continues to increase at the present rate the situation will shortly arise when the private car will not be worth having in Dublin because it will be so difficult to move or park.  Therefore it seems it might be worth while to encourage the use of public transport because I am sure it is accepted by everybody that you can accommodate far more people on an omnibus in a given space than if they were in private cars.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister argued against <Col N="1448" /> our amendment that it was better to reduce the overall rate of income tax rather than to give allowances here and there.  Against that, I would argue that where you reduce the flat rate of income tax the people who benefit most are those who are on the higher income level.  Were a concession to be given of the type Deputy Byrne and I suggested, the people who would benefit by it would be the people who greatly need it.  I am thinking of the person whose income tax might be only £10 or £20 a year and who is paying on the PAYE system.  Spread over the year it is a small amount in any week but to any average home or family it means that some person is denied some essential or partially essential commodity like clothes or boots or some assistance in relation to education.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to accept this amendment or to qualify it by saying the benefit would be applicable only to people who earn less than £10, £12 or £15 a week or whose income tax assessment is not more than £25 or £30, I think Deputy Byrne and I would be prepared to accept it.  The concession is very necessary by reason of the fact that State and municipal policy in relation to housing in a place like Dublin has forced people to live where they do not want to live and where they cannot afford to live because of high transport costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment and the arguments that have been put forward by Deputy Patrick Byrne and Deputy Richie Ryan in respect of the workers in Dublin, particularly those who live in the suburbs.  I merely want to speak on behalf of those workers outside Dublin and especially in the rural areas who have to travel fairly long distances to their work, people who may be employed on building schemes and who may live 10, 15 or 20 miles from their work or, as I have been reminded, in some cases up to 30 or 40 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such people undergo considerable expense in the course of their employment. Take, for instance, people who work on the land reclamation scheme. They may work in one area for three months and need a motor bicycle or <Col N="1449" /> a motor car in order to get to their employment.  They get no allowance for that and I am sure those who employ them do not give them any allowance or, if they do, it is a very small one.  There are also those engaged in the building trade who find they have to change their place of employment four or five times during the year.  A good case can be made for income tax allowances for people like that.  It is quite easy to establish their place of residence and also their various places of employment.  A certificate from their employers would, I am sure, be acceptable to the income tax authorities and could be easily verified.  I do not think they should be put in any less favourable position than company directors or those who are employed by well off concerns and who can travel at the company's expense. Therefore I would plead with the Minister to make an allowance in respect of workers in Dublin and elsewhere who must travel long distances either by motor bicycle or motor car.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not there is an allowance in income tax for lodging expenses.  Again I refer to those who are engaged in land reclamation or in the building trade. Workers in the building trade may be engaged on a housing scheme for three or four months and may find it more economical to stay in the place of their employment rather than to return night after night to their place of residence which may be anything up to 40 miles away.  I believe they may get an allowance but it is a concession given purely at the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners and not as a right.  There may be administrative difficulties but in all justice and fairness an examination of the whole matter should be made in order to give reasonable allowances for income tax purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that if a worker could show expenditure which was necessarily incurred in travelling to and from his work the Revenue Commissioners would allow that as a deductible amount.  What gave me that impression was that recently a friend of mine found it necessary or economical to buy <Col N="1450" /> an autocycle to travel to and from his work.  He made this point to the Revenue Commissioners and was given an allowance.  I should like to know if the position is that a man travelling to and from his work on an autocycle will be allowed to deduct a certain amount from his income and that the man who travels by bus will not get such an allowance.  If that is the case it is a bad situation.  However, no doubt the Minister will explain the position.  I am very glad the amendment was put down because whatever the Minister may do at this stage it will certainly give food for thought between now and the next financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the income tax code allows a person expenses for travelling to and from his work.  Deputy Byrne made that point clear and he probably knows a great deal more about this facet of income tax than the average Deputy here.  There is another section of the community for whom I should like to make a plea.  In rural Ireland there are many teachers concerned with vocational education who have to travel a considerable distance to their work.  I have in mind a music teacher who lives in Enniscorthy, in the centre of the county, and who has to travel to Wexford, Gorey and New Ross.  If he were to stay in Enniscorthy he would not make a living.  Whether he travels by public transport or not I do not know.  This amendment is so framed that the allowance would be made to anyone who travels by public transport.  It is reasonable to assume that if the Minister accepted the amendment many of these people who do not travel by public transport would do so.  It is a reasonable proposal because it is limited to £52 in the year or £1 a week.  There are other people teaching languages who have not got their pupils in one place and who have to travel all over the county.  This applies to vocational teachers in every county.  The vocational teacher who has to travel to different parts of the county in which he works gets no allowance whatsoever. In spite of what Deputy Lemass has said, I do not think there is anything <Col N="1451" /> in the income tax code which enables people to get an allowance for travelling expenses.  The Minister is adequately safeguarded by the phraseology in the amendment and I hope he will accept it.</P>

      <P>The normal procedure is to transmit the complaint to the health authority concerned, with a request for a report and an indication of any action taken by the authority in relation to the matter complained of.  An alternative procedure sometimes followed is to arrange for the investigation of the complaint locally by an officer of my Department.  The nature of any further action which might be taken by my Department would depend on the outcome of the enquiries so made.</P>

      <P>Allowances to disabled persons are payable in pursuance of the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) Regulations, 1960, which were made under Section 50 of <Col N="1456" /> the Health Act, 1953.  Article 4 (2) of these Regulations provides that in determining the amount of a maintenance allowance for a particular person, a health authority shall have regard to the means of that person other than income from home assistance. These allowances were introduced to provide some measure of relief for certain disabled persons who do not qualify for social welfare benefits and it follows that persons in receipt of such benefits would not ordinarily be regarded as eligible for a disabled persons allowance.  In exceptional circumstances, however, a health authority could, at their discretion, pay an allowance in such a case.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the purpose and nature of these allowances, I regret that I am unable to accede to the Deputy's request.</P>

    <P>Copies of the speeches made by the Irish representatives in the United Nations on the question of Southern Rhodesia on 12th and 29th June are to be found in the Dáil Library.  If the Deputies will read these speeches they will find that we exhorted the British Government to postpone making the proclamation envisaged under article 40 of the 1961 Constitution of Southern Rhodesia, pending the holding of a Constitutional Conference representing all parties concerned in the affairs of Southern Rhodesia, including the British Government, the Government of Southern Rhodesia, leaders of the several parties and all the people of <Col N="1460" /> the territory, with the object of working out a Constitution under which all elements of population will be able to play a full and free role in the government of the country.</P>

      <P>There is no official control over the prices payable to producers for milk for liquid consumption outside the Dublin and Cork Sale areas.  Creameries are required to comply with the same regulations as private pasteurisers in relation to milk for the liquid trade and to ensure an adequate output of milk during the winter period all pasteurisers must necessarily pay a price above the normal creamery price for milk.  It is, therefore, a matter for each concern to pay to its suppliers a price that will secure an assured supply.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1962&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>Before section 15 but in Part III to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In connection with any assessment for liability for income tax where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure by way of fares on public transport in travelling between his normal residence and the place where the income is earned he shall, subject to a maximum of £52 in any one year, be allowed such expenditure as an expense wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by him in earning such income.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Byrne).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment that there seems to be some misunderstanding about this amendment because it is a fact that people who use vehicles for the purpose of getting to and from their work cannot at present claim tax remission, while those who use vehicles in the course of their work do in fact claim remission and are granted it.  It is very important that the Minister should consider not alone the question of those who travel by bus but also those who have to use motor cycles, auto cycles or even motor cars to get to and from their work&mdash;to have those people included for the purpose of tax remission.  At present there are people travelling from Kells in County Meath, 40 miles, to their work because of the present building boom in Dublin and they can get no tax remission in that respect.  I think the Minister could attempt to meet that <Col N="1496" /> situation.  I would say that the people responsible for administering PAYE seem to be quite sympathetic but the regulations prevent them from granting any remission in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would be commendable if it were not so local in its outlook.  If adopted, it would be applicable to Dublin city and the contiguous areas only.  I am not in favour of confining such reliefs to such a small area or to travelling by public transport.  It should also apply to those who have to provide their own transport, such as motor cycles and bicycles to get to and from their work.  Particular hardship occurs where people's work is not in a fixed location.  There are building workers and road workers who might work here today and ten miles away tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly there should be an allowance in respect of travelling expenses incurred in this way, whether in respect of public transport or otherwise. Unless Deputy N. Lemass made a mistake, his contribution suggested that regulations in this respect are being applied illegally at the moment.  He mentioned the case of a man who bought a scooter and who was allowed tax remission in regard of its use in transporting him to and from work. In my interpretation of the Act, if such an allowance is being made, it is highly illegal.  I understand the regulation is very definite that the Income Tax Commissioners have no power to give a remission in respect of any vehicle used to get to and from work, unless the vehicle is also used in the course of a person's employment.  I would accordingly ask the Minister to insert a new section dealing with travelling expenses generally, leaving out all mention of the amendment we are now discussing in so far it relates to travelling by public transport only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A reasonable allowance could be granted to people having to incur expense in travelling to their places of employment.  It would be difficult to give a fixed amount as the circumstances and the cost would vary very much but if there were some system whereby the local tax inspector could deal with each case on its merits it <Col N="1497" /> would be a good thing.  There should be a section inserted in the Bill providing travelling expenses for workers. I would not oppose the amendment but I think it is too local.  You cannot give something to people in one part of the country and deny it in another part of the country.  I would be in favour of an amendment giving an allowance for expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The income tax law as it stands at present provides certain reliefs but on very broad principles, so much to a single man, so much to a married man and so much for children and other dependants, but apart from that there is very little relief of any kind.  It would be very difficult to depart from that and it would be very difficult to operate any other scheme administratively and to be impartial and fair to everybody.</P>
      <P>It is assumed that a person chooses his own residence and it is not therefore the business of the State to compensate a man for going to his work and coming from it whatever that distance may be.  That assumption may be correct in some cases but there are other cases where relief from income tax is claimed and conditions are right but nothing can be done about it.  This proposal would be very difficult to administer.  There are almost a quarter of a million people paying income tax in this country and a great many of these would make a claim if a concession like this were given.  It would mean an individual investigation in each case which would be a costly procedure and it might be difficult to be fair to all the applicants.</P>
      <P>There is a certain misunderstanding by some Deputies with regard to allowances already given.  It is not true that company directors or executives get better treatment than the ordinary workers.  They are not allowed to charge income tax on the expenses of going to work or coming from work. In a Bill brought in here in 1958 it was provided that where a company gives a car to an executive officer or director there is a charge made for it.  In other words, the Revenue Commissioners put a charge against that amenity and income tax is payable on the amount charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> There is, on the other hand, an allowance for travelling between one business and another or where a man is travelling on business.  If a man has to travel on business, whether he is a commercial traveller, or engineer or some other man who has to go from one place to another, then a travelling allowance is allowed.  Take this example. There are workers with Dublin contractors who, if their employer is doing a job in the country, get country money.  They are charged income tax on that allowance unless they are living away from home on the job.  In that case an allowance is made and they are not charged income tax on the allowance.</P>
    <P>These are the only points I want to make on this amendment but I should like to mention that the seventh report of the Income Tax Commission does deal with this question of allowances provided they are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred.  The commission have some comments to make on that definition in their report.  I have not considered it yet nor have I asked the Government to consider it and I should not like to give the Dáil the impression that it will be favourably considered.  It will have to be considered but whether anything will arise from that I do not know.  I would oppose the amendment as it is against the present concept of expenses as far as income tax is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would only say in conclusion that we are grateful to hear that this matter is to be examined. The only people in this country who are able to travel from their homes to their places of employment without having to incur expenditure are Ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries who have cars, petrol, oil and two chauffeurs given to them to use as they wish, either for pleasure, for family use or for going to their homes and offices.  It must choke the Minister for Finance to deny this privilege which is enjoyed by himself and his colleagues to less privileged members of the community by refusing to give consideration to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this amendment, I am thinking particularly <Col N="1499" /> of the people who had this expenditure imposed on them, people who through slum clearance were pushed out to Ballyfermot and such places where there are no local opportunities for employment.  They have to pay considerable sums annually in travelling to the city to work.  Heretofore, they lived in the city but now some of them have to travel as far as the East Wall to their work.  That involves considerable expenditure, expenditure that has been imposed on them and this is a matter that should receive serious consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what other Deputies have said on this amendment.  There is a point in the case made by Deputy Clinton. Those of us who have had experience of applications from persons who reside in these housing estates know that the majority of them want to be transferred to housing accommodation nearer to their places of employment. Most of them were anxious to be rehoused but they regarded the transfers to the outside housing estates as a temporary alleviation of their problems.  There is great force in the view expressed that these people through no fault of their own, contrary to their own wishes and desires, were transferred to housing estates much further from their places of employment and in many cases to areas where there was no immediate prospect of employment.  Consequently they are forced to incur travelling expenses which persons employed in the same or similar undertakings are not obliged to bear.  I believe there is a very strong case for sympathetic consideration of this matter.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment, I hope the matter will be examined between now and the Finance Bill next year.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with you, Sir. Between this and the next Stage the Minister may have an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Government.  I cannot see any reason why the Minister cannot insert a new section on Report Stage. The case has been made from practically all sides of the House that this concession in respect of travelling expenses is wanted.  Deputy Lemass mistakenly believed that travelling expenses were allowed and he was surprised to think they were not allowed. All public servants qualify for travelling expenses in the course of their duties and I cannot see why the ordinary worker who has to pay for private transport or to provide private transport should not be entitled to some remission.  Many of these people have incomes of less than £10 a week. A concession should be given and the Minister might consider inserting a new section on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Deputy Murphy in his submission in regard to travelling expenses.  There is no denying the fact that people in SDA houses are mulcted in taxes and experience the greatest difficulty. They are the same set of people who, when they look for benefits under the Health Act, do not qualify because of their income.  Yet they can see big business people having an easy passage in the matter of relief.  It is quite common for people who own or direct businesses to entertain as much as they like and charge it down to the Minister for Finance because of the reliefs they get.  The people to whom I refer have to struggle for an existence.  I am quite satisfied that in the homes of many SDA tenants in Dublin, there is abject poverty because of the pressure of taxation.  Surely it is not asking too much for these people that they be afforded relief in respect of travelling expenses?</P>

You do not pay income tax if you have a few children.  You would want to have £20 a week yourself.  The children might have to pay it, but the tenants who are shifted to Ballyfermot do not pay income tax.  I do not pay income tax&mdash;I have five young children. It affects only a percentage.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Before section 15 but in Part III to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection with any assessment for liability for income tax, where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure on the provision of necessary medical services or treatment in respect of illness or infirmity of himself or any of his dependants and that he was unable to insure himself against the said expenses, there shall be deducted from the income to be assessed the expenses so incurred.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that last year we had an amendment in similar form.  The Minister then expressed some sympathy for the amendment but indicated it was not acceptable because, apparently, it was contrary to the inhuman income tax code so much respected by the Minister.  This year, I shall ask the House to approach it from what I might call a negative <Col N="1502" /> or artificial angle.  I want to show how by not accepting this amendment, we are treating different sections of the community differently.</P>
    <P>If a man has a weekly income of about £5 per week, it is almost certain he will be entitled to free hospitalisation and medical treatment at the expense of the local health authority. When such a person is sick, his medical expenses may amount to £10 per week in respect of hospitalisation and the drugs, medicine and treatment he may have to get.  That puts him in the position of earning or having to his name £15 a week, £10 for hospitalisation and £5 which he otherwise has.  If he is earning £15 a week from his own work and labour he will be disqualified from receiving free medical benefit from the local authority.  If he goes into hospital or if he is at home and has to provide expensive drugs, he may well be denied the services because he will be regarded as a person able to provide for them out of his own means, or the State or local authority may come to his relief in part.  Nevertheless, if he is ill in any particular year, he is assessed for income tax purposes on the basis of £15 per week, although the income over which he has control is exactly the same as the man who has £5 for himself and £10 paid by the State.  It is quite clear that we are penalising the person who has an income of his own and who has to pay for his own medical expenses.  It is high time that we gave the reasonable consideration to such a person which is asked for in our amendment.</P>
    <P>We in the Fine Gael Party are especially proud of the success of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  In passing, may I say that I think it is regrettable that the Minister has not yet seen his way to relieve the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme of liability from income tax in relation to its own costs.  A body of that kind which is saving the national Exchequer and the local authorities a considerable amount of money, and a scheme in which people contribute for their mutual benefit, should be relieved of any liability whatever.  If that were done the Voluntary Health Insurance Board would be able to provide <Col N="1503" /> additional benefits which are not now available to policy holders or people who pay their premiums to the Board. However, that is only in passing.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that there are many medical expenses which are not covered by the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.  As men of the world we know that the cost of treating a person at home in this day and age is quite considerable.  The expenses of modern drugs, antibiotics, and the regular attendance of a general practitioner of medicine in the home, can be exceedingly high.  That is something which is not insured under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme or, I think, under any independent commercial scheme.</P>
    <P>A situation can arise in any one year in which people may have considerable medical expenses for treatment of themselves or their families at home. Again, unfortunately, so long as we tolerate the continuation of the present scheme that will be regarded as money which they have to spend themselves. I understand&mdash;and I am sure most people in the House will accept&mdash;that the principle underlying income tax is that it is a tax upon that portion of our income over which we have control of the manner in which we spend it.</P>
    <P>Illness is not something which people voluntarily take upon themselves, unless they are suitable patients for a mental hospital.  Normal people will not bring illness upon themselves.  If they become afflicted with illness they must provide the money and the means to cure themselves and, therefore, they are deprived of that portion of their normal income which goes for the purpose of paying for medicines and doctors' fees.  Therefore, we should no longer regard necessary medical expenses as being expenditure over which people have control or choice. It is necessary and vital and it should be allowed for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Such expenses could be easily proved.  Our medical profession and pharmaceutical profession are reputable and honourable enough not to issue certificates in respect of medical <Col N="1504" /> treatment or drugs unless they are necessarily obtained for the cure of some illness or pain.  The argument the Minister used earlier today and last year against such a scheme was that it would benefit only those who were sick and that there are many other people who need relief of one kind or another. That is a very thin argument.  The illness which afflicts us mortals is something over which we have no control, and it must be cured.  That being so, I believe our amendment is worthy of acceptance.</P>
    <P>Another principle which has been accepted by those in favour of the present income tax system is that the cost of earnings should be deductible for income tax purposes, that if you have to expend a certain amount of money in order to earn an income you should be able to deduct that for tax purposes.  If there is any necessary cost of earned income it is the cost of good health.  A sick person or a dying person is unable to work and earn an income.  If a person expends money for the purpose of restoring himself or his family to health, that is a productive thing.  It is necessary for the purpose of earning an income and, therefore, on that rather academic income tax principle, our amendment is worthy of acceptance.</P>
    <P>Under the income tax code provision is made for the cost of replacing or repairing equipment.  Surely if it is necessary to improve or restore the human body and the human brain as a piece of productive equipment, the expense of that improvement or restoration should be allowed under the income tax code.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that under our amendment people who can insure in respect of some illness or ailment, or some hospital or medical expenses, but who refuse to insure themselves, would not receive the benefit of any allowance for income tax.  We have done that because we believe the Voluntary Health Insurance Board should be encouraged.  If people were to receive that benefit without that qualification, the danger is that they would not insure in respect of hospitalisation and medical expenses, and that would be undesirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> There are many classes of people who are unable to insure under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, or any other scheme.  People who have coronary trouble or chronic diseases of one kind or another are debarred from availing of the various health insurance schemes.  People who are above a certain age limit are likewise excluded from any such scheme.  By reason of their condition, their lack of health or their age, such people are in need of the relief we now seek to give in this very reasonable amendment, because it is the aged, and people who are suffering from a chronic disease or an ailment and in need of constant treatment, who deserve the small modicum of relief we suggest should be given by this amendment.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister said the right thing to do was to provide for them under some national health scheme rather than to provide for them under the income tax code.  I do not want to become too partisan in this matter, but last year when we, on this side of the House, were straining to introduce such a comprehensive national scheme, we tabled a motion and the Fianna Fáil Party, including the Minister, went into the Division Lobby and voted against it and put the whole idea of improving the health scheme on the long finger by appointing a farcical committee which is sitting like a hen on a dud egg at the moment, a committee which the Minister for Health has said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it debars the Minister from proceeding upon the same extremely foolish line, I shall deal with it by way of reply later on.  These, in brief, are my arguments.  Last year, the Minister indicated he was sympathetic. <Col N="1506" /> When we asked him to translate his sympathy into action, he accused us of being sarcastic.  I am perfectly genuine in moving this amendment and I hope on this occasion the Minister will indicate a preparedness, if not on this Stage, then on Report Stage, to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, I supported this amendment and I want to do the same this year.  It is perfectly feasible administratively and, in fact, it is in operation in Australia.  I am not quite sure whether, on the wording of the amendment, it is clear that the allowance would have to be given for expenses in the preceding year.  When we introduced the amendment of the income tax laws to allow an offset for the premium paid to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in 1956, we did so on the basis of providing that it was the premium paid in the preceding year that was eligible for offset against income tax.  Exactly the same procedure could apply here.  I understand that it is on this basis that the allowance is made in Australia. Frankly, I do not know whether it is made in any other country, nor do I know whether, for example, the premiums paid in America to Blue Shield Insurance are eligible in the same way as our voluntary health insurance premiums, but the Australian and, I think, the New Zealand practice is that the allowance is made for the full medical expenses that have been incurred, subject to proof that they have been genuinely incurred.  It is quite a simple matter for the Revenue Commissioners to exact such proof from any taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment was phrased quite deliberately last year, and again this year, to cover only the case of persons who are not able to get insurance benefits against these expenses, the idea being that we want so far as we possibly can to assist in building up the Voluntary Health Insurance to enable it to give greater cover and greater benefits.  As every Deputy knows, through cases brought to their attention, there are many instances where voluntary health insurance is not able to offer cover because of bad <Col N="1507" /> medical history in one respect or another.  Yet, when those people have necessity, because of the matter for which they have been excluded from voluntary health insurance, to go into hospital and be operated on, it costs them just as much as if they had a clear record before.  Indeed, I do not think it is unfair to say that there is even greater need for protection for them because they are more likely to suffer expenses in regard to medical attention over a period than the normal, healthy person who is able to insure with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Minister said he did not think an allowance against income tax was the proper way to deal with this situation.  I say this in no spirit of criticism of the officials administering the income tax code.  They must administer the code as they find it but the whole tenor of the code up to 1956 has been, with, I think, the sole exception of the additional allowance for Irish insurance premiums, that it would not take cognisance of anything outside taxation matters.  There was the breach in that of the additional allowance given to Irish insurance premiums and the additional breach&mdash; I am not disclosing any secret in saying this&mdash;was greatly resented by senior officials of the Revenue Commissioners at the time because they felt it was putting them on an entirely different line.  Those officials are now no longer in the public service.  Times have moved and have changed and we must now accept that no longer is it a question of the tax code being one purely for taxation but that tax can take cognisance of matters outside the pure equity of taxation between one individual and another.</P>
    <P>After all, there is another section in this Bill which deals with the doubling of initial allowances.  The whole point in that is to try to induce people to modernise their machinery.  The purpose of the amendment in regard to allowances on Voluntary Health Insurance premiums was the same, to induce people to insure against that type of expense.  Once you have done that in that respect, then there is an <Col N="1508" /> obligation also to ensure that there is equity between one taxpayer and another and it is not equitable for the A.1 medical history life to be able to get relief on his insurance premium and for his next-door neighbour, who is not quite so lucky in regard to health, not to be able to get any allowance for income tax purposes in that way.</P>
    <P>The administrative machinery for this proposal should be quite feasible and it will not mean a very great dent in actual taxation because it is specifically provided here that it is applicable only where the person concerned can show the Revenue Commissioners that he is not able to insure against the illness in question.  The obligation of proof remains on the taxpayer.  I know many people think it is entirely wrong that any obligation of proof should remain on the taxpayer but that is not the issue on this amendment. The obligation here remains on the taxpayer and when he can discharge that burden of proof, he should get the allowance for which this amendment provides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit a very large proportion of Dublin citizens is affected by this amendment.  I have in mind, particularly, the claims of people I have already referred to, those coming under the Small Dwellings Acts.  It is well known that such people, in order to qualify, go out of the class entitled to a corporation house and come within a particular condition in relation to what they are able to afford in order to pay off their commitments.  It is generally found that such people are asked to substantiate that they are able to have, after meeting their commitments, a sum of £8 2s. 6d. or £8 5s. on which to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can well imagine the difficulty such people experience not only in trying to live but in trying to combat something that happens to them rather suddenly in having to pay medical expenses.  I am well aware that the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme exists and that it has done very commendable work but a vast number of people are not familiar with its operation.  Indeed, there are a number of people who not only do not contribute <Col N="1509" /> but do not qualify for what is set out there.  That being so, we should take into consideration the difficulties such people experience, the natural way of living of these people.</P>
    <P>People are urged to have their own houses and the trend is for them to be on their own and be independent.  In some cases, it is found they commit themselves to something that they cannot fulfil.  These are the people who could very easily be described as trying to keep up with the &ldquo;Joneses.&rdquo; They are people who enter into commitments day after day by way of hire-purchase and so on.  They are people who can be found in very straitened circumstances living in their own homes.  Surely these are the people who deserve relief and consideration?</P>
    <P>These are the people who can be classed as being a little above the corporation house but still they are struggling with a young family and on occasions need the kind of relief set out in this amendment.  As I have already said, all our people are not imbued with a realisation of the value of the voluntary health scheme.  All our people are not thrifty.  All our people are not as cute as the fellow who controls business, the fellow who is able to lay it off against taxes.  Such people are entitled to relief and our Christian inclinations should urge us to assist them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said that on the last occasion this matter was raised there was a great deal of sympathy extended from the opposite side in regard to the points of view expressed.  We have now reached the stage where we do not want sympathy.  What is very much required is action with a view to ensuring that these people who are undoubtedly trying to keep their heads above water will be afforded an opportunity of existing.  They are the self-same people who are called upon to face the demands for increasing rates and similar charges and they face such situations bravely.  Every man should be encouraged to have his own possessions and not discouraged.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a commendable one and should be accepted by the <Col N="1510" /> Minister.  If affords an opportunity of bringing relief to a section of our people who have always been asked to pay because they are between the fellow on the low rung of the ladder and the fellow who is higher up.  We should never discourage any of our people from moving up.  If something is not done in this connection even those people who have obtained assistance from the SDA people and who have been facing up to their commitments will be left in a forlorn position. Were it not for the people who pay taxes, direct and indirect, a most peculiar situation would exist in this country.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote this amendment which intrigues me in one respect:</P>
    <P>In connection with any assessment for liability for income tax, where a person proves that he has incurred expenditure on the provision of necessary medical services or treatment in respect of illness or infirmity of himself or any of his dependants and that he was unable to insure himself against the said expenses, there shall be deducted from the income to be assessed the expenses so incurred.</P>
    <P>The operative word there is &ldquo;unable&rdquo; and I should like to have the matter considered on that basis.  The people of whom we speak are absolutely unable to meet their many commitments and we are pushing them into destitution if we continue the way we are operating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice in urging the Minister to consider seriously accepting this amendment. This matter was referred to last year and I referred to it on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I instanced the case of a man who was in a rather high income bracket but whose expenses to keep himself alive ran into several thousands of pounds.  I think the Minister knows this man and certainly many members of the Government do.  I was surprised to hear that this person has for many years been paying by instalments the fees of the doctors and specialists who attended him.  Even though he is in a fairly high income bracket, he could not be expected to pay £6,000 or <Col N="1511" /> £7,000 which was the cost of the series of operations he had to undergo.  Whatever arrangements he made to pay his commitments in this regard, I believe they are genuinely deductible expenses.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage, I did not ask the Minister to introduce an amendment at this stage.  I suggested to him that he might give the matter further examination, with a view to including a provision next year.  However, now that the amendment is before the House, unless the Minister has some serious objection, I would urge him to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment for the reasons that have been stated already and, in addition, because I believe that, in equity, there is a very good case for accepting it.  We proposed a similar amendment last year and understood on that occasion that the Minister was having the matter examined.  There are two very valid reasons for accepting it.  At the moment those who are insured under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act are entitled to relief from income tax in respect of the premium paid and they benefit to that extent but, although a person is actually insured under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act and is entitled to the income tax relief granted in respect of the premium, where such a person incurs either in respect of himself or his dependants expenditure for hospital or medical treatment, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board allow only a certain maximum benefit to be paid for doctors' fees, hospital accommodation, drugs or medicine.  Therefore, in most cases, even for a comparatively minor operation, the amount which is allowed by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board represents only about half the actual expenditure incurred. Over and above that sum, the insured person has to bear the full liability. There is, therefore, a great case for including in the allowances granted not merely an allowance in respect of the premium paid but an allowance in respect of the expenditure incurred over and above whatever sum is granted under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> Outside these categories, there are cases of elderly physically infirm persons who are not regarded by the insurance board as proper subjects for insurance under this scheme.  At the moment a person has to prove that he, or she, suffers from no serious disability before he, or she, will be admitted into the scheme.  Two categories are excluded: those who suffer from some serious disability and those who are above a certain age. Now it very often happens that the onset of years necessitates medical care or hospital treatment and these older people are obliged to undertake certain necessary expenses.</P>
    <P>Apart from these cases, there is the case of the person who, although insured under the scheme, is put to considerably more expense for medical and hospital treatment than is met by the scheme.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board have in recent times increased the amounts being paid.  I know of one case, however, where for a comparatively simple operation, the amount covered by insurance was less than half the actual expenses incurred. In all these cases, the difference between the actual sum paid by the Board and the expenses incurred by the insured person should qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>Where a person, because of physical infirmity or disability, is refused admission to the scheme and where aged people are excluded from the scheme&mdash;I understand eventually the Voluntary Health Insurance Board hope to extend the cover&mdash;sympathetic consideration should be given to these cases.  This amendment might well be the subject of sympathetic consideration by both the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners because of the very special circumstances applicable in cases where people necessarily incur either medical or hospital expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of this amendment.  The Minister will be quite safe in accepting it because people will have to prove they were unable to insure against &ldquo;the said expenses&rdquo;.  These are the people in the categories mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave.  No one would get away <Col N="1513" /> with anything.  There is no element of risk.  No one will be able to say: &ldquo;Oh, I will not bother.  If anything happens, I will be able to claim something back from the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;. No one will be able to get away with that.  The percentage affected by this amendment would be comparatively small.  Those who would benefit are those who might, perhaps, be in dire need.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to people who are alleged to have high incomes and who therefore do not benefit at all from local authority assistance.  Those in receipt of incomes up to £800 a year have half their hospital expenses paid.  If the cost per day is £1, they need pay only 10/-.  In fact, if they can make a good case, the cost may be only 6/- a day.  I am aware of an unfortunate class which has the name of having over £800.  Because of that, they receive no local authority assistance. They must pay £1 per day for maintenance, £3 3s. for extras, £4 4s. for X-rays, and so on.  Some people have come to me in a panic with bills for £50 and £60.  They are alleged to be in receipt of £900 or £800 a year. These people deserve some consideration. They are not exactly working-class people but they are not much better off than the working classes.</P>
      <P>To illustrate my argument, I do not pay income tax.  I have got only my allowance as a Deputy.  I had a child in hospital.  I was asked to pay £7 7s. per week for that child, just because I had the name of being a TD.  Half of my allowance goes in paying election expenses.  A certain percentage goes back in my day-to-day work as a TD.  I calculate I have about £10 per week to live on, but I have the name of having £20 per week.  I made representations to the hospital and the hospital authorities admitted to me that they had numerous cases like mine; these people could prove that they could not pay but, under the law, they were compelled to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the cases which could be met by way of income tax relief for expenses incurred due to illness.  The Minister would be quite safe.  Those affected would have to prove they were unable to pay.  I think he could accept <Col N="1514" /> this amendment.  If he cannot see his way to accepting it now, perhaps he would consider it sympathetically between now and Report Stage.  A good case has been made for it.  Only a small percentage will benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over the arguments, or to repeat what I said on the last amendment, or what I said last year, but I do want to point out, in relation to this question of being unable to insure, that the Fine Gael Party produced a scheme.  Arising out of that scheme, a committee was appointed.  The task of that committee is to find out whether an insurance scheme would be feasible.  I know, and others know, that there were many defects in the scheme put up by Fine Gael.  I am very much in favour of insurance if a feasible scheme can be put up.  I hope the committee will arrive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Income Tax Commission made certain recommendations, not in line, but not out of line either, perhaps, but not by any means the same recommendation as is made here.  That will have to be considered.  I do not know whether we will be compelled at some stage to do something with regard to relief of income tax in relation to medical expenses.  There is such relief in some countries.  These countries appear to have a better system of check.  The only one I have seen in detail is the American system. The Revenue Commissioners there have power to check the expenses by asking the doctors to produce their accounts.  I am afraid we would never get that here.  Therefore, we would never have the same opportunity of checking expenses put in by a taxpayer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan seems incapable of avoiding personalities.  He said Ministers are the only people with free transport to their work.  So have Deputies, Senators and local authority representatives.  Therefore, we are not alone in that.  However, in this particular <Col N="1516" /> instance, there is no immunity. I think I would be safe in making a bet, at 10 to 1, that I am the person who most recently paid medical expenses.  I had to pay them within the past week.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before section 15, in a new PART IV entitled &ldquo;STAMP DUTIES&rdquo;, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;15.  Subsection (4) of section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, is hereby amended by the deletion of paragraph (a) and by the substitution of&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no objection, if the Minister has no objection, to amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 being discussed together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all cognate. Under Section 33 of the Finance Act, 1961, it was provided that if a non-national bought land, he had to pay the 25 per cent. stamp duty, unless the two Lay Commissioners gave a certificate that the land was not required.  Then the practice and the procedure was that that certificate was sent back to the Minister for Finance who then had another look at the matter.  At that time, it seemed to me that the practice and procedure of last year was very unnecessarily complicated but I let it go as a practice because I felt that perhaps it was better that the right of dispensing from tax should be vested in the Minister for Finance rather than in the Land Commission.  The Minister for Finance, however, has in his own two amendments, Nos. 9 and 10, provided that the right of dispensation from the 25 per cent. duty should be vested directly between the two Lay Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners. When it can be done and is being <Col N="1519" /> done by the Minister for Finance himself in his two amendments, I think it proper that it should be done on all occasions.</P>
      <P>It seems to me undesirable, once the system by which the Minister for Finance alone dealt with taxation has been breached, that there should be any second examination by the Minister for Finance himself.  It seems to me that it adds unnecessarily to the administrative cost and indeed it is undesirable that there should be a position remaining that the Lay Commissioners who are in fact by our legislation in a quasi-judicial position should then subsequently be subject, if one likes, to veto by the Minister. The procedeure which the Minister himself visualises in amendments Nos. 9 and 10 is entirely satisfactory to us and it obviates a possible loophole which existed already in the legislation. Once it has been accepted and dealt with in that way correctly, it is highly desirable that the whole matter should be done like that and highly desirable, therefore, that the Minister for Finance would drop his right of veto which he is leaving in it as between the Lay Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, with regard to the Deputy's amendment, I prefer to deal with amendments Nos. 9 and 10 and then go back to amendment No. 8. Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are designed to deal with a certain form of avoidance that has arisen of buying an estate with a building and taking the building with less than five acres in one part and taking the remainder of the estate in another part, and, therefore, avoiding the 25 per cent. tax on the building on the smaller part.  The Land Commissioners have knowledge of what is being done and I presume they will refuse in a case like that to recommend that the lower duty should be applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 8, when this scheme came in first, it was difficult to know if very much revenue would be lost by giving the exemption from 25 per cent. to 3 per cent.  The case has come to me, as the Deputy pointed out, from the Lay Commissioners. <Col N="1520" /> They have it tabled.  I should like, however, to keep a tab on it for a little while longer.  I think I might be disposed to agree to this next year when we have a little more experience.  If the Deputy would agree, I would undertake to give it full consideration in connection with next year's Finance Bill.</P>

    <P>This amendment is a long-standing question in respect of which the Minister was requested to make this change but it was not possible to get the agreement of the parties concerned until now.  First of all, it is proposed now not to charge duties on the admission of a person to the degree of barrister-at-law, admission of any person as a student of the Society of King's Inns <Col N="1522" /> in Dublin or articles of clerkship whereby any person becomes bound to serve as a clerk in order to his admission as a solicitor.

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>Before Section 15, in a new PART IV entitled &ldquo;DEATH DUTIES&rdquo;, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the property passing on the death, occurring on or after the day of the passing of this Act, of any person dying domiciled in the State includes (a) any Irish stocks, shares or securities or (b) land situated in the State, such stocks, shares, securities or land shall not be taken into account for the purpose of assessing death duties&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that money invested in Irish securities or property by a person who dies domiciled in the State shall not be included for the purpose of assessing death duties.  Many years ago, somebody conceived the idea of imposing death duties as a means of getting handy revenue.  I submit that at that time circumstances were very different from what they are today.  In fact in those days, there was a much greater concentration of wealth in the hands of a few.  In the course of time, during which the estate duties were paid, it became obvious they were affecting not the particular people at whom they were aimed but the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many instances that come to my mind of big business concerns, the business and employment potential <Col N="1525" /> of which were practically destroyed by reason of one or two deaths in the family.  I know of two instances of businesses in the State which had to close down and sell out as a result of death duties.  I know of one instance where two people put their life savings into a garage here, but because of several deaths in the family, had to close down and emigrate and their employees, of course, lost their work.</P>
    <P>It is well known that big landed estates which had given regular employment throughout generations found themselves, by reason of the death of two or three people in the family, faced with the prospect of having to lay off workers and, in fact, practically cut out employing men altogether.  In our fiscal policy, we spend a tremendous amount of money encouraging people to bring capital into the country.  We give all sorts of facilities to people to bring money in here to start industries, but at the same time I suggest to the Minister, without drawing on the taxpayers' purse at all, we could get an influx of capital sufficient to meet all our requirments&mdash;and the one thing we need is unlimited capital&mdash;simply through acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendment is so framed that anyone who is relieved of these estate duties will be living here and whatever the loss may be through the remission of the duty concerned should be repaid four or five times over by the influx of new capital.  In every part of the world, this situation obtains and no other country has seen fit to introduce legislation of this sort.  I should like the Minister to give the House some indication of what the revenue under this heading is.  Of course it is impossible to give the actual revenue from estate duty itself, since it varies so much from year to year, but I believe it is in the neighbourhood of £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>I venture to suggest that if the Minister could himself make this decision, overcome the inherent conservatism of his advisers and introduce legislation to bring this into effect, there would be a tremendous inflow of capital from abroad and the revenue <Col N="1526" /> from income tax alone would be sufficient to compensate the State for any loss suffered as a result of the remission of this duty.  I would also suggest that if such legislation were introduced, we would not have to pay huge sums of money to encourage people to come in here to start industries.  Anyone who rationally examines this will see there is a tremendous loss of employment, that there is tremendous instability in industry, as a result of this duty.  In this age in this country, employers and employees are so dependent on each other that this is a step the Minister would be well advised to consider.  I do not suppose that his advisers will be inclined to accept this, but I will have achieved something if I sow in their minds the idea that we would have a much more efficient fiscal policy if this most misplaced system of taxation were eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be interested if the Minister would give some indication of the amount that has been lost to the revenue by the operation of the Finance Act, 1956, which provided that in respect of certain Irish securities, one-third of the death duty should be remitted.  When that was brought in at that time, it was introduced very deliberately for the purpose of trying to widen the stock market in Irish securities and for the purpose of widening interest in such securities.  It is an unfortunate fact, however, that it has not been availed of as much as I personally would like to see it utilised.</P>
      <P>The more that section was used for the purpose of the legal avoidance of a certain amount of death duties, the more the market and the interest were aroused in Irish securities, and that is the first fundamental in achieving a better basis for Irish public industrial issues.  I do not know whether the Minister has the figures but I should be obliged if he would give them to us, if he has got them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that this amendment has been so phrased as to obviate at once the usual objection that is made to remissions of death duties&mdash;that all that will happen through its acceptance <Col N="1527" /> is that one would be subsidising a foreign State, that the only thing that would happen is that the people who came over here kept their foreign securities in such a place that they would not have to pay on them here. This amendment deals peculiarly with Irish securities and a very strong case can be made in respect of working capital here, particularly that of a business.</P>
    <P>I include in the term &ldquo;working capital&rdquo; the capital of a farmer, a man who owns land.  In such cases, the family of such a farmer find themselves, after his death, very seriously restricted, sometimes to such an extent that they are, in consequence, unable to continue properly to work that land.  Private firms and private companies have felt this draught from time to time.  I see considerable difficulty in administration in regard to a method of investment through a private investment company or through securities outside the State, but I suggest it is not beyond the wit of the Revenue draftsman to provide a means whereby that method of avoidance cannot be operated.</P>
    <P>I admit that when I introduced the concession in 1956, I did so as the first step along a certain road.  This amendment is another step along the same road&mdash;perhaps not the next step but a jump ahead by two or three steps.  It is, however, one we ought to consider.  We must remember that the State gains nothing on a long term basis if, by extracting duties on the death of the owners of businesses, they prevent those businesses carrying on effectively so that their product is lost to the national economy.</P>

      <P>I could only give a very rough estimate of what would be lost by this.  It would be something under £200,000.  I say that is a very rough estimate.  If we were to accept Deputy <Col N="1528" /> Esmonde's amendment, it would make a very big hole in the death duty because property taken as well as Irish investments would certainly be one half of the lot.  It would hardly be worth while continuing death duties at all, if the amendment were accepted. As far as I understand the Common Market requirements, they do not prefer division in taxation as between foreign and home investments so it would be a bad thing to do a thing like this.</P>

      <P>It would look like a trick to get there in time.  At the moment, we could hardly afford to forego the income that is derived and that would be done away with if we were to accept the amendment.  My reply is that we cannot afford it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister slid amendment No. 4 through a little bit too quickly.  Amendment No. 4 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Imposition of Duties (No. 108) (Used Omnibuses) Order, 1961, <Col N="1531" /> and the Imposition of Duties (No. 123) (Tobacco) Order, 1962, are hereby confirmed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was in substitution for Section 10 of the Bill which referred in the first part only to the Imposition of Duties (No. 108) (Used Omnibuses) Order, 1961.  I certainly never heard the Minister, when he was giving his explanation of the amendment, referring to the fact that the amendment also covered the Tobacco Order.  I cannot say whether the Minister said it or not, but I certainly never heard him.  If I had heard him, I would have made the point that I objected for the reasons I quoted earlier as to the Imposition of Duties Act being used for the purpose of revenue duties.  In case the Minister might suggest at a later stage that, because I had not challenged the amendment, I was accepting it, I would <Col N="1532" /> ask your leave, Sir, to move on this, the Report Stage, that the words &ldquo;and the Imposition of Duties (No. 123) (Tobacco) Order, 1962&rdquo; be deleted.</P>

      <P>The arguments we had last night on Section 9 will apply generally, I think, to Section 10 also. I want to make one point dealing with the remarks of the Minister, that is, that there are more dancehalls in Dublin than cinemas.  The majority of these dancehalls have no facilities for running licensed dances but some of them do.  Many young people would not attend a dance if it were licensed.  They object to attending dances where people take drink.  On the other hand, there are people who prefer to have refreshments during a dance.  There are two distinct types of dancehalls and people who frequent them.  Therefore, I think the observation of the Minister last night, that by accepting the amendments we were seeking under Section 9 we would, in effect, be forcing a situation where drink would be freely sold to all young people attending dances.  There are two completely different situations.</P>
      <P>I should not like it to be thought that even a large section of the people attending these dances go exclusively for the purpose of obtaining drink outside the permitted hours.  My experience in running such dances has been that about 5 per cent. of the total attendance go exclusively for that purpose.  I should say about 35 per cent. could not care less whether drinking facilities are there or not and the other 60 per cent. wish to combine dancing with refreshments and have a drink, perhaps, after a fast dance to restore their energies for further dancing.  I take it the Minister will examine the arguments that we put forward last night on Section 9 in respect of Section 10 also and that will save us having to go over them again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to suggest that to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Minister's contention on this matter, I wonder could it not be arranged by all the dancehalls concerned that tickets for licensed ballrooms could <Col N="1536" /> not be purchased a half-an-hour before the publichouses close?  I say that because I am conscious of the fact that the Minister is concerned about the young people attending dances but I do not accept for a moment his contention that if you do not have drink at dances the young people are all right.  While my colleague, Deputy Kyne, referred to class legislation there is no denying that young people whether in the socially exclusive set or of the ordinary working class are still young people.  What intrigues me is that young people who can afford to go out and enjoy themselves, be they 18, 19 or 20, may do so but the young working-class person may not do it unless they have a meal at the dance.</P>
      <P>To me that proves conclusively that we are separating people and discriminating. I hold that young people, if they are exposed to things that are wrong, can be exposed to them whether at the ordinary &ldquo;hop&rdquo; or the hunt ball.  If we were to pursue the Minister's line of reasoning we would not afford an opportunity to the people who promote hunt balls to operate because you find that it is they who most misbehave.  That has been proved down the years.  The debs who fly in from England decide to &ldquo;live it up&rdquo; and take liberties with the staff, insult them and even throw water over them or douse them with champagne.  Our young people do not do that.  If we are setting out to deter that social set let us not take it out on our own people.  I cannot understand how the deb set are afforded every conceivable opportunity to enjoy themselves simply because they are going to dance in a hotel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can say quite truthfully that they are the people that the organisation that I represent has had most difficulty with, the people to whom we have had to refuse service and not the working people who go to the ordinary &ldquo;hop&rdquo;. These people who cause difficulty are foreign to us.  They decide to come <Col N="1537" /> here and feel they will show us how to &ldquo;live it up&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that this only affects commercial dancehalls.  I would ask the Minister if he had to divide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The licence attached to the Shelbourne Hotel, for instance, applies to the whole house and I understand the licence attached to the Metropole Ballroom applies to the whole house and that the same is true in the case of Clery's.  Here is a situation where, if one is to have a dance, whether in the Shelbourne, the Gresham, the Royal Hibernian or in any one of the hotels one is all right but if you decide to operate in Clery's it is different&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly the same provisions apply to both.  The Metropole Ballroom would be in exactly the same position as the Shelbourne or the Gresham under Section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that the hotels concerned are establishments in which they have made it a condition that you must wear evening dress to attend any of the dances.  In the Metropole or Clery's there is no such condition on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understand how people aspire to certain standards and it is not unnatural for the working man or woman to aspire to be as good as the fellow they see going in dressed up and wearing his dickie-bow.  The Metropole and Clery's afford that type of person that opportunity and in those circumstances we find that unless the <Col N="1538" /> aspirant is prepared to dig further into his pocket and pay for a substantial meal he will not be allowed to enter into that way of living.  That is completely wrong because we are setting out to accommodate a set of people who do not deserve to be accommodated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>A great number of people would much prefer not to dress up.  They do not believe in convention. A considerable number of people will say to themselves if they are thinking of going to a staff dance: what will it cost me?  Here is a condition attached to an ordinary factory dance.  There are some factory dances at which meals are served but there is a tremendous number&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I could name a multiplicity of them where there is no meal. What they want is what the Minister describes as a &ldquo;hop&rdquo;.  These people will now be told: &ldquo;If you want to enjoy yourself the way you did before, you must dress yourself up; you must buy a meal whether you like it or not <Col N="1539" /> and go to more expense.&rdquo;  These people cannot afford that type of expense.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this I should mention.  The best-behaved people are ordinary working-class people.  This section conveys to me a suggestion that the only young people who can behave themselves at a dance are the social set, the people with money.  I say that because it is being made a condition that they must have a meal; in other words, if they can afford a meal, they are well-behaved but if they cannot afford a meal and do not have a meal, they are ill-behaved. That is something I cannot understand because there is proof positive in existence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is over-simplifying the case.  It is not just that they should have a substantial meal.  It must be a special function organised by a particular group or association; in other words, the type of function we have in mind is the ordinary staff dance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from those running staff dances, as was submitted to the Minister under Section 9 and as applies to Section 10, there are many organisations who arrange dances. They cannot be described as staff dances but these organisations are doing a great deal of work.  Deputy Lemass referred to his union's benevolent fund.  We run two dances every year in aid of my union's benevolent fund.  Were we not to run them we could not extend to our members the benefits we are extending at the moment.  Where shall we get the money from now?  Where shall we get the customers from?  We cannot expect people who ordinarily support us to come now and, in addition to paying their admission fee, to pay for a meal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That will drive business away and it will have a serious effect on people.  I am not saying it is the Minister's intention but it brings out this contention that there is class legislation being introduced in this <Col N="1540" /> way, knowingly or unknowingly.  We cannot forget that the people who are being particularly accommodated, who are given <i>carte blanche</i> to do what they like, are the people who are well-heeled. That is very wrong because whether you have money or not or whether you are young or old, your behaviour will depend on your make-up. There is no use in saying: &ldquo;Keep certain sections away.&rdquo;  In this connection we think in terms of young people.  There is a considerable number of wolves in this town who, by way of money, try to induce young people to go the wrong way.  Take the ordinary fellow who cannot keep up with all this and who has to compete with the fellow who is well-heeled and who will say: &ldquo;I will dress you up and we will go to the Shelbourne.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a dance without a bar suits a young fellow with less money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the person himself decide and not introduce a situation where you say: &ldquo;That is for you but not for you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for the working class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is entirely wrong in this age.  I wish to draw attention to this fact.  I can well understand the Minister's desire to regulate and the importance of regulating things perhaps in rural Ireland.  Perhaps there is a great need for regulation there.  I am not saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; in that connection but I can only repeat that there is no need for such regulation in the county borough of Dublin. Deputy Lemass referred to the agitation that brought this whole thing about but such agitation was only worked up outside Dublin city.  The people who are responsible for it can be appeased and satisfied without interfering with Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin city, there are only two restaurants to which licences are attached.  The other ballrooms have not got licences attached.  The two restaurants to which licences are attached have been proven to be <Col N="1541" /> exemplary in their performance and have given absolute satisfaction to the locals and the tourists.  Apart from being local attractions they are tourist attractions.  It is the working man's aspiration to mix in such places about which he has only read before.  They are as well kept as a star hotel ballroom and the people who control them have had no complaint either from customers or from the authorities.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is extremely unfair, if this measure is necessary to regulate things in regard to people who are misbehaving, to include people who are well-behaved, to include people whose business is well-conducted and who are not only looking after the interests and the desires of the citizens of Dublin and visitors to Dublin but also paying substantial rates and taxes, paying satisfactory wages under good working conditions and who will undoubtedly, if this section is passed, have to lay off labour.  It is wrong that that should happen.  I believe it is quite wrong to compare those establishments with ballrooms which do not exercise the same vigilance at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like for a moment to take the Minister's mind away from the city of Dublin.  Dublin will always be able to look after itself. I should like the Minister to consider the position in rural Ireland.  Some few years ago, dance halls were relieved of tax.  As a result of that, dance halls sprang up all over the country.  These are first-class halls bringing bands from all parts of Ireland and even England.  People travel miles to dance in these halls.  In one case I know, a great deal of money went into the building of a dance hall; it is situated within 14 miles of Limerick and not alone do double decker buses bring the people out to the dance hall but special trains are run also.  Anyone who wishes can verify the facts for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now none of these dance halls has kitchens attached.  If the Minister, therefore, persists with this section these people will have to provide cooking facilities.  I put it to the Minister that the type of meal that will be <Col N="1542" /> served for 5/- in one of these dance halls would approximate very closely to what one might get for 1/- in the middle of the day, when the overall costs are taken into calculation.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this provision about the serving of meals.  In the area from which I come, the usual dress at these dances is a blouse and skirt.  We do not go for these highfalutin dress dances.  They may be popular in Dublin.  I am talking for the rural areas.</P>

      <P>Indeed, he is not.  He is right on the point.  If I am not, will you tell me who is?  I know what I am talking about.  I am not talking about the hunt balls and the people who patronise them.  They are the people who misbehave themselves.  The Minister is well aware of that.  Prosecutions have been taken as a result of the conduct of these people, with their red coats and their riding crops.  I want to cater for the ordinary people who may be working all day in a factory, behind a counter, or down at the docks.  I see no reason why these people should have to pay an extra charge of 5/-for a meal they do not want.  All they want to do is dance and enjoy themselves. They do not want a sit-down meal or a running buffet.</P>

I want the worker to be provided for, the ordinary man and woman, the young boy and girl.  They are entitled to their drink just the same as the member of the hunt club who can pay a bit more for the hunt club dance.  I want the people who have the annual staff dance to have the same facilities as the members of the hunt.  We must cater for the ordinary people.  We must meet their needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, the Minister said&mdash;and he has said it again today&mdash;that he wants to save the young people and to restrict drinking at these dances.  He should be careful about such statements or about such policies. That is the policy that will drive the people into what we call bootlegging.</P>
      <P>I do not say that 90 per cent. of the people who go to dances are looking for drink but 30 or 35 per cent. of them will look for drink at dances and if you take the 35 per cent. away, the dance no longer pays.  The type of dance I am speaking about is a dance in a rural dance hall.  Last night, the Minister and a couple of Deputies alleged that the whole idea was the sale of drink after hours.  I refute that statement.  That is not the idea of those people.  They are reputable people.  They are the secretaries of clubs and of organisations.  Many of these organisations are our national organisations.  The Minister points a finger at the rural dance hall and says it is not licensed to sell drink and that these people should go to a hotel.  I speak for my constituency.  The successful dances run in rural dance halls could not successfully be run in a hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not dealt with in Section 10.  The section deals with ballrooms attached to hotels and restaurants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has brought me to order on the point of licences for ballrooms and restaurants. He will compel people to go into these places.  He will compel people in <Col N="1545" /> these organisations or people responsible for them or for the promotion of dances in rural areas to go to these places.  The main thing the Minister is doing is pricing the dances out of existence.  When these hotels say what they will charge for the spread, which the Minister says they must charge for, it will be found that the dance will cost 6/-, 7/- or 8/- and the spread will cost 5/-, or maybe more. That will mean 14/- a head and people will attend the dance and be told they can have supper.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that 75 to 80 per cent. of the young people going to dances do not want supper for these short dances.  These dances are advertised as from, say, 9 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. The people do not start arriving in any numbers until about 10.30 p.m.  If you are to have this long supper, then you will have had it.</P>
      <P>It may be said that in the hotels which could not cater for a big number for the supper during those hours there can be a running buffet.  Why should we compel people to pay 5/- for a running buffet?  It has been said and reiterated, as if it were a kind of disgraceful thing, that a great number of our organisations and clubs throughout the country are dependent on running dances for funds.  They are dependent on them.  I am a member of several organisations.  We look forward with great interest to seeing how much we shall get.  I told the Minister last night of dances that are run for the political organisation to which I belong and I am sure the same thing applies to the Minister's political organisation. He will not do them any good, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, even at this late hour, to show the members of his own Party who have appealed to him and the members of the various Parties in Opposition some kind of tolerance&mdash;&ldquo;leniency&rdquo; is not the word. I hope we live in a democracy.  The Minister must realise that there is a great section of opinion&mdash;maybe the majority section if it were all counted up, judging from some of the speeches by Government Deputies&mdash;in favour of tolerance.  The Minister should show a little more tolerance not only to the <Col N="1546" /> members of the House but also to the people in the organisations I have mentioned and to the people who promote such dances in the rural areas.  The case for Dublin was very ably put by Deputy Mullen, who is a man in a position to state the facts.</P>

I do not believe that all the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, or that even a majority of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, are in favour of this section.  It speaks well for the forcefulness of the Minister when addressing a Party meeting that he was able to get away with this.  As time passes in regard to this Bill, I think a great number of the Minister's colleagues are wakening up to the fact that this section needs a bit of over-hauling. If the Minister would only say that he is prepared to meet us, we will show the Minister much more tolerance than the Minister has shown to us.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the Minister's intention to reconsider this section in relation to Section 9, I feel there are some points which I should put to him for his consideration.  I notice that the Minister laid particular emphasis on the fact that under this section we are dealing with hotel and restaurant ballrooms.  May I respectfully, and not in any aggressive way, direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that it is not many years since the ordinary working man was deprived of the opportunity of going into a hotel or restaurant ballroom, due to force of circumstances, unless to do a job such as repairing a boiler, and so on. Thank God, the working man is now coming into this way of living and he wants to participate in it.  I am satisfied that this section will put what the working man desired beyond his reach again.  It will undo his achievement of taking his place in social life.</P>

Finally, I want to say that the Minister told Deputy Lynch across the House that I may be out of touch. I am so much in touch with workers connected with this section of the Bill that I am fully conscious of the fact that what they have submitted to me is absolutely correct and that some 250 of them will lose their employment if Section 10 is passed in its present form. I am very pleased to hear that the Minister is disposed towards giving consideration to the submissions made to him in relation to Section 9 and Section 10.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before Section 11, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where, on application to it under Section 9 of this Act or Section 5 of the Act of 1927 the District Court is satisfied that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a festival consisting wholly or mainly of the presentation of performances of music, dancing or plays or showings of films or of any combination of such performances or showings is being held, and</P>
      <P>(b)  a <i>bona fide</i> club has been formed by the organisers of the festival the members of which are either persons performing at the festival or persons paying a single subscription the payment of which entitles them to attend each event of the festival or each event of a particular class, being a class constituting a significant part of the festival, and</P>
      <P>(c)  a social function is being held at a place that is either a place to which no licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor is attached or is a hotel or restaurant by the members of the club, being a function that takes place during the period of the festival or a function that begins on the last day of the festival and ends on that day or on the day following that day,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the Court may, notwithstanding anything contained in section 9 of this Act, or Section 5 of the Act of 1927, and irrespective of whether or not a substantial meal is to be served to persons attending the function, grant, upon such conditions as it thinks proper, either an occasional licence or a special exemption order, as may be appropriate, authorising the person making the application (being, in the case of an application for an occasional licence, the holder of an on-licence and, in the case of an application for a special exemption order, the holder of an on-licence <Col N="1549" /> for the premises to which the application relates) to sell at the place at which the function is being held, during such times and (subject to subsection (5) of section 9 of this Act or subsection (3) of section 5 of the Act of 1927) on such day or days as may be specified in the licence or order, as the case may be, such intoxicating liquor as he is authorised to sell by the on-licence aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(2)  It shall be a condition of an occasional licence or special exemption order granted in relation to a social function by virtue of this section that the sale of intoxicating liquor pursuant to the licence or order be confined to members of the club by whom the function is being held and to persons holding an invitation to the function (being a written invitation stating the name of the person invited issued not later than twenty-four hours before the commencement of the function) from the organisers of the festival during which the function is being held, that a list of the names of the members of the club and the persons invited to the function be kept by the organisers of the festival, that the list be open to inspection by the Garda Síochána and that the function be held in compliance with the relevant provisions of Section 9 of this Act and Section 5 of the Act of 1927 and of this section.</P>
    <P>(3)  An occasional licence or special exemption order shall not be granted for a social function by virtue of this section unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the organisers of the festival during which the function is being held support the application.</P>
    <P>(4)  An application shall not be granted by virtue of this section in respect of more than one social function on any day in relation to any festival.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section `hotel' and `restaurant' have the meanings assigned to them by the Act of 1927&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> This amendment deals with a fairly simple and straightforward matter. Deputies will recall that in recent years a number of towns and cities have been very successful in promoting various international festivals of one sort or another.  There are, for instance, the Cork International Film Festival, the Dublin Theatre Festival, and so on.  Very strong representations have been made to me by the bodies concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Dare I forget Waterford?  Strong representations have been made to me by the organisations concerned and by Bord Fáilte that a very important part of these international festivals is the club which normally operates during the period of the festival.  I understand that in the case of a theatre festival the club is open to the visiting participants and dignataries of one sort or another and that the atmosphere and the sociability of these clubs has become an essential feature of the festival.  Indeed, it is one of the principal things which contribute to the success of these international festivals.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 is to enable these clubs to operate.  As the law stands at present, and as the Bill is framed, it would not be possible to organise or operate a club of this nature in connection with one of these international festivals.  The purpose of the amendment is to enable them to be run in future in connection with these international festivals.  There are, of course, the usual safeguards to make sure that they must be operated and run on a <i>bona fide</i> basis.</P>

      <P>I have no particular objection to this amendment.  The type of club referred to by the Minister, so far as Dublin is concerned, is undoubtedly run in conjunction with important festivals.  In regard to attendance at these clubs, if you are interested in the week's events you can become a member of the club on payment of a fee.  The reason I mention that is that it is a matter that if you have the money you can be accommodated. I want to draw the Minister's <Col N="1551" /> attention to the fact that whilst I have no objection to the idea it still proves the point we made on earlier sections.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 20 is not moved.  Might I just make it clear, in case Deputies have forgotten, that the amendment was not moved because it was part of a composite proposal which was in fact disposed of when the hours were accepted on Section 2?</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 not moved.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20a:</P>
      <P>Before Section 11 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, on the passing of this Act it shall be an offence to serve in a public dance hall intoxicating liquor to any person who is under twenty-one years of age.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to prevent owners of dance halls in the rural areas from running dances solely for the sale of drink.  As I explained before, generally at these dances free <Col N="1552" /> tickets are given out to a number of people up to 11 o'clock.  When the band arrives they appoint a member of it to be in charge of the dance hall.  The owner goes behind the bar and sells drink until 4 o'clock in the morning. No one is employed other than a local man at the door and some of the patrons may assist with the serving of the drink.</P>
    <P>In regard to many of our dance halls in Dublin, where there is proper supervision, there are no complaints.  Some Deputies have already pointed out that dance halls were built in rural areas a few hundred yards outside the borough boundary in order to avoid the tax on tickets.  We have a large number of halls in my constituency where no drink is served and no person is allowed in under the influence of drink. In parts of Ireland, there are people who have dances in their places merely for the purpose of the sale of intoxicating liquor.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask why the young people attend dances in rural areas.  The answer is that the nearest dance hall to them might be 15 or 16 miles away.  People in the rural areas have no other alternative but to attend the dances in the rural districts.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must have received complaints in regard to young people being served with intoxicating drink because there is no supervision. The owner stays behind the bar and so long as you can come up with the money, you are supplied with drink until 4 o'clock in the morning.  The purpose of my amendment is to prevent any young person being supplied with intoxicating liquor.  The onus should be put on the owner of the hall.  The committees of football clubs which run dances take every precaution and provide proper supervision, but there are many clubs where the individual himself runs the dance during the season.  By my amendment, I am endeavouring to ensure that there is proper supervision so that no young person will be supplied with drink.  Having ventilated the matter in this House, I am sure that the people who run these dance halls will know that there is a large body of <Col N="1553" /> opinion not in favour of the manner in which those dance halls are supervised at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have much preferred to have waited to hear the views of other Deputies.  I take it that the Deputy's amendment is for the purpose of ensuring that intoxicating liquor is not supplied to people under 21 years of age.  I cannot agree with the amendment.  It seems laudable, but in practice I cannot agree with it.  A person of 21 years of age is more than an adult.  In the eyes of the law, he is three years beyond that stage.  It would be a funny thing if a married man having a family of three or four children were refused a drink at a dance.</P>
      <P>I have always argued that a person of 18 years of age should have the vote.  It is a funny thing that they are denied the franchise until they are 21 years of age, but if there were any trouble in this country, they would be conscripted and would have to go out and die for their country.

The law at present prohibits the sale of alcohol to persons under 18 years of age in public houses and on licensed premises generally.  I think that is even difficult enough to enforce at times. Apart altogether from the question which Deputy Sherwin raised as to the responsibility of a person at the age of 21, there is the over-riding consideration in this that it would be impossible to enforce the proposal.  There is no point in our putting provisions into the Bill which we know could not and would not be enforced.  I am not saying that I do not sympathise with what Deputy Everett has in mind.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider his amendment and to alter one word in it.  In the third last line, I would ask him to substitute for the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; the word &ldquo;area&rdquo;.  That would meet my case.  This section applies mainly to the market and dock areas in Dublin.  Under the existing Act a number of licensees in the dock area did not apply for exemption orders. If this amendment is accepted, those people who did not apply for exemption orders, or those who might purchase the premises concerned, will be prevented in the future from applying for exemption orders.  I say that would be an interference with their <Col N="1556" /> rights.  It is not my purpose to increase the number of licensed houses entitled to open but I think it would be an injustice to the licensees who did not apply heretofore for exemption orders and, of course, to their successors.  The Minister's amendment denies such people for all time the right to apply for exemption orders.</P>

      <P>I would point out that the substitution suggested by Deputy Barron would be meaningless because a general exemption order can be secured only in respect of a particular premises.  It would not mean anything if we inserted the word &ldquo;area&rdquo; in this section.  That is really the technicality of the matter.  Apart from that, I disagree with Deputy Barron.  It is my intention to prevent any further general exemption orders being granted in this way.  Deputies know well the history of this matter. It was my original intention to abolish these early morning openings in the dock area altogether.  I came to that conclusion because my predecessor was approached by the Trade Union Congress to do exactly that because the Trade Union Congress felt these early morning openings were undesirable and should be abolished.  My predecessor agreed to do that but subsequently the technical arrangements necessary to give effect to that intention turned out to be unsuitable.  In fact, we were not able to give effect to the intention of my predecessor, and when approaching this Bill, I set out to remedy that situation and to give effect to what was the intention of my predecessor, at the instance of the Trade Union Congress.</P>

      <P>It was represented to me that the proposal to abolish these early morning openings should not be proceeded with and the very valid case was made to me that in the dock area particularly the only food, shelter and wramth available to these early morning workers were provided in these licensed premises.  I then reconsidered the whole question and, having special regard to the wishes of the Congress of Irish Trade Unions, I decided readily not to the proceed with the proposal to abolish the early morning openings. I was concerned overall with the point of view and the interest of the workers but I now feel that the situation is adequately catered for by the number of licensed premises which already have exemption orders.</P>

      <P>I think the reason given by Deputy Barron was one of the principal reasons which compelled the Minister to take the dock areas out of the arrangement whereby people could secure drink early in the morning.  It was happening that you had people <Col N="1558" /> cashing in on that arrangement.  I agree with the Minister that the demand is very well met as it stands at the moment.  He is right when he says that representations were made to him by the Congress of Irish Trade Unions to have the section as it is now.  Had the Minister done what he proposed to do initially people coming from the dock areas might have to go to the markets to have a drink.  The Minister has met the point of view expressed by the Congress of Irish Trade Unions in a reasonable manner.  Were he to go further than he is going the whole thing would be wide open to abuse.</P>

There were strong representations made by the local workers and we are very pleased at the Minister's concession and we are pleased that there should be no further extension.  Some people should have priority.  That is the nature of things and it is also the nature of things that those who are there first should have it.  The section mentions those who had the exemption order prior to April, and what I should like to know is how many have got exemption orders within the last two years and how many will be deprived of them?  The Bill states: &ldquo;In respect of premises on the 1st day of April, 1962, or at any time during the two years immediately preceding that date&rdquo;.  Does that mean that you must have held the exemption order two years previously?</P>

      <P>On this matter there are four points to which the Minister should give consideration.  I agree with what Deputy Barron has said.  You have the early morning opening hour from 7 o'clock and the next closing hour is 2.30 p.m.  Great play has been made in this House by Deputies on both sides that 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. opening on Sunday is too long.  I ask is 7 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. too long?  Representations have been made to me by certain publicans in the area that a closing hour should be imposed at 9 a.m. or 9.30 a.m. because 50 per cent. of the people who use these early <Col N="1559" /> morning houses are people going home early in the morning.  You will often see more people in dress suits in these places than people in working clothes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In other areas where there is early morning opening, you often have more dress suits than working suits.  A second closing hour should be created for these houses that open at 7 o'clock in the morning.  I suggest also that there is a certain amount of discrimination if you permit these publicans to hold an early morning licence and prevent other houses situated much closer to the dock area from getting a licence.  There may have been several reasons why these people did not apply for a licence originally.  I suggest that in Parnell Street there is one publican who has an early morning licence because he is catering for the dock area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It seems unfair to me that all the houses in the street that are opponents in regard to business cannot avail of a similar licence.  That is unfair discrimination.  It would be difficult also to set a limit to the dock area.  Who is qualified to define where the dock area begins and where it ends?  I would also suggest to the Minister that these people who are anxious to trade earlier than the normal hours in the city should be permitted to have 13 consecutive hours trading.  If they want to open at 7 a.m. let them close at 8 p.m.; if they want to open at 9 a.m. let them close at 10 p.m.  That would make for more equitable distribution of trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present moment there are 50 or 60 houses in the dock area.  As a result of that not one of them is doing <Col N="1560" /> a great business.  If there were staggered hours in the dock areas the houses that would avail of the 7 a.m. opening would do a good business while they were open.  They would be closed at 8 p.m. and then the other houses would do a good business. There is no sense in saying that a trader can close when he likes.  Any trader is forced to do what his opponent in business does, otherwise he will lose his trade.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider imposing a second closing hour for the early morning openers, that there is a certain amount of discrimination if publicans are not allowed to apply for early morning opening, that limits should be made to the dock areas and that where this concession is given publicans should be confined to 13 consecutive hours.</P>

      <P>The amendment has two objectives. First, it will have the effect of permitting a six-day licensee to open for unlicensed business on Sunday mornings. As Deputies know, the Bill contains a provision whereby licensed premises will be entitled to open for unlicensed business for a period of threequarters of an hour on Sunday mornings.  The idea is to enable them to sell papers, cigarettes and so on to the people coming from first Mass. What I now propose is that that facility should be made available to the six-day licensee also.  That is only fair and equitable.  The second part of the amendment is consequential on the deletion of Section 15 from the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>Before section 15 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 12A of the Act of 1927 (which was inserted by the Act of 1960 and relates to limited restaurant certificates) is hereby amended as follows:</P>
      <P>by the deletion in paragraph (a) of subsection 6 of the following words: `but not otherwise'.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the Act of 1960 and deals with restaurant certificates. After the passing of the Act, there was a lot of confusion, possibly among the police authorities, as to the definition of the premises which would ordinarily be used for the serving of meals and which would not be ordinarily be used for the serving of drink; in other words, that food would be the main business done in that part of the premises.  I suggest to the Minister, in view of his statement introducing the Bill, that if it were possible to close off that part of the premises that would expose drink for sale, the part of the premises that would ordinarily be used for the sale of food would qualify for a limited restaurant certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement introducing the Bill, the Minister recommended that licensed houses should go into food, provide substantial meals for the public and, thereby, help the tourist industry. It should be made possible for houses catering on those lines to avail of opportunities to serve the public. When speaking on the 1960 Bill, the Minister's predecessor, the then Deputy Traynor, assured me that a part of the premises ordinarily used for the sale and consumption of drink would not comply.  But when the Bill was put into operation, I was in several licensed premises where all the bottles you wanted to consume were displayed and exposed.  Possibly, there was a little bit of chicken wire in front of them, but this complied with the section.  I suggest that if some sort of roller shutter were installed and the <Col N="1562" /> bar premises closed off, they would then qualify for a limited restaurant certificate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the position is this: We have the licensed premises and then we have the attached restaurant with a limited restaurant certificate.  I think this is the situation which with the Deputy is concerned, but I am not clear whether he is concerned with the restaurant portion to which the limited certificate would attach.  It seems to me the suggestion he made was that in the public house part, as we will call it for convenience, if provision were made whereby the bar could be cut off at a certain stage, persons could remain in that portion of the premises for the serving of food.  I think that would get us into a lot of difficulty.  However, it is something I shall consider.</P>

Section 9 of the 1960 Act, however, stipulated very clearly that the position of the premises to which a certificate could apply should not include a public bar or part of a room in another part of which there is a public bar. The stipulation of the 1960 Act is quite definite and precise in that regard.</P>

      <P>Section 16 deals with licences for greyhound race tracks.  The point has been made to me&mdash;and I imagine it has been made to the Minister also&mdash;that subsection (2), which permits the licensing of greyhound race tracks not only during race meetings but also during sales or trials, leaves the position very vague. Let me confess that I know very little about what happens at greyhound race tracks, but it has been represented to me that as this section is worded, continuous all-day drinking could be permitted. For the reason that sales or trials could go on for an indefinite period, they would not fit in to a limited time such as would be the case where there is a race fixture.</P>
      <P>Under the section as it stands, the licence obtained for a greyhound race track could permit continuous drinking during the day, and while in the ordinary licensed premises the break from 2.30 to 3.30 p.m. will be observed, it would not have to be observed under this section by greyhound race tracks. That point has been made to me and I want to ask the Minister to look into it and see if some limiting definition so far as time is concerned could be imposed for sales and trials as well as races.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that perhaps in Dublin city there is need for a bar at greyhound race tracks, but not outside Dublin city.  I know the Minister's idea about having uniformity in this Bill, but I should like him to understand that in country towns where there are greyhound race tracks the practice has been for people to have a drink in the public house before they go down to the track, and a drink on the way home.  In fact, I have seen that happen over the years and although I do not attend at greyhound race tracks very often, I have seen people get good service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dundalk last Monday night I pulled up outside an office where I interview constituents, and I saw at least six people with greyhounds going <Col N="1565" /> into one or two public houses which had lounges attached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say, but I imagine it was just before the first race.  However, I went into my office and when I had finished, I went into one public house to see what was happening.  I found that race cards were displayed behind the bar and available before the meeting, and that facilities were always given to those people with regard to bringing the dogs into the lounge and that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>I feel that if there were a bar in the Dundalk race track, for instance&mdash;and here I am sticking my neck out because I am sure there are a lot of people in my constituency who would desire to have a bar there&mdash;the capital value of their premises and the opportunity for profit of those publicans to whom I have referred would be impaired. I hold that the person who goes &ldquo;to the dogs&rdquo; in Dundalk is well served as he is, and I do not see any need in a relatively small greyhound race track down the country, such as the one to which I have referred, for a licence.</P>
      <P>If we went right through every section of the Bill, I am sure we would find many occasions where there is a greater need and a greater case for a bar licence.  This should not be considered in any Party way or in any, shall we say, area of argument, but between now and Report Stage, I would ask the Minister to consider amending this section to restrict the granting of licences to greyhound race tracks in specific areas such as the large city areas of Dublin, and perhaps Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was very wise to do this.  I hold the view that if such provisions are made for horse racing, there is no reason why they should not be made for dog racing.  I do not see that there is any danger of interfering with a neighbouring publican.  Under the section, this operates more or less while the meeting is going on, a reasonable time before and a reasonable time after.  I think it would be ridiculous to go on the line that it would take trade away from anyone.</P>
      <P>I am perturbed about the sales.  I am conscious of the fact that race horse sales take place in the morning, and I am told that greyhound sales take place in the evening time or late at night.  I am concerned about ascertaining what would be the finishing time for serving drink at those sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> I welcome the section because it will give employment.  It will afford an opportunity to some of my redundant barmen&mdash;and I hope the Minister will not declare some of them redundant as a result of another section&mdash;to get work at greyhound race tracks and sales.</P>

      <P>Anyone who attends a greyhound race meeting in Dublin knows very well that the dogs must be kennelled half an hour before the commencement of the first race, and usually the first race is at 8 o'clock, so the dogs must be kennelled at 7.30 p.m.  I do not think that 15 minutes before the first race is sufficiently long to have the bar open. I am referring only to the place I know.  There may be different conditions in other parts of the country. There may be tracks far away from public houses.  If people come up from the country with dogs, as most people do, to the Dublin tracks, rather than have them going into licensed premises before they come near the tracks, it would be better if the Minister would consider at least 7.30 opening, half-an-hour before the first race.  That would suit people better and I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <P>I am not a dog fan at all but I can see the sense of what has been said by Deputy Mullen and Deputy Barron.  You cannot be at the dog track and at a public house at the same time so if you want beer you can only get it at the dog track. One point mystifies me and that is the inclusion of the greyhound trials.  I can understand a full public attendance at a greyhound race meeting.  At a greyhound sale only a limited number of the public will be present but at a greyhound trials I cannot imagine anybody being present but the people directly concerned with the dogs.  Where is the need for a licence there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Barron's suggestion to extend the time a little, I am not sure that it would not be worth doing.  That point has been made by quite a few people <Col N="1568" /> since the terms of the Bill were published. One must bear in mind the interests of the local publicans and the proposals in the Bill are framed to ensure that there will not be any, or hardly any, interference with the trade and business because, as Deputy Sherwin rightly pointed out, we are giving licence facilities to the tracks only for a period practically coincidental with the period during which people would be there anyway.  The argument has been made that 15 minutes before the start of the first race is a little too short.  If Deputies agree, I should like to consider that between now and Report Stage and see whether we might make any change.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Donegan's point concerning greyhound tracks outside Dublin, I am not sure he is correct.  First, we have the safeguard that the hours we propose should not necessarily mean any particular interference with the publicans' trade.  I say this to Deputy Donegan who is a well-known sportsman himself.  The greyhound industry is a very important one to the country and one which it is hoped, through the activities of Bord na gCon, will become more important as time goes on.  It is the function of that board, and their objective, to develop this industry.  One of the main ways in which they hope to do that is by providing better tracks, increased facilities and more comfort at the tracks.  This proposal is just such an amenity as Bord na gCon hoped they would be able to provide for the racing public at the tracks.  I do not see why the sportsmen of Dublin should be entitled to this facility at a greyhound race track while sportsmen of Dundalk or elsewhere should be denied it.  It is just as important from the point of view of the greyhound industry that we should build up the tracks outside Dublin and it is just as important to provide facilities at these tracks as it is to do so in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Under Section 16, it seems obvious with this proposal, we are going so far as to say that there are not enough public houses convenient to the tracks to enable people to get drink.  Speaking as one interested in greyhound racing, perhaps more in open coursing than in the tracks, I believe if people are really interested in the sport, the pleasure of the sport itself, plus perhaps the hope of making a few shillings, the couple of hours that they must spend without a drink at night will not break them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's views are in accord with the principles brought in here by Deputy Traynor as Minister, principles that were un-made by the present Minister last night.  The Minister should remember that when he boasts that this Bill is &ldquo;the Bill&rdquo;. He did not say that when Deputy Traynor was here.  This is put forward because of the few hours at night that people may spend at a dog track in Dublin or Cork or other centres.  The public houses are not far away.  For these few hours, if people were really interested in greyhound sport, whether track or open coursing, they would not die of drought for the want of a pint or a &ldquo;half one.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greyhound trials, as we know, have been going on for many years in daytime. It is not a case of perfect timing as in the case of racing.  There will always be delays in kennelling and unkennelling and bringing out the dogs and so on.  This may go on for many hours.  Apparently, according to the Minister's statement the new Board set up to deal with the greyhound industry is very much behind this proposal to provide drinking facilities.  Let me remind the Minister that the greyhound industry was here long before such a Board was set up.  It would be fantastic to suggest that, because one of the prominent factors influencing these proposals is the Greyhound Racing Board, the proposals are right. I believe the reverse could be the case. Trials may go on for many hours. <Col N="1570" /> There is no hurry.  As some Deputies said, they can take place conveniently at hours when the public houses are closed.  Apparently, we must make everything very comfortable for the new patrons of greyhound racing.</P>
    <P>A greyhound sale may also go on for a long while, whether in the evening, early in the day or late at night. With all the talk of sporting facilities and the comforts that we offer with them now, I wonder how did sportsmen exist before.  I oppose this section. I believe there are adequate facilities for people to get drink outside the race-track before they go in and when they come out.  That should be sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Desmond there have not been the dramatic changes in the patronising of greyhound tracks on the establishment of Bord na gCon that the Minister would indicate.  The patrons of greyhound tracks were always able to secure the facilities they required at establishments within easy reach. More dramatic changes have been the abandonment of the country fairs and the establishment of cattle marts. People are there for longer hours than people who are at greyhound tracks. They are there from dawn to dark, and after dark on many occasions. Yet it was found possible to get licensees already established in the licensed trade to provide facilities at these marts without any special public house licence being found necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to indicate that what he proposes to do under Section 16, namely, to install bars in the greyhound tracks, would not affect the licensed trade.  I believe it would and I think it is the function of any Deputy to speak here on behalf of his lowliest constituent, to defend his way of life, and to defend his capital and his business.  I propose to do that for some very few of my constituents, perhaps an unpopular thing to do with a greater number of my constituents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of races at a greyhound meeting is such and the interval between races exactly half what it is at a horse race meeting, namely 15 minutes, is such that nobody has very much time for drinking except just before the races and right up to the end of the races.  At the same time, the provision of these facilities will mean that people will pass public houses where they normally went for a drink.  In the town of Dundalk when I was playing rugby football, we used to come up from the field and go to one of the public houses adjacent to the field.  There are only two public houses, or at the most three or four, but if there were only one, I would still make the case that it is wrong that these facilities should be provided at the greyhound track.  The person who goes to the greyhound track has <Col N="1572" /> not much time to drink and he will normally go to the public house, if there is not a bar at the track.</P>
      <P>Somebody said that people of Dublin city have these facilities and asked why should the people of Clonmel, Dundalk or any other place not have them.  You cannot compare a greyhound track, even one with potentialities for extension, in Clonmel or Dundalk with Shelbourne Park or Harold's Cross.  There you have a vast number of people, and where you have a large number of people, perhaps ten per cent. of them might desire to miss a race or two in order to have a drink.  If you take ten per cent. of the people at a greyhound meeting in Clonmel or Dundalk the result would indicate that there is no reason for a bar in such places.</P>
      <P>The question of trials was raised and, as was indicated in conversation across the House, these trials can go on all day.  When these trials go on all day, it is doubtful that there could be proper supervision.  They cannot supervise in the Bluebell and in various other places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is the harvest of the publican's week.  It is his good night on which he depends.</P>
      <P>When I was interrupted by Deputy Flanagan, I was making the point that there are three or four public houses in Navan which are known and which cater for this trade.

      <P>I should like to mention one fact.  Dogs travel in cars, some of them, particularly greyhounds, <Col N="1574" /> very badly.  Greyhounds seems to know when they are put into a car that, at the end of the journey, they will run in a race.  Giving them a walk up and down the street on the way helps them to relax.  They also relax if whoever is giving them a walk goes into a public house for a drink.  Dogs suffer from tension just as much as Deputies and Ministers.  My case is that in the small greyhound tracks, excluding Dublin, there is no argument for a bar. The Minister is not interested in the small places I am talking about but I am interested in them.</P>

      <P>I do not think the last speaker has read the provisions of the Bill.  Harold's Cross greyhound track is situated in my constituency. When this Bill was first mooted, I consulted the publicans who get a very big trade on the nights that there is greyhound racing.  As soon as the Bill was circulated, I consulted them again. They are perfectly satisfied because the situation is admirably covered by clause (ii) of subsection (2) which says: &ldquo;ending, in the case of a race meeting, at the time at which the last race of the meeting starts...&rdquo;.  No one will be staying on to have a drink after the meeting.  While that provision remains, I cannot see how any of the arguments put forward by the last speaker can be sustained.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Ryan, I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>Before Section 17 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment an off-licence may be granted in respect of any premises in any city or town if within an area of one mile distant from such premises there is the requisite increase in population and the other conditions of the law are satisfied.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the point involved is in connection with the granting of new licences.  At the moment, as the Minister is aware, it is necessary to show an increase of population of 25 per cent. over and above the 1902 Census in the civil parish in which the premises in respect of which the application is brought is situated.  In the city of Dublin, some of the old civil parishes have become extremely populous as, say, the Kimmage-Crumlin area.  However, a situation can arise where a person who is an applicant for a licence, by reason of being slightly outside the area or the boundary of a civil parish and in the next parish, is unable to show the minimum increase in population, whereas the parish <Col N="1576" /> boundary may start on the other side of the road and within the immediate area of the premises more than sufficient increase in population may have taken place.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's amendment does meet the point which Deputy Sweetman was making in his amendment.  There is just one point I should like to be clear on, that is, whether, in amendment No. 32, it is quite clear that a notice to the county registrar is sufficient, even if the actual newspaper notice which is necessary has not been published.  There is a practical difference, in practice, as between Dublin city and rural areas in relation to these applications.  In Dublin, the circuit court is sitting continuously. Certainly, the practice is that the notice to the county registrar is given by means of filing the newspaper notice, which has been inserted, together with a voucher copy of the newspaper.</P>
      <P>In rural areas, where the circuits are not in continuous session, it would be possible to give notice to the county registrar but it would not be possible to insert the newspaper notice because, under the Act, there is a limit&mdash;I think of 28 days&mdash;within which the notice must be served.  I think, from my reading of it, that the ministerial amendment does cover the situation. If that is so, Deputy Sweetman will not press his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some misgivings about subsection (2) which stipulates that a licence shall not be granted in respect of a premises situated less than one mile from a premises which had a licence prior to the passing of the 1960 Act.  A situation that arose as a result of the passing of the 1960 proposal was that two or three people from the same area could <Col N="1579" /> come into court, and have come in, and be granted licences.  In my opinion, the 1960 Act in that respect was a little too wide.  I do not think it is desirable that too many public houses should be created.  It would be better that you should have one good public house catering for a rural area rather than two, three, four or five, none of which is doing sufficient business to carry on as a public house alone.</P>
      <P>I do not think it was the object of the legislature in 1960 to establish too many rural public houses.  What happened in practice was that in many areas because of the way the 1960 provision was framed&mdash;which was in effect that the establishment of the business would have to be proved to be unreasonably detrimental to other businesses already existing in the neighbourhood but it is practically impossible to prove that the establishment of a new public house would be unreasonably detrimental because it is almost impossible to say what is unreasonable&mdash;several people have been able to come along together in respect of the same area and be successful in their application to court.  What I found happening in practice was that many of these places were really not proper public houses but general grocery and hardware stores and they added a licence as a sort of sideline. There is far too much of that in the country, far too much of the type of mixed business in which the public house portion is only a sideline and in which the public do not get the facilities to which they are entitled.  In many cases, these premises have not got the sanitary facilities which would be regarded as a minimum requirement.</P>
      <P>Any encouragement given in this or any other section to the establishment of these mixed places where you can get a licence and add on in the hope of getting a few extra shillings is a step in the wrong direction.  I would urge the Minister to make this subsection considerably stronger than it is at present, to provide both for our own people and tourists a suitable licensed premises in rural areas but not too many of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the one mile should be <Col N="1580" /> extended and I would go further and say&mdash;although I have some misgivings in saying this but at the moment my mind lies in this direction&mdash;that the 4th July, 1960, should be removed and the provision should apply to any licence in existence at present.  Even licences granted pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15, whichever is the relevant section of the 1960 Act, will debar a person from setting up within a mile.  I would suggest three miles. Perhaps three miles would be too much but one mile is too little.  I think the 1960 public house should be included.  I hope the Minister will appreciate that it is better that we should have a reasonable number of licensed premises in rural areas which can cater for the existing and potential trade rather than set up this mixumgatherum type of place of which we already have too many.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I do not agree at all with Deputy Flanagan on this.  One of the best ways of getting service for the public as far as the public house is concerned is competition.  I have seen a single licensed premises in a locality where the service was anything but satisfactory and as a result of a second license being created inside a mile, both premises are now first-class.  The new premises is a first-class structure and the result was that the other premises had to improve. If we do not provide opposition for the existing public houses, and unless we bring in punitive measures they will not exert themselves and give the service which Deputy Flanagan and everybody else wishes to see.</P>
      <P>I am not at all in favour of being dogmatic in regard to one or one and a half miles.  That question should be left to the courts to establish because if there were a big influx of people into a locality in a rural area&mdash;I cannot give a good example how it would happen at the moment as conditions are so bad in rural Ireland&mdash;but if there were a big influx and if there were only one licensed premises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not unless you get the 25 per cent. increase.  Say you got a 20 per cent. increase?  That is why it should be left to the discretion of the courts in a matter of that nature. As far as the mile or mile and a half or two miles is concerned, nowadays transport cuts out many of the advantages or disadvantages so there should be no limit at all.  If an application is made to a court by a person who is considered suitable to have a licensed premises and the people of the locality would like to see a premises in the area, he should not be debarred because this House suggested a mile and a rigid line is laid down that a mile is the limit and that there cannot be another premises inside that.</P>
      <P>You are acting in favour of the hotels in this regard because you can get a hotel licence, I presume, under this if you have the ten bedrooms and applied for it.  I believe there are people in rural areas who may not go in for the hotel business but who will provide meals and who will give first-class meals in accommodation attached to the licensed premises.  If there were such an application to the court and evidence given that meals were to be provided as in some of the top-class public houses in Dublin I think a licence is justifiable in the circumstances where the question of the hotel does not arise at all.  The Minister himself is in favour, and rightly so, of seeing that meals are provided in licensed premises so that the customer can drink and have a meal in a civilised fashion.  You will encourage that by removing this restriction of the mile.  Unless the Minister has very strong reasons for bringing it in, he should get rid of it.</P>
      <P>I have a feeling&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash; that again it is a matter of vested interests. To satisfy every publican, the Minister would want to bring in a special licensing law to suit each one of them.  The public should count more than the individual publican.  As I said, I may be wrong, but I think pressure is being brought to bear on the Minister to the effect that this will be hard on existing publicans.  I do not think it will be.  If the Minister leaves it as it is, he will taken them up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies will readily realise the purpose for which Section 17 is intended.  The 1960 Act provided that it would be possible by extinguishing two licences to get a new licence in certain circumstances. The thinking behind that proposal in the 1960 Act was quite clear.  Indeed, it had reference to a recommendation made by the Liquor Commission.  That Commission had in mind the less well catered for areas in the country, particularly in the west of Ireland.  The idea was that where rural Ireland was badly catered for in regard to licensing facilities&mdash;it could not, of course, show the increase of 25 per cent. in the population which would enable a licence to be granted under the other provision in the 1902 Act then you could get a new licence in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>Of course what happened was something that could not have been visualised. Admittedly, the process mentioned by Deputy McQuillan took place which did have a beneficial effect in a number of limited areas where the advent of a new licensee made the existing licensee or licensees buck up and improve their premises and so on.  In fact, the facilities provided for the public were very considerably increased, improved and augmented.</P>
      <P>As against that, it did work out unfairly in a number of cases. In fact, what was happening was that applications were being made for new licences in the already well catered for areas, on the outskirts of Dublin city, for instance, and so on.  The provision was not being availed of to any extent to provide the facilities it was meant to provide for the rural areas.  You had cases where the thing worked unfairly.  In all this there is this background.  There is a whole legislative process existing in this country for the protection of what are called the equities of existing licensees. All our liquor legislation has always recognised the principle that in so far as it is possible, the existing equities, in other words, the existing vested interests, should be protected.  That applies to the licensed trade.  It does not apply to any other trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To a large extent, it did.  We do not protect chemists, butchers or grocers.  Anybody can come along and open a grocer's shop but there is that element in our legislation in this matter that the existing equities are preserved.  Of course, premises have changed hands on that basis, so that whatever we may think about the validity of that situation, it is there.  To interfere with it in any serious way at this stage would not be a just or equitable thing to do.  If we were to start all over again, I should be inclined to approach the situation differently.  Since that is the situation as we find it, the principle is that in so far as possible we protect existing equities.</P>
      <P>That also has the other overriding situation attached to it.  You do not, so far as you can possibly avoid it, have an unnecessary creation of new licences.  Therefore, when you come to apply that particular criticism to this situation, you find that this provision, which was meant to have certain beneficial effects in the rural areas, was working out to the detriment of publicans who were providing a reasonable service to the public and catering adequately for the needs of the areas in which they were situated. Instead of having one good licensed premises in an area able to keep its head above water, you have two competing for existing business.  It is almost impossible to establish that the granting of the new licensing arrangement would be unreasonably detrimental to the existing licence.  It works two ways.  Deputy McQuillan points to the area where the advent of the new licence improved the situation but, in fact, what happened more often was that the advent of the new licence disimproved the situation because you had two or, perhaps, three licensees now competing for the same business.</P>

Today in rural Ireland a public house during summer time might not sell drink until 9 o'clock at night.  In the winter time, the fellows on the road might or might not have money.  I do not know what the experience of Deputy McQuillan is in County Roscommon but I know from my own experience in Limerick that publicans are very tightly put and few of them get a living out of the public house alone.  For that reason, I would say that the mile does not cover what is needed in the particular area from which I come.  I would extend that to three miles at the very least.</P>

Under the 1960 Act, it was made mandatory to purchase two existing licences before a new one was issued.  That led to a rush.  That is all over and done with now.  As these licences are bought up, they will go up in value and there will be less of a problem as far as the Minister is concerned in the city areas and the large centres.  People will not be as anxious to buy the licences because the licence will get dearer.  On that basis, it will be only in isolated cases that such licences will be purchased.</P>

      <P>The problem arose as a result of the rigid enforcement of the 1960 Act.  There are many parts of the country where, traditionally, ponies and traps are put into the yards of licensed premises while people are attending Mass, and, of course, the rigid enforcement of the 1960 Act prevented people from doing this, since the yards were part of the licensed premises.  We feel that was never intended under the 1960 Act.  It resulted in a lot of inconvenience to people in certain areas and we are proposing to set it right now.  From now on, a man will be able to stable his horse in the yard of licensed premises.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36 in the names of Deputies Ryan, O'Keeffe and Clinton:</P>
      <P>Before Section 24 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment a holder of a beer only off-licence shall be deemed on the passing of this Act to be the holder of a spirits off-licence <Col N="1589" /> subject to the same conditions as are now applicable to spirits off-licences.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the subject matter of this amendment. I understand that it relates only to the city of Dublin and here there are 264 beer off-licences throughout the country and 258 spirit off-licences. The difference between the number who hold spirit licences and the number who hold beer licences amounts to only six.  It is suggested in the amendment that as there are only six beer off-licences they should be put into the same position as the spirit licences and, if necessary, that there should be some fine, or premium or payment imposed on them for the privilege. That satisfies the Minister's principle of uniformity and as there are so few people involved I would suggest that he look at it and see if the proposition might be acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I should like to put a point to the Minister. Under the 1960 Act as referred to in this section the only people permitted to be on licensed premises after normal closing hours would be the holder of the licence, the owner of the premises, a person to whom intoxicating liquor may legally be sold or supplied, a person carrying out construction work or alterations to the premises, or a person in the employment of the holder of the licence or the owner of the premises and who is permitted to be there in the ordinary course of such employment, or a resident on the premises, or an officer of Customs and Excise who is there in the course of his duty.  It would be desirable in the interests of the licensed trade, the hotel business and the licensed restaurant business that a subsection should be added to that providing that an employee employed <Col N="1590" /> there at the time would be permitted by his employer to purchase a drink after he finishes work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the employer giving him the drink?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well but when you have 25 or 50 people employed in a hotel you could not expect the employer to stand them drinks but often after a big function the staff are permitted by the hotel owner to purchase a drink or two within reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>He may but he permits them to buy a drink as well.  Any employer will permit his staff to buy a drink after they have finished work and I think that such people should not be subject to prosecuion.  I think the matter was overlooked in the 1960 Act and now that the Minister has decided to bring in a new Bill he should include this provision in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Belton on that point. In the Minister's constituency and in mine we have had a case such as Deputy Belton has mentioned.  A Guard visited a licensed premises in my area where, after the glasses had been cleaned up, the owner of the premises stood a drink to the employees. The Guard came in, took the names of the assistants and the owner and went ahead with the prosecution. That is sailing very close to the wind altogether.  I spoke here last night about people trying to manufacture cases and no Minister, no matter how good he might be, could alleviate the misunderstanding that might occur afterwards.  I know of two such cases as a result of the 1960 Act although nothing was made of them afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not ask the House to agree that the publican should be allowed to go behind the counter and allow his employees to drink for two hours after closing time but many of these people are working hard all day and they cannot take a drink during duty <Col N="1591" /> hours.  In such circumstances they should not be prosecuted if they have a drink after working hours.  Possibly only one per cent. of the Guards in the whole country would do a thing like that but it has been done.  I want to support Deputy Belton on the matter. While I do not agree with him on many things there are some things on which we do agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a novel suggestion and one which I should like time to think about.  What does strike me about it, however, is that if we were to provide that the employer could permit the employee to buy a drink after hours the said employer might be less likely to give the staff a free drink and I might be cutting across the interests of the unions in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not worry about that.  I support Deputy Belton in this matter.  We expect people who serve behind the bar, whether it be in a public house, hotel or restaurant to be on their best behaviour.  Surely it is a nice thing for the person in charge of the function to be able to say to the employees: &ldquo;Now, boys, we know this is a big night but at the end of it, we will be able to allow you have a drink and we will give you a drink,&rdquo; without having them in the position of being apprehensive?  It happens on the eve of St. Patrick's Day, Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and around all festivals. As I understand Deputy Belton, he is not advocating that they should go in for a few hours drinking, but that the man who is working hard is entitled to a refresher.  I would implore the Minister to accede to his request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear that I am concerned only with employees directly concerned with the sale and handling of intoxicating liquor and, in the case of hotels, employees directly concerned with the handling of the function in question.  I do not mean the rest of the people mentioned in the subsection I read out. <Col N="1592" /> I want to point out also that as soon as an employee buys drink he becomes a customer&mdash;he is no longer an employee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would join in the appeal to the Minister to accept the suggestion on the grounds that, if the proprietor or the manager desire on certain occasions to stand drinks to their employees, there are very few rooms on the ground floor in any public house which are not licensed. Every room on the ground floor is licensed and it would therefore be a breach of the law if an employee had a drink.  It has even been stated that the owner himself is guilty of a breach of the law if he has a drink in his own bar after hours.  That suggestion has been put forward.  Because of the fact there are not any private rooms in most of our public houses, on the ground floor at any rate, I think it would be very wise if the Minister accepted that suggestion, thereby safe-guarding against any danger of frivolous prosecutions.</P>

I would ask the Minister to consider that point carefully. But I hope that some of the gentlemen who made that proposition here will be as elastic in their own ideas as they ask the Minister to be in his. I should like to ask them how they propose that these people who are to get these drinks at these unusual hours of the night are to get home after having them.  Consequently, I propose to the Labour members, who control the trade unions, that they now very graciously go to their members in C.I.E. and make sure these gentlemen keep the buses on at night until such time as these people can get home.</P>

A concession like that can be abused. The Minister is only too well aware of that himself.  Some privileged people will hang on as one of the staff. Indeed, they may be appointed to the staff for the time being.  It has happened in some places.  They are up to anything.  When the Guards knocked at the door, people were brought upstairs and put in bed and they were told they were visitors, uncles and aunts.  I accept the suggestion that these people should be able to have drink within a limited period after closing without fear of prosecution but I should not like to think that men could hang on until a late hour and have their wives complaining.  I should not like to have employees &ldquo;invented&rdquo; as some gentlemen would certainly do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This may not be an appropriate time to mention the drinking time rule which has been brought into operation in England. In a number of prosecutions in the district court under the 1960 Act the question has been raised as to the possibility of getting people out at the closing hour.  The publican is entitled to sell drink up to the closing hour. Theoretically, the place is supposed to be completely clear and everybody out at the closing hour, so that 30 seconds before 11.30 p.m. there might be 50 people lawfully there and 30 seconds after 11.30 p.m. there might be 30 people on the licensed premises during prohibited hours.  In England they have got over that by introducing the 15-minute drinking time system.  In the district court, the question has been decided in different ways by various district justices.  Some of them held that if the publican is genuinely and obviously making an effort to get the people out he is not to be convicted. I think 20 minutes is the longest any justice in the last two years allowed for that purpose.  But that was in very exceptional circumstances, one of the Swinford prosecutions in which something like 200 people were ultimately got out.  It was accepted that the licensee and his <Col N="1594" /> assistants were making every possible effort.  But, strictly speaking, under the law as it stands it is an offence to be there 30 seconds after the closing hour and, if the justice insists, he can convict.  In view of the penalties which this House agreed were necessary under the 1960 Act, it becomes a very serious matter.  Would the Minister give thought to the idea of giving a 10 or 15 minute drinking time period?</P>

    <P>&ldquo;26. (1)  In Section 8 of the Act of 1902, Section 14 of the Act of 1924 and in this section `last census' means the last census of population taken under the Statistics Acts, 1926 and 1946, from which statistics of population other than statistics which purport to be provisional only, published by the Stationery <Col N="1596" /> Office have been derived.</P>
    <P>(2)  In any application to a Court under the Act of 1902&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a document purporting to be published by the Stationery Office and to be compiled by the Central Statistics Office and to contain statistics of population derived from a census of population taken under the Statistics Acts, 1926 and 1946, other than statistics which purport to be provisional only, or to contain statistics derived from the census taken in the year 1901, shall be evidence, until the contrary is proved, of the matters relating to statistics of population stated in the document,</P>
    <P>(b)  a certificate purporting to be signed by the Director, or other person for the time being in charge, of the Central Statistics Office and to certify that the census referred to in a document of the kind specified in paragraph (a)  of this subsection is the last census and, either, that no later census has been taken or that statistics of population derived from a later census, other than statistics that purport to be provisional only, will not be published during the two months immediately following the date on which the certificate is given, shall, without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate or that he was the Director, or for the time being in charge, of the Central Statistics Office, be evidence, until the contrary is proved of the matters certified in and by the certificate,</P>
    <P>(c)  a certificate purporting to be signed by the Director, or other person for the time being in charge, of the Central Statistics Office and containing statistics of population and purporting to certify that the statistics are derived from the last census and, either that no later census has been taken or that statistics of population derived from a later census will not be published during the two months immediately following <Col N="1597" /> the date on which the certificate is given, shall. without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate or that he was the Director, or for the time being in charge, of the Central Statistics Office, be evidence, until the contrary is proved, of the matters relating to statistics contained in the certificate and of the matters certified in and by the certificate, and</P>
    <P>(d)  a certificate purporting to be signed by the Director, or other person for the time being in charge, of the Central Statistics Office and containing statistics of population and purporting to certify that the statistics are derived from the census taken in the year 1901 shall, without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate or that he was the Director, or for the time being in charge, of the Central Statistics Office, be evidence, until the contrary is proved, of the matters relating to statistics contained in the certificate and of the matters certified in and by the certificate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to replace the present Section 26 by a more comprehensive one.  The idea of the section is to obviate the need for applicants for new licences in urban areas bringing along officers of the Central Statistics Office to give formal proof of population figures that may already be officially published or that can equally well be given in a written certificate from the Director of the Statistics Office.  The attendance of the officer is, of course, only a formality unless the figures are challenged, but it not only involves inconvenience for the Statistics Office but expense for the applicant.</P>
    <P>The amendment is more comprehensive in that it applies the new procedure not only to current statistics but to the 1901 census which is the &ldquo;base&rdquo; year with which comparison is made&mdash;the reason for that, of course, being that that was the last census before the general ban was put, by the 1902 Act, on the issue of new licences.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is the intention <Col N="1598" /> of the Statistics Office, if possible, to publish, for the convenience of applicants, both the 1901 figures and &ldquo;current&rdquo; figures for civil parishes on the outskirts of Dublin and possibly the other County Boroughs.  Apart from these areas demand is very small and in most cases non-existent but, of course, a special compilation will continue to be made where necessary.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so.  This amendment is much the same as Deputy Dunne's amendment, No. 39, and amendment No. 40 is being proposed as the minimum which we would ask the Minister to accept, if he is not prepared to accept the proposal embodied in amendments Nos. 38 and 39.  As the House is aware, the present position is that it is mandatory on the courts to record convictions, and to have convictions endorsed on the licences of the licensees, apart from the first conviction, I think.  When there are three endorsements, the licensee loses his licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this was that endorsements were provided in Section 25 of the 1927 Act.  They were mandatory to a certain extent in the 1927 Act, but the following section of the 1927 <Col N="1599" /> Act, Section 26, contained a provision that if a district justice came to the conclusion that the offence was of a comparatively trivial nature, he could make an order so declaring, and if he made such an order, it was not necessary to endorse the licence.  In other words, the district justice in the 1927 Act was given discretion to make an order against recording the conviction, if satisfied that, by reason of the trivial nature of the offence, it ought no to be recorded.  The 1927 Act also contained a provision whereby an appeal could be made to the circuit court against a decision of the district court recording the conviction on the licence.</P>
    <P>The next Act which dealt with the matter was the 1943 Act which made it clear, by amending Section 25 of the 1927 Act, that this matter could be left to the discretion of the district court.  There was provision in Section 14 of the 1943 Act which specifically left it to the discretion of the court as to whether the licence would or would not be endorsed.  That position obtained up to the passing of the 1960 Act.  By Section 37 of the 1960 Act the section of the 1943 Act which made it discretionary was deleted, and it was made mandatory in the 1960 Act for the licence to be endorsed by the court, in the event of conviction.</P>
    <P>I think all of us appreciate that in liquor legislation when certain restrictions are being imposed, the House will think it desirable to have those restrictions honoured and kept, and to have the Act carried into force.  Therefore, it is obviously necessary to provide for the situation which will arise where breaches of the Act occur.  We feel that as a general rule mandatory penalties are not good and as a general principle, when we have all the elaborate machinery in the establishment of courts to administer justice, it is right and reasonable that discretion should be left to, and invested in the courts with regard to penalties as in regard to so many other things.  Consequently, we feel that the principle of mandatory endorsement of publicans' licences is bad.  It should be left to the discretion of the courts to decide <Col N="1600" /> whether the facts relating to any conviction warrant the drastic step of recording the conviction on the licence which contains, so far as the publican is concerned, the risk that after a certain number of endorsements&mdash; three, at the moment&mdash;the licence will be lost.</P>
    <P>Consequently, in amendment No. 38&mdash; exactly the same idea is contained in Deputy Dunne's amendment No. 39&mdash; we are asking the Minister to get back to the situation that obtained under the 1943 Act where it was left to the discretion of the court whether the conviction would be endorsed.  That is our principal request in amendment No. 38 but, as we are discussing amendment No. 40 with it I want to mention briefly our attitude in relation to this.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, we are asking the Minister to accept the principle that discretion should be vested in the courts in regard to the endorsement of licences.  If the Minister cannot go that far we ask him, as a minimum, to accept the proposition contained in amendment No. 40 which suggests that, at least, in relation to offences committed within a period of 15 minutes of closing time, discretion should be allowed to the courts as to whether a conviction shall be recorded.  The reason for this was, to some extent, advanced by Deputy Seán Flanagan when discussing another section this evening, when he was pointing out the difficulty publicans experience in clearing their premises immediately.</P>
    <P>As the law stands, a person is entitled to drink up to the closing hour but at closing hour the premises should be closed and everybody should be out of the place.  Physically that is impossible. The situation may obtain&mdash;I think it has obtained&mdash;in some places where raids were made on public houses within a very short time of closing.  In those cases, the publican, once he was brought to court, had to be convicted because an offence had taken place.  At times, as mentioned by Deputy Flanagan, if a publican was genuinely and obviously making an effort to clear his premises, the district justice might feel it was unreasonable to convict him, but, as the law stands <Col N="1601" /> if there are people on the premises after closing time, the publican is liable to conviction and if he is convicted at present it is mandatory on the court to endorse the conviction on the licence.  When that happens three times the licence goes.</P>
    <P>We suggest that if the Minister is not prepared to accept the principle that, generally speaking, it should be left to the court to exercise discretion as to whether the facts of the case warrant the drastic step of endorsement, that at least in the case of offences related to a period of 15 minutes after closing time discretion should be allowed to the court.  I emphasise that we are suggesting that merely as an alternative to amendment No. 38.  We would prefer the Minister to accept amendment No. 38 which contains the same proposal as in Deputy Dunne's amendment No. 39.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">

      <P>That was one of the clauses in the 1960 Act that I referred to as a penal clause for licence-holders.  I felt very strongly about it at the time.  I know publicans who are really in a state of nerves and insult customers in trying to get them out before 11 o'clock or 11.30 as the case may be.  I have known a publican to snatch a drink from a customer&mdash; who refused afterwards to go back to that public house&mdash;because the Gardaí were outside waiting.  I am not saying anything about the Gardaí&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Act is there and the Gardaí are only carrying out the laws we pass here.  I am against people staying on in public houses after closing time but we have had some experience of people being found in a public house three minutes after 9 o'clock on a Sunday night.  We had another case of a man waiting outside for his wife who delayed talking to the proprietress for two minutes.  His name was taken.  We had some extraordinary cases in County Dublin.  While I am all in favour of observance of the law that penal clause is very severe.  Could the Minister consider it in this way: if <Col N="1602" /> a man found on the premises gets a substantial fine he will not be caught again.  I do not know a case in Dublin city or county where a man was caught a second time in a public house after hours.</P>

    <P>There is another case of a man who was under the influence of drink coming off a bus.  A publican, a charitable man, knew the person concerned and he took him into his house and sent for his nephew to bring him home.  He was caught leaving the premises under the influence of drink and the publican was fined and his licence endorsed.  The endorsement of a licence is a very serious thing for any publican.  I investigated this case <Col N="1603" /> myself because the man concerned was a very good old friend of mine and I did not want to lose his friendship. These are things in the Bill against which a publican should be protected. If that publican were a callous fellow and said to this man who came off the bus: &ldquo;I will leave you there.  Do not come into my house&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak mainly in support of amendment No. 39 in the name of Deputy Seán Dunne. Deputy O'Higgins has indicated he feels that amendment No. 39 is more correctly drafted than amendment No. 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not wish to elaborate on what Deputy O'Higgins has said.  He put the case fairly and concisely and I do not want to hold <Col N="1604" /> up the House as we have been discussing this Bill for quite a long time.  I would appeal to the Minister to give this matter serious consideration.  It is a penal clause.  I am quite well aware there must be some system of endorsement for the rowdy house that is kept deliberately by a publican.  It is no harm that after a series of wilful violations of the law such a publican's licence should be taken but this question of whether or not the endorsement should be there should surely be left to the local district justice who, having heard all the facts and being, as he should be, a fair-minded man, may feel that a conviction and endorsement are not necessary probably on the grounds that a technical offence had been committed or perhaps on the grounds that although an offence had been committed it had been committed without the countenance or the knowledge of the legal owner of the public house.  I hope the Minister will consider accepting amendment No. 39.  Should he not do that I would then have to ask him to consider the subject matter of amendment No. 40, but I do appeal to him to accept amendment No. 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with amendments Nos. 38 and 39.  Quite definitely I believe 15 minutes grace should be allowed after closing time.  The hours suggested in this Bill are 11.30 p.m. closing on week nights during summer-time, 11 p.m. during winter-time and 10 p.m. on Sundays.  If the Minister would not favourably consider 15 minutes grace I would seriously suggest to him that he should make the legal closing time 11.15 p.m. and permit the grace up to 11.30 p.m., no drink to be served during that time. The position at the moment is that licensess or publicans are offending their best customers.  They produce the closure motion, as it were, at a quarter of an hour before the legal closing time.  If a good customer comes in before the legal closing time he is refused a drink.  The legal position is that the publican has to have the premises empty at closing time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this point on the 1960 Bill with Mr. Traynor when he was Minister <Col N="1605" /> for Justice and he said the grace was provided before closing time. Anybody in this House who has had any connection, remote or otherwise, with the license trade will agree that it is most difficult and awkward to operate this system.  Publicans are insulting their best customers.  If the Minister does not favourably consider allowing the licensees 15 minutes to empty the premises after the legal closing time, 11.30 p.m., I suggest that the legal closing time be stepped forward by 15 minutes to give some legality to the fifteen minutes grace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied there is a point to be considered in the matter of endorsements arising out of offences committed shortly after the closing hour.  I mention for the Minister's information something that occurred recently in a village in my constituency.  A Guard entered a licensed premises four minutes after the closing hour and he was quite satisfied the publican was doing his best to clear his premises.  He left after advising the people to go as quickly as possible and he went across the road to another licensed premises where three men were present.  It was a very wet night and they were waiting for a car.  There was no drink of any kind and it was 11 minutes after the closing hour.  He did not prosecute the first publican because he said he was doing his best to clear the premises when he arrived four minutes after the hour.  The other people were waiting in the kitchen for a car and there was no drink there but that publican was prosecuted.  If that were the second prosecution he would have got an endorsement for what could only be considered a trivial offence. If an offence is committed in such a short period as 15 minutes after the closing hour, except in extreme cases, it should not carry with it an endorsement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I came across a peculiar case which I should like to put forward for the Minister's consideration. It is the case of a publican who was either renting or selling his public house on a tenant purchase agreement.  I am not quite sure which. <Col N="1606" /> The person who was renting the public house has been convicted twice already under the 1960 Act.  The owner has been in touch with him and the tenant's attitude is that he does not care if he loses the licence eventually because it is the landlord's licence.  That is the kind of aggressive attitude he has adopted.  This public house was rented before the endorsement clauses were reintroduced in the 1960 Act.  Anybody now renting a public house is left in a rather difficult position.  As well as that, it has the effect of preventing a publican disposing of his property. A man might get on in years and want to retire, renting his public house to his manager or foreman, and living on the income from it in his old age.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have expressed the view that since the 1960 Act, order has been restored to the drinking habits of the people.  We agree there was very little order before the 1960 Act. A great many publicans traded outside the permitted hours.  I suggest to the Minister, however, that it was the vigilance of the Garda which in the main helped to restore order rather than the reintroduction of the endorsement clauses.  Whether or not enough time has now elapsed to permit the repeal of these clauses, I am not sure. For that reason, I think the idea in amendment No. 41 is more acceptable. Perhaps the Minister between now and the Report Stage would consider this 15 minutes grace and also, possibly, a reduction of the periods of endorsement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against mandatory punishments.  I have heard old and tried supporters of the Government&mdash; I might say distinguished supporters, like Deputy MacCarthy&mdash;pleading with the Minister.  I have heard Deputy Lemass, a young Deputy from a very distinguished family in the Government Party, also pleading with the Minister. But the Minister refuses to give way to anybody.  We heard our old friend, Deputy P.J. Burke, telling us the other night that it was his leading the embattled publicans of Dublin in their representations to the Minister that resulted in the removal from the Bill of Section 15.  I believe that we should not be pleading with the Minister at <Col N="1607" /> all; we should be pleading with Deputy Burke and making our representations to him so that he may persuade the Minister.  Indeed, we ought to ask for an adjournment so that we might have an opportunity of asking Deputy Burke to bring pressure on the Minister so that he will meet us in this.</P>
      <P>We would cheer the Minister &ldquo;from the ranks of Tuscany&rdquo; if he would meet us on this.  This is a very important section.  It is a very important matter from the point of view of the publicans' livelihood and property. The majority of our publicans are reputable people who have never had their licences endorsed and who have conducted their businesses properly all through the years.  If they are caught one minute past closing time and are prosecuted, that would be a first offence.  Another situation might evolve in a short space of time, as situations evolve everywhere, and the publican might not be able to clear his public house.  If he goes into court again, before he knows where he is, his licence will be endorsed and the value of his premises will be reduced by 30 per cent.  That is a very serious penalty for Parliament to inflict.  I do not think the offence is one that calls for such a penalty.  This section convinces me that the Minister has no confidence in the judiciary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that I think Section 37 of the 1960 Act was most ruthless.  First of all, take the position of a hotel.  Now, a certain amount of drink is laid out at night in the hotel and given to the night porter for the residents.  I have met cases <Col N="1609" /> where the night porter provided his own drink and allowed some of his friends in and had them, maybe, in the kitchen or in some other place.  In a matter such as that, if that hotel had been convicted, the chances are that, on the first conviction, they would be fined but that, on the second conviction, there would be an endorsement on the hotel.  You can imagine the effect on an hotel, say, of the value of the Gresham or any place else&mdash;maybe the hotel in Belmullet.  However, you can imagine the effect on value of the property by reason of its carrying an endorsement.</P>
      <P>Now we have the case of the lettings. Suppose a licensed publican transferred his licence either by way of sale or rent to any other person and that person misbehaved and did not comply rigidly with the Act of 1960 with the result that endorsements were placed, not on the tenant but on the house. That house, with every conviction, lost not 33 per cent. but much more because you have two endorsements on your licence, you can say that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;you have had it. I would recommend to the Minister that convictions and endorsements be left to the discretion of the district justice.</P>
      <P>Then the question of clearing the premises arises.  I would go so far as to say that it is an absolute impossibility to abide by the 1960 Act because you can be served drink up to the time but you cannot be on the premises one minute after it.  There was the absurdity in the 1960 Act.  I would agree with what Deputy Belton has said. The publicans and their assistants are human beings.  A man comes in after a picture and has maybe five minutes and asks for a drink.  Surely a regular customer in any house will not be refused? Suppose that, two or three or four minutes after the time, the Gardaí come in.  If the Gardaí want to go ahead with the prosecution, there is no more about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider seriously (1) the endorsement on the person, not on the premises; (2) the <Col N="1610" /> endorsement to be allowed to the discretion of the district justice and (3) that a stay of 15 minutes be granted, provided no drink is served after the time, to clear the premises.  The Minister has been very fair on this Bill.  He has treated all our suggestions with a certain amount of sympathy.  We are all trying to do something the people of rural Ireland want.  We are all trying to help them and we are here to make our suggestions.  I am sure the Minister will take cognisance of what I said.</P>

      <P>The Minister will know that at no stage of this Bill did I intervene.  As a matter of fact, this is the first comment I made, despite the fact that probably every Deputy has addressed himself in some way or other to this Bill.  I feel that my voice may not be a very influential one with the Minister but, realising that the Minister is noted for his courtesy and, not alone for his courtesy, but for his kindliness and his anxiety to co-operate, I rise on this occasion for the purpose of joining with the many Deputies who have already&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;made a very special appeal to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why or how the Minister can listen so attentively, so carefully, with great ease and with keen notice, to the appeal made by Deputy N. Lemass and Deputy MacCarthy&mdash;the reasonable request which his sincere friends and colleagues have made&mdash;and not be moved.  But the sincerity that was behind Deputy MacCarthy and Deputy N. Lemass fades out into complete insignificance in comparison with the influence which Deputy P.J. Burke has on the Minister.  That is why I feel that when the Minister hears the pleading of Deputy N. Lemass, livened up with the appeal by Deputy MacCarthy and backed by the influence of Deputy P.J. Burke, we on this side of the House are pushing an open door when such influential people are already pleading with the Minister to adopt the suggestions in the amendments which I have not <Col N="1611" /> read, though I am speaking on them. Nevertheless, I want to ask the Minister to give this matter more serious thought than apparently he has given it.  From my knowledge of the publicans&mdash;and, mind you, my knowledge of the publicans is extremely limited&mdash; I may say that the big bulk of them are strictly honest and law-abiding citizens.  They do not want to break the law; they have no desire to break it in any way.  They are anxious to co-operate to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I feel, in regard to the unreasonable attitude which, may I say, unlike Deputy P.J. Burke, has been adopted by members of the Garda Síochána in relation to certain publicans, that any member of the Garda who in his sane, common-sense way could go into a licensed premises a minute after closing time and take out his notebook and proceed to register the names and addresses of those caught on the premises, would certainly be abusing his duty.  Certainly I feel that to take advantage of the situation to prosecute a publican who may have men on the premises five minutes after the time, and who has not served a drink since the stroke of closing time, would be most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Belton in appealing to the Minister to give 15 minutes grace for the purpose of assisting the publican to clear his premises.  We know very well that no matter how anxious they are and no matter how willing publicans are to have their premises cleared in time, it is an absolute impossibility.  We know very well that where a good customer calls in for a drink after the pictures which may finish after 10.30 p.m., with his friends, it is impossible for the publican to get, say, 12 or 14 people out on the stroke of 11 o'clock.  Where the publican serves no drink after the appointed closing time, he should not be prosecuted. The whole question of endorsements is very bad because, in plain language, the publican who has had the second endorsement on his licence has &ldquo;had it&rdquo;, so far as the value of his property is concerned. <Col N="1612" /> Deputy Lynch is one of the most progressive and best known men in the auctioneering business in the south of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Lynch has sufficient intelligence and experience as a businessman to know, as I know, that in the event of a licensed premises having a second endorsement, the premises, as Deputy Coughlan stated, drops in value substantially. That is why I appeal to the Minister to comply with Deputy O'Higgins's request.  I presume the Tánaiste is now whispering in the Minister's ear that the Opposition's plea is very reasonable and that the Minister should agree with it.</P>

      <P>I feel he is dealing with the amendments when he is whispering in the Minister's ear and I feel that his presence in the House will lead to the acceptance of Deputy O'Higgins's amendments by the Minister. Let us hope that when the Minister makes his comment, it will be a favourable one because when we hear the strong plea of Deputy MacCarthy, and the recommendations of Deputy Burke backed up by the terrific influence of the Tánaiste himself, I think we can describe these two amendments as the lucky amendments in that they have the support of such influential people in the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister cannot see his way to meeting us to the fullest possible extent, I would ask him to leave endorsement to the discretion of the <Col N="1613" /> district justice.  Naturally enough, the district justice will view each case on its merits.  He is the most highly qualified person to judge on the question of endorsements.  If the Minister has every confidence in the district justices in this regard&mdash;no Minister of State has ever had more trust and confidence in the judiciary and the district justices than the present Minister, as is evidenced by the recent increases he introduced for them &mdash;this is another way in which he will be able to show renewed confidence in the district justices, by leaving the matter of endorsements to their discretion.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal to be said for what Deputy Coughlan advanced in relation to having the endorsements, if there are to be endorsements, on the owner rather than on the premises.  The endorsements are a considerable handicap to the value of the premises and the property ought not to have such a serious handicap which interferes drastically with its market value.  If the endorsement were on the owner, arrangements could be made by the owner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not dispute that.  Arrangements could be made so that the value of the property would not be adversely affected.  The Minister would be well advised to give this matter further consideration.  A plea has been made to him and a reasonable one to let us know on Report Stage the results of his considerations. Knowing the Minister to be a man of action who never leaves matters in the air, I feel this is a matter on which he can give a decision and I would urge him to be helpful in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it is very difficult for a logical man to resist these persuasive appeals to his reason but before going all the way with the House in this matter, I should like to put a few of its aspects to the Deputies. I want to point out that there is a considerable amount of exaggeration about it.  Take, for instance, the matter raised by Deputy Burke.  Usually, <Col N="1614" /> when we investigate hardship cases of this sort, where the inoffensive publican has been harshly treated by all concerned, the Garda and the district court and so on, the facts have a habit of turning out somewhat differently from what they have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  If Deputy Burke looks at Section 14, paragraph (b) of the 1927 Act, he will see it points out clearly that no offence is commited for:</P>
      <P>the supplying at any time of intoxicating liquor on licensed premises to any private friends of the holder of the licence <i>bona fide</i> entertained by him at his own expense in any part of such licensed premises other than the part in which the sale of intoxicating liquor generally takes place, or</P>
      <P>and so on.  So that if the facts are as described by Deputy Burke, the law was administered very badly in that case.  However, if we are to delve into the facts they may not be as put to us.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Lemass, I would not feel obliged to give a very definite opinion on the matter one way or the other, but it seems to me in the circumstances a civil action would lie on the part of the proprietor.  I think he could almost certainly take an action for the protection of the licence involved.  However, as I say, it is not for me at this stage to go into that in any detail.  This whole question of endorsement, of course, is bound up with the question of the enforcement of the licensing laws.  I know that it is the unanimous desire of all Deputies that the licensing laws, whatever they may be, should be enforced.  I think that is also the view which most responsible people throughout the country would take.  This business of compulsory endorsements is merely a mechanism or machinery by which to ensure that enforcement is real and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met a deputation from the Dublin City publicans.  They were talking to me about this question of compulsory <Col N="1615" /> or mandatory endorsement.  I said: &ldquo;Of course, this provision is there to endeavour to make enforcement effective.  If I put it to you as a question whether you want to have a relaxation of enforcement or the retention of compulsory endorsement, which would you prefer?&rdquo; They unanimously agreed with me that in that case they would opt for mandatory endorsement if they thought that the removal of mandatory endorsement would in any way interfere with the effective enforcement of the licensing laws.  As responsible publicans they were prepared to accept the retention of mandatory endorsement.  That is the background to this whole business.</P>
    <P>I want to mention what is the reality. Deputies endeavoured to convey the impression that a publican has only to make one mistake and he is finished. The reality of the situation is this: First of all, since the passing of the 1960 Act, all endorsements prior to that were wiped out, which was not a very bad gesture at all on the part of the Legislature towards erring publicans; but more than that, the 1960 Act went on to stipulate that the first offence after the passing of the Act would not go on the licence at all.  In other words, every publican would have one free offence so to speak.  The 1960 Act also stipulated that the first endorsement&mdash;which would arise out of the second offence&mdash;would last for two years; the second for four years and the third for six years.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to be clear about this.  It is not just because a publican has three endorsements that he must lose his licence.  The three endorsements must be extant on his licence at the same time so that I think we can all agree that he has to be a fairly well erring publican before he loses his licence.  First of all, he has the free offence with no endorsement.  Then he has the next offence after that, with compulsory endorsement, which disappears after two years.  The next endorsement lasts only four years.  Only then would he get into the comparatively serious long-term endorsement of six years.  The three endorsements must be on the licence at the same <Col N="1616" /> time.  Even though a publican might have committed an offence which demanded a mandatory endorsement of four or six years, if the first endorsement of two years had disappeared he would be quite safe until he committed another offence.  Deputies should realise exactly what is involved in this question of mandatory endorsements.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I am still prepared to accept that there is some validity in the case made here that hardship can in certain isolated instances result to some publicans.  The question which I would have to decide in that regard and which I think the Legislature would have to decide is whether or not the overall good from the point of view of effective enforcement would be more than counter-balanced by the case of individual hardship that might result.  I am quite prepared to say to the Deputies that I will consider this matter further between now and the Report Stage.  I want to emphasise particularly that I give this promise to consider without any undertaking whatever of being able to come back and do anything along the lines the Deputies suggest.  I see that there is a very strong volume of opinion about this matter.  I am prepared to go that far.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because I may be asking for some things to be recommitted myself.  Now I come to the question of drinking-up time.  I think that the case that is being made here against the mandatory endorsements has been based to a large extent on the situation prevailing in the five, ten or fifteen minutes after closing time.  If I were to say to Deputies: &ldquo;Very well, we will give drinking-up time of ten or fifteen minutes&rdquo; most of the arguments about the unfairness of the mandatory endorsement would disappear. The Deputies who spoke concentrated on the period immediately following closing time.  Nobody will have any sympathy with the publican who is caught breaking the law one, two or three hours after closing time. It may be that in the consideration of <Col N="1617" /> this matter I might see whether something could be done along the lines of remedying what I readily admit is a difficult situation at the moment.</P>
      <P>The law, as every Deputy knows provides that a publican may sell a drink to a customer right up to two seconds before the closing time.  At the same time, the law requires that customer to be off the premises a couple of seconds or a minute later.  I admit that there is a difficulty there for publicans but whether or not it is as serious as Deputies have endeavoured to portray I am not quite sure.  I know that many publicans have solved it in their own way by serving drinks 10 or 15 minutes before closing time.  I know that there are parts of the country where the customers would just not be prepared to accept such an arrangement.  However, all these things can be considered in the same context and I give the undertaking which Deputies pressed me to give in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very technical business.  It is to cater for a certain procedural difficulty which has arisen in applications that are made to the courts on the <Col N="1618" /> basis of plans.  The idea of these applications is that the court should be asked to say on the basis of the plans submitted that the premises which will be built in accordance with these plans would get a licence.  It has been suggested that the courts could not possibly say on the basis of the plans whether it would grant a licence because the question of granting a licence arises only where a premises have a certain minimum valuation.  The actual figure is different for different areas. Deputy Lynch will no doubt be quite pleased to know in this connection that Waterford is put in the same category as Cork and Limerick.</P>

      <P>In page 18, before section 27, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 17 (which relates to the licensing or certification of premises the subject of a declaration under section 15 of the Act of 1960) of the Act of 1960 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following sub-section for subsection (1):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>`( ) If, on the hearing of an <Col N="1619" /> application for the grant of a certificate entitling the applicant to receive a licence in respect of any premises, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that a declaration has been made by the Court under sub-section (1) of section 15 of this Act,</P>
    <P>(b)  that the premises have been acquired, constructed or altered in substantial accordance with the terms of the declaration, and</P>
    <P>(c)  where the application is made pursuant to any provision of the Licensing Acts that provides for the extinguishing of one or more existing licences on the grant of the licence&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that the licence or each of the licences in respect of which it was shown to the satisfaction of the Court on the application for the declaration that the applicant was the holder thereof or had secured the consent of the holder to the extinguishing thereof is in force, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if such licence or licences or any of them is or are not in force, that the licence or licences not in force has not or have not been forfeited or extinguished and the premises to which it or they related have not been deemed, by virtue of any provision of the Licensing Acts, never to have been licensed,</P>
    <P>it shall not be open to the Court to refuse the application&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  in a case where it is made pursuant to section 21 of the Act of 1943, on any ground, and</P>
    <P>(II)  in any other case, on any ground other than the character, misconduct or unfitness of the applicant,</P>
    <P>and where, as respects a licence or licences and the premises to which it or they related, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that it or they comply with the provisions of <Col N="1620" /> subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of this subsection, the licence or licences shall be deemed, for the purposes of the provisions of the Licensing Acts relating to the granting of licences, but not otherwise, to be in force and to relate to the premises to which it or they related and, on the grant of the new licence, shall accordingly be extinguished and the premises to which it or they related shall be deemed never to have been licensed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is also to deal with a procedural difficulty.  It was mentioned by Deputy Costello on the Second Reading.  He pointed out that when a person goes into court with the plans of a new licensed premises he has to prove he is in a position to extinguish one or two existing licences and that the owners of these licences have agreed to sell their interests, that they have no further interest in keeping the licences alive.  The need to keep them in being may cause serious inconvenience because it may be impossible to use the premises for other purposes if the annual renewal of the licences is not to be in jeopardy.  This amendment is to ensure that the licences need not be renewed between the granting of a declaration on the basis of plans and the final granting of the new licence&mdash; that they are held in abeyance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies O.J. Flanagan, P. O'Donnell and Tully have already dealt thoroughly with the question of sea fisheries, I shall confine my remarks to the Foyle Fisheries.  The last occasion I spoke on the Foyle Fisheries was when the regulations now in force were introduced by the Foyle Fisheries Commission to reduce the fishing week from five days to four. We were told on that occasion there would be a meeting of the fishermen and public representatives from Donegal at the Commission's office in Derry on the following Tuesday.  I attended that meeting and I came away from it with the same impressions as I had when I went there.  We were listened to, but that is all.  We were told by the Commission that the four days fishing week was necessary.  I still do not believe it is necessary.  If it is necessary, then I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to apply it from the mouth of the Lough right up to the River Foyle to where the last shot is taken by the netmen.</P>
      <P>The Commission preach that the fishing week must be reduced.  They have reduced the fishing season and also the number of licences issued. But, at the same time, they can make presents of salmon to people who have no connection whatever with the Foyle Fisheries Commission, or indeed with fishing in general in Ireland. Some time ago, I put down a question here in relation to this but it was ruled out of order.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of it or not, but I have a list of names and addresses, and the number of salmon sent to these people last year totalled approximately 70 fish.  These fish were sent to various people in Britain.  If the Commission can send salmon to people in Britain as presents and at the same time, curtail licences for the fishermen on the River Foyle, who have to rear their families on their catches, it is time the Parliamentary Secretary took a keener interest in the working of this Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question I put down recently was also ruled out of order. It concerned the payment of an employee of the Commission.  I furnished his name at the time to the Clerk of the Dáil.  My information is that this person drew wages from the Commission for two years and worked in a garage in Omagh.  He was not known to be a bailiff at that time.  If this charge is correct, and I have very strong reasons to believe it is, <Col N="1627" /> again it is time something were done about it.</P>
    <P>Another point that is causing unrest among the fishermen and even among the bailiffs is the system of promotion within the Commission itself.  I have the highest regard for the bailiffs who police the River Foyle and Lough Foyle.  As Deputy Tully said, they are doing a job akin to that of the Garda and they should have uniforms and should be paid more.  Far more bailiffs should be employed.  At the same time, however, the bailiffs employed at present should be promoted on their merit.  I have in mind a few bailiffs who merit promotion but who have been overlooked.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to inquire into the system of promotion in the Commission.  I would not like to say what I think the reasons are, but it is hard to understand that a bailiff told to get down from the witness box by the justice should afterwards be promoted.  It does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>There is another point not really of major interest, but I feel I should mention it.  On one day last year, four bailiffs were engaged for a whole day &ldquo;teeing up&rdquo; salmon with nylon thread for the cameras of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  Presumably, this was to publicise the Foyle Fisheries for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  I should like to know the cost of this and I should also like to know where these people will come to fish.  Apparently they were to come to the Mourne.  But, unless you were a very close friend of a close friend of a Commissioner, you would not get fishing on the Mourne.  It is a closed shop as far as the ordinary angler from Donegal, Derry and Tyrone is concerned.</P>
    <P>In reply to some of these questions, I was told the Minister had no responsibility in the matter; but I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have these matters investigated.  If this situation is allowed to continue and at the same time, people are refused licences, it is unchristian, to say the least of it.  There should be <Col N="1628" /> some fresh thinking on the question of the issue of licences.  The Advisory Council gave advice to the Commission on various occasions but this advice was ignored.  I would appeal again to the Commission to take the Advisory Council into their confidence because the Advisory Council is composed of practical fishermen who understand fishing from A to Z.  They are not in it for what they can get out of it but solely because they have a love of fishing.  They made recommendations on numerous occasions.  The least the Commission should have done was to listen to them, and above all, to listen in time, but they refused to acknowledge them on numerous occasions. After waiting two, three, or four years, ultimately they took advice when it was too late.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly fishing is the second greatest industry, second only to agriculture.  In Donegal the inland fisheries are more or less confined, in my area, to the Foyle.  There are families there who had been fishing the Foyle and getting their living out of it until the new regulations were made restricting the issuing of licences. The Commission should consider the economics of these families when they are considering the issue of licences. It is not right to say that one does not qualify by reason of not having held a licence two years out of three and to refuse a licence.  That defeats the purpose which it was meant to achieve.</P>
    <P>The big problem in relation to fishing the Foyle is that the Commission feel that fishermen are all crooks.  I do not agree that net fishermen and anglers are crooks.  This goes back again to the fact that no one has confidence in the other person.  The fishermen have no confidence in the Commission.  The anglers and the net fishermen have no confidence in the Commission, and I would go so far as to say that, in my opinion, some of the bailiffs are losing confidence in the Commission.  Certainly the Advisory Council have no confidence whatever in the commission. If I were a member of the Advisory Council, I would do the decent thing and resign, because all they are there for at the moment is to take the blame.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the Foyle fisheries are a great source of revenue to the State. I do not think the same can be said of other fishing industries of the State when the Donegal fishermen must pay a levy of 1d. and 2d. in the 1b. on salmon, whereas their colleagues who pay the same for a licence, fish the same hours, and have the same conditions generally, in Tyrone and Derry, do not have to pay any such levy.  That is something the Parliamentary Secretary should consider very seriously in relation to the working of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  If he will not consider doing away with the levy generally, he should abandon it in relation to the Foyle fisheries.  Where possible, the fishermen who fish the Foyle take their catches to the northern side where they do not have to pay a levy.  I should like to make it clear that that is not done generally, but it is done where possible, and they do not break any laws by doing it.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, the Commission, after reducing the fishing week, and cutting the licences to the bare minimum, decided that they would open a new shot between Carrigans and Derry.  After a number of bailiffs had toyed about in boats for a week or more, they succeeded in shifting a large rock, which must have been one of the dearest rocks ever taken out of the Foyle.  I mention that to give an example of the way in which money is being wasted&mdash;in my opinion, squandered&mdash;on the Foyle.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying, or on the next available occasion, to let me know the cost of making that shot on the Foyle.</P>
    <P>I do not like to make an attack on any person, especially when he is not present to defend himself, but there is a person&mdash;I shall refrain from naming him&mdash;on the Foyle Fisheries Commission, who said that he could not care less what happened to the River Finn. <Col N="1630" /> A professional man told me that he had told him that, and the man who told me is prepared to come forward and testify&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to instruct this official&mdash;and I shall give him the official's name&mdash;to pay more attention to the Finn because the spawning beds are in the Finn. More damage is done to the spawning beds by poachers than is done by the lad who goes down to the river and takes odt a salmon.  It would probably be taken by an angler or a net fisherman anyway, but damage is done on the Finn and this official said he could not care less what happened on the Finn. While I speak on behalf of the net fishermen I think it is only right that I should mention the bailiffs on the Finn.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence with reference to the case of a retired officer and to the provisions of Defence Force Regulations S.3 and Amendment No. 136 thereto, paragraph 36 (e) (ii), whether any explanation as by the regulations provided was sought from the said officer, and in what circumstances.</P>

      <P>The contemplated deduction in the case to which the Deputy refers will fall to be made from a gratuity under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, and not from pay. Consequently, the Defence Force Regulation mentioned does not enter into the matter, but the same procedure is being followed.</P>

      <P>I propose to make available to the Oireachtas Library a complete set of Defence Force Regulations at present in force with the exception of one Regulation which is in the Restricted Category and which deals with the organisation of the Defence Forces.  Thereafter a copy of every Regulation made, which is not restricted, will be furnished when it is printed.</P>
