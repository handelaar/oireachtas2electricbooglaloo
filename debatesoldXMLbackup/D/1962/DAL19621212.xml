    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will arrange with the Revenue Commissioners to have the Crossmaglen-Carrickmacross road recognised as an approved road for cross-Border traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Carrickmacross-Crossmaglen road has at present a limited approval for the exportation of cattle otherwise than by motor vehicle.</P>
      <P>Following the Deputy's previous query I have had a full review of the situation carried out by the Revenue Commissioners.  From their report I am satisfied that the potential traffic for this road, were it approved, would not be sufficient to warrant the expense of providing official accommodation and personnel and accordingly I am not prepared to have the present limited approval extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming there is a conflict of opinion on this matter between the experts of the Revenue Commissioners and the local people, would the Minister not consider, for the common good, that an experimental period should be provided during which the road would be approved, <Col N="1150" /> on the understanding that, if the traffic using the road did not justify its permanent approval, the Minister would feel himself quite free to withdraw the approval or recommend a restricted approval after, say, the lapse of a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be some expense, of course, in giving even limited approval.  There would be expense in providing not alone the personnel but also the accommodation. I should also like to remind the Deputy that these services could not be given unless there was a reciprocal agreement between the British side and ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can expect the Minister to do more than his own part.  Would the Minister not agree that where there is a persistent and constant conviction in a rural area that the service of the road is truly necessary, that it would be used by a large volume of local traffic, and where that conflicts with the views of the Revenue Commissioners but the conviction remains, as it does in this case, is it not the wise thing to give it a trial to enable us to demonstrate to the people that, in fact, the traffic they believe to be available is not there?  Otherwise they will go on believing that this is a very great hardship under which they are being asked to suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had representations on this matter from one of my own colleagues representing the county.  But this does not appear to be a road that would be open to very much traffic even if approval was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will consider the proposal to have an experimental period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dromore River is part of the River Erne catchment area and its improvement is being considered in connection with an arterial drainage scheme for that catchment.  An engineering survey has been completed and study of the data collected and work on the design of a scheme are proceeding.  This is a large and important catchment covering more than 500 square miles in counties Cavan, Leitrim, Longford and Monaghan and although we are pressing on with the preparations as fast as we can, it will be a few years yet before we can begin the actual works. I cannot commit myself to a specific date for commencement of works, but under pressure, I have already mentioned 1965 tentatively and I will do my best to give effect to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Parliamentary Secretary not say that the planning would take at least two years, that the survey would take two years and that it would take some time after that to get started.  Two and two make four in any language and sometime &ldquo;after&rdquo; means at least a year where the Board of Works is concerned.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my speech on 2nd December, I dealt with general conditions.  Following is the relevant quotation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is necessary for us to take cognisance of derelict and unworked land everywhere throughout the country. Irrespective of the amount of land that may become available to the Land Commission in the Midland counties for migrants, I am satisfied that there is a vast amount of land throughout the country that has been let for long periods by the owners which should be acquired by the Land Commission for the common good.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have, therefore, directed the Land Commission to compile a Register of vacant and derelict holdings, and lands that have been let for a period of 5 years or over.  This job is now being done, and on its completion, county by county, it is proposed to take certain action in respect of these lands.  The owners will firstly be invited to sell these lands to the Land Commission and an offer will be made to them.  In this connection let me say that under the law as it stands a landowner is entitled to the full market value of his land from the Land Commission. In the cases to which I refer, it is the intention to pay the market value of the lands to those concerned and, if possible, to acquire them by agreement.  If, however, we cannot get agreement with these absentee land-owners, then the Land Commission will proceed with their full compulsory powers for the acquisition of these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Again, under this procedure, if the owner is not satisfied with the offer of the Land Commission, he has a right to appeal to the Appeal Tribunal on the question of value, and a Judge of the High Court will there assess the market value of the lands having listened to the evidence produced by the owner.  This, I think, is as fair a system as can be devised and no reasonable man can quarrel with it.  The people to whom I refer can either sell to the Land Commission or, alternatively, <Col N="1163" /> live on and effectively work their holdings.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This country can no longer afford absentee land-owners; they are, in my view, just as detrimental to the common good as were the absentee landlords of former times.  While our people are free to go where they wish and live where they wish, the question of the utilisation of their land is a different matter as it is fundamental to the common good of the whole nation.  There is not a country in the whole of Western Europe that does not have special laws dealing with land utilisation.  Indeed, in many countries they have special laws regulating the sale and inheritance of land as well.  I am convinced that we have come to the stage here where the whole position must be re-assessed and a new Land Bill is being prepared to implement this re-assessment.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Special provisions are being made to deal with cases of elderly or incapacitated farmers who are obviously unable to work their lands.  We propose to provide a pension scheme for this class as an inducement to them to surrender their lands to the Land Commission forthwith, while leaving them in possession of their homes during their lives.  I also hope to introduce a scheme under the new land law whereby in any particular pocket of congestion the Land Commission may assist some of those concerned to solve their own problem by they themselves purchasing a farm in another district and leaving their own lands for the relief of their neighbours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have never denied that there may occasionally occur short-term lettings for clearly genuine reasons: speaking to the Agricultural Science Association in September last I said &ldquo;whilst undoubtedly there may sometimes be justifiable and compelling reasons for temporarily letting lands, there can be no justification for allowing land to be vacated indefinitely&rdquo;.  This view was repeated by me at column 345 of Dáil Report for 31st October last.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the reasons why casual labourers employed on post office engineering work in Kilkenny City are paid at the rate payable by the County Council to labourers, rather than at the rate payable by the Corporation of Kilkenny to similar labourers, particularly in view of the fact that County Council road workers are rarely employed in the Kilkenny urban area and that Kilkenny Corporation is the relevant local authority in the Kilkenny City area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>In provincial areas, casual labourers employed by my Department are paid the rates prevailing for road workers employed by the county councils in the same areas on the grounds that the type of work on which both groups are employed is comparable.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Kilkenny County Council attend to only a small percentage of the roads in the urban area, that Kilkenny Corporation labourers attend to most of the roads and that they are paid at the hourly rate of 4/1½d.?  Is he further aware that other labourers who do work similar to that done by Post <Col N="1173" /> Office workers in Kilkenny are paid at the same rate, and in view of that, would it not appear that the very low rate paid to Post Office labourers on engineering work is completely unjust?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate was adjourned I was urging on the Minister for Transport and Power that, the euphemism which was now so widely employed by State companies of &ldquo;an operating surplus&rdquo; was inappropriate and was designed to cause confusion in the public mind.  The Minister urged that that was not so and that nobody mistook the phrase &ldquo;an operating surplus&rdquo; for a profit in the generally accepted sense of the term.  I think it is true that at least four or five Fianna Fáil Deputies, in the course of this debate, have in fact referred to an operating surplus as a profit.  It is just that confusion of mind which I deem inappropriate, and I am not altogether certain that it is not part of a studied policy on the part of the Minister for <Col N="1191" /> Transport and Power to use this terminology in order to conceal the fact that, with the exception of the Electricity Supply Board, every public company for which he is answerable to this House is making heavy annual losses which it ought to be his duty to defend as such on social or other grounds, and for which he is prepared to justify the very heavy payments which have to be annually made from the Exchequer or taxation in order to meet the losses being incurred by those companies.</P>
      <P>In connection with Aerlínte and Aer Rianta, the Minister interrupted at column 732, volume 198 of the Official Report to say: &ldquo; `Operating surplus' is the term used by all the air companies. They try to get some uniformity.&rdquo;  That may be true, but if you want to use it here and defend it on the ground that other companies use the term, then you ought to be able to demonstrate that that is not the only phrase in the accounts of other air companies that you have adopted. If you are quoting that phrase as used by Aerlínte and Aer Rianta, you ought to be in a position to show that the accounts of Aerlínte and Aer Rianta are in all particulars the same as those of other air companies, which I very much doubt.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the depreciation provisions and the liability for charges in respect of meteorological and airport facilities represent an identical charge in the accounts of Aerlínte and Aer Rianta, as they do in the other accounts to which the Minister referred.  If we got a true and honest picture of the losses these various companies are generating each year, it ought then be possible for us to determine on the merits which of them we are prepared to continue and which of them we believe ought to be brought to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of them, it may seem, are a necessary charge in order to maintain essential services.  I would be prepared to argue that in regard to any losses sustained by Aer Lingus, because, in the day and generation in which we live, it is as necessary to have some outside contacts with the world <Col N="1192" /> by air transport over which we have control as it is to have access to the outside world by any other method of transport and as I do not believe that it is expedient that we should be wholly dependent on BEA or BOAC for that kind of communication, I think it is justifiable to maintain Aer Lingus, even at the cost of some annual charge to the Exchequer.  I am not so convinced that that is the case in regard to Aerlínte and I am not satisfied that Aer Rianta is recovering from its customers a sufficient part of the total cost of maintaining their operations.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to hear from the Minister his view on the consequences of establishing the services maintained by Aer Rianta.  I understood that one of the reasons Aer Rianta was to be established was to make sure that other air services would continue to use Shannon.  I know a variety of other representations were made by the present Taoiseach at the time the legislation was before the House but, as is customary with the present Taoiseach, he was bluffing and blabbing and very largely prevaricating when he made those speeches.  He frequently is.  He said on that occasion, at column 1304 of the debates of 15th July, 1959:</P>
    <P>We are going into the development of the transatlantic air service in the confident expectation of making a cash profit as well as conferring other benefits directly or indirectly on the country.  Our expectations are based upon estimates prepared by very shrewed people who know this business thoroughly and who rarely have been wrong in similar estimates before.  Deputy McGilligan said I had justified this development on grounds of prestige.  I never mentioned the word &ldquo;prestige.&rdquo;  I have no interest in prestige in this regard.  The decision to proceed with this transatlantic air development, which had been pressed on me by the Board of Aer Lingus, was taken on hard, cold commercial facts and nothing else. </P>
    <P>It subsequently transpired that the Board of Aer Lingus had never made any such representations to the Taoiseach <Col N="1193" /> and I constrained him by Parliamentary Question into admitting that that was a misstatement of fact and that in fact the board to which he referred was the Board of Aer Rianta, a very different body.  But, observe that he was induced to embark upon this by &ldquo;a confident anticipation of a cash profit.&rdquo;  That has gone up the spout pretty effectively.  I do not believe that many people believed the Taoiseach when he said that in this House.</P>
    <P>He said that he hoped it would confer other benefits directly or indirectly on the country.  As I understood it, the other benefits were these: that the Government apprehended that with the development of jet aircraft, SAS, Swissair, TWA, Pan-Am, and the other great international airlines might get into the habit of overflying Shannon. If the Irish trade were left in a position that they had no other carrier to turn to if these foreign firms combined to resolve not to use Shannon any more, it was, therefore, important that an Irish firm should intervene in the traffic and fix all and sundry with notice that they were going to land at Shannon and those who wanted to cater for the Irish trade had better realise that they either land at Shannon or the Irish trade would be lost to them.</P>
    <P>That seemed a specious enough argument but what has happened in fact?  Is it or is it not true that, contrary to expectations, the nationalistic feeling of our people has proved to be so strong that the Irish emigrants or persons with Irish affiliations coming on a trip to Ireland, even though they intend to go on subsequently to the continent, have all patronised Aerlínte, with the result that we have a relatively high seat occupancy on Aerlínte compared with the other lines on the transatlantic route but with the astonishing effect that we have emptied Pan-Am, emptied TWA, emptied Swissair, emptied SAS, and the other transatlantic operators of Irish custom, with the result that the tendency for these lines to overfly Shannon has been greatly intensified and we are now faced with the prospect <Col N="1194" /> of reducing the whole status of Shannon Airport owing to a lack of terminal and in transit traffic there and, where we used to maintain a 24-hour restaurant service which was fully utilised and urgently required and where we had a large transit trade in commodities at the Shannon shop, we now find that the prospect is that the catering facilities at Shannon will very materially dwindle, that already a considerable number of staff are being laid off and that it is quite possible that in the foreseeable future only very restricted catering facilities will be required at Shannon at all and that the custom for the Shannon shop will tend to dwindle away because the transient traffic that used circulate through the airport while the various international lines paused at Shannon to unload their Irish passengers or to take them on have ceased to appear there at all because they either overfly the port or, if they come down, do not leave the aeroplane but go straight on.</P>
    <P>If this be true, then I apprehend that both of the brash and brazen kind of prophecies, which one would expect from the Taoiseach, of a cash profit and other benefits directly or indirectly for the country, have failed to materialise and that both calculations in that regard have proved to be wrong.</P>
    <P>I understand we have sought to remedy that situation by an effort to generate freight traffic through the Shannon Industrial Estate.  I always understood that one of the principal reasons for establishing the Shannon Estate on a site 15 miles removed from Ennis, and 20 miles removed from the city of Limerick, was that we wanted to put it close to the airport, in the belief that the bulk of the output would be carried on aircraft and, in some measure, substitute for the diminution of passengers traffic.  We took that decision at a very considerable cost to the town of Ennis and to the city of Limerick.</P>
    <P>Am I correct in my belief that far from our anticipations in that regard having been realised, the situation now is that more than 60 per cent.  of all <Col N="1195" /> the traffic generated by the Shannon Estate is going by rail and sea, that only about 30 per cent.  of the incoming traffic in raw materials and outgoing traffic in finished products is using aircraft and that the trend appears to be away from air transport and toward rail and sea freight in growing degree? If that is true, all I can say is that the calculations made in regard to this matter are strangely unrealistic.  It is more than high time for the Minister for Transport and Power, who is responsible to this House for these matters, to take the House into his confidence so that we can take decisions in the knowledge of the facts and not live in a kind of cloud-cuckooland, created by the perversion of language and the twisting of words to mean something far different from what people probably understand them to mean and what it is manifest, from the course of this debate, that the backbench members of Fianna Fáil have clearly understood them to be, because they have thought that operating surplus was synonymous with profits.  It is now manifest that the two concepts are entirely different and that operating surplus of £29,000 very frequently means a real annual loss of £500,000 or more, which must be ultimately made good by the Irish Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at the references by the Minister in his introductory speech to the accounts of Irish Shipping.  Here the company is declared to have shown an operating surplus of £279,000 for the 12 months ending 30th April, 1961 but, when the depreciation for the fleet over 11 months has been allowed for, the commercial loss is £409,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the significance of this figure of operating surplus? It seems to be wholly unrealistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> What is the purpose of giving a figure that has no significance at all?  If we ask CIE &ldquo;How much did you receive for freight or passenger transport at the stations of a particular branch line?&rdquo; they will say: &ldquo;We will not tell you, because if we told you, it would mislead you and addle you.&rdquo; These figures are not relevant to a true evaluation of the profit and loss of a rail system service; yet the Minister tells us, again and again, of this mysterious figure, the operating surplus, which appears to me to be a balance of the actual money paid out and the actual money paid in without any reference at all to the source of both items.  It transpires when we come to examine it more closely that part of the payments out in regard to Irish Shipping are made not in coin of the realm but in rust and depreciation and all the other risks inevitably associated with the operation of transport by sea.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us in his review that, although we are adding to the fleet, he apprehends there may be more ships laid up this year than there were last year and that our losses this year may be heavier than they were before.  At the same time, however, we appear to be building new ships in Holland to add to the fleet, part of which is already laid up and all of which is making heavy losses.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should tell us what programme the company has in mind.  Are we going to go on building ships making more losses or does the Minister say to us&mdash;an attitude I can understand: &ldquo;Now is the time; here is the day of deep depression when you can buy ships cheaply, and now is the time to invest in the confident anticipation that, in two or three years time, there will be a great boom in shipping&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I find the Minister's interruptions very helpful.  He says in his statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> With the establishment of the Verolme Cork Dockyard, the building at home of deep-sea vessels for the company is now also possible. The <i>Irish Rowan,</i> which is the first ship to have been built at the new dockyard, reflects great credit on the management and workers and marks, I hope, the beginning of a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the two companies. </P>
    <P>At Column 265, Volume 198 of the Official Report, he referred to the bulkcarriers and said:</P>
    <P>With the delivery of the second bulk-carrier, the company's dry-cargo fleet will total 153,500 tons deadweight so that only a further additional 47,000 will be required to meet the target of 200,000 tons which has been set.</P>
    <P>Upon my word, it is all very well to set targets, but suppose you find you are losing heavily on less than the target, is there not a great deal to be said for postponing the filling of the 47,000 tons for a fleet which is already losing £500,000 a year?</P>
    <P>My primary purpose in referring to these matters is to get away from the detestable system of living a lie and to induce the Minister, in terms that his own supporters understand, to state the facts clearly&mdash;what companies are making a profit and what companies are making a loss&mdash;and then to determine what we should do hereafter.  In that context I do not want to re-cap what I said the previous day but I want to remind the Minister that I sought to apply this test of which I am speaking not only to the shipping company and to Aer Lingus, Aerlínte and Aer Rianta, but also to Bord na Móna and to their accounts especially in so far as their relationship with the ESB is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one last matter of a specific character to which I want to refer.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister on more than one occasion during Question Time what plans are in hand to deal with the traffic at holiday times between this country and Great Britain and if sufficient precautions had been <Col N="1198" /> taken to ensure that reasonable accommodation will be provided for those who travel.  The reason I pressed that question on him is that the descriptions I read of conditions, written by people travelling from Great Britain to here, compare most unfavourably with the conditions that appear to obtain at the peak periods of travel between Great Britain and the Continent.  The distance to here is relatively short.  There is the Fishguard-Rosslare line, the Fishguard-Cork line, the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead line and the Dublin North Wall-Liverpool line.</P>
    <P>With this number of lines available, it does seem we ought to be able by duplicating or, if needs be, triplicating services to these several ports to secure that people wishing to spend a holiday here during the summer tourist season or at Christmas will not be subjected to the astonishing discomforts that I have seen described in the public Press. I cannot give the Minister the date of this publication, because it is not on the extract I have cut out, but I shall be pleased to hand him the original for the purpose of checking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an article, not a letter.  It speaks of the privileged minority sleeping in comfortable berths or resting in armchairs in first-class lounges, while the 500 ordinary passengers &ldquo;spent the night huddled on <Col N="1199" /> floors and stairways or wedged between mountains of luggage on the windy decks.  Some abandoned all hope of sleep and spent the whole journey looking out for the first signs of land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The article continues:</P>
      <P>I was as thankful as any when I left the ship after sharing their discomforts in the second class quarters of the ship.  I quickly discovered that some of the recent complaints about conditions in the night boats to Dublin had not been exaggerated.</P>
      <P>The plight of second-class passengers on these trips, run six nights a week by the British and Irish Steam Packet Company, is not new. For some years regular travellers to Ireland have seen samples of this, especially at peak holiday periods...</P>
      <P>Apart from the &ldquo;victims&rdquo; themselves, port officials and others who watch them leave the ship regularly at Dublin believe the problem is getting much worse.  They wonder when the company, which also runs a sister ship the <i>Munster</i>... will be urged to improve the facilities.</P>
      <P>Some passengers told me they felt they were being treated no better than cattle.  Many presented a depressing spectacle as the night voyage wore on.</P>
      <P>I had to step over people stretched out on the floors, in corridors and on stairways leading to the levatories. Men, women and children were trying to get sleep anywhere they could.</P>
      <P>Every available seat was occupied long before the boat left Liverpool. The rest then indulged in a kind of treasure hunt to find corners where they could sleep.</P>
      <P>The situation was aggravated when the bar closed an hour after we sailed.  The customers poured into &ldquo;makeshift&rdquo; dormitories and added to the congestion...</P>
      <P>A woman lying on the floor with a two-year-old baby, said &ldquo;I can't afford to travel first class.  It is only £1 more, but I would rather save that for my holiday, even though it means this sort of thing&rdquo;. </P>

If I had read that in some of the yellow press in Britain, I should not have bothered drawing the attention of the House to it because I would assume it was merely such a scare-mongering paragraph as might appear in papers with which we are quite familiar but which have not got the standing or reputation of the <i>Sunday Telegraph.</i> The lesson to be learned from what I have just read out is, I think, that the first-class passengers are relatively well off; apparently there is some attempt to measure the accommodation to the number of persons travelling first-class.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to one aspect. Let us be fair.  Suppose 500 second-class passengers turn up at Liverpool and they have only a four or five days holiday before them, which is it better for the shipping company to do? Is it better for the company to say to 150 of them: &ldquo;We will not take you. We have not got the room&rdquo; and leave them on the quay at Liverpool or to say: &ldquo;They have only got four or five days.  Push them on.  We will do the best we can for them&rdquo;.  I can understand the point of view of the shipping company finding itself faced with a crowd far in excess of the boat's scheduled capacity, but still within the limits of marine safety.</P>

      <P>You may have Board of Trade minimum regulations and you may have accommodation programmes of the shipping company, but the shipping company finds it is in the position that there are 150 men and women who want to get over to Ireland for a short holiday.  The company could either say to them: &ldquo;We will not take you and you will be writing letters to the papers,&rdquo; or to the crew: &ldquo;Look, the Board of Trade regulations permit us to take them. Shove them on.  We will do the best we can.  They will be there in the morning in any case.&rdquo;  If that were an isolated case in which there was a supreme effort made by the shipping company to get them home for a few days' holiday rather than send them back to Birmingham or Manchester, then I can imagine the story I have here described being a matter for praise.  But suppose this is a regular occurrence, then I think we are in duty bound to ask the Minister why this company does not provide a second boat.</P>

      <P>It is not the same thing because the boat may be drawn up at the quay in Liverpool in anticipation of a crowd no greater than the boat is able to carry in comfort.  Extra numbers turn up.  The company could put up the barrier and say: &ldquo;We do not give a damn what happens to you.  We are not going to have letters written to the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> about us.&rdquo; I think the shipping company is to be praised if, on a very odd occasion, it says: &ldquo;We have been caught short but we are not going to send the people home.  We will do the best we can.&rdquo; But suppose that is happening regularly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to defend the shipping company against that criticism, if it is an isolated case.  If it is an isolated case, in the circumstances, <Col N="1202" /> I think the shipping company are right to put them anywhere they can rather than send them back to Birmingham or Manchester, or whence ever they have come, and say: &ldquo;We do not give a damn.  Do without your holiday.&rdquo;  I want to be fair.  But suppose the Minister says we are obliged to confess that that is happening pretty regularly on the Liverpool-Dublin route during the holiday season, then I think he has a duty on him to say: &ldquo;This is not good enough.  This should not happen.  If it is tending to happen repeatedly, you have on you a duty to provide a second boat.  It is part of your job as a transport company to do it and if you will not, we will have to consider ways and means to provide additional transport, if needs be, by a national service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I know there are a number of people who will look down their noses and say: &ldquo;He does not know what he is talking about.  We have not the ships to do it.&rdquo;  That gives rise to justifiable and violent indignation.  The people who look down their noses and say: &ldquo;What nonsense he is talking: how can we spend money to provide ships to bring people home on holiday?&rdquo; are the same people who demand that we spend £½ million to provide facilities for people to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
      <P>I have much more sympathy for the people struggling to get back to have a holiday in the homes from which they were driven by hunger and want than I have for the people who want to fly to New York or San Francisco.  I think it is much more important to spend money to see that the second-class passengers on the Liverpool-Dublin route are reasonably catered for than to spend money in order to maintain Boeing jets flying across the Atlantic.  Here is the place and this is the occasion for a detached appraisal of the whole problem and the requirements to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister must keep in mind is that while technical advice is very valuable and should be fully weighed, it is not technocrats who are running the country.  We prefer, and I think the vast bulk of Deputies would prefer to see money spent on facilitating <Col N="1203" /> our people to come home on holidays from Great Britain than to see it spent to maintain other services which are of relatively little value to the ordinary people, who on the whole, we are sent here to represent, and whose interests it is our prime duty to protect.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will have time, in dealing with the many matters he will be called upon to deal with, to consider the matter I have raised as to the desirability of reviewing the question of whether the transport monopoly, especially in regard to the freight services, should be maintained in the new situation in which we find ourselves.  That, and the other topics to which I referred when speaking on the last occasion on this Estimate, are deserving of attention.  I shall be glad if the Minister can deal with them when he comes to close the discussion on the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I want to refer particularly to ESB services and charges.  To-day I addressed a question to the Minister for Defence and he referred me to a debate which would be taking place later on, and suggested that perhaps the Minister for Transport and Power might be in a position to answer the question better than he could.</P>
      <P>When the ESB make a connection in a newly built-up area, they very often seem to forget that the extra houses will be using extra current, and that extra transformers should be erected.  We very often find that with the additional houses, the strength of the current seems to drop, and the result is that people are literally unable to boil and egg on Sunday mornings or at peak periods.  The Minister should endeavour to get the ESB to do something about that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>I drew the attention of the Minister recently to the fact that despite the recent changes in legislation as a result of the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Bill, 1962, which became law on 7th August, 1962, and despite the fact that that Act provided subsidies of 75 per cent.  on the capital cost up to a maximum of £75 per house, there were a number of people not only being charged exorbitant prices but that in some cases the charges were doubled over a period of 12 months.  I wrote to the Minister and pointed out two cases in particular.</P>
      <P>One was a case of five dairy farmers who did not live on the side of a mountain but in the middle of a populated area which had been, for a long period, receiving electric current.  They lived on a farm which had been divided by the Land Commission, so, when the area was serviced originally, the houses where those people are now living were not in existence.  They asked for current.  The main reason they wanted it was that they were dairy farmers and the people to whom they supplied the milk instructed them that if they did not get coolers installed, it might not be possible to continue taking milk from them.  That is quite reasonable, and it happens pretty often in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister and explained <Col N="1205" /> the position to him.  I asked him, in view of the fact that the charge which they had been asked to pay was extraordinarily high, he could do something about it.  He did something about it. Within a reasonable time, he sent me a reply which no one could say was a brief one.  He certainly went into great detail pointing out how these people could get current at a reduced charge. He finished up with a gem which I should like him to explain when he is replying to the debate.  I quote from his letter:</P>
    <P>Enclosed is a copy of a Press Announcement made when it was decided to embark on further subsidisation of rural electrification.  As can be seen from paragraph 6, the Government were aware that a number of premises are so situated that the cost of connecting them would be extremely high and that the maximum subsidy of £75 for each premises would not be sufficient, in their case, to eliminate the necessity for substantial special service charges. The Government decided that, as an alternative, in these cases a subsidy of £10 per house should be offered to enable the householder concerned to install bottled gas.  A leaflet giving particulars of this scheme is also enclosed.</P>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister explain to me how they could cool milk with bottled gas?  That was the main reason they wanted the current installed. They wanted to cool the milk because they were in the dairying business.  I believe that is possible.  I believe there is a very complicated and expensive system by which it can be done, but a £10 bottled gas grant is not the answer to it.</P>
    <P>What amazes me is that the ESB continue to use this argument that they can only supply people living in a certain area.  The Minister's letter states:</P>
    <P>This Act provides for a subsidy of 75 per cent of the capital cost up to a maximum of £75 per house. As a result of this subsidy it is expected that about 100,000 additional houses can be offered connection at either the normal rates of charge <Col N="1206" /> related to the size of the premises or at rates less than 50 per cent above the normal rates.  The capital cost of connecting these houses would, on average, be less than £50 each.  There remain, however, an estimated 12,000 houses, the average cost of connecting which would be very high.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say how it can be stated it is not possible to give current at a reasonable charge to houses, not miles away, but in the middle of a thickly-populated area?</P>
    <P>There are one or two other cases I wish to deal with.  The gem of them concerns the people living beside Gormanston military camp.  This camp is in my constituency, a few miles from Balbriggan.  Even when Deputy Collins and I were there, the camp had electric light; but the people who lived outside it had not the privilege of having electric light.  They were not given that previlege mainly because of the fact that there was a military airfield attached to the camp.  I agree with the Department of Defence that the question of hazard should be taken into account.  But the people outside the gates, who lived in houses which had been there for many years before the camp was established as such, felt they should be entitled to some facilities. They asked the ESB to quote them. The ESB quoted them but pointed out that underground work would have to be done.  These people felt the charges were a bit high.  Eventually, when this new Act was passed, they decided they would take a chance and ask the ESB for a quotation again.</P>
    <P>I have the particulars of one case here.  It concerns a man who lives within 20 yards of the front gates of the camp.  He lives in a vested county council cottage, consisting of three rooms and a kitchen.  That man got a quotation at the normal fixed charge of 15/3 per two months, plus a special service charge of £9 15 11d., making a total charge of £10 11 2d. before he gets any current.  Apparently, the Department of Defence are the niggers in the woodpile here.  The ESB wrote to this man:</P>
    <P>We have now heard from the <Col N="1207" /> Department of Defence in regard to the extension to your house.  To make supply available and comply with the requirements of the Department, we are obliged to erect approximately 100 yards of overhead lines and to lay approximately 240 yards of underground cable.</P>
    <P>On account of the large cost involved, we are obliged to fix a by-mensal charge on your premises of £10 11 2d. which is made up of a special service charge of £9 15 11d. and a normal fixed charge of 15/3d. The standard unit charge also applies.</P>
    <P>They add, of course, the tailpiece, which was hardly necessary:</P>
    <P>If you wish to have supply on the above terms, please complete the attached application form.</P>
    <P>The fact that I have it here proves whether or not it is being completed.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Defence today was it not possible for his Department to accept the responsibility, because it is their fault that this has happened.  He politely told me it was a matter for Transport and Power, for the ESB.  I should like to have the Minister's comments on this.  It looks as if this man and a number of his neighbours are being treated very shabbily by this Department of State. They are just being made fools of.  If it is the position that this extravagant charge is being insisted on, then the Department of Defence should pay for the cost of the extra work.  If they do not, the Minister should see to it that the ESB give the current to those people at the normal fixed charge.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate whether or not the people living quite close to where the current is running can have the current at the normal charge.  I know of one instance where somebody who applied for current was told he could not have it off that line, because that line was not being used for that purpose at all. He accepted the excuse he got, and he was told he would have to pay £5 or £6 to have an extension from another line further down the road. <Col N="1208" /> The funny thing was, however, that a very well-to-do person bought a house further up the road and decided that he would like electric light.  The strange thing was that in his case the current could, and did, come off this line.  There was no difficulty about it and he got it at the normal charge. Yet the very much poorer man was told he could not have it and has not got it yet.</P>
    <P>Those are things the Minister should try to eliminate.  He may say these are the day-to-day activities of the ESB and are no function of his, but I can tell him that the responsibility is being laid at the door of the Minister for Transport and Power by the people concerned.  The ESB say: &ldquo;This is what the law lays down and we can do nothing about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have two further questions.  One concerns people living in areas which, because of the peculiar system adopted by the ESB of leaving pockets, were not serviced when the areas were being developed.  Even in thickly-populated areas, you will find these pockets left. They should be eliminated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>My second question deals with people who accepted current, before the new system was introduced, at the charge then laid down.  The fact that they accepted it then should not be held against them now and they should not be asked to pay until the cows come home a charge which normally they would not have had to pay.  It is unfair and it is something the Minister might take account of.</P>

      <P>I regret to inform the Minister that the likelihood of his immediately concluding this debate is somewhat remote.  My hands are not tied now in the way they were on the last occasion we had an opportunity of discussing Transport and Power. At that time the question of the West Cork Railway was <i>sub judice</i> and it was not right or proper for me to discuss it.  I now propose to deal with what might be more honestly and graphically referred to as the rape of West Cork.</P>
      <P>At no time did CIE produce any facts or figures about that line that would justify its closing.  Even at the penultimate stage of the decision, the Minister himself only wakened up to the fact that there was an immense revenue from beet haulage there but no consideration was at any time given to the future of the line in that regard or to the possibility of the development of the tourist industry in West Cork.  This is another stupid blunder of bureaucracy which I have no hesitation in saying, is tantamount to deliberate dishonesty.  I am laying at the Minister's door a deliberate charge of complicity and responsibility for this disastrous decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has only to go down to visit some of his friends in West Cork, and he has some friends in West Cork, to find out the devastation and the havoc that have taken place on the roads of West Cork since this stupid, unnecessary and unjustified decision to close the railways for the purpose of having a quick sale of rails to bolster up the capital losses of CIE.  That is all it was.  I am not going to be charitable about the codology put up by CIE that the figures might mislead us.  The only people who would have been misled by the figures were the people who did not get them and all the poppy-cock and nonsense about having to spread the revenue from the beet freight throughout a whole length of line is rubbish and nobody knows that better than this statistically-minded, figure-tortured Minister.  I am saying on behalf of the people of West Cork that the Government are responsible <Col N="1210" /> for aiding CIE in the unjustifiable destruction of 30 odd miles of worthwhile railway line.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied from investigations made from time to time of the use of this railway line that there were nothing like the losses in its operation which have been suggested by CIE. If the Minister saw the havoc the heavy beet trailers are doing to the West Cork roads, he would see what a burden the use of these trailers has thrown on to the ratepayers, a burden that would have been infinitely lighter if it had been met by a contribution from the Cork County Council to the upkeep of the railway.  The contribution to be made by CIE will fall short by hundreds of thousands of pounds of what is necessary to put those roads right now after having to meet the initial destruction caused by the CIE freight blunderbusses inefficiently run and inadequately serviced.</P>
    <P>The Minister allowed this line to go in the light of an industrial development that has since arisen and in the light of an immense impetus by the people of West Cork in the development of tourism.  The initiative that was going to make possible a type of package holiday which would bring families in the city out into the fresh air and into an air of conviviality has been destroyed because if it was one thing to bring a family on a holiday in the inefficient trains which were run by CIE, it is infinitely worse to try to bring such a family on a long journey in a CIE bus.</P>
    <P>I am again saying that every reason given by CIE and supported by the Minister for the abolition of the West Cork railway line is codology and rubbish and I am asking Providence to preserve us from the alleged transport experts.  We have had nothing from CIE but a sorry record of glorious inefficiency.  I am going to take up in this matter where Deputy Dillon left off because it is time that somebody stopped the monopoly and the codology that is going on in the CIE road freight department.  Things were bad enough when we had the West Cork railway and we had CIE showing their administrative capacity by running the trains, buses, lorries and vans into the same area within 30 <Col N="1211" /> minutes of each other, creating fresh competition amongst themselves and completely ignoring the needs, wishes and comfort of the business people and passengers.  As a result of that, we now have the development where more and more business people have to buy their own lorries and transport facilities because of two things, the inefficiency of CIE and the extravagant cost.</P>
    <P>It is an amazing thing that the type of carrier the Minister will not allow to operate outside 15 miles can, within the 15 miles limit, always beat the tar out of CIE and give efficient service at the present time.  Has the time not come to stop the rubbish of saying to these people that they must have a plate in order to join the select vested interest group when we know that people who are not inflicted by the type of administrative monster created by CIE can carry goods more cheaply, more safely, more quickly and more efficiently?  Surely we have to face up to the fact that if we have to maintain a rail system in this country at a loss, instead of calling in foreign experts, the Minister should sit down and consider what is a simple solution to the whole problem.</P>
    <P>It is so simple that the Government will not have it and the experts will not understand it.  Would the Minister think of taking it on himself to allow the free operation of road transport again and make the people operating the road freight service as private enterprise pay a carrier's fee of so much a ton on the lorries they use?  If he did this, he would be able to make the necessary subvention to maintain the CIE rail system and give the Irish industrialist, business man and farmer an efficient, speedy and effective service. It is so simple, and I have said it so often, that I know the Minister will succeed in getting Sir somebody from God-knows-where, or possibly some gentleman now described as an expert but who probably has no more credentials than the man in the moon, but he will succeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is wrong with the Minister is his egotistical vanity and stupidity.  There is no doubt that one of the Minister's functions is tourism.  Possibly because his environment is different, or because his outlook may be continental, the outlook of Bord Fáilte is as unbalanced and unreal as can be.  I have never yet believed, and I never shall believe, that the person who provides money for the Irish people through tourism is the fellow who flies across the Atlantic and stays at plush-lined, subsidised hotels. I know&mdash;and the Minister knows, if he applies his mind to it&mdash;that our own people coming back for holidays and the workingclass and middleclass English tourists who bring their cars and fishing gear and their families to this country are the type of people that Bord Fáilte do not cater for.</P>
      <P>If you try to get facilities from Bord Fáilte for the little man who wants to put in a few wash-hand basins in his house, to make things a little better so that he can give better facilities to the people who are coming, the amount he wants is too small for the lordly Bord Fáilte to consider.  The little contribution he wishes to make is insignificant compared with the &ldquo;posh&rdquo; hotels which we shall have in the near future and for which the Irish people, in the main, are going to pay.  Have no doubt about it, the amount of the contribution that will be made by the outsiders will be microscopic compared with the contribution to be made by Bord Fáilte towards building these hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> There is no doubt that most of the nice tourist places, such as those the Minister discovered in his rambles through West Cork or Donegal or the West of Ireland or in the unknown parts of Kerry, have a value and an intrinsic beauty that is apparently lost on Bord Fáilte, its directors and administration, lost in the tinsel and plateglass, the luxurious colour, the luxurious openings and in the stupid cocktail parties and idle chatter.  A wonderful new conception seems to be growing up that unless you have the sort of place, either a hotel or an industry, in which all the senior Civil Service officials and all the Ministers and all the minions are asked to drink the multitudinous variety of cocktails available, partake of the various delightful savouries and talk utter nonsense, you are of no consequence.</P>
    <P>Is it not time we got down to reality and faced the fact that it is not in the top stratum that Irish tourism is to develop?  It is through the improvement of amenities for the ordinary people, because, whether the Minister and Bord Fáilte realise it or not, the greatest number of people in the world are ordinary people and the fly-by-nights, the fops or the illusory millionaires are a very small section of any community.  The sooner we realise this the better, because we must realise that we are spending the money of the Irish people and we must get down to dealing with the biggest possible section of the Irish people in distributing that money by way of reinvestment and development.  It is time the Minister ceased the codology by which one must do a £500 job before one gets a grant from Bord Fáilte.  There are some places in my constituency where, if they got a reasonable loan of £80 to £150, they could do a worthwhile job for themselves and it would be done quickly and efficiently and they could make their contribution in the coming season by having an extra five or six visitors or an extra family kept in reasonable comfort in areas where, thank God, there is much hospitality and kindliness.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has been rightly, in my opinion, much criticised because it is time its whole direction was changed. <Col N="1214" /> The Minister is responsible for policy. According to some speeches he has made, the Minister is keenly interested in the development of tourism, in the co-ordination of deep-sea fishing, coarse angling and river fishing.  Surely he has learned by now that the most numerous followers of Walton and his theory of the comfort and relaxation of fishing are not among the cigar-smoking, whiskey-swilling transcontinental flying type but among the ordinary, decent middleclass and workingclass people who can afford to take a little holiday and who seek, not the luxuriously-appointed bedroom with separate toilet and shower accommodation but who are perfectly satisfied if they get a comfortable bed, a reasonable meal and the use of an ordinary bath.  They want to get these facilities near the river or lake or sea area in which they want to enjoy their sport.  If the Minister is in earnest, it is time he told Bord Fáilte to direct its mind to that and not to what I might describe as oftentimes increasing the strain on hotel accommodation in the cities.</P>
    <P>It is out on the hillsides, the lake-sides and the sea coast of Ireland that you will find the abundant variety and the tremendous kindliness that have made us famous as a nation, and it is the people of these areas who deserve the best possible financial help that we can afford to give them. People who want to improve the accommodation in their guesthouses, their private houses or their small hotels should be given every encouragement to do so.</P>
    <P>I can proudly boast, representing South-West Cork, that there is no area in Ireland in which the people make such an all-out effort in their homes, guesthouses and small hotels to improve standards and to give good, expert service, excellent food, with cleanliness and kindliness, at reasonable prices.  I like to think it was our efforts there in drawing the alleged experts from Bord Fáilte down among us to learn how to do things which played one of the big parts in raising our standards generally.  Now, in times of depreciating money values and our alleged entry into the Common Market, we must establish ourselves <Col N="1215" /> as people prepared to give comfortable, worthwhile holidays to ordinary people at reasonable prices.  That is the best sales talk we could give if we are to attract tourists.  The amazing thing about the decent people of Ireland is that if the hand of bureaucracy is kept away from them the festivities will go much more merrily among them and among the tourists when they arrive.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Tully, I have seen many difficulties arising from the pockets that have been left behind in the development of rural electrification. One of the main complaints is that many of these pockets were left because the canvass was not satisfactory. Some of the people who were pioneers in helping the ESB in such areas now find themselves the victims of new savage charges which the ESB, for reasons I cannot fathom&mdash; I suppose the Minister will say they are economic reasons&mdash;are imposing on them.  These charges are sometimes double and even treble what they would have been some years ago.  It is nonsense that the ESB at this stage should appeal to the Minister and the Government for subsidies towards the installation of gas in certain areas to replace the responsibilities and the undertakings given by the ESB to complete the electrification of this country.</P>
    <P>It may involve losses to the ESB at this stage but they will recoup those losses <i>in futuro.</i> They would certainly never amount to the losses I shall deal with later on in reference to some of our much vaunted State companies who are losing at the rate of £500,000, £750,000 or so annually.  I do not see how anyone could object to the ESB sustaining losses in ensuring the comfort of our own people.  The Minister should be strong enough to go back to the Government and say: &ldquo;God knows, if Jim McCarthy or Michael Donovan or somebody else has the courage and the heart to live on his rocky mountain holding, on his harsh, rugged farm, and keep his family there by sheep raising or mixed husbandry, surely he deserves more sympathy and support than anybody else and surely it should be our bounden duty to give <Col N="1216" /> him, in his courage and isolation, every possible comfort this country can afford.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is so much codology, so much stark nonsense in the type of cheap bureaucracy that is growing up that we do not seem to be able to look at first things first.  I do not care what rubbish may be talked about some of the State companies.  I can tell the Minister here and now that he will always have my full support for any measures he may take to enable the ESB to complete their rural electrification network and to bring light and power to these isolated pockets as quickly as possible.  I know that expenditure will be involved, that there will be difficulties, but I feel sure the Minister would be flabbergasted by the support he would command if he were to come into the House with proposals of such a nature.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I, too, have complaints from people whose supply has been disconnected.  I know it is not easy, sometimes, for a big unwieldy company to consider each small item of complaint.</P>
    <P>The ESB are in a unique position where debts are concerned.  They have a sanction and a method of collection denied to any other type of trader or business.  Where ESB charges are due, and where a large portion of them may be hire purchase charges, the ESB should not disconnect a consumer who may be in a temporary difficulty due to unemployment, illness, and so on, if he pays the account in respect of the current used.  Some element of humanity should enter into the privileged hire purchase position in which the ESB find themselves.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience as a lawyer that, when hardship occurs in a family, most of the maligned hire purchase companies sympathetically receive representations and always extend the period where the circumstances warrant it, so as to enable the person to catch up on whatever temporary difficulties he was in.  When dealing with the powers of the ESB to cut off current for non-payment of accounts, where circumstances of unemployment or difficulty arise, once the commitment in respect of the amount of current used is met, the Minister <Col N="1217" /> should consider favourably a continuation of the supply and some method of adjustment between the consumer and the ESB in relation to the other charges that may come under the heading of articles acquired on the hire purchase system.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of tremendous value to tourism, and indeed considerable improvement in the type of programme Telefís Éireann are producing, Bord Fáilte might make a series of worthwhile films of certain not so publicised tourist centres in Ireland of extreme beauty and variety.  They would be of immense educational value to our people and would help them to choose places for their holidays.  I have in mind films about certain parts of counties such as Donegal, Kerry, West Cork, Wicklow, some of the inland counties where lake fishing and wood areas abound.  Our people would be able to enjoy an occasional programme consisting of such films rather than some of the canned international rubbish and some of the &ldquo;hill-billy&rdquo; cowboys shooting so many men dead.  They would see some of the beautiful parts of their own country.  They would be encouraged to overcome the <i>blasé</i> rubbish of continental trips and, rather, to see a bit of Ireland first.</P>
    <P>I come now to Irish Shipping. Nobody is more conscious than I am that at a certain stage of our history Irish Shipping, with very ancient and decrepit ships, did a very worthwhile job.  I have no doubt that in certain ways the company&mdash;in its personnel and in its ships&mdash;has an extremely high record.  I do not know how the Minister can defend the policy of expansion in the company when even the dogs in the streets are barking the fact that shipping is being laid up and piled up all over the world.  Charter has become very difficult and freight for ships is becoming equally difficult.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to face the problem of whether there is any reality in Irish Shipping wanting to achieve a target of 200,000 tons.  Would we not be much better off with half of that target, and have it working?  We are not in the difficult position in Irish Shipping that we want replacement.  Most <Col N="1218" /> of our ships are among the most modern in the world.  Most of them for a considerable time have been on charter.  If they had not been on charter, the disaster in Irish Shipping would have been a <i>débâcle.</i></P>
    <P>Has the time not come for us to stop thinking that we are the pivotal point of an empire, or something? We want an empire in the air and an empire on the sea and all the playboys of the world in plush hotels.  Has the time not come for us to assess the fact that we are a progressive, small, sturdy nation and that we should be able to assess our potential and our needs? Unless we are to start something like an international shipping line, to compete with our transatlantic air line, I cannot see why reality and reason, practicability and commonsense cannot limit the needs of Irish Shipping to some practical figure in the potential of its trade.  That is particularly so when we know that shipping of first-class condition, of most recent and modern type, can either be bought infinitely cheaper than the price we are now paying for ships being completed or can be chartered very readily, if any necessity arises for Irish Shipping to do some extraordinary type of trade in a hurry.</P>
    <P>I want to see preserved a good Irish Shipping Company but I want to see it as a practical reality, not the frothy imaging or the megalomaniac concept of a money-spending mad Government. I want to see it as something that will endure and inure to the benefit of the Irish people as a practical working proposition, paying its way.  I urge the Minister to have a moratorium on the investment of the State in Irish Shipping.  I urge him to say to the Directors of Irish Shipping: &ldquo;From now on, it is not an operating service that we want but a practically-run business showing some profit to service the continued use of the company and something to put into reserve against further replacements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of these State companies&mdash;whether they be Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, Irish Shipping, and so on&mdash;which carry a tremendous wealth of Irish investment, with a token promise to repay which is as <Col N="1219" /> idle and as vain as would be our sending somebody from this island to the moon.  I would far rather see the Irish people and the Irish Parliament amortise all these investments and say: &ldquo;They were good investments; they did develop the type of company we wanted in certain ways.  Now that their growing pains are over and they are established, let us wipe out their debt to the nation; let them become competent companies and not be coming back to us year after year for further dips into the public purse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Companies like Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping and indeed Aer Lingus were well worth establishing and subsidising to the present stage.  However, we shall have to make a very serious appraisal as to whether or not it is wise to continue to delude the Irish people and ourselves by producing what I might describe as ornate but spurious accounts to show operating surpluses.  These investments may have paid off in the social value and the employment they gave and to that extent any investment by an Irish Government in them has been justified.  I am prepared to say that is so, but has the time not come when the people who will reap the benefit of these amenities should pay for them?  I can assure the Minister that it is not the McCarthys, the O'Donovans and the other people in the far-flung fastnesses of my constituency who will get the benefit of transatlantic air travel or indeed of the limited berth accommodation for travel across the ocean in Irish shipping.</P>
    <P>It has come as a salutary shock to many people that these concerns about which so much has been sung in their praise have never repaid any of the capital invested or even the interest on it.  It is time these concerns stood on their own feet.  If prices have to go up for air freight or air passengers, if prices have to go up to meet the trading deficits of Irish Shipping, let them go up and let the people who use these companies use them in the normal commercial way, and let these companies go into competition on a businesslike basis.</P>

      <P>The Minister would rather the poor unfortunate farmer in West Cork paid for them.  I do not believe in that rubbish.  I believe the farmer in West Cork, working his patch of ground and making his contribution to the Irish people, is far more worth a subsidy than the passengers we want to carry in Aer Lingus planes and who are off-shipped to BEA or BOAC when Aer Lingus cannot carry them.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;You are not worth listening to,&rdquo; because he has a concept of the more sophisticated or naíve or personable person using the airline, but it does not get away from the fact that it is the unfortunate taxpayers of Ireland who are paying for them and also paying for Irish Shipping and Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>I saw the Minister as usual disgorging himself of wisdom, allegedly basic commonsense and statistics, at the recent IATA Conference in Dublin. An examination of the situation by international airway people on that occasion certainly did not leave any hope, unless somebody injected some reality into the situation, that these State-sponsored air companies at home and abroad were ever going to be other than the grandiose playthings of the unwary taxpayer.</P>
      <P>If we do not face reality in relation to this company we shall be in the impossible situation we are already in with regard to the Minister's primary problem, CIE, and we shall eventually get to the stage where we shall have to pour more and more money down the drain to meet competition, to pour more and more money by way of subsidy into Shannon to keep it open, to say nothing of the industrial area around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not time a halt was called to these schemes and attention drawn to the fact that there must be a bottom to the well?  I know the Minister does not like reality.  If he did, he would direct his ability to a ministry with some function in it.  If you ask the Minister a question about CIE, the Minister has no function in the matter; about the ESB, the Minister has no <Col N="1221" /> function in the matter; and Irish Shipping, the Minister has no function in the matter; about anything in his Department, he suddenly becomes one of these vacillating people who just stand up to say: &ldquo;I am Minister for Transport and Power but do not ask me anything about either transport or power because I have no function in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not believe that that is right. I do not believe the Minister's interpretation of his function is right.  He is charged with responsibility to this House for the control of policy in all these companies, and, what is more, he is charged with their administration to the extent that he must ensure that their administrations carry out the policy directed.  Is it the policy of this Government to continue allowing these companies to operate on an operating surplus that would not service their running accounts, never mind their debt accounts, never mind contribute a farthing to their interest accounts?</P>
    <P>I am not going to be misrepresented or to allow myself to be misinterpreted. I do not want it to be said that I do not conscientiously believe that these projects were worth bringing into being, but we have now to assess the continued cost of supporting them as uneconomic entities in the light of the responsibility we have to vast sections of the community to help them.  We have to ask ourselves the realistic question as to whether it would not be better to see very substantially extra grass grown in Ireland than more Irish Shipping ships laid up at enormous expense in cost and maintenance, or whether it would not be better to see increased production of first-class Landrace pigs as a better prospect than some of the loud-voiced, cigar-smoking international travellers in the very efficient Irish service across the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>In fairness to that service, it must be said that they have succeeded in wresting an immense amount of transatlantic traffic from other companies, because fortunately we are not yet overtainted with some of the stilted customs of other airlines and fortunately the natural charm and courtesy of the Irish girls and crews, flying these planes, has come to the top and <Col N="1222" /> enables a transatlantic Aer Lingus flight to be a comfortable, homely, pleasing journey as distinct from many of the irritating rules, regulations and indeed mass directions we find at some continental airports.  But after all that, we must equate the ultimate cost of keeping this type of service against what better could be done with the money.</P>
    <P>I believe that in, particular, in connection with tourism the Minister is at last a convert to the idea of directing our main impetus to the not so wealthy but very pleasant type of tourist that we get from the English middleclass or the good class English workingclasses, and that he is prepared to concede that the people coming back from far flung parts of England and, indeed, even further distances returning to their homes on visits, contribute a very substantial part of our tourist revenue.  It is essential that Bord Fáilte revises and reorientates itself on the problem of the amenities to encourage.  It is well to know that we have come to the end of the large luxurious hotel building bubble, and that, whatever luxurious hotel is to come in the future, will be that of private enterprise, and developed by sources of money other than a virtual building grant from the State.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that at last some of the concepts of the Lord Bishop of Cork, Dr. Lucey, have been recognised, that it is the duty and the purpose of Bord Fáilte to preserve and where necessary contribute to the enhancement of the beauties of those small places.  Deputy MacCarthy opposite and I could enumerate them on our hands and toes within a very few short miles of where we live, whether it be the beauties of Kinsale, Glandore, Baltimore or down to the rugged fastnesses of the Beara Peninsula or back into the pleasant beauty and entrancing sights of Gouganebarra and Inchigeela with its mountainside, lakes and rivers.  All of this is something that we do not have to sell.  We have only to get the people to see it.  Anybody who has come there has come there again and again, and it is into these places that we must put the extra bit of money and effort.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows personally of <Col N="1223" /> the tremendous effort the village of Inchigeela has made to put itself on the map, what the people of Ballingeary are doing, and the work of the West Cork Development Association to create a bed bureau and to co-ordinate and deal with the problems of people who wanted to come in. Knowing that, I am pressing upon him to direct the minds of the Board, and the money available to it, into those areas where the decent, simple honest man and his family are met in their own environment with their immense intrinsic charm, displaying that incalculable hospitality that is so typical of the Irish.  Let him face the fact that that type of investment is going to increase enormously the arrivals of the type of tourist we want, the touring Britisher we find in his maybe aged Rover, or, indeed, aged Rolls, often stopping on the roadside and appealing to you above all other things in the development of Irish tourism to preserve this wonder of simple courtesy and this charm of people in their own areas that is so completely strange to them and such an extraordinarily attractive thing to them.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment last night, I was pointing out that the Minister for Agriculture said that taking the agricultural workers from the Agricultural Wages Board, and putting them under the Labour Court or a joint labour committee, would mean having a Minister other than the Minister for Agriculture in charge of their wage fixing machinery and he thought it was not the right way to deal with the matter.  I was pointing out that, in fact, very many other people, very many other <Col N="1224" /> sections of workers, are removed from the jurisdiction of a particular Minister for the purpose of fixing their wages.  Perhaps a typical example would be law clerks who normally are under the Minister for Justice but, in fact, whose wages and conditions of employment are regulated by the joint labour committee of the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>Local authority employees, who are under the Department of Local Government, again have their wages fixed by the Labour Court.  Bord na Móna and ESB workers who are under the Department of Transport and Power again have their wages fixed by the Labour Court, Dairy and creamery workers, who are under the Minister's own jurisdiction, have their wages and conditions fixed by the Labour Court joint labour committee.  Even hospital workers who are under the jurisdiction of an Tánaiste have their wages and conditions fixed by the Labour Court from time to time.</P>
      <P>There is nothing unusual, therefore, in changing agricultural workers and putting them also under the Labour Court.  They would just be falling in line.  It would be doing something I think long over-due by preventing anybody from referring to agricultural workers as second-class citizens.  A long as we have one set of laws governing the wages, working conditions and wage fixing machinery of agricultural workers and a different set giving higher wages and better conditions to all other workers, it can rightly be said that the agricultural worker is the Cinderella and is, in fact, a second-class citizen as far as those in control of his destiny are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that it has been stated here that there is very close contact between the agricultural employer and the agricultural worker and, of course, that may be so on the odd occasion where one man is employed for a particular reason&mdash;because of the illness of the head of the house perhaps&mdash;on a relatively small farm, but I can assure the Minister&mdash;and I have more experience of it perhaps than anybody else in this House&mdash;that there is very <Col N="1225" /> little close contact between big farmers and farm workers.  To suggest that they are brothers doing the same type of work just does not ring true to those who know what the position is.  The worker is somebody working for wages, doing hard work, skilled work.  Do not forget that the farm worker must not alone know everything about crops, sowing, reaping and rotation, but he must also now know in most cases how to do running repairs and how to run machinery.</P>
    <P>The farm worker is a man who gets wages at the end of the week, the small pittance that is paid to him, and when, for one reason or another he is unable to continue working, he has to depend on his family if he has got one or on friends to sustain him until the good Lord calls him.  The proof of this, if proof is needed, will be found in a visit to any of our county homes because it is unfortunately true that more farm workers end their days in county homes than any other class of worker in the country. It is a shocking reflection on the farming community and on the agricultural industry in a country such as this to find that attitude.</P>
    <P>Of course it is the natural follow on to the type of treatment the agricultural worker has been getting.  He never got enough pay to meet his ordinary outgoings while he was working and surely then there is no reason why we should be surprised to find that he has not been able to put anything by for the rainy day or when he is no longer able to work and has nobody else to look after him that he must find his way to the nearest county home.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made here about the question of the &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; wage, that the Agricultural Wages Board fix a &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; wage.  Of course we know that according to the Act they do fix a minimum wage, but those who say that it is not also recognised throughout the country by a different name are less than truthful because we all know that in the agricultural community the minimum wage for the area as laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board is referred to <Col N="1226" /> as the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; wage.  When somebody is hired by a farmer he is told he will be paid the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; wage. I was amazed to hear people, who should know better, talking in this House as if, with very few exceptions, farm workers were paid very much more than the minimum rate of wages. We know from our own experience, and can give the Minister evidence if he requires it, that the majority of farm workers in the country receive the minimum wage or the standard wage, if you like to call it that.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about it is that while agriculture is referred to, by anybody who wants to praise it, as the primary industry of the country, we have never been able to get the agricultural employer to pay a rate of wages comparable with that paid to those who process the agricultural produce after it leaves the farm.  As a matter of fact, if you look over the list, bacon, meat, butter, cheese, fruit canning, grain milling, bread and flour, sugar, confectionery, food preparation, distilling, you find that every worker there is paid a much higher rate than that paid to the agricultural worker.  There does not seem to be any reason for this.  If the processing of agricultural produce can afford to pay a decent rate, then surely the people who produce it should also be entitled to receive a decent rate. I do not think there can be any reason.</P>
    <P>Take other rural occupations.  In the case of the ESB, Bord na Móna, forestry and road workers, the working week has been reduced but the Agricultural Wages Board insist they have no right to alter the working week for agricultural workers.  It is rather interesting, too, that while the previous chairman of the Wages Board accepted motions for the purpose of discussing the question of reducing the working week, the present chairman has so far refused to accept such motions despite the fact that while the previous chairman was accepting them, the present chairman was Secretary of the Department of Agriculture.  While I am sure he was an excellent man at his job over the years as Secretary of the Department, the wage-fixing machinery for agricultural workers is of such <Col N="1227" /> importance that it is not right that a person, who has completed his normal span as a civil servant and who did an excellent job in that capacity, and who has gone out on pension, should be taken back and put in charge of that machinery.  It is belittling the agricultural worker that that sort of antics should be adopted.  Again, I am afraid the Minister or his predecessor must accept responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Agricultural Wages Board may be, and I am sure he is, a normal decent Irishman but his outlook on agricultural wages seems to be very different from that of other people.  For that reasons, a person who could be termed independent should have been appointed.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill, I referred to the constitution of the Agricultural Wages Board.  Let me repeat that I think it is too bad that the board should be so constituted.  Apparently, according to the central Board the five regional boards have no authority to do anything.  The central board have repeatedly rejected recommendations made by them.  If they stand for anything, at all, there should be some other system of appointing members.  The Minister will not disagree when I say that in areas in which the trade union of which I am general secretary made recommendations to have members who were employed as farm workers appointed on regional committees, the Minister's name was used to make the appointments and people who were not connected in any way with agriculture were appointed.</P>
    <P>One thing occurred again and again, namely, that in very many cases the persons appointed were close connections of the local Fianna Fáil cumann. As a politician, I can understand that certain people, if they want to get into a position, will approach the politician and say that he would like a trip to Dublin so many times a year and suggest that he should be appointed.  The Minister should resist that sort of pressure. There was an instance of a county council road worker being appointed as a regional member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We all come to Dublin a couple of times a week.  We protested very strongly because of the fact that this man had nothing to do with agriculture.  He was secretary of a cumann at one end of the parish and he was replaced last year by the secretary of the next cumann, who happened to be a farm worker.  We have no objection at all to that.  The Minister should ensure that farm workers are appointed to these boards or, otherwise, that persons who represent trade unions should be appointed, not someone who has no connection whatever with agriculture.</P>
      <P>The same could be said of farmers' representatives.  A farmer who has 15 or 20 acres of land should not be appointed as a farmers' representative on the Agricultural Wages Board.  Such a farmer does not employ labour and would have no idea of the position of a man who is an employee.  He does what he thinks will curry favour with the bigger farmers in the area.  There are many instances, all over the place, of such persons being appointed as farmers' representatives on the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
      <P>The Minister made references to the constitution of the central board.  He said that four people were nominated by the Federation of Rural Workers. He was very nearly right.  Three of them were; the fourth was not.  I do not know who nominated him.  We certainly did not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When the period of office of a board is up, we usually make recommendations but in this case somebody died and a new member was appointed.  I am not quarrelling with him at all, just correcting the Minister's statement.  We have farmers' representatives and the Minister said that one of them represented a farmers' organisation.  Formerly, he was a member of a farmers' organisation but he now has no connection with it, good, bad or indifferent.  I should just like to make that point.  I do not know whom the other three represent.  However, again that is a matter which the bigger farmers should look after.  I am sure they will do so.</P>
      <P>The neutral members are those to whom I take strong exception.  The Minister must agree that if a person is neutral, he should have no bias towards either side.</P>

      <P>For instance, there is a lady on a board who has no connection with either side.  For that reason, I would accept that, whatever she does, she would have a neutral attitrude. The Minister also has somebody on the board who is a very large employer of labour and whose labour rates are influenced very considerably by the rates paid to agricultural labourers in the area around the town where he operates.  The Minister must agree that that is wrong, that that situation should not be allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>No, I have no intention of naming the individual.  Also, I consider that he is not neutral.  He could not be neutral.  If he is neutral, he is not human.  He must have his ideas weighted towards the agricultural employers.  He is a Fianna Fáil member of a council, as is also the man who works with him.  He is a school teacher and a man who was there before was also a Fianna Fáil member of a county council and also a school teacher.  I have nothing against any of these people, except that it has been our experience time and again that these neutrals seem to be biased towards one side.  If the records of the boards were checked, the number of occasions on which they voted against workers' proposals would be seen to be 99 per cent.</P>

      <P>No.  In the original Agricultural Wages Act from which this was called, he was not called neutral.  He is not called neutral in Northern Ireland.  He is called neutral here.  The Minister could come much nearer to getting a neutral otherwise than by appointing a very big employer <Col N="1231" /> of labour.  Possibly somebody who does not employ labour and who has a mind of his own can be found but it is unfair to expect somebody who does employ labour to a large extent to act as a so-called neutral on the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I join issue with the Minister there, but it is a fact that his rates of wages are influenced greatly by the rate being paid to agricultural labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a trade union dealing with industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But for the fact that the Chair has ruled me out of order on certain things, I would explain why, in this particular case, the trade union does not operate the way it should. When somebody prevents a trade union from operating and persuades workers not to be members, it is very hard for a trade union to operate in that industry. I do not want to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at that confession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a confession; it is a statement of fact; and if the Minister wants further information I can let him have it.  I can let him have plenty of information.  We have not gone past the stage where people will still threaten employees to force them out of a trade union.  As far as the rates of wages in rural Ireland are concerned, we find that, in Carlow, for instance, the ESB workers working a 45-hour week are paid 187/6; Bord na Móna workers all over the country, working 45 hours, are paid <Col N="1232" /> 159/4d.; forestry labourers in Carlow, working a 48-hour week are paid 169/-and road workers are paid 140/7.  Farm workers are paid 120/-.  That is the pattern right through.  In Dublin, forestry workers are paid 180/-, road workers 179/6d. and farm workers 135/-, the highest rate in the country. In Cavan, ESB workers are paid 187/6 and farm workers, for a 50-hour week, 120/-.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the farm workers under the Board are receiving a very raw deal.  If the Minister, as I am sure he will, sits down and looks at this, he will find that the wages which have been paid to farm workers are not what should be paid to people engaged in the important industry in which they are engaged.  I am sure he will agree with me that Deputy Dillon's suggestion that Fine Gael were forcing the pace into the Common Market so that the farm workers would get a square deal is not going to have the farm workers lighting bonfires on the hills, because we are still a long way from the Common Market and, apparently, from the reception given to this Bill, a long way from the square deal which everybody in the House is prepared to talk about but very few prepared to support.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to the fact that, if we go into the Common Market, we must of necessity pay the same rates and work the same hours as other countries in the Common Market. Of course that is so and there is a hope there, but we should not forget that, before going into the Common Market, the farm workers have still to live, they have still to exist&mdash; and it is more an existence than a living&mdash;and that the onus is on the Government to do something about their wages and conditions rather than wait until the possible advent of the Common Market either next year or in another six years' time.</P>

May I mention something of which perhaps the Minister is not aware?  That is that in 1948 the difference between industrial and agricultural wages was 44s. 2d. a week. In 1949 it was the same; in 1950 it was 46s. 8d.  That was the difference, mark you, taking an average all over the country, both for industrial and agricultural workers.  In 1951 the difference was 51s., in 1952 it was 50s. 10d., in 1953 it was 52s. 10d., in 1954 it was 53s., in 1955 it was 60s. 8d., in 1956 it was 56s. 11d., in 1957 it was 61s. 1d., in 1958 it was 70s. 5d., in 1959 it was 69s. 10d. and in 1961 it was 72s.  There was a difference of £3 12s. a week between the average wages paid to industrial and agricultural workers.</P>

      <P>I am sure of it.  The Minister complained yesterday that he <Col N="1234" /> was getting a number of questions from me about the Agricultural Wages Board and that he did not know the purpose of the questions and found difficulty in giving courteous replies. I am glad to say that he did continue to give courteous replies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much. For that reason, I should like to give the Minister some information which may clear his mind.  The reason the questions were asked is that there seems to be grave doubt in the minds of the Wages Board as to what their powers actually are.  As a result of the Minister's replies, I think that doubt no longer remains.  We are all pretty clear about what the Board can do and cannot do, despite the fact that the Minister's final reply did indicate that the Agricultural Wages Board Act can be interpreted by anybody the way he likes.  Despite that, I think we will be able to talk in the same terms as the Wages Boards in future.</P>
      <P>There is one point on which the Minister could help me.  At one time the legal adviser of the Board, to whom the Minister referred yesterday, was the Attorney General.  I wonder would the Minister say why that has been changed.  Why is the Attorney-General no longer the legal adviser to the Agricultural Wages Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I say he is not.  It is said that lawyers thrive because no two of them take the same interpretation of any Act of Parliament and it would, perhaps, have been better for everybody concerned if the Attorney-General, irrespective of whether we think he is good, bad, or indifferent, had continued to advise as to what the Agricultural Wages Board could or could not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's comment a moment ago, that the Board set up in 1936 was entirely new in this country, is not correct, because that Board was just a copy of something that happened in a previous Act of the British Parliament <Col N="1235" /> here.  The provision was originally brought in in 1908.  It was repeated in 1909 and again in 1917. We all know the reason why.  It is an extraordinary comment that the Agricultural Wages Board under the 1936 Act is substantially the same as it was under the 1917 Act.  We have been told by both the Minister and Deputy Dillon that it is the only way we know to fix agricultural wages and conditions; there is no other way in which that can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was originally brought in in 1908.  Does the Minister not consider it rather remarkable that the system of fixing the wages of industrial and other workers has been changed drastically over the years?  Yet the wages of agricultural workers must be fixed in the same way as they were fixed in 1908.  Perhaps the Minister might like to know why the original Bill was brought in.  It gives an insight into the whole situation.  I have here an extract from a Parliamentary speech made on 21st February, 1908.  The Bill was called the Sweated Industries Bill:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a Bill could be brought in to increase the wages of agricultural labourers, a great deal might be said for it as agricultural labourers are the worst paid men in the country and it is difficult to organise them because they are spread in small numbers over the country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was 1908.  Could it not be equally so 1962?  The position is exactly the same now as it was in 1908 and I am afraid that the present Government do not seem to be very anxious to do anything to remedy it. We could discuss this for a month of Sundays, there are so many aspects to it, so many aspects unfavourable to the agricultural worker, so many aspects which should be brought to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a very short Bill.  The Minister did not say that there were any holes in it.  He did not say it would not work.  That was not the reason he gave for opposing it.  This Bill could very easily be put into operation.  But <Col N="1236" /> it is being opposed by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  It is very significant that the two big Parties here oppose this Bill, and for the very same reason.  They oppose it because they both had a hand in the setting up and the keeping in operation of the Agricultural Wages Boards.  In my opinion, they are opposing it because neither of them represent the interests of the agricultural workers.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Labour Party have introduced this Bill for the purpose of trying to do something for the farm workers.  We do not want to wait for the Germans, or the French, or the British, or anyone else, to force us to do it.  We are trying to do something now for the farm workers, something which should be done.  We believe the Minister might agree to adopt the Bill.  If he wants to alter it in any way, he is free to do so. Whether the Bill passes or fails, the Agricultural Wages Board must be changed.  I should like the Minister to remember that.  The present constitution, the present powers, the present method of fixing wages have got to be changed.  I suggest this Bill will be a vote for a against the farm workers. We will see, when the voting is over, who are the friends of the farm workers and who are the people who pay lipservice to them but do not want them to have improved wages or conditions, lest such improvement should take something out of the pockets of the rich.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Amendment of Army Pensions Acts&mdash; Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of Dáil Éireann the Government should introduce legislation (1) to amend the Army Pensions Acts of 1924 and 1934 to 1949, and see that justice is done to legitimate claimants for Military Service Certificates, and (2) to amend the Army Pensions Acts of 1923 to date so as to (a) extend the Disability Pensions Acts to those who suffered from disease attributable to service, (b) include the widows and Dependent children of persons in receipt of disability pensions due to gunshot wounds or disease contracted on service, or attributable to service, and (c) amend the regulation governing the means test for special allowance.</P>
      <P>This motion has been a very long time on the Order Paper but I am very glad that even at this late hour we have got the opportunity of moving it.  I know it is a motion that has support on all sides of the House. Therefore, I move it with confidence and in the belief and hope that the Minister for Defence and the Government will accept it.  It is not as complete, perhaps, as I myself would like to have it.  It is divided into three parts and each part deals with a very specific set of facts and cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to say that this motion has the full support of my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party.  It does represent the policy of the Fine Gael Party relating to this whole question.  It is true that this part of the policy was put before the electorate at the last election.  It is also true to say that a very large number of people who did demand and are demanding amendment voted against it.  I think that was due more to loyalties to Parties <Col N="1241" /> than to the body of their colleagues who needed and who should get this help.</P>
    <P>I find it extremely difficult to use words which will be reasonable and which will convince my colleagues in the House on both sides that they should approve of the motion and urge the Minister and the Government to accept it.  I feel that there are two obligations on me.  In the first place, I will have to show the justice of the claim for the amendment of the Acts and, secondly, perhaps, to defend myself as to why I did not amend the Act when I was Minister for Defence. Perhaps the best thing I could do would be to get the latter point out of the way first.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Defence in the last Government, I found that a board was operating.  As an old member of the IRA, I was not satisfied with the decisions it was giving.  I was not satisfied with the decisions given in cases where a certificate was issued on the grounds that they were inadequate, insufficient and did not give full credit to the applicant for the service rendered.  In the cases where they were rejected, rejections were taking place which, in my opinion, should not take place.</P>
    <P>On examination, I found that was due to two causes.  In the first place, there was no definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  It was incumbent on the applicant to satisfy the board that he had what was known as active service, although there was no definition of the phrase.  Under the 1924 Act one had to be a member of the Defence Forces in order to qualify.  I should like to point out, in passing, that at a later date Fianna Fáil charged that as unfair and unjust and proceeded to rectify it.  But again they did not rectify the flaw in the Act in that there was no definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  The result was that you had what were known as easily decided cases, where it was clear that an applicant was a member of a column and was on wholetime service from point A to B, or that he was out in 1916 and so on.  If he was out for any day in the week of 1916, he could <Col N="1242" /> get a day's service.  In some cases that represented a year's or two years' service.  If he was out the whole weeks, it ordinarily qualified him for the pension.</P>
    <P>In cases I cited here previously the applicants did not know what they had to establish.  In 90 per cent. of the cases, they went before the board believing that their service was well known to the members of the board and that it would be recognised immediately. Unfortunately, that was not so.</P>
    <P>The other definition was &ldquo;service of an essential and dangerous nature.&rdquo; It was impossible for an applicant to know what constituted that.  Therefore, you had applicants calling witnesses to prove something, although they did not know what the requirement was. You had the board deciding in a most haphazard way what was essential and dangerous service.  The net result was that people with much less service than others succeeded in getting certificates. That begot this hostility between comrades.  The charge was made that so-and-so got a pension because he had so-and-so as a pal.  Unfortunately, the idea became widespread, and still obtains, that there is influence in all these matters.  Be that as it may, it has bedevilled the whole question with the result that nobody has been satisfied under any of the Acts because there is no definition of service.</P>
    <P>I feel the justice of the claim is such that it should be hardly necessary to make it.  I should like to remind a great number of people who think differently that the Volunteers with the Citizen Army and other units became the standing Army of this country with the administration of the Oath in the Dáil in August, 1919. The then Minister for Defence declared on the 20th of August, 1919, that the Volunteers were the standing Army of this country and, as such, must be subject to the Government. When the Minister for Defence confirmed those officers in their ranks, with such additions as were necessary subsequently, they became part of the standing Army of the nation.  I assert that once they became part of the standing Army, just the same as the standing Army of to-day, they should <Col N="1243" /> not have to say what they were doing, whether they were doing guard duty at Portobello or McKee barracks or whether they were in the cook house. Whatever their duty was, they were part of the Army and had all the rights and privileges attached thereto. When the Oath was administered, I know from personal knowledge that some Volunteers who were on parade on that Sunday refused to take the Oath and went home.</P>
    <P>On page 206 of the Official Report for 6th August, 1920, the then Minister for Defence, the late Cathal Brugha, God rest him, reported that the reorganisation of the Army on the basis of the vote of the previous session was now complete.  From that on, not all of them, but a great number of them were in the field.  At various stages, from then until the Truce and subsequent to it, at every meeting of the Dáil the Minister for Defence made a report on defence.  There is no question that the Volunteers and the members of Cumann na mBan and Fianna Éireann were subject to the Minister for Defence.  In so far as they were, I claim they are entitled to recognition as such.</P>
    <P>When I was leaving the Department of Defence, I had all the provisions made for the establishment of the new boards.  That was in pursuance of an undertaking I gave to Deputy Gilbride to amend the Military Service Pensions Act and to define service.  The Government of the day&mdash;let this be clear&mdash; decided it would be unreal and unreasonable to set up two groups of deciding officers, because the then referee and the board had reported that they would conclude the investigation by a certain date.  The Government decided therefore that no amendment of the Act would take place before the final report of that referee and board was made.  I felt that time was passing and I got authority from the Government to proceed with the drafting of the Bill that I would introduce when the reference had concluded his investigations and made his report on the working of the Act.  I am sure the Minister has these documents because I set up within the Department a committee to carry out this plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> It may be no harm to cite the size of the difficulty that had to be contended with.  The number who applied under the 1924 to 1934 Acts was 82,000.  Of these, 1,500 were successful and 63,300 were rejected.  As I say, rejections in most cases were due to the fact that the applicants did not know what they were to establish.  As time passed on, the 1949 Act enabled rejected applicants to appeal and also gave an opportunity for new applications. The latest date for appeals was 18th September, 1953, and the latest date for fresh applications was extended to 18th March, 1955.  Adjudication by the board of assessors under the 1924 Act and by the referee under the 1934 Act on petitions and applications were then proceeding.  The total number of persons concerned in these, under all the Acts, was 16,150 appeals and 4,630 new applications.</P>
    <P>The new applications were due to many causes.  There were applications by people who were associated with the Executive Forces in the Four Courts and who were associated with members of the present Government. When the present Government came into the House, these people did not follow suit and a number of them, associated with the Executive Forces, did not appeal.  There was no doubt that a certain number of these people had active service, both pre-Truce and post-Truce.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at these figures.  The previous Fianna Fáil Government, in 1949, had decided that all these cases were over and done with and that everybody who was entitled to get a certificate of service had got it.  However, under the 1949 Act, there were 16,150 petitions, without counting the new applications.  Some time in 1956, 1,610 of these petitions had been successful.  Of the 4,630 new applications, 290 succeeded.  The number of petitions undecided was 1,530 and 470 of the new applications were undecided.</P>
    <P>That was roughly the position when I was leaving Office as Minister for Defence.  The new Government came in.  They knew that their predecessor had promised to amend the Act.  There <Col N="1245" /> is what is known as continuity.  Even though there is a change of Government, it does not necessarily follow that the new Minister should repudiate the undertakings given by his predecessor but that, unfortunately, is what happened.  The board was reconstructed on the death of the judge and was eventually wound up.  There the matter remains ever since.  Because there was no definition of active service, there was no possible method by which applicants could establish their claim.  I set out my intentions regarding that matter to the Government and action was postponed until the referee and the board had considered it.</P>
    <P>Time is running short and the number of these people is getting smaller every day.  Even at this late stage, recognition should be given to them.  I feel it is essential that &ldquo;service&rdquo; be defined and defined in the manner I have set out.  It would take too long for me to go into it in detail now but there is a fair indication in the form of a directive to the adjudicating officers.  For the purpose of getting speedy decisions, I proposed that a certain number of boards be set up in each area.  But there would be this directive as to how to ascertain service, if service had to be to a qualification, and the type of service, whether it was cooking for the column or whatever else it might be, that that in itself, because of the decision of the Minister for Defence, of August, 1920 that they were then on active service and were a whole-time Army, as it were, in the field.  It is true that on every occasion when these Bills were introduced and Acts passed there was one overriding factor, that is, that the Minister for Finance had not sufficient money. Nobody has denied that claim but the argument was that we had done as much as could be done within our financial resources.</P>
    <P>I think a great many people would be satisfied if they had the certificate of service without the money but the greatest insult or injury is for a person, who has had service, to bring up his witnesses to establish it and then to be told he had none.  To the man or woman of independent mind&mdash;we had many of them at that time&mdash;who <Col N="1246" /> rendered service and helped to establish this State, that is the greatest insult.  I do not say that we did all the establishing but we were a substantial part of the forces that helped to build it up.  I do not say that the Army did everything; various Departments played an important part, sometimes a more important part than, the Army, but on the whole, the Army did the lion's share of the work.  To be told after that, in a very skimpy note, that they did not qualify caused resentment and now that many of those concerned have gone to their reward, it will not be easy to make good the damage done.</P>
    <P>Even at this late date, the records are there; the sworn testimony is on the file of practically every applicant and there is no reason why these could not be resurveyed and the certificates issued.  On the question of the military service pensions only, I commend my plan to the Minister.  I do not care what the expenditure is.  In equity and justice, I think he should see to it that these cases are re-examined and certificates issued. Where he finds, under the definition I left behind me, that the fact of service is established, the certificate should be given to the person concerned, whether he fought with the Executive Forces or in the forces of the State, once he had pre-Truce service. That was the all-important matter.  Where an applicant remained neutral in the Civil War period, he would get his qualification for pre-Truce service in keeping with that awarded to his comrades who had service on both sides.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I have made a good case on the question of the service certificate but I feel so strongly about it that I have only one more comment to make, that is, that I regret my inability to make the case as well as I should like to make it.</P>
    <P>The second leg of the motion deals with the extension of the Disability Pensions Acts to those who suffer from disease attributable to service. I know this is one of the most difficult problems any Minister has to contend with, but, again, there is a record in nearly every applicant's case, <Col N="1247" /> where he had a disability pension based on a decision as to the cause of his disability, whether exposure, hardship or hunger strike.  I am dealing with disability due to disease and a good number of possible causes are set out.  I have no doubt that the records clearly show that and there is no use in anybody saying to me&mdash;and nobody should be allowed to say to the Minister or the Government&mdash;that the people who had disability pensions for disability of this type were capable of earning their livelihood between leaving the Defence Forces or the Volunteers and the date of their death.</P>
    <P>In a great number of cases, because of the hardship they went through and because, possibly, of the disappointment of not attaining their ideals, or perhaps because they thought they were not getting the recognition they deserved from the Government or their comrades whom they had helped to achieve their present position, the applicants mental condition became unsettled.  In many cases, these men&mdash; and in a few cases, women&mdash;did not make any provision for themselves. They were unable to do it because they were unsettled.  Never in the history of any other country was there a revolution carried out, as it happened here, after which when stable Governments were established in a short space of years, the revolutionary bodies handed over completely to the elected Government of the country and accepted their dictates on every matter. Even where the few exceptions occurred, the people who were breaking away thought they were still carrying out the wishes of the elected Government.  They suffered mental and other hardships through not being able to make provision for themselves or their families.</P>
    <P>I appeal to every Minister in the Government and to every Deputy, where widows and dependents of these people now exist&mdash;the Department has detailed records of every one of them&mdash; even at this late stage, to give them recognition and compensation for their hardship.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress, I was in the happier vein of going through certain areas of the constituency I represent, and with conscious pride asserting what they had been able to do for themselves to develop tourism in their areas, and using it as a basic premise for an argument that might bring the Minister and his policy direction down to reality and away from the high-flown notions of international chicanery in plush hotels.  But I had made reference earlier to Irish Shipping, and I feel that it would be unfair not to sketch out for the Minister a programme that might be infinitely more fruitful and beneficial to the nation for Irish Shipping.  I do not know who is responsible, but I charge the Minister, in his nomenclature of Minister for Transport and Power, as being the person responsible for the internationally misconceived idea of 10,000 ton or 15,000 ton boats for Irish Shipping.  I would again ask him to come down out of that vapourising airy-fairy economic statistical imagination of his and consider what are the real needs in relation to Irish Shipping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the rules of order very well.  He practises in a profession which has taught him to keep those rules of order.  I am going to say that unless the doctrine of &ldquo;there are none so blind as those that will not see; there are none so deaf as those that cannot hear&rdquo; applies to the Minister, he must be <Col N="1250" /> aware that there is considerable trouble at times in the passenger traffic between Liverpool and Dublin and between Holyhead and Dun Laoghaire and that the Minister could, if it was not interfering with some of his friends, insist at times that these people provide an extra boat or in the alternative allow Irish Shipping if necessary to charter a passenger boat to bolster up the trade at its peak periods.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that the Minister has control over, and I would commend to him for consideration in relation to Irish Shipping&mdash;that we build a coaster fleet and that we might extend that fleet to take the tremendous strain off the roads.  The Minister should direct the activities of Irish Shipping into the coastal service of tankers to distribute some of the petroleum products that go down the country in those monster lorries, and, indeed, take to the canals.  There was consideration given in the Department of Industry and Commerce, before it was divided into this queer partition of Industry and Commerce and Transport and Power, to the possible use of the canals for the distribution by barges of considerable amounts of oil products that are going through the country.</P>
      <P>Rather than let those places go derelict, surely the Minister should consider the feasibility of converting the canals into some useful type of waterway, and the possibility of distributing those various oil and petroleum products in bigger quantity by tanker barges on the canals.  Irish Shipping could fruitfully engage in the distribution among our provincial ports of those products.  It would certainly enter into a very fruitful market if it got the 2,000 ton to 4,000 ton type of ship that would be effective in our coastal trade and our export trade to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that we are facing the possibility of entry into the Common Market.  The Minister will have to wake up to the fact that one of the big impacts in competition is the transport costs we have in getting our goods delivered to market.  Every saving that can be made in that line is going to play a very effective part in the building up of our competitive strength in <Col N="1251" /> such a Common Market.  There is nobody in the world who has a titter of wit or uses an ounce of common sense but realises that, in the future, Irish Shipping will have to be contained within the practical type of work we expect the company to do.  I commend to the Minister an immediate reappraisal of the policy in relation to the size of the ships to build, because I am told&mdash;and I am sure the Minister if he is aware of it will let us know in his reply&mdash;that the situation of Irish Shipping this year is bordering on catastrophic, and that the portents of a bad year this year have been only too sadly fulfilled.</P>
    <P>As I said before, Irish Shipping did a very useful job at a vital stage of our existence, but in the light of what one might call the Common Market era, we must examine where its future lies.</P>
    <P>I can see on a cursory examination of another company under the Minister's control, Bord na Móna, that there is a fluctuation from year to year between profit and loss, but one will not in any way condemn that company because it has tremendous value in the experimentation and in the research it has carried out and the employment it has given in the area. It cannot be equated with the fantastic figures of loss shown by some of the other companies and, anyway, the ultimate aim of bog development as a consequence of its work is well worth considering as a potential earner in the nation's economy.</P>
    <P>Before I get away from my present trend I want to revert to what I can best describe as the most neglected and unfortunate section of the community that I know&mdash;the group of some 2,000 CIE pensioners who are on destitution pension level.  The Minister is aware of the figure.  There are some 1,500 odd on the 12/- level and another 400 odd under 22/-, making in all an excess of 2,000 people who have to live, subject to what they can get in social welfare benefits, on that pittance.  Mind you, I want to strike this note very deliberately.  They represent the people who made CIE pay and who accepted low wages and long hours.  Now they <Col N="1252" /> are abandoned on the scrap heap. Surely to heavens, when we talk in airy-fairy language of these big State companies and their operation surpluses, we could readily think how money could be diverted into the channel of ameliorating these people's lot.  They are not even accorded the facility by CIE of travelling in their vehicles free to collect these pittances. Often it is costing them the princely sum of one shilling of their 12 to get in and out to collect their miserable pittance.</P>
    <P>This has been a very protracted debate because the time has come to pull down the five or seven veils from some of the grandiose schemes of a Government who seem to think it is a seat of empire rather than the controlling entity in a small hard-pressed country that needs very many substantial technical improvements to develop both its industry and its agriculture, and which needs above all a proper appraisal of the extent to which these large State companies will operate within the framework of this nation's future.</P>
    <P>I get appalled when I find the Government&mdash;as they have done&mdash;enshrouding with successive mysticisms the whole of Irish endeavour and of Irish political effort in the past 15 months, enshrouding them in the Common Market veil.  This is the Valhalla in which we bury all our mistakes and forget all our broken promises and the forlorn record of dismal failure.  On this particular Estimate I feel pretty strongly because I think the Minister, if he bestirred himself, need not be so inept and ineffectual as he sounds in this House at times with his lack of function. I do not believe the Minister is so blind or so foolish as not to be aware of the particulars of some of the policies designed and carried out by State companies under his control.  I do not believe he could not, if he wanted to, arrest this drift and get policy back on a factual beam.</P>
    <P>I think we are all unanimous on one thing.  We would like to see these enterprises survive.  We would like to see them justifying the faith and the investment placed in them.  I do not <Col N="1253" /> think any of us, however, are prepared to subscribe to the continuation of unwarranted subsidies to encourage increasing loss.  We face a very vital problem in improving the efficiency of our transport system, whether it be road, rail or sea, so that we will be able to deliver for Irish exporters, to whatever market they must go, their goods in the best possible condition in the quickest possible time.  It is to that type of trade that our rail and our road freight systems should be geared.  It is to that purpose that our shipping should be geared also.  The Minister knows as well as I do, and as well as anybody in this House, that it would be more than adequate for us to have a good type of coaster vessel not in excess of 5,000 tons to do our continental trade.  If we can fill them often enough Irish Shipping would be doing very well and the Irish economy would be doing better.  Turbines of ships this size plying the seas with cargo would give a sweeter tone than those of large leviathanlike ships lying up silent in some yard waiting for either charter or cargo.</P>
    <P>It is time this type of investigation took place.  It is time for hard hitting. I must confess that the Minister has got a fair share of that and, no doubt when the opportunity comes for him to reply, he will try to spar back. There is no getting away from the basic fact that, for some queer reason, bureaucracy has gone mad in these State companies and we have more braid and gold in and around the offices of some of these companies than you would find in five armies. Huge administrative machines are being built up, in many cases recklessly and wantonly.  It is time somebody got down to analysing how many of these people are wanted, how many are only in sinecures, how real and how necessary is each of these <i>entrepreneurs</i>, whether he is called service manager, area manager, freight manager or anything else, how many of these innumerable braided executives are really necessary, how much could really be saved in these companies by some man doing a full time job of work, instead of creating an aura of mystery about his job and getting three or four assistants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> I am positively nauseated by the capacity for job-making in some of these companies.  I am not even prepared to admit that there is any honesty of purpose behind much of it but I am prepared to say that the ordinary Irishman&mdash;the man about whom the Minister would not know too much&mdash;is getting sick and tired of carrying the burden of subsidisation. The time has come, as I said before, growing pains having ended, when some effort should be made to direct policy and confine activity to a sphere in which they are competent.  We have got to get this notion of internationalism out of our heads.  We have Boeing jets flying the Atlantic; we have immense cargo ships not only plying the Atlantic but&mdash;some of them&mdash;on charter in the Pacific; we have them plying up the St. Lawrence River but we have none of them plying between here and England with our cattle.  We have not got the kind of basic fleet which would carry the exports we have.  No, we will seek the glories elsewhere and sacrifice our people in the effort rather than get down to practicalities and give the country an assurance that there will be reason and rationalism in future policy.</P>
    <P>No matter how the Minister tries to wriggle out of it, he has the title of Minister for Transport and Power and if it is a nebulous ministry, or if it is a ministry without portfolio, the Minister should tell us.  The Minister, for his own good and for the good of his Party, and because of his duty to this House, should take off his coat and do something and stop hiding behind this mythical wall of &ldquo;no function&rdquo;. If he does not, he can rest assured that his tenure of office as Minister for Transport and Power will be interlaced with questions, Adjournment Debates and a constantly raised whip by the Opposition to make him do the job he is meant to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to refer to the closing of the Sligo-Leitrim railway and the effect it has had on the people and the economy of the county.  Perhaps it may be a warning and a help in regard to what will happen in the future.  The Sligo-Leitrim <Col N="1255" /> railway was abandoned a couple of years ago.  As far as I know, it was subsidised for about six months and then the families who had been making a living from that railway were paid off, given a gratuity, and they had to rehabilitate themselves and go anywhere they liked and do whatever they liked.</P>
      <P>That was one aspect of it but the main aspect of the folly of abandoning that railway at the time was that nobody made allowance for the condition of the roads then.  The roads in County Sligo, I can state categorically, were barely able to carry the transport at the time the railway was abandoned and then an extra volume of traffic was thrown on to those roads. The result of that can now be seen and it will be seen for the next year or two.  I admit we are getting quite a good grant to help us to build up the roads in place of the railway but the cart had been put before the horse in this case.  Now we have bridges being repaired, roads being closed and traffic being diverted and the surface of the roads used for the diversions being ploughed up by heavy traffic. We have traffic jams, cars and lorries going into ditches, and so on.  I think the Minister will agree with me that it would have been wiser to subsidise the Sligo-Leitrim railway and to ensure that the roads were capable of carrying the extra volume and weight of traffic before it was abandoned.</P>
      <P>I never like to criticise any ministry but I think this was bad policy and it might help in other cases where railways are being abandoned to ensure that roads are in a proper condition first and that a proper estimate is made of the volume of traffic being carried by the railway and which is being thrown on to the roads.  As I say, it was a mistake to abandon the Sligo-Leitrim railway when it was abandoned.  If the roads had been built up first, and even if the line had to be subsidised, it would have been better in the long run for the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must also refer to a statement made by a Deputy on the Government <Col N="1256" /> benches who comes from my constituency. I regret he is not in the House, he was here when I tried to get in before.  In volume 198 of the Official Report No. 3, for November 29th last, he stated that he knew a man who was waiting for six months to get into a job in CIE.  After six months waiting&mdash;presumably he had nothing to do in the meantime&mdash;he got in and presumably the same Deputy was responsible for getting him in.  He said he stuck the job for three weeks and then told Deputy Gallagher that he left it because if he stayed any longer he would become demoralised, because during that period of three weeks he did nothing except drink tea and play cards in sheds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make here is that in so far as my constituency is concerned, that is Sligo and North Leitrim, I know the personnel in Sligo, in Ballisodare, Coolaney, Ballymote, Collooney, Tubbercurry and Manorhamilton and I have never found anything like that, I am very glad to say.  While I do not want to be taken as agreeing with the policy as dictated by the Minister to CIE, I would certainly wish to repudiate emphatically the statement made by Deputy Gallagher.  So far as my constituency is concerned, I have found nothing but courtesy, efficiency and absolutely everything that could be required.  I have never found anything like that wrong with CIE in my county. I want to make that very very clear. If, by inference, Deputy Gallagher meant to bring the Sligo-Leitrim constituency into it, I want categorically to repudiate it and say that no such thing ever happened to my knowledge in that constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the same Deputy who made another rather erratic statement in respect of transport when he said that you would hardly see a bicycle outside a chapel gate in the West, that the people are so well off they all have their motor cars.  It is a pity he does <Col N="1257" /> not live in the area and he might know the position.  It is very difficult for me, or any other Deputy from my constituency, to come in here and try to put up a case for our constituency when we find such foolish and irresponsible statements being made.  I shall finish on that subject by saying that a little learning is a dangerous thing.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to hotels.  I quite agree with many of the statements made concerning the amount of money being spent on grandiose hotels.  It appears to me that that money is being expended for tourists here.  That is desirable and I have no quibble with it.  In my constituency, we have probably one of the most scenic areas in Ireland and we have seaside places all along the western coast from Mullaghmore to Rosses Point, Strandhill, Enniscrone and Easky.  In those seaside places, we have none of these £50,000 hotels, but we have small family hotels, boarding houses, and also public houses, which do quite a lot of catering and quite a lot of good for tourists.  Some system of grants should be devised for those family hotels, boarding houses, and even the public houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about the family hotels, the boarding houses and the public houses, which cater for tourists, and I can assure the Minister that they are run by the majority of the people in whom I am interested.  There is no big town on the coast except Sligo town, which has first-class hotels which we all know about.  They are all right.  I am trying to deal with the little seaside places which entice tourists to visit them from all over the country and from Scotland.  Scots visitors come very often to my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also speaking about the effort we should make to facilitate that type of visitor and not the wealthy visitor, the working-type visitors from the <Col N="1258" /> Lancashire mills, who come to our resorts with a certain amount of money to spend, and who like comfortable accommodation at reasonable cost. They are the people I am talking about.  If some kind of grant could be devised by Bord Fáilte, or any other body, to help those people to do up their premises, it would certainly help tourism, or else, as I heard someone say before, if interest-free loans were given to them, it would be a tremendous benefit.  Candidly, I think that too much provision is being made for the £50,000 hotel and the smaller hotel, the family hotel, the boarding house and the public house on the seacoast is being neglected.</P>
    <P>I should like to go back again to CIE briefly and to mention merchandise haulage.  In my county, there has been a difficulty which was very noticeable in recent years in relation to merchandise haulage.  Quite a number of young people who went to the expense of purchasing trucks, building up a business of their own and going into the cattle business, suddenly found that they had become subject to the law relating to haulage. They were put off the road.  They were summoned because they carried a neighbour's animal.  Some people were put to the expense of going into court to prove that it was their own cattle they carried and that if it was a neighbour's animal that was carried, they did not receive any reward for carrying. Something should be done about that.  I know quite a number of young farmers who built up a business and were put completely out of it and had to emigrate.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to rural electrification.  There is one thing which I have come across which I think really is an injustice.  When rural electrification was carried out in a particular section, from among six or seven people, two decided to take it&mdash; I have in mind a particular case&mdash;and they got it at an excess service charge. Their neighbours are now getting it at no extra service charge.  It is a small point but I should like the Minister to cover it.</P>

It is not equitable at all.  Living in out of the way places, these people have had a rather tough existence over the years and because they were just pushed into the out of the way places during the time of Cromwell, we still regard them as outsiders.  That is the way they feel about it.  I should like the Minister to give some consideration to them.</P>
      <P>The last point I should like to make is in relation to airports.  We have heard quite a lot about them, the amount of money spent on them and the losses and so forth which have been sustained.  I would like the Minister to consider the importance of having an air strip at Sligo.  We have the facilities there.  The Sligo Chamber of Commerce is a very responsible body and there is development of industry in Sligo town, due to the efforts of that active body.  I can foresee the day when rapid transport will mean a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> I was the first to mention this matter in the House.  It has been mentioned since.  Every facility and every help should be given towards the establishment of an airstrip in the vicinity of Sligo town.  There is no need for me to elaborate upon the geographical position and the necessity for such an air strip.</P>

      <P>If we examine the make-up of CIE, there is only one conclusion we can come to: When they got the monopoly of the transport of this country, it was the greatest disaster that ever happened.  When I say that I would not want anybody to misinterpret me.  The employees of CIE at that time took full advantage of the monopoly.  When I refer to employees, I do not mean the lorry driver, his helper the local station-master or anybody in that category. I mean the official of CIE who drove around this country in a high powered car.  He adopted the attitude at that time that they had the monopoly and that it was our job as business people or whatever category we happened to be in to give them our transport.</P>
      <P>I want to point out to the Minister where that completely failed.  During that period, I approached CIE on numerous occasions and asked for quotations for the transport of certain reasonably large quantities of goods. I remember the officials handing me a blue book and reading out the charges from one station to another. They told me: &ldquo;Those are our charges.  If you do not accept them, we are not prepared to transport your goods at any other price and we are not prepared to bargain with you.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inside the past few years, their tune has changed slightly.  They are now prepared to bargain with every businessman and to carry goods at a cheaper rate than that at which he can transport them himself, but before that position came about, all the people with reasonably heavy goods to transport were compelled, because of the monopoly of CIE, to go into the lorry business.  Speaking as a businessman with some slight experience, I now find I have a number of lorries on my hands.  If at that time, CIE had been <Col N="1261" /> prepared to bargain with them, there would have been few businessmen who would have owned lorries.  They have enough to do today without being involved in the lorry business.  However, CIE compelled us to go into that business and now they are doing their damnedest to put us out again. Even at this late stage, I am delighted to see CIE prepared to quote reasonable prices for people willing to use their transport.</P>
    <P>There are now only three stations, Carrick-on-Shannon, Drumsna and Dromod, left in my county.  About 22 miles of railway has been lifted in the northern part of the county and about 45 miles in the southern part.  I honestly think it was bad form on the part of the Minister to allow CIE to lift those lines, especially in the southern part.  That railway served a tremendous purpose.  During the war, when there was no other means of transporting coal from Arigna to the Pigeon House and to industries throughout the country, that narrow-gauge line answered the call.  In the foreseeable future&mdash;I hope it never happens&mdash;we may find ourselves without the supplies of diesel oil available to us at present.  Since then, this coal has to be transported from Arigna to the Drogheda cement factory and various other places.  We are asking our over-burdened roads to carry this coal.  That job was reasonably well done by the railway.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by a number of Deputies to the closing of branch lines.  I live in a town where a branch line was closed.  It had a drastic effect there, as well as on Mohill and the village of Dromod.  A number of people were employed in these towns. Some of them were transferred to Dublin or elsewhere, but those of them not long enough employed by CIE to have a claim for alternative employment had to emigrate.  That badly affected the business communities in these towns.</P>
    <P>There is also talk of closing the Kilfree-Ballaghaderreen line.  The people of Ballaghaderreen are hoping to secure a factory for the town in a short time, and we all hope they will <Col N="1262" /> be fortunate enough.  Before the Minister lets the axe fall, I would ask him to defer the closing of this line until we see what the effect will be on this industry.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the possibility of providing grants for rural public houses in order to bring the amenities in them up to the required standard.  We all know the reason why they are not up to standard. We might get an official to calculate the profit a rural publican would have on a half of whiskey or a bottle of stout.  Before he makes that calculation, he must remember that the consumption of intoxicating liquor in the rural areas is very small.  There is no point in saying that a rural publican has a profit of from 20 to 30 per cent on a bottle of stout, if he is unable to sell his stout or there are not sufficient people in his area to buy it.  I am not encouraging people to go in and buy drink just for the sake of bettering the financial position of the publican.  Because of the low income publicans have at present the Minister should consider asking Bord Fáilte to make some grant available to them or a loan free of interest for the purpose of providing adequate toilet accommodation in rural public houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>A lady living in Carrick-on-Shannon applied some time ago to the Department of Local Government for a grant to build new rooms on to her premises. Her normal business was to keep fishermen who came from England for five or six months of the year, and, in order to keep a few more, she decided to add three or four rooms on to her public-house and small business premises. She made the application and an inspector called and said: &ldquo;We do not give grants for such jobs.&rdquo;  I think that is a desperate pity.  That lady and her husband are trying to rear a family and they now find themselves in the position that they do not qualify for a grant.  It is their only means of livelihood and the Minister should try to get Bord Fáilte to consider this application with a view to giving them a grant.  It would be better for Bord Fáilte to spend money on this type of development rather than to spend £50,000, £60,000 or £100,000 on big hotels.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister was asked in the House if a further generating station could be built in the Arigna district, for the burning of Arigna coal in the generation of electricity.  The Minister has stated in the House that he doubts if there is sufficient coal in the mines to justify the erection of another generating station.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of people who have been in the coal business in that area for many years back, there are ample supplies of coal there.  I would ask the Minister to consider the erection of another generating station there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the conditions that exist in my constituency as a result of the Minister's action in closing down the railway lines there.  One of these lines ran from Collooney to Enniskillen and the other from Drumshambo to Belturbet.  The first was about 25 miles and the injury done to that stretch of country as a result of its closing is plain to be seen by anybody travelling that road.  Take the towns of Dromahair, Manorhamilton and even Collooney itself.  These towns have lost from £200 to £500 weekly and today they are like ghost towns. Up to the time the employees of the railroads found themselves out of work, things were not too bad but now many of these people have emigrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to the Drumshambo-Belturbet railway which was about 40 miles long.  The towns on that line, such as Drumshambo and Ballinamore, are almost bereft of employment now.  We were told that a subsidy could be paid to these undertakings no longer as they were too costly but it is now taking far more money to maintain the roads in the area.  You meet trucks on these roads today carrying up to 30 tons.  In a constituency such as Sligo-Leitrim, where we have so much bog country, it is almost impossible to keep the <Col N="1266" /> roads built up against the desperate traffic.  That is the result of bad management, to my mind, and anybody who goes to any of the towns I have mentioned will agree that is the feeling of the people.</P>
    <P>As those lines closed, many young people thought the opportunity would arise to put a lorry on the road and make a living carrying some of the extra freight and livestock formerly carried by rail.  In order to ensure that could not happen, an Act was passed as a result of which they dare not come out on the road to earn any money.  Some of them found themselves prosecuted and heavily fined and, from the North Leitrim area, some even found themselves in jail in Dublin.  It is sad, in a country like this where men fought and many died to gain us freedom to do what we like, to think that a young man with enough courage to pay out £3,000 for a lorry and trailer outfit will find himself held up by the Garda, put off the road and left to take the consequences. That is what is happening. People were sadly disappointed about that.  Those boys are gone and the result is that the rural areas are being stripped of their population and it is one of the saddest things to be seen when we go into these areas, as we must do as public representatives to find so many homes closed and scarcely a young boy or girl left in the area.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to deal with those groups of people in my constituency who still require electricity and not to ask them to pay this extra charge to have light in their homes.  The small farmer in those areas could not possibly accept the ESB supply if he had to pay this extra charge.  Whatever it may cost I appeal to the Minister to see that those people, who are to be congratulated on still living in such remote places, will have at least the light laid on.  I appeal on that ground very sincerely, because I am approached very often by groups in Sligo and Leitrim who are off the line.  I hope the Minister will note that because we have quite a number of those groups now and also a number of individual <Col N="1267" /> cases where the line might require to be brought to one person.</P>
    <P>A number of drivers, three or four, or perhaps five, who were in permanent employment with CIE have been transferred to other centres while other drivers have been brought in there. Where a young married man lives in a town or district with his wife and family and has a home there, it is very unreasonable for CIE, who are not paying him such a great wage, to ask him to move down to Cavan or some other county, pay for lodgings, continue working as a driver and get home only occasionally.  That position should be carefully examined and, where possible, married men should not be sent away from home. I have been speaking to some of these people and they are seriously considering whether they should give up their jobs and go to England, because of the great hardship involved in maintaining themselves in one town while their families live in another.</P>

      <P>During the first part of the debate on the Estimate, I felt a little disheartened because it was quite obvious that the majority of those who spoke in Opposition, had not bothered to read anything I had said either on the Transport Bill or in connection with this Estimate and were simply making points without taking the trouble to read the facts.  But as the debate continued I felt heartened at the general trend of what I heard.</P>
      <P>My first statement tonight is that, at least, we have a policy on this side of the House.  I have listened for hours and hours to the most wonderful set of contradictory policies put forward by Deputies of Fine Gael and of other Parties, none of which have any consistency and most of which, if adopted, would mean complete nonsense.  They indicate that there is no real policy on the Opposition benches in regard to transport and power.</P>
      <P>We have had suggestions that CIE should no longer have a monopoly&mdash; the effect of that would be to drive the company further into deficit&mdash;and at the same time, when the Transport Bill was voted on, the voting was 63 to 12 against the proposition that CIE be not required to pay for itself.  We had Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches, who could move any amendment to that Bill if they so wished, and having clearly indicated they did not wish CIE to pay, they failed to vote in the division on the Transport Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had suggestions by Deputies that a number of the State companies are faking their accounts. We had other Deputies quoting from the accounts and asking questions on them in a manner which indicated quite clearly that they regard the accounts as validly presented and audited.  We had Deputies praising a number of the State companies and we had others condemning them all round for policies of aggrandisement, of appointing people with gold braid and excessive numbers of executives and so forth.  We had Deputies speaking in regard to Irish Shipping and asking that they should run coastal services when it is perfectly clear that coastal services are declining all over the world and the only result of selling <Col N="1269" /> the large ships of Irish Shipping would be that its overall deficit would become even greater and that it would be utterly impossible for us to secure supplies in time of war.</P>
    <P>We have had suggestions by some Deputies that the ESB is the only paying State company we have, these Deputies having failed to realise that it has a monopolist position, in which no other State company finds itself. We have had suggestions that the charges imposed on the public by the ESB are too great, and in contradistinction, we have had suggestions that the ESB should spend more and more money to provide current to people in remote areas for quite unremunerative receipts.</P>
    <P>The debate as a whole emphasises the fact that it is a good thing that we on this side are conducting transport and power policy, because, as I have said, the inconsistencies of the Opposition have been fantastic.  I do not know how to deal with the Opposition, half of whom say that CIE should no longer be a monopoly and the other half that they should be supported by the State <i>ad lib.</i> It is impossible for me to answer such questions because there is nothing but gross inconsistency shown.</P>

      <P>It is only reasonable that I should say a few words first about the accounts and the financial position of the State companies.  I will deal with them as briefly as I can. First of all, their accounts and balance sheets are properly presented and audited and I am satisfied that they are correct in the way they are presented to the House and to the public.  Secondly, I wish to make it clear that CIE are the only State company in respect of which a subsidy is paid to cover normal operating expenses and receipts.  There are various kinds of subsidies, as the House well knows.  There are the capital subsidies we give for industries, and for rural electrification; there are interest-free grants we give for various types of productive development; but there is a tremendous <Col N="1270" /> difference between that kind of capital grant subsidy and the subsidy where you say to a company at the end of the year: &ldquo;We will make up the difference between your receipts and expenditure.&rdquo; CIE have a limited subsidy of that kind confined to £1,175,000 and it is the only one of the companies under my control which are not promotion companies, such as Bord Fáilte and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, receiving that kind of subsidy which fills a deficit in regard to ordinary receipts and expenditure.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping is not subsidised, nor is it going to be, nor is it insolvent or anything like it.  During the present severe freight rate depression, Irish Shipping continues to meet its losses out of profits made in the past.</P>

      <P>I was speaking about Irish Shipping and saying that it met losses out of profits made in the past. On the most recent balance sheet, the present value of the company's assets is shown as £11.3 million compared with £9.3 million capital subscribed by the State.  We need a good shipping service for emergency purposes, if ever we should be forced to carry goods under exceptional or wartime conditions. Irish Shipping carries as great a volume of goods from this country to other distant countries as can be carried at profitable rates and imports in the same way.  About 20 per cent. of its business is between this country and other countries and it is not neglecting the interests of this country. Irish Shipping is earning foreign currency for us, giving good employment, and setting a splendid example of punctuality and good service throughout the world wherever it goes.</P>
      <P>I am not going to close down Irish Shipping or to force them to sell all the most profit-making of their vessels in order to establish a coastal shipping service when I know that all over the world coastal shipping is gradually declining.  I do not intend to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna is not in receipt of any subsidy.  The Bord is paying interest on the capital advanced to it and repaying capital in instalments in accordance with the provisions of the Turf Development Acts.  There have recently been some losses due to bad weather, but, for example, if you take the past three years, there was a clear profit of £1,900,000 after charging all expenses, including depreciation, and its shareholders, who consist of the people of this country who have advanced the money and include a private company, have received £1,700,000 in interest and in sinking fund repayment.  That left a surplus of £200,000 to be set off in reduction <Col N="1272" /> of the very big deficit that was caused in the very disastrous year 1958 that put the company at a disadvantage. I am certain that Board na Móna is conducting itself in a thoroughly efficient manner, that there is no gold braid as suggested by one Deputy in relation to its operations, or extravagance of any description.</P>
    <P>The air companies are in receipt of no operating subsidy, nor are they making operating losses.  I made it quite clear in my speech that they had not been able to remunerate State capital but they had met all charges proper to revenue and have preserved the value of their assets representing the share capital amounting to about £12,000,000.  The company has no accumulated revenue losses.  The performance of these airlines compares very well with those of other countries, many of which have been making consistent operating losses, and many of which have not been able to repay their capital or to pay a dividend on it.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the whole question of the functions of the air companies quite recently with the Chairman, and I hope that the time will arrive for them to make some remuneration on their capital.  The airline has been deliberately asked by the Government, and by successive Governments, to develop very rapidly without waiting for profits to accumulate from the running of profitable routes.  They have been asked to develop new services to various places in Great Britain, leaving aside altogether the transatlantic service, and to do it at a rate which has made it very difficult for them to remunerate capital, but, as I have said, I hope that the position will improve in the future.</P>
    <P>All the air charges, the rates arranged by the international air transport organisation, are based on a number of factors over which neither I nor the Irish airline have control.  In many countries air companies operate under hidden subsidies.  The Government choose to pay for air traffic control or for meteorological services, so charges at airports and air fare structures can be attuned to the fact that <Col N="1273" /> the Government are paying for services for which in other countries it is considered that the air companies should pay at least a contribution.  Many other factors make it very difficult for a considerable number of air companies to remunerate their capital.</P>
    <P>The ESB enjoy practically complete internal monopoly in respect of a great number of their powers.  The ESB pays interest and principal on loan capital. The ESB is not in the vulnerable position as some of the other State companies.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt to some extent with the charges levied against me of being inconsistent and trying to hide the true facts regarding State companies.  As I said, it is very important, in discussing the whole question in the House, for people to realise the psychological difference and the financial difference between the kind of subsidy which enables the company to say year after year: &ldquo;It does not matter what happens to us, the Government will pay&rdquo;; and a delay in remuneration of capital or a temporary subsidy granted just for a period as in the case of CIE.  There is a very great difference between the two types of aid.</P>
    <P>I omitted to say that, in the case of Irish Shipping, the law passed in this House provides that there should be no dividend on capital.  That was agreed to.  If dividends did accumulate, all the money must be invested in new shipping.  Irish Shipping will have 153,000 tons out of the 200,000 tons and there will be no necessity to replace any vessels in the immediate future.  Naturally, regard will have to be had to current operating conditions in making any further decision for the growth of the company, but I must say that it is unreasonable for us to make the presumption that freight rates are never going to rise again.  We can presume that there will be some day some order in the world regarding freight rate structures and that freight rate structures will rise to the point where Irish Shipping, if it is efficiently run, will be able to earn full depreciation.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to be able to tell the House that so efficiently run is <Col N="1274" /> Irish Shipping that last year, when freight rates were far below the economic level, a number of the newer vessels of Irish Shipping were able to pay depreciation and could be able to pay hypothetically three per cent. interest on their capital.  The fleet consists of a number of vessels of different kinds, some of which under prevailing conditions do better than others, but taking the whole picture, we can say that it is a company of which we can be proud and which I hope will have a great future.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to operate any policy in this country on wholly pessimistic presumptions.  The whole of the work of the present Government&mdash; and to that extent nobody in the Opposition has questioned it&mdash;is based on generally optimistic forecasts of the future.  We would stop all development if we presumed disaster.  We would stop all industrial development and everything else.  We in the Government are going ahead on the presumption that the world will remain sane, that there will be no disastrous war, that the financiers of the world and the Governments of the world will be able to prevent a disastrous slump and, where there are cases of unduly low prices for services or goods, that in some way or another, through the gradual intelligent appreciation of these things by modern economists, there will be changes for the better. That is all I can say regarding the future of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>I have already said in connection with CIE that, as far as this debate is concerned, I can recommend to my colleagues in the Government that the present policy can remain because in the debate on the Transport Bill it is quite clear from the vote cast that very few Deputies are prepared to suggest that CIE should not be asked to cover its expenses by the end of the period allotted to it in the 1958 Act. That makes a great deal of the observations on the closing of stations and on the efforts made by CIE to reduce their deficit quite inconsistent.  This is the general expression of opinion clearly recorded in the House when the Transport Bill was voted on.</P>
    <P>As I indicated before, the Beddy <Col N="1275" /> Committee Report gave the background to the 1958 Act and clearly indicated the position of rail transport in this country.  It clearly indicated that redundancy is inevitable and the redundancy provisions in the 1958 Act could have been passed by the Oireachtas, as a whole, only in the knowledge that they would be used.  It is quite obvious that if only three or four people were going to be found redundant in CIE as a result of the operation of the Act, there would have been no need for special redundancy provisions.  The special redundancy provisions made it perfectly clear that there was to be drastic reorganisation of services.  No one could have voted in favour of these provisions without realising their implications.</P>
    <P>I was asked by a number of Deputies what I thought the prospects were of CIE paying for itself by the end of the period allotted in the 1958 Act.  It is very difficult for me to say. Much depends on the growth of the productivity of the system.  A good deal depends on having a system of wage negotiations which have been, in general, approved by both employers and workers which will ensure that productivity can grow in all our services and in all our companies both public and private.  I am not unhopeful that CIE will be able to improve its position as a result of changes which are now taking place.</P>
    <P>If Deputies look at the accounts of CIE, they will see that a change of from five to seven per cent. in receipts and expenditure on one side or the other of the balance sheet, would bring about balance and that is not an impossible figure at which to aim.  All I can say is that the Chairman and Board of CIE are not unhopeful that they will be able to achieve a balancing position round or about the time the 1958 Act expires.  Meanwhile my duty will be to examine the whole position of transport in order to bring fresh legislation before the Dáil when the 1958 Act expires.</P>
    <P>The next question with which I want to deal is the suggestion that CIE was falsifying the figures for receipts and expenditure in relation to lines the <Col N="1276" /> closing of which was announced previously.  I want also to deal with the question put by Deputy Corry and some others: why did not CIE give a full picture of all the revenue received at various stations if public bodies were to be convinced that CIE generally was losing money on these lines? I wish, first of all, to say what I have said before on the Transport Bill, that the Board of CIE is a board of responsible people, that a very high level of integrity has been evident for many years in the conduct of State company boards.</P>
    <P>There have been some Deputies tonight who have been making lurid remarks about these boards but, on the whole, the more responsible Deputies have recognised the splendid record we have had in that regard.  It is inconceivable that the Board of CIE, whose activities can be examined by any Government, either our own or any other, and which can be subjected to any commission of inquiry that any Government institutes, would deliberately falsify receipts and expenditure for the sake of closing a line, particularly when it is the object of CIE to keep as much of the railway service open as they can, and when they are genuinely desirous of giving an accurate picture of the financial position.</P>
    <P>The reason why it is useless to ask stationmasters, in stations along routes which are to be closed, for figures for traffic, is that the procedure followed by CIE, and by the industrial consultants in relation to each of these branch lines, was of an entirely different kind.  They worked out the expenditure along a particular sector of line and they could only identify with certainty about 70 per cent of the expenditure.  The rest they said they could not identify and, therefore, they did not place it to the debit of the line.  That surely is fair enough. They were able to identify about 94 cent. of the revenue attributable to the particular sector of the line.</P>
    <P>As members of the House are interested in this matter, I shall give them some information which really is entirely a matter of day-to-day administration, on the part of CIE.  I want to make it clear that, in giving the information, <Col N="1277" /> I am not implying that the members of the Board are not absolutely responsible in what they are doing. I am doing it simply in order to show how foolish it is to suggest that what stationmasters can give in the way of information is relative to the question of revenue and expenditure attributable to a particular sector.</P>
    <P>The passenger traffic was calculated by taking a mileage for passenger trains on each branch line and by multiplying that by the fare per passenger mile.  It is quite obvious that stationmasters could not give that information. It has to be done in head office. The ordinary parcel revenue was computed by carrying out a study over a certain period; the number of parcels were recorded and then the total revenue attributable was allocated to each line.  The freight revenue was allocated to each sector, in proportion to the length of each sector.  As I said, they left out all the main overheads that would be attributable to particular branches.  They did not attempt to allocate the whole of the expenditure at the terminal stations and headquarters, because they could not fully estimate the amount, and so they did not allocate any of these expenditures to the particular line in question.</P>
    <P>Therefore the statement of losses which has been published was an absolutely minimum statement and it was not totted up, or added up, in such a way that it would deceive the public.  May I make it absolutely clear that if I should find any of the State companies, CIE, ESB, or Bord na Móna, permitting their local managers, at the level of a stationmaster, to give information on receipts and expenditure in regard to their particular sector of business, I should regard that as grossly irresponsible.  It would simply result in the chaotic working of these companies and it would mean every stationmaster and every superintendent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It would be entirely wrong for members of the public to be able to go to bog managers on a bog operated by Bord na Móna and everybody knows that is true.  Everybody knows it does not apply in any of the rail systems in any well administered community.</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of CIE, I am very glad to be able to quote a new study of inland transport in Ireland which has been published under the auspices of the Economic Research Institute.  It is paper No. 10 which was published in November, 1962, by Mr. D. J. Reynolds.  I will not read the names of the Directors of the Institute because they are the names of people who are so eminent in the life of this country that the document can be regarded as having some relevance and validity.</P>
      <P>I am interested to see that, from studies made in 1960 and 1961, there has been no change in the general position of inland transport in Ireland in its main facets from that which had been analysed by the Beddy Committee and in which they used figures for years varying from 1954 to 1957.  I do not think I am going to have time to quote in full from this document and I shall just read the summary.  It may be taken for granted that the writer of this study wrote independently of the Beddy Committee report and formed his own independent conclusions. The Irish transport system was associated with these factors:</P>
      <P>The Irish road system and the low density of vehicles upon it; which make it one of the least densely populated, developed road systems in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he refers to the rapid increase in road vehicles over the past 10 years which has been at a rate of 7 per cent. to 8 per cent. per annum.  He then refers to the comparatively small number of road vehicles per head of the population as compared with other Western European countries, vehicles per head of the population being highest in the counties to the east and south and least in the western half of the country.  Here the rates of increase in vehicle ownership, particularly cars, have been highest.  That shows that in the areas <Col N="1280" /> of the country where vehicle density is lowest at present, there is the greatest increase.  He says&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is he?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>He refers to:</P>
      <P>The difficulties of the railways and their response to these difficulties in the concentration of the railway system, the modernisation of its equipment, and its better utilisation, with specialisation on longer-distance transport and the haulage of bulkier freights.</P>
      <P>That is another factor.  He then says that it is estimated that in 1960 road supplied 93 per cent. of the State's requirements for inland passenger transport and rail 7 per cent., while road supplied 80 per cent. of the State's requirements for inland freight transport and rail the remaining 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>All those are facts which I have frequently given to the House.  They indicate the difficult position in which CIE find themselves and they indicate the comparative amplitude of private transport.  Dealing with the whole basis of CIE policy, of providing an economic transport service, we should bear in mind that the private sector of transport is enormous, and that the idea of permanently subsidising a public transport service in relation to the amplitude of private transport is one which should not be entertained, unless we are absolutely driven to it.</P>
      <P>The CIE subsidy is very different, for example, from the subsidy on butter.  We must export our surplus butter and the present arrangements in Great Britain make it difficult for us to sell it save with a subsidy.  That is an entirely different position from the position of CIE who have to provide an efficient and economic transport service within the vast mass of private transport.  Suggestions have been made that we should remove CIE's monopoly.</P>

      <P>Page 10.  He says:</P>
      <P>Private transport as opposed to public, i.e., transport operated for reward, seems to account for some 37 per cent, of total ton-mileage. Although the railways are of much greater relative importance in freight than in passenger transport, it is clear that in quantitative terms the railways are of minor importance in inland transport.  Depending on the relative weights given to a passenger mile and a ton-mile, they could be said to account for some 10 to 20 per cent. of the nation's inland transport only. </P>
      <P>That suggests that the idea that CIE possess a very great monopoly seems to be very far wide of the facts. It seems to me to be only reasonable to allow them to preserve whatever monopoly they have at least until we can review the position in the light of what we believe transport conditions will be in the ensuing years.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies raised the matter of my replies to Questions relating to CIE.  I find that out of 120 Questions put down to me in the past 12 months, 40 were ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle and 80 were answered.  That does not suggest that I am not prepared to answer Questions in regard to CIE, but I shall deal later with the matter of answering Questions and giving sectionalised information about State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main heat of the debate was in relation to CIE and I am afraid the reason is one which applies in virtually every other country, that is, an almost obsessional belief by some Deputies, and some members of the <Col N="1282" /> public, in the value of a railway service, regardless of how many passengers or how much goods it carries.  I have said before that this is an almost universal feeling which exists practically everywhere, and although in modern Europe, in the Northern democracies with a very high national income per head, huge mileages of railways have been closed down, one can find no reports in the history of all those countries that the closing down of the railways had an adverse effect on the economy or had been in any way a disaster.  It is true, nevertheless, that in those countries when the railways were being closed down there were violent protests, but once a substitute service was provided the protests were largely forgotten and became simply a part of history.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is one fundamental difference between me and the Government and a number of Deputies in this House in relation to the 1958 Act. I do not feel there is anything sacrosanct about railways in the modern world.  I do not have any feeling of wanting to preserve a branch line railway in an area when it is, in fact, nothing but a bus or a lorry forced to travel along railway lines and stop at infrequent intervals.  We are simply going to have this difference in the House, which, as I say, exists in other countries.  It may be a very human feeling, but there is nothing I can do about it.  It is a feeling that exists. The Government have made it absolutely clear that they completely agree with the policy that the public transport service should be whatever is the most efficient and the least costly.</P>

      <P>In relation to the substitute services not all individual sectors are making money.  Some are losing.  The idea that CIE find it easy to supply a completely profitable substitute service is not correct.  The whole basis of a public transport is that there is bound to be cross-subsidisation.  I think something like 35 per cent. of the bus services in the city of Dublin do not pay their way.  That is an illustration of cross-subsidisation within Dublin city.  That is a picture in relation to transport which, again, is universal.</P>

Whatever else I may be proved wrong about in future by those who come after me, I believe that general statement will hold good.</P>

      <Col N="1284" /> I think that the attacks on CIE have been very unfair in many ways. Another State company might have been in the same unenviable position in which the present Chairman of CIE found himself.  We may have a position 15, 20, 30 or 40 years from now when somebody discovers how to use radiant power from the atmosphere for electric power in individual domestic houses and there will have to be a drastic and radical reorganisation of the ESB&mdash;a complete organisation of the system with widespread redundancy, transfers of employment, changes in the whole system, areas losing prestige because of an alteration in the whole method of producing electricity.  I am not saying that will come about but such a thing is not inconceivable.  Nobody has invented a cheap form of radiant energy but simply because CIE are involved in something which is part of the modern changes and development taking place everywhere, the Chairman comes in for a vast amount of undesirable abuse.</P>

      <P>Somebody made some comparison in relation to the fact that the taxpayer has to find some hundreds of thousands of pounds a year because the air companies are not remunerating their capital.  They ask why, if the air companies are not remunerating their capital, does the Minister want CIE to pay their way? The answer to that is very simple. There is no alternative at the moment to the aeroplane.  It is still in the initial stage of development and is so regarded by the Governments of many countries.  It is a new instrument.  If one compares the money raised by the taxpayer to pay for capital that is not remunerated by the air companies with CIE, the result is rather a dismal one.  CIE have lost about £27,000,000 since the war and they lose £3,000,000 a year.  There is really not any comparison because the whole of the CIE structure was built when the only competitor was the horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank Deputy Dillon for his comments on the work of Dr. <Col N="1285" /> Andrews and for his very statesmanlike observations in that regard which have had the effect of cancelling out some deplorable comments by other Deputies.</P>

Dr. Andrews had a very great record in creating Bord na Móna where the industrial relations have always been first-class and where the whole staff work as a united team. They must all know that the character of the man has not changed.  He is trying to apply the same principles so that CIE will be a successful organisation with good industrial relations.</P>

      <P>I have already dealt with the Ballaghaderreen branch line in answer to a question.  The suggestion was made that CIE show no interest in the requirements of their customers. As there has been a very considerable increase in the volume of road freight traffic, coach traffic and some increase in the volume of rail freight traffic, that is an answer in relation to whether they are interested in what kind of service they provide for the public.  Members of the Dáil will have noted that, having done some fundamental work of reorganisation, they are now beginning the work of market research.  They are getting into personal touch by way of questionnaire with their passengers by rail or by road to see how they can improve the various services.  I understand that this motivation research will be conducted on the same lines in regard to the <Col N="1287" /> various sectors of traffic where CIE have buses or railways.</P>
      <P>I heard some complaints about the inadequacy of the various bus services of CIE.  Nobody mentioned the fact that, as a result of a public opinion poll conducted in the Limerick area last year, there was an alteration in the number of timetables and many of the bus connections in Limerick were altered to meet the convenience of the travelling public.  It was found that a number of the trial services introduced proved eventually to be satisfactory. That is an indication that CIE are adopting the most modern techniques in trying to improve the public services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one statement made in regard to redundancy by Deputy Dillon in which he pictured a redundant CIE labourer of 50 years of age being retired on a small pension. An employee of 50 years of age, with 30 years' service, would receive a compensation pension of two-thirds of his retiring wages.  Railway men who are transferred and who suffer a worsening of their contractual conditions of employment are entitled to a lump sum compensation.  This compensation is borne by the Exchequer along with the redundancy payment. There are opportunities for appearing to an arbitrator if they are dissatisfied with the CIE decisions in regard to any particular place.  I am glad to say I have not heard any complaints in regard to that arbitrator, who is a very highly esteemed individual.</P>

If they are transferred to a lower grade in the railway service, they can appeal.

      <P>Another suggestion was made that the railway fares were much too high.  I do not think I need read out all the cheap return tickets, week-end tickets and day-return tickets available from CIE.  I want to make it quite clear that there are reasonable offers of reduced travel costs made available to a wide section of the public who make use of this service.  It is equally true to say that it so happens that, strangely enough, a high proportion of the people who travel on CIE are casual travellers and not regular travellers.  That has to be taken into account in the construction of the rates of fare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better deal next with the question of bus fares.  The increase in the wages and salaries and the improvement in the working conditions of those employed in the Dublin city bus services cost some £413,000 on the eighth round of wages. The increased fares were estimated to yield only £363,000.  When I saw this motion I wondered whether we were not in an election year because of the extravagance of its terms.  These are the facts.  Since 1950 bus fares in the city have increased by 63 per cent. Wage rates in Dublin have risen by 80 per cent.  Employment in industry has risen from a total of 131,000 in 1950 to 156,000 in March, 1962.  In the <Col N="1289" /> same period the non-contributory old age pension has increased by 85 per cent. from 17/6d. to 32/6d.  Many people now qualify for the contributory pension at the rate of 40/- for a single man and 70/- for a married couple.  These rates have been increased to 45/- and 80/- from 1st January next.  Unemployment and sickness benefit for a married man with three children will be increased from 50/- to 77/6d., giving an overall increase of 93 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, the cost of living has gone up by 55 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only illustrating the fact that the increases in CIE bus fares in relation to the increases in social services in the period from 1950 to 1962 are not such as to be a very great source of disadvantage or hardship. The figures are there.  I admit fully that no one thinks of it in that light, that the standard of living is always rising in people's minds much more rapidly than their increases in wages and that when people pay more for bus fares they naturally feel deeply about it because they have so many family commitments and they have to support themselves on what are still very modest social services.  Naturally, as the standard of living rises there must be a feeling of hardship when bus fares go up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister speaking of the cost of living or the standard of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard of living goes up in people's minds.  They naturally resent increases in bus fares. <Col N="1290" /> I have made it clear that I cannot find any kind of figure which would suggest that an increase of 50 per cent. in the Dublin bus fares since 1950 is something which will have a disastrous or unfortunate effect on the economy and life of the people of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister lived in Crumlin or in Finglas, he would feel it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I am limited in time I cannot further deal with this matter.  I think myself the way to get over the increase in bus fares is not by making special rates for various classes of the population.  There would inevitably be pressure if you included one class and excluded another.  It would only make more difficulties for CIE and would probably result in the fares going up in respect of those who did not belong to these particular classes and there would be further complaints again.  It would result in the taxpayer having to pay more.  The best way of dealing with this question of the rise in bus fares is to do all we can to improve the economy in general; and, on every occasion we can do it, we should raise the social service assistance and benefits available to the people of Dublin so that, as the years go by, it would be more and more easy for them to pay these charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is cod.  You are cutting it down as a percentage of tax revenue rather than increasing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no mention in this debate of the fact that there are very reasonable bus fares for children in Dublin.  Children under three years ride free; those under 15 pay half the adult fare; school-going children under 16 between the hours of 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. pay one penny up to the 7d. stage and 2d. from the 8d. to 1/- stage. There are also school buses provided. These are concessions that can be made without pressure for extension because children are easily identifiable.  There is no fear of other groups swelling the bill for CIE.  This is a concession of an intelligent kind which can be easily administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have been complaining about the character of the Dublin bus service. Again, I shall not go into it in detail, <Col N="1291" /> but CIE keep a large staff of people whose duty it is to investigate complaints. I have been given many illustrations of improvements in service made as a result of legitimate complaints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could you persuade them not to have three No. 10 buses coming one after the other and then none for 15 minutes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of bus traffic are gravely affected by the bunching of traffic in the centre of the city.  CIE does turn some buses around to avoid this but it is not always possible because the conditions wherein buses can turn around and re-route themselves do not apply in many sectors of the city centre.  Conditions of bus traffic are influenced by bunching, sudden changes of weather and insufficient exits from the city centre to the housing estates in the suburbs.  Quite a high proportion of bus travellers go from north to south and from south to north again and this contributes to a great extent to the problem of city bus services.</P>
      <P>In that connection, if Dublin Corporation have any plans for dealing with traffic congestion, it does seem to me that some time or other they should consider the question of the staggering of hours in offices.  One realises that that is a most difficult problem to be solved but it has had to be solved in New York where the tenant of a skyscraper has to arrange for staggered hours of work for the office staffs in the bus section of the building.  To me, it seems inevitable that in the next 30 years such a scheme has to be brought into force.  If Dublin Corporation hopes to rearrange traffic through the city, and solve some of the congestion difficulties, something will have to be done about the staggering of office hours by common agreement so that the CIE bus services can be more effectively operated and the charges will then be at the optimum level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that there is no place I know of in Northern Europe, and I speak of Northern Europe <Col N="1292" /> because most of these countries have a higher standard of income than ours, where there are not bus queues at certain hours.  In practically every country in Northern Europe, the number of persons seated to work and back from work are at least on a lower level than in this city.  I speak of this with certain knowledge in regard to that matter and in full confidence that I cannot be contradicted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you would stagger the buses so as to not have them coming in groups of three, it would be a great blessing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There was another amendment by Deputy Dunne who spoke of the high profits made by CIE in Dublin.  Deputies will have seen in the Beddy Report a breakdown of the profits made.  If they examine the accounts of CIE they would see that the profits on the bus services, in relation to the fact that 34 per cent. of the total revenue of CIE comes from the bus services throughout the whole country, are not excessive.  They will find that the degree of cross-subsidisation of the services in general by the city bus services is not an unreasonable one.</P>
      <P>There is another point and that is that about 50 per cent. of the total staff of CIE are employed in the city of Dublin, so that where any extra profit is made by the bus services in Dublin city, and it is not very large, it must be taken into account together with the fact that a large proportion of the staff of CIE, particularly the rail staff, are resident in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a bad thing for Dublin not to contribute to some extent to the rural services.  The urban services of the ESB contribute to a considerable extent to rural electrification. That makes for a better standard of living in the rural areas and Dublin gets the benefit of that. If Deputies take into account the total revenue of CIE, and subtract the figure of the total revenue attributable to the bus services, they will find that there is nothing grossly excessive in it.</P>

      <P>About 1,000 B class bedrooms were constructed as a result of grants given by Bord Fáilte but the <Col N="1294" /> difficulty is that only about 10 per cent. of the B and C class hoteliers applied for these grants.  We have taken some action in reducing the minimum amount required for a grant from £2,500 to £500 but it is essential that those who have B class hotels should consider extending their premises.</P>
      <P>We do need a sufficient amount of this type of accommodation, so that travel agents in Britain especially and in other countries can book blocks of beds for coach tours and rail tours through the country at prices ranging from 30/- to 35/- a day with full pension including service.  It just happens that this particular development is not taking place and Bord Fáilte have done nothing to discourage it.  As we know, we have got nearly to the end of the need for A class accommodation in many areas and we must now use every effort to persuade more people to go into B class accommodation and ask for grants for the extension of their premises.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte agrees with those members of the House who say that there lies a great future for the tourist business of this country.  They never held any other point of view and the percentage of grants refused by Bord Fáilte in relation to any category of hotel is sufficiently small to enable me to say that however difficult some hoteliers may think it is to jump the fence of getting a grant, it cannot be very difficult as the percentage of refusals is quite small.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say what is now the minimum expenditure required for Class B and Class C hotels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>£500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As against?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>£2,500.  Having said that, I have pointed out to Bord Fáilte that they must do their utmost to convince some of the people owning Class B and Class C hotels that there must be a minimum standard when they want to extend their premises.  I hope Bord Fáilte will be able to provide an advisory service that will be able to help the architects employed by the hotels so that <Col N="1295" /> we can gradually get standards improved and so that there will be more inducement for these classes of hoteliers to extend their premises and so that there will be equally a growth of new Class B and Class C hotels.</P>
      <P>In relation to block booking and the encouragement of travel agents in England to send large parties here who cannot afford Class A accommodation I have asked Ostlanna Iompair Eireann, a subsidiary of CIE, and Bord Fáilte to get together and see if they can select a large number of places suitable for these people without interfering with those who provide existing accommodation. In this way we shall see if we can get further progress along these lines. In another year's time I hope to be able to report that we have made some progress but there must be initiative on the part of the Class B and C hotel owners.  The Government cannot do it and Bord Fáilte cannot effect the change unless there is a demand for grants and unless the decisions are made by the people in charge of the hotel business that they want to extend their premises.</P>
      <P>For example, I could mention County Donegal.  That is one county where I know from Bord Fáilte that there is an acute shortage of Class B and C accommodation.  Finally, may I also remind the House that Class A accommodation in this country varies in price.  By no means does it consist only of hotels all of which charge top class prices.  One has only to get the Bord Fáilte list of rates for class accommodation to see that the pension rates vary.  The list covers quite a large group of hotels ranging from the extremely well-run country hostelry to the very big hotel catering for the luxury trade.  That is another mistake Deputies made in the debate in which the general trend towards Class A hotels was deplored by Deputies, having seen the number of hotels related to that class that have been built since 1958, as though Class A included only luxury hotels, when, of course, it does nothing of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Lynch has gone. <Col N="1296" /> I had meant to put him out of agony&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deputise for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by telling him that there was an operating surplus on the Waterford-Tramore road service of £2,500 during 1961/62.  I hope that will allay his fears.  He talked of the petty loss on the Waterford-Tramore rail service which was £3,000.  That works out at £428 per mile.  If it was applied to the rest of the system, to longer lines, it would correspond to a loss of £42,800 for each 100 miles.  The Deputy seems to have forgotten that the Waterford-Tramore line is seven miles long and he did not relate the £3,000 loss to the length of the line.</P>
      <P>Again, I have to cut down answers to a great number of questions about the ESB.  The only thing I can deal with in the short time at my disposal is the question of the people who have to pay very high service charges.  At this moment there are 77,000 people who can get power without any extra service charge.  There are 23,000 people who can get it by paying additional amounts of up to 50 per cent.  There are 12,000 people who can only get it by paying 100 per cent. or so.  Some of those people, as a result of recent legislation, have been asked to pay somewhat more but I am perfectly certain, from enquiries made of the ESB who have a wonderful service in regard to predicting the numbers of people in various years who want to take power&mdash;their record of predictions in this respect has been remarkably accurate&mdash;that a very large percentage of that group, whose extra service charge has been increased for technical and financial reasons that I have not time to go into but which were fully indicated in my replies to various Deputies who wrote to me on the matter, would not have taken power in any event even if there had not been a slight additional charge put on them as a result of the recent Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demand for electricity has grown very greatly and I am glad to tell the House that not only have the ESB informed me that they will have to <Col N="1297" /> introduce another 60 megawatt station in the course of the next ten years over and above what they have proposed up to now as a result of increased consumption of electricity but that they have had four or five times the demand in October, 1962 for connection to the electrical network compared with what they had in 1961. That shows that, although there are these cases that are very difficult to deal with, there has been a very great increase in the number of people seeking electricity as a result of the lowering of the service charges through the increased subsidy of 75 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take too long to give to the House the picture, as I see it, of my duties as Minister for Transport and Power and the work that I do with the aid of the officers of my Department in supervising the working of the companies.  I can only assure Deputies that the work continues consistently week after week.  We maintain the closest liaison with all the State companies.  Now, I want to deal with the question of day-to-day matters and the decision by the Ceann Comhairle to refuse some Questions that came before him.  First, I want to say&mdash; and I hope members of the House will believe it&mdash;that it would be my personal instinct to answer every question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to do that in the case of every question asked, and in fact, a Minister for Transport and Power, keen on his job, would really like to be chairman of each of the companies.  That was not the thought behind the setting-up of the State companies and the Questions that are not accepted by the Ceann <Col N="1298" /> Comhairle as appropriate to be answered by me relate to day-to-day matters of administration and to sectionalised information involving details of working and of local costs and receipts.  When I see a Question, I say to myself: &ldquo;Ought the Ceann Comhairle to allow this question to be answered or not?&rdquo; and my emotional instinct is to answer the whole lot, but I know that from the point of view of the future of State companies, not only in this but in every country in the world, it is essential that we do not allow local political pressure groups for the gaining of detailed information in regard to purely sectional activities of those companies to help to break up the unified work of the companies.  I could say a great deal more about that, but I want to assure the members of the House that it is only with that object that I understand why answers to Questions have to be refused.</P>
      <P>Within a few months, if all those Questions were allowed, human nature being what it is&mdash;and I am sure that if I were in Opposition, I would be in the same category&mdash;there would be more and more Questions, and gradually you would have conflicting pressure groups throughout the country asking State companies to increase services here, to reduce costs there. There would be a multitude of pressures all designed to produce a benefit for one particular area or in one section of the company's operation or one facet of its services at the expense of other areas.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been written on this subject.  It is true to say that conservatives, liberals and socialists in countries all over the world have generally recognised that there must be a limit to which the day-to-day administration of State companies can be interfered with by Question in Parliament, and it would be impossible to get first-class executives for such companies if every day they came into their office they found themselves looking over their shoulders to find out what Questions were being asked about particular services in Ballaghaderreen or Galway or anywhere else.  It would utterly prevent efficient work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, members of this House well <Col N="1299" /> know that there can be debates such as we have had in this House today. There can be special debates on the reports of the companies when a great many questions, that in the ordinary way would not be answered from day to day, can be answered on a general basis, and I have already in the short time at my disposal given a considerable amount of detailed information to relieve the minds of Deputies who have been anxious about some particular aspect of the company's work.  If allowed to, I could go on for the next hour and a half until I had answered every question.  I have notes before me for that purpose, but it is my regret that owing to the order of business, I shall not be able to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not time to answer questions about the air companies, but I would like to say in reference to Aerlínte that it is doing a tremendous job on the transatlantic service.  All the questions put to me in relation to Aerlínte seem to be irrelevant in relation to this fact, that it is spreading the message of Ireland all over the United States.  They have the highest load factor of any air company operating over the Atlantic. They have offices established there. They are bringing new traffic to this country and they are doing a very splendid job.  I would not like this occasion to pass without particular <Col N="1300" /> reference to the very great success attending the operations of those who are responsible for Aerlínte.</P>
      <P>I am very sorry that I cannot answer more questions, but I think I have answered the main points in the time at my disposal.  Deputy Dillon was out of the House when I dealt with the position of each State company but he will be able to read what I said in the Official Report.  I ask for support of this Estimate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that on a number of questions asked in this House.  I pointed out that the contributory old age pension made a very great difference to the CIE pensioners and I gave the total pension income from both sources.  I also pointed out that there was no way in which the pension fund of CIE could be altered by way of sale of shares for reinvestment, and that, in fact, at the moment there is a heavy deficit in the operation of the pension fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had time to do that but Deputies will find in my statement that the number of sailings on the cross-Channel services have very greatly increased in the last two years. I would still like to see further improvement, but there has been a very marked improvement in relation to the number of travellers and in the catering for passengers on trains.  I look forward to still greater improvements.</P>

      <P>I move motion No. 54 in the name of Deputy S. Dunne:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann considers that the Annual Report of CIE for the year ended 31st March, 1962, clearly demonstrates that Dublin City and County bus-users are being made to pay exorbitant bus fares to meet losses incurred in other sections of the CIE system; and calls on the Government to require the Chairman and Board of CIE to institute reduced bus-fares for workers travelling to and from work, for school-going children and for old age pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £331,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1963, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946 and No. 6 of 1956), including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was opening the recent debate on the token Supplementary Estimate for Forestry for the current year, I informed the House that it was expected that it would be necessary to seek an additional grant for land acquisition for the year and also that <Col N="1313" /> supplementary provision would be needed to meet additional labour charges in the year.  When dealing with Appropriations-in-Aid, I forecast that there was likely to be a shortfall in the level of receipts compared with the original Estimate allowance.</P>
    <P>The full extent of the additional requirement has now been determined and the Supplementary Estimate before the House is for a net addition of £331,000.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to increase the Grant-in-Aid provision for land acquisition &mdash;Subhead C.1&mdash;by £135,000.  This very substantial increase is necessary in order to enable my Department to meet commitments for the purchase moneys of areas in respect of which it is expected that sales will be closed before the end of the current financial year.  The uncommitted balance in the Grant-in-Aid Fund on 31st March, 1962, was £30,500 which, with the original grant of £135,000 sought for 1962/63, gave a total availability of £165,500 to meet commitments for the year.  Actual payments out of the Fund up to the end of October came to £93,450, leaving a balance of £72,050 on 31st October, 1962.  Having regard to the area and total purchase price of cases with the Chief State Solicitor on that date for closure of sales it was apparent that the balance available would not be sufficient to meet even the needs of the normal land acquisition programme for the remainder of the year.  Making reasonable allowance for contingencies, the additional amount required to meet the expected draw on the Fund for the rest of the year in respect of the normal type of acquisition case (including nursery land) is estimated at £45,000.  In addition to the normal type of acquisition case, provision must also be made for payment within the current year of the purchase moneys of nine unusually highly-priced and/or extensive areas which the Department has either agreed to buy or in respect of which agreement to purchase is likely to be reached in the near future.  The total area involved in these transactions is 12,120 acres and the total purchase money is approximately £90,000.  The <Col N="1314" /> most important case included in this group is the Charteris Estate, County Tipperary, containing 4,440 acres, the purchase price of which is £42,000. The sale in this case is expected to be concluded within the next few months. In most of the other large cases for which provision is being sought, agreement to purchase has actually been reached and title to the areas is in course of clearance.  If, as expected, all of these transactions are completed before the end of the current year and if the acquisition programme in the more normal type of case follows the anticipated pattern, it can be expected that the total acquisition figure for the year will reach an all-time record level.  While the distribution of acquisitions is still not as evenly-spread as we would wish, I feel sure that the House will welcome the progress that is being achieved and will agree to provide the necessary funds to enable my Department to maintain it.</P>
    <P>For Subhead C.2 (Forest Development and Management) the additional sum sought is £131,000. An excess of £142,000 is expected on labour under heads (1), (2), (4) and (5) of the Subhead consequent on the increase in the basic wage rates of forestry workers by 10/- a week with effect from 1st April, 1962, and an increase of 2d an hour in the standard rate of bonus which took effect from mid-August, 1962.  On the non-labour heads, a total excess of £18,000 is expected on the purchase of seeds, fencing wire, tools and miscellaneous items of equipment. The gross additional requirement for heads (1), (2), (4) and (5) of the Subhead C.2 is, therefore, estimated at £160,000, which falls to be reduced by savings of £29,000 expected on other parts of the subhead, giving a net requirement of £131,000.</P>
    <P>In Subhead G (Appropriations-in-Aid) allowance has to be made for an anticipated shortfall of £75,000 in receipts from timber sales during the current year.  Actual receipts from this source in 1961/62 came to £521,000, a record figure.  In the framing of this year's original Estimate, it was believed that it would be possible to increase the volume of sales in the year compared <Col N="1315" /> with the level obtaining last year and the allowance for receipts was placed at £625,000.  It is now clear that this target was over-ambitious. The level of sales in the current year has not been appreciably up on last year and, in particular, the receipts position has been adversely affected by the fact that the volume of heavier material suitable for conversion to structural timber becoming available for marketing has not increased to the extent that had been hoped.  On the most optimistic possible view, receipts for timber sales for the full year are unlikely to exceed £550,000, and the allowance is being reduced to that figure in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The gross additional amount required in Subheads C.1, C.2 and G is £341,000.  Savings of £10,000 are expected on other parts of the Vote so that the net amount being sought in the Supplementary Estimate is £331,000.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that Deputies will readily appreciate the need for the additional provision required in Subhead C.1 and C.2.  It is unfortunate that it should be found necessary to combine the increases in these Subheads with a shortfall in Appropriations-in-Aid but I am afraid we must accept the fact that we are still at the capital investment stage in forestry and that revenue is bound to be limited and not fully predictable.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when introducing the Main Estimate, I fore-shadowed this Supplementary Estimate and indicated the reason for it.  On that occasion, which was quite recent, I was unable to give the exact figure. I have given it now, and I ask that the House accept this Supplementary Estimate without discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will, I think, accept that this is a pretty sizeable Supplementary Estimate which has appeared, if not unexpectedly, certainly somewhat suddenly. I understand it is necessary that this Supplementary Estimate should be passed before the Christmas Recess in order to put the funds of the Forestry Branch in order.  Representing <Col N="1316" /> the principal Opposition Party, naturally we are not going to deny the Government the facilities for which they are looking.</P>
      <P>While it is true that the Minister in the Main Estimate, which we discussed only a few weeks ago, referred to the fact that it was possible we would have a Supplementary Estimate, it is also true that nobody was expecting such a sizeable one.  As I understand the Minister's speech, this Supplementary Estimate is necessary for three reasons.  First of all, it is necessary for the purchase of land.  The Minister has said the House would be glad to know that they are purchasing more land than heretofore and that they also gathered into the pool a sizeable estate in the Charteris Estate, situated in South Tipperary, and comprising over 4,000 acres.</P>
      <P>It seems to me there must have been some administrative slip-up somewhere or other, because I think the Forestry Branch knew they were going to take over the Charteris Estate.  Whether or not the negotiations were prolonged, I do not know. Perhaps the Minister will tell us when he is replying.  He also stated that the other lands for which the money is required have been the subject of negotiations for a considerable time. Reading into his speech in the limited time at my disposal, it appears to me that the only estate they really were unaware they would acquire and upon which there were no active negotiations throughout the financial year concerned was the Charteris Estate.  If that is the position, perhaps the Minister would indicate why this money is suddenly required at short notice and why such a heavy call on the funds has fallen in on the lands concerned.  Have these other lands been the subject of prolonged negotiations or are they also, shall we say, snap sales like the Charteris Estate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone is happy to see the Forestry Division acquiring land.  I have always been one who has been trying, as far as I can as a public representative, to hurry them up in acquiring land because there are inexhaustible delays and frustrations endured by anyone who wants to dispose of land to the Forestry Branch. <Col N="1317" /> Beyond these few queries, I shall leave the matter of the purchase of land.</P>
    <P>With regard to labour costs, I quite appreciate that the Estimate could not possibly meet the labour charges as it was not possible to foresee what the charges would be.  I have no other comment to make on that.</P>
    <P>With reference to the third item, the sales of timber, I take it that the Forestry Branch has a considerable amount of timber under its jurisdiction. I take it that there must be some sort of over-all survey from time to time, not only a regional survey but seasonal surveys as well.  Those, therefore, who administer the Division must have some idea of the amount of timber and the quality of the timber which will come up for sale.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening speech, explains that the receipts have fallen far short of what was anticipated.  That is quite reasonable, but he also says that the heavier type of timber is not available as expected.  That, to me, indicates there has not been a hard and fast survey of the timber available for sale by the Forestry Division and it may be that the price for timber and the demand for timber is not as good as it was before.</P>
    <P>That, of course, brings me back to the question of the marketing of timber.  I do not think we have any proper marketing system at all and if the largest landowners have had difficulty in disposing of timber at an economic price, surely the private individual who is trying to sell timber must meet with considerable difficulties? I am informed by those who are in the private timber business that it is a very frustrating trade, that it has been going through a lean period lately.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the State has found that to be the case.  The Minister might indicate if his Department have had difficulty in selling timber at economic prices.  He might indicate, too, what the marketing conditions are likely to be in the foreseeable future and further, whether he has made any arrangements for timber marketing because the demand for timber, taking Europe as a whole, is considerable. <Col N="1318" /> Europe is in short supply of timber, as I indicated in the figures I gave, and for that reason I should like to know if the question of marketing has been seriously considered, if there is any specialised section within the Division dealing with this problem or whether the Division has any plans for such a section.  We on this side of the House accept this Estimate with some reserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party's view is that money invested in forestry is well invested and we have no hesitation in giving full approval for the money the Minister asks for here.  In fairness to the Minister, he did give us a warning earlier that he would be coming to the House for a supplementary sum.  I think I am right in assuming that this does not mean any increase in employment because the bulk of the money is to meet the increase of ten shillings per week in wages and of twopence an hour in the standard rate of bonus.</P>
      <P>The money is being provided here to meet those additional expenses, if I interpreted the Minister properly.  I know it is rather late in the night and I do not expect the Minister to deal fully with the whole question of forestry, but I would impress upon him the necessity to try to have employment in forestry made an all-the-year-round effort.  There is too much casual work in forestry at the moment.  I know many people have continuous employment but it is frustrating for men to be laid off for two, three, or four months each year.  If the Minister could evolve a system whereby there would be more continuity of work in forestry, he would be making a valuable contribution to employment in rural districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We note that the bulk of the money for acquisition is in respect of one or two areas and I would remind the Minister that there is tremendous dissatisfaction over the price that is sometimes offered by the Division for land for forestry purposes.  I do not know whether there is any system of arbitration in this matter.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether or not there is a system of arbitration for determining the price of land or, if there is not, whether he has ever considered the <Col N="1319" /> appointment of an arbitrator so that people will feel at least that they are getting a reasonable price for land offered for forestry.  Of course such land cannot be of any great value but landowners cannot be blamed for expressing dissatisfaction when they see the measly amounts per acre offered. If there was a system of arbitration by which they could have their cases dealt with, there would be much more satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the concluding portion of his speech, gave what I thought to be the reasons for the decline in receipts from timber but I do not think he explained fully why such a fall has come about.  He says that the volume of heavier material suitable for conversion into structural timber has not increased to the extent that had been hoped.  I wonder if that is the main reason or if there is anything else the Minister can tell us about it.  For the reasons I outlined at the beginning, we in the Labour Party give our approval to this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies who have spoken for giving me this Estimate and in so far as I can, briefly, I shall elaborate somewhat on the figures I have given and the reasons for the sharp fall in income.  I should like to say to Deputy Esmonde that the Charteris Estate was not on the market when the original Estimate was prepared.  It was one of the big estates we had to get after and it is one of the things that will arise from time to time if we are to get on with the business of getting such land for forestry purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another estate, but I do not wish to identify it here tonight because the contract has not yet been completed, though we have, I believe, reached agreement.  I think that estate will be coming in in about a month. That also is a very substantial estate constisting of more than 5,000 acres and I believe the cost will be something in the region of £50,000.  As I said, because the contract has not been signed I feel I should not identity that estate, but I want to assure the House I am confident that my Department <Col N="1320" /> will have acquired this very large estate for forestry before the year is out.  That accounts for another £50,000 of the additional amount I am seeking here which, together with the figures I have given for increases in labour costs, adds up to the £331,000 that I have asked the House to give in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment raised by Deputy Corish, may I say the very fact that in this year we are going after an even higher figure of acquisition than last year, which was an all-time record, must lead to more employment in forestry?  I have already pointed out that my Department are anxious to provide whole-time employment for workers engaged in forestry. It is because of the build up throughout the country that it is so difficult to plan programmes so as to ensure that continuous employment will follow.</P>
    <P>I have stated on many occasions that in order to plant properly ahead and fully to utilise our labour force, at our present planting rate of 25,000 acres a year, we would need a reserve of up to 50,000 acres a year.  The build-up, because of our history in forestry, has been scattered in small areas throughout the country.  Nobody appreciates more than the Forestry Division the fact that, when workers are engaged in forestry work for nine or ten months or for a year or two years, it is quite natural that they acquire certain skills and that they are more efficient than raw workers coming in.  Our people, from an economic point of view, would be most anxious to keep these men fully engaged if the work and the plantable reserve were there for them in their own districts or within striking distance of their districts.</P>
    <P>Where there is other work in the vicinity of a forest, where men worked and had been left off, we try to employ them in the other districts.  Rural Deputies will know of certain labour difficulties encountered in these districts.  With the build-up of forestry at the present rate, we can look forward to a period of more stabilisation of our labour force engaged in forestry. The pattern will become more and <Col N="1321" /> more a pattern of the vast majority of the labour force being permanently employed on forestry.  With new sections coming in, perhaps for a short period a number of temporary forestry workers will be employed.</P>
    <P>The best answer I can give to the question about the price of land is that until now about 99 per cent. of the land acquired by the Forestry Division has been acquired on a voluntary basis.  That means that the vendor was satisfied with his deal and we were satisfied with the deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister would be satisfied but I do not think it would be true to say that the 99 per cent. were absolutely satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They were free agents. They sold their land to the Forestry Division.  I do not know that anybody who sells anything is satisfied.  In my county, a man, going home from a fair, met a neighbour on the road. The neighbour asked him if he had sold his cow and he said he had.  The neighbour asked him if he got what he expected and he replied that he did not but that he did not expect that he would.  It is the same position with a man selling land to the Forestry Division.  While he may not have got what he expected, a country man, generally speaking, does not want any advice as to when he should or should not sell.</P>
      <P>It is true that in the coming year there will be a number of compulsory acquisitions which raise a different question.  In that instance, there will be a procedure similar to the Land Commission procedure.  If the vendor is dissatisfied with the price offered by my Department, he can appeal in respect of it, call evidence and the court will decide on a proper price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any information as to, say, the amount of land that is not offered or sold to the Forestry Division, because there cannot be an agreement on price?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Very, very few.  In the vast majority of cases, price has not <Col N="1322" /> been a stumbling block.  That has been our experience.  Last year, we acquired voluntarily, by purchase, 31,793 acres.  I feel confident that this year we shall beat that record figure of acquisition by voluntary action.  I think that is the best indication we could give the House that the system as we have it and the prices we are paying are satisfactory for the type of land we are getting.  The House will appreciate that most of this is marginal land.  To call it land is a misnomer.  A lot of it is snipe grassland and unplantable land with big skelps of rock which come into the deal.  Averaging out an acre, taking a stretch of 800 or 1,000 acres, they never take into account that perhaps 300 or 400 acres of that land is land on which a goat could not live.  It might be on the top of a mountain.</P>

      <P>Perhaps some future Minister for Lands will find himself sitting on a bonanza; I hope that is so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke about the difficulty of marketing.  There has not been difficulty about marketing in the sense that the Deputy seemed to think. While it was estimated by my Department that they would be able to get out, between mature timber and other types of timber, an amount that would bring in some £625,000, it fell short by £75,000, mainly because they were not able to get out the mature timber.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy Esmonde thought, that an exact survey and estimate was not made throughout the different forests.  It started only in the past couple of years.  That job has been undertaken and it is now practically ready.  The position up to the moment has been that our people did not know precisely the exact volume in different stands.  The result was that while it was anticipated that this amount of mature timber could be got out of certain forests, it did not prove so when they tried to get out the necessary amount of timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The receipts have been up.  They were up last year and they have been up again this year.  Although they have not reached the amount anticipated, <Col N="1323" /> a record amount of timber was sold by the Forestry Division during this year.  It it expected that, when this survey to which I have referred is completed and the position is assessed, it will be possible for my people to estimate with greater accuracy what may be available for the market in any specific year.  As I told the House on the main Estimate, it will be possible for the Forestry Division to indicate to private enterprice the approximate output for the years ahead so that they, in their sphere of business, will be able to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Again I express my appreciation to the main Opposition Party and the Labour Party for the manner in which they have received this Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I put the following question to the Minister today:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the reasons why casual labourers employed on post office engineering work in Kilkenny city are paid at the rate payable by the county council to labourers rather than at the rate payable by the corporation of Kilkenny to similar labourers, particularly in view of the fact that county council road workers are rarely employed in the Kilkenny urban area and that Kilkenny Corporation is the relevant local authority in the Kilkenny city area.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In provincial areas, casual labourers employed by my Department are paid the rates prevailing for road workers employed by the county councils in the same areas on the grounds that the type of work on which both groups are employed <Col N="1324" /> is comparable.  The casual labourers employed by my Department in the Kilkenny urban area are paid the same rate as that paid by the Kilkenny County Council to its road workers in the same area. </P>
    <P>This matter concerns a group of men who are in very weak bargaining position and, although it is very late in the night, I felt it was my duty to bring the facts of the case to the notice of the Minister and to help these people who have very little means at their disposal to protect themselves or to fight for their rights.  When the Minister is aware of the facts, I am sure he will see that the right wage is given to these men, the corporation rates payable to workers on work similar to that being carried out by the Post Office labourers.  The corporation pays a rate of 4/1½d. an hour for a 45-hour week which comes to about £9 5s. per week and the rate which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs pays to its labourers amounts to £7 8s. for the same number of hours in the week.  The ESB pays a rate of 4/1½d. an hour to its workers for work practically identical to that being carried out by the Post Office casual labourers, as do civil engineering firms and all other employers who employ men on a similar type of work.</P>
    <P>This is very bad example for a State Department to set.  It is a bad example to employers in Kilkenny city who feel aggrieved when they see they have to pay the high rate of £9 5s. 0d. per week to their men, while a Government Department can get away with paying £2 less.  The man digging a hole for the foundation of a building has £2 a week more than the man a few yards away from him digging a hole to lay a cable for the Post Office. State Departments should give a lead in this matter to private employers, especially the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which is one of the Departments which pays its way and whose men are engaged in work which will prove a great source of revenue to the Department.  What makes this more unjust is the fact that they are working beside men employed by the Post Office who, because they are not <Col N="1325" /> tagged as casual labourers, who are more or less permanent labourers but doing the same type of work, also have nearly £2 a week more; they have about £9 2s. 6d.  These other labourers employed by the Department, as well as having that big differential, enjoy much overtime.</P>
    <P>I should hate to think that the reason for taking the county council rate in Kilkenny as the operative rate as against the corporation rate is that it is the lowest rate.  It is interesting to speculate whether, if the county council rate happened to be higher than the corporation rate, the case would be made that they should be paid the corporation rate.  The type of work they are doing is very hard and difficult.  They are working on concrete which I believe has failed to yield to pneumatic drills and other machinery, and they deserve a just reward for their labour.</P>
    <P>These few men who are employed in this casual capacity have been unemployed for most of the year up to now and this is the only employment break they have got.  If they did not get this, they might have been better off because the corporation is now going ahead with a scheme to improve a road in the urban area and will be recruiting from the labour exchange men who are on unemployment assistance; these men will be paid the rate of 4/1½ an hour or £9 5s. per week. It will be seen, therefore, that these casual labourers employed in the Kilkenny urban area by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs definitely have a grievance.  It is unfair to take advantage of their weak position by putting them on this rate of pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said it has been the practice of his Department for years to give to such workers the rate paid by the local authority in the area.  I submit that the local authority in this area is Kilkenny Corporation.  The work the county council workers do in the urban area is confined to main roads, and there is really no heavy work, since the main roads in the city are in a good state.  The number of hours the county council workers spend in the urban area is only a very small percentage of the number of <Col N="1326" /> hours the Corporation workers spend in the city.  For that reason, as well as the other reasons I have given, I would appeal to the Minister to treat the Post Office workers in the way Kilkenny Corporation treat their workers.  I am asking for nothing more than what is their right, a fair wage.  I appeal to the Minister to see to it they will get this.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point.  Even if they were regarded in the same way as county council workers, the Department have not seen fit to give them even the tea-break which the county council workers have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>Wonders will never cease.  This practice of paying casual workers in the engineering branch of the Department the same wages as those paid by the county council when the workers are employed within the administrative area of that county council has obtained for the past 30 years.  Successive Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs, including a Minister from the Party to which the Deputy belongs, have permitted this practice to continue.  Now the Deputy is pressing me to have it altered on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no good reason for having it altered.  The only exception to that general practice is in the city of Dublin.  I do not mind admitting that. If I acceded to the request made by the Deputy in relation to the casual workers in Kilkenny, that would have to be made applicable to the casual workers employed by the Department in every urban area in the country.  As I explained to the Deputy in reply to his question, there is a gang of road-workers with headquarters in Kilkenny. They are paid at the rate of £7 8s. per week.  County council workmen working outside the city of Kilkenny in the rural areas or in urban areas in other parts of the county are paid at the rate of £7 1s. per week.  The <Col N="1327" /> Department pay the casual worker working in the city or working outside the confines of the city at the higher rate of £7 8s., which is applicable only to the county council worker in the city.  It is not the practice of the Department to try to fob off the lowest possible wage on the casual employee.</P>
    <P>The information supplied to me by the Department is that in the city of Kilkenny, the county council are responsible for the maintenance of certain county roads passing through the city.  The corporation are responsible for the maintenance of other roads within the city.  The corporation, in their wisdom or otherwise, do the bulk of the maintenance and surfacing of roads within their control on contract and not by direct labour. Therefore, the Deputy's argument that the labourers employed by the corporation are employed as road workers does not hold good.  They are labourers and their wages are related to the building rate in the city.  They are paid, as the Deputy says, at the rate of £9 5s. 8d. per week.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has pressed me to have this practice discontinued and a new practice instituted.  He says it is giving bad example.  It is a long time there if it is bad example.  I believe the casual labourers employed by my Department would like to have extended employment, if it were possible to give it to them.  The fact is that they are employed for a specific job only and when that job is finished in the area in which they are working, there may be no further work available <Col N="1328" /> for them and they are let go.  If it were possible, I would like to employ them for a longer period, even at the wages they are at present getting from the Department.  This question relates to the employment of six men.  They are engaged in the work of digging trenches and filling them in when the ducts have been laid.  They have been working for three or four months, but the Department and they will work for another three or four months, but no longer, unless the Department have other work for them.  If I, as Minister, could obtain sufficient money from the Government to accelerate the telephone development programme and give longer periods of work to the casuals offering.  I would be doing a better job than paying them a higher rate of wages that has been the practice in the Department over the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>We are not doing any injustice to the men concerned.  Justice is a peculiar thing.  It is hard to determine when you are doing justice or injustice to an individual or a group of individuals. I, as Minister, have to hold the balance between the people who pay and the people who are paid.  I feel I am being as fair as I possibly can in this matter.  I have no objection to paying casual workers or any workers a higher rate of wages.  If the Kilkenny County Council increased the wages of their road workers, I would immediately do likewise.</P>
