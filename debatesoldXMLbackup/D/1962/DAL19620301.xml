    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say anything at all in regard to this matter, were it not for the attitude of Deputy Byrne who spoke last night.  I welcome any money which is made available by this House for the development of industry and I believe that the policy of the Government in dispersing industries as widely as possible throughout the country is the right one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said here last night that industries should be made as <Col N="861" /> large as possible and should be confined to restricted areas.  I expect his attitude was that all the industries should be set up in the big cities.  I cannot agree with the mentality of the city Deputy who cannot see any further out than the confines of the city.  It would be a rather sad day for our country if we were to pursue such a policy and further denude the countryside of its population.  If we ever reach the position in which we all live in cities, we shall become a nation of morons.  Anything the Government can do to disperse industries as widely as possible throughout the land should be done.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed in regard to the closing of industries.  If you do not open an industry you cannot close it.  I have not heard any serious comments made on all the industries which closed in the period from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, periods during which no industries were opened but in which many industries were closed.  No comment has been made on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the western areas where there were large populations which, as a result of lack of industry, tended to decline very seriously.  No matter how small the industry is that the Minister can bring to any western town, it will be of tremendous value there.  Deputies said that some of these industries give employment only to girls or women. They have not to go very far from their own country to a place where there is nothing else happening.  In Derry, they will find all the men out wheeling prams and the women out working.  Whether we employ men or women, the attitude should be to employ them anyway, or at least give them the alternative of employment in their own country as against emigrating to Britain.</P>
    <P>These industries should be based in the rural towns.  There is not much difference between taking people from the West of Ireland to Dublin and taking them from the West of Ireland to London.  The Minister is following the proper course and should not be deterred by reactionaries who would reverse his policy if they got the opportunity. <Col N="862" /> I do not think it is likely that they will ever get that opportunity again.  I commend the Minister for making this money available and if there is any criticism I have to offer it is that it is not enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I intervene in this debate is that it is the only opportunity a Deputy has to express his opinion regarding siting of industries.  I am not opposed in any way to the setting up of industries on the Western seaboard or in what are called the undeveloped areas but it seems to me that Foras Tionscal is the only body which has the power to site industries.  This creates a difficult problem for any Deputy who does not live in an undeveloped area.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that Foras Tionscal are taking an unbiased view with regard to the siting of industres.  I believe it is the intention of Foras Tionscal to site every industry in an undeveloped area rather than elsewhere. The purpose of Foras Tionscal, I take it, is to retain our people in the country and for that reason to site industries in the most advantageous positions.  Therefore, it seems to me that if any desirable project is to go to an area outside the undeveloped areas, it should be assisted by Foras Tionscal.</P>
      <P>I know of several specific cases in my own side of the country where projects have been refused by Foras Tionscal.  Although I applied to the Minister concerned, who has always been receptive to proposals made to him, he had no power to do anything at all.  It was in the hands of Foras Tionscal to decide where the industry went and the Irish Development Association, who are in a position to give funds for the setting up of industries, are, to a large extent, controlled by Foras Tionscal.  One is told that the siting of industries is dependent on the question of local employment and so on.  There is unemployment and definite unemployment in every rural part of Ireland.  The great difficulty at the moment is that our people are leaving rural Ireland.  They are moving to Dublin or some other place where they believe factories may be sited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that industries should not be <Col N="863" /> sited in Dublin if it is possible to site them outside the metropolitan area. I want to mention one or two cases here where I was absolutely powerless to do anything.  There is an old established shipbuilding industry situated near my constituency and they felt they could give a great measure of employment if a certain amount of capital, not a very great amount, was made available to them.  They were prepared to put up and help put up a lot of money on their own behalf. They had gained for themselves over the years valuable experience in building fishing boats and in exporting them.  They felt that they could double their employment and help the people locally.</P>
    <P>The matter was referred to Foras Tionscal and the reply came back that they could not be considered for a grant because there was a parallel industry in Dublin.  The industry in Dublin is not a parallel industry. It is a shipbuilding industry and is not competing in the same trade at all.  Even if it were, the industry of which I have spoken was established long before the Dublin one.  I was powerless to do anything. I could not raise the matter in the Dáil by way of Question because I would be told by the Minister that it was a matter for Foras Tionscal and that he had no say in it. Deputies are being hamstrung more and more because these statutory bodies are becoming the final arbiters in everything and there is no reference to the Minister.  That is the type of legislation that is being set up here. It is unsatisfactory in a democratic State.</P>
    <P>I know another instance, this time in my own constituency.  A sizeable industry had an opportunity of coming there.  The people concerned were non-nationals who would site a factory in my area.  Again the matter was referred to Foras Tionscal and they decided that the site was not suitable but, instead of sending the industry to the West of Ireland, on this occasion they sent it to Dublin.  If Dublin looks for an industry it gets preference over any part of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>These decisions are taken by Foras <Col N="864" /> Tionscal and what it amounts to is a direction of policy.  If people are to come here and start an industry they want the full sympathy and co-operation of the authority.  It seems to me that the policy of Foras Tionscal is to site everything in the West and, failing that, to site it in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in the industrialisation of this country to think in terms of thousands.  If people come in here with a big project and want to put in £100,000 of their own money while asking for a grant of £300,000 everybody will be running after them with a cheque book.  Small local industries are what are needed in rural Ireland.  That is what happened in the poorest part of France, in Brittany, where the land was poor and the people were leaving.  Small rural industries were set up there and saved the countryside but here it does not seem to be any use making an application for a small rural industry.  If you go to the powers concerned for the small sum of £3,000, £4,000, £5,000 or even less you have no chance whatever. That is where the mentality is wrong.  If we are to keep and maintain our people in this country, and maintain them where they were born, bred and reared&mdash;and that is the only hope for Ireland; it is the only hope in the industrialisation, really, of Ireland, in maintaining the equality of a population and the stability of a country &mdash;we must do it by small rural industries.</P>
    <P>If I came to the Minister for Industry and Commerce with plans for a small endeavour, I am certain he would give me full and sympathetic consideration. He would like to see a rural industry, although he is a city man, because he has had enough experience in the Department to know that the population is leaving rural Ireland.  At the same time, he would refer me back to Foras Tionscal and I would not get my money.</P>
    <P>I know a specific case.  A person employing 15 or 20 girls in the manufacture of soft goods for export, for which they had an illimitable export market, was precluded from expanding purely by reason of the fact that she had no funds.  We applied twice on <Col N="865" /> her behalf but we could not get a penny.  They had a full export market. Everything they were making was being exported.  This was typical of rural industry.</P>
    <P>The lady who owned the factory told me that mothers of girls in the district were coming to her and asking her to take on more girl employees.  She was willing and happy to do so, but she could not do so because of lack of money.  She started the industry, financing it herself by borrowing money from relations up to the hilt.  She wanted £5,000 so as to employ another 15 persons.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I know there may not be much time every day, but as we sit for about 13 hours a week I wonder if it would be possible for the work now being done in the precincts of the House to be done outside those hours.  It is very difficult to hear the speaker.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>If you want to save rural Ireland, you must turn your eyes to rural Ireland.  You must turn your eyes away from the big man and aid and support the small person. I do not think there is a rural Deputy who would not agree with what I have said.  I have been fighting for that for years&mdash;since I came into this House&mdash; and my words have been falling on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>If we get into the Common Market &mdash;I have my doubts on that subject&mdash; we must remember that if we have huge industries with large capital investment in remote parts of the country, they may not survive.  There is not the same reason for them to survive. It may be argued that if there is a lot of foreign capital in this country, then it is safe and they are here for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, there is a tremendous <Col N="866" /> measure of prosperity within the Six of the European Economic Community. I know that some of the big firms there have very big orders, up to, say, £2 million or £3 million. Owing to lack of factory space, owing to lack of personnel, they are not able to meet those orders.  It is very easy for them to come to Ireland and to avail of all the facilities offered to them.  Everyone is following them around with a cheque book and offering them money.  Maybe they manufacture or process £750,000 worth of stuff here and that gives useful local employment.  It is a bait, a short-term bait, that anybody will swallow. Naturally, any public representative in the area will be glad to see them. However, there is no guarantee that they will not up tools and run away when they have filled a particular order.  That is the reason I ask the Minister to consider changing the whole policy and concentrating on many industries all over the place.  I do not mean, now, in small towns but in villages which are disappearing by reason of emigration.  By starting industries there, you will save Ireland: this is the only way to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cupla focal a rá agus comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire agus le Foras Tionscal ar an obair atá déanta aca go nuige seo.</P>
      <P>I welcome any extra money that may be spent by Foras Tionscal because I am conscious of the excellent work they are doing and have done since they were founded.  The idea has been to help and encourage the establishment of industries in the undeveloped areas of our country. Those, as we know, are the poorer areas, the areas to which the people of Ireland clung when they were persecuted in former days.  Those are the areas of the bad land, the uneconomic holdings and the small farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the changing pattern of life, not alone in rural Ireland but indeed in Scotland and other countries where people in small and uneconomic holdings such as these are now prone to drift into emigration or into the bigger cities, this <Col N="867" /> represents a long-felt want.  It will give a much-needed shot in the arm to the economy of those poor areas which are trying to establish some industries or to boost the economy.</P>
    <P>If at all possible, I think that, in these areas, apart from the bigger industries, we should try to go in for something select.  I feel there is a good market among our exiles, if it were properly developed, for select articles, well-made and well-turned out, notably Irish linen.  I have been told that despite new products made from rayon, and so on, there is no more suitable or welcome gift in the United States than a gift of Irish linen and I could also say gifts of other Irish products that are well and fashionably turned out.  That would be a very good programme for us more or less to concentrate on, to try to have some select industries, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the location of industry, naturally foreigners must have a good say as to where they wish to establish their industries.  It is more or less to weight the balance and to encourage them to go into those areas that they get the extra grant from Foras Tionscal.  In this respect, people who have been in industry in these areas&mdash;some of them for the past 50 or 60 years&mdash;and whose machinery is now becoming out of date and obsolete should be considered under this scheme in a kindly way and should get a grant to replace that machinery.</P>
    <P>It would be well if the Minister now and in the future concentrated more on the north-west of the country.  In the other areas, notably the south and south-west, a great number of industries have already been established so that unemployment in these areas is very low in comparison with the north-west. As some Deputies mentioned last night, around the Border counties and the north-west, there is a good pool of labour, of willing and honest workers.  That, in itself, should be an incentive to any foreigner looking for a suitable site for an industry and wishing to avail of these grants.</P>
    <P>It is well known that, in bygone days, when foreigners came here to <Col N="868" /> establish factories, notably in Ulster, the industry left its mark on the history of the country.  The Irish workers learned a lot in the way of technique from the foreigners.  Now, with rural electrification, there is no reason why areas like that should not come in for a fair share of the new factories that are being established.  It is very important that these people should see that some effort is being made to sustain them in the hard battle which they have in order to exist in reasonable comfort. Any project, notably this one, should be welcomed if it helps them in any way.  Probably in those areas, the creamery counties, industries could profitably be established to manufacture something from milk other than the traditional pound of butter.  Some moves have been made in that direction but there are many other avenues that might be explored to dispose of the surplus milk produced by small farmers in these areas.  There are big pig populations in these areas, on which it should be possible also to base some industry.</P>
    <P>These are the points I should like the Minister to bear in mind.  I do not suggest that it is easy for him to do an enormous amount and I should like to congratulate him and Foras Tionscal on the work they have been doing and on the fact that, as he has told us, 70 new projects have been sanctioned quite recently.  That, in itself, is sufficient evidence that the people are fairly well aware of the help and encouragement which Foras Tionscal will give them.  Somebody mentioned that it was regrettable that Drogheda or some such town could not get a certain industry because it was not an undeveloped area.  It should be borne in mind that it is in the areas for which Foras Tionscal caters that it is most difficult for promotors of industry to get the necessary local capital and that it would not be much use for anybody to go around in some of the poorer areas trying to get local people to subscribe £15,000, £20,000 or £30,000 to start a factory.  There would be no hope whatever of getting it.  In other areas people are much better off by reason of their past history and so on. <Col N="869" /> For the time being the Minister is doing a wise thing in encouraging industrialists to site factories in the undeveloped areas.  Later, he may consider the suggestions made by some Opposition Deputies so that when these first factories are well established the same facilities might be given all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a little to say and that is in regard to Dublin.  It has been said by rural Deputies that Dublin is especially favoured, or words to that effect.  I understand their point of view, representing rural Ireland, and I agree to a large extent that industry should be staggered so that people will remain in rural areas but there is a problem in Dublin that rural Deputies seem to forget.  There is probably no work for manual workers in Dublin. There is plenty of work for young boys and girls but, as far as manual workers are concerned, what industries have been started for a number of years back that have absorbed any great number of manual workers?</P>
      <P>I pressed this matter two years ago when I said that there were 20,000 people idle in Dublin, the majority of whom were manual workers.  Whether there are 20,000 idle now or not I do not know but, if they are not idle, they are in England.  I know that most of those without trades or technical qualifications have no choice but to take the boat and that is what they are doing.  The main source of employment for such people is the building industry and, as far as municipal building is concerned, it nearly petered out two years ago.  In fact, last year, according to statistics, there were only 300 engaged in the building of municipal dwellings.  This year there is an improvement with 600 employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Enough manual workers cannot be got for that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because they have gone away.  When there was no work to be found here about two years ago they all packed up and went away. Now, when they are wanted they are not here.  Even manual workers require a certain amount of skill in the building <Col N="870" /> industry but the fact remains that the majority of those engaged in building went away.  That is the only industry that absorbs manual workers. There is no choice for the manual worker therefore but to take the boat. The country people have not much to complain about.  They do not all go away; they come to Dublin.  The last census has proved that one-third of the people in Dublin were actually born in rural Ireland and we have a majority of Deputies from rural Ireland.  Dublin is going to Britain.  That is the position. I am here to fight for the old Dublin. My name is Sherwin and my forbears must have come here with the Danes 800 years ago so that I am an old Dubliner, formerly of County Dublin, with my family living here for centuries. I am interested in the old Dublin manual workers, the poorer classes that have to go away in droves.  There is need for industry in Dublin to give maximum employment to manual workers.</P>
      <P>I shall say no more now.  I know the problem and let me tell the Minister that I expect in about two years from now building of dwellings will start to peter out again and in three years from now no more than 200 or 300 people will be employed in that work.  I am anticipating that time so that the Minister will think of aiding industries in Dublin that will give employment to manual workers.  I have a meeting to go to but I want to make Dublin's position clear.  Our people take the boat to a greater extent than do people from rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express satisfaction at the fact that the Minister is recruiting young, intelligent and industrious men to such boards as An Foras Tionscal.  As regards the moneys made available by such bodies we should remember that it is not simply the fact that the money is being spent that should give us satisfaction.  Quite often the only yardstick by which we measure activity in this country is the amount of money spent on this or that.  Very frequently in local government local bodies congratulate themselves on spending so many thousands on roads and so on, not counting the value they got for it.  It is not the fact as <Col N="871" /> the Minister said that An Foras Tionscal holds total property investments of about £15 million that is important: what is much more important is that the money should be properly spent and maximum value received for it.</P>
      <P>Several speakers before me in this debate expressed fears&mdash;not personal fears but fears of their constituents&mdash; about the collapse of a number of projects in this country in recent times.  It is something many intelligent, farsighted businessmen foresaw.  I should like the Minister and the House to remember that where you have free or cheap money or concessions of any kind, there also will you find the 67 different varieties of chancers and racketeers ready to come in and avail of it.  For that reason, I make no apology for reiterating the opinions that many other Deputies expressed in this debate, that the Minister should attempt to have more control of the running of projects of the nature referred to.  We do not want the &ldquo;here today and gone tomorrow&rdquo; type of industrialist who will come, take all he gets and be able to leave without any personal loss.</P>
      <P>That is the danger I see in projects of this nature.  While the aim is worthy, our enthusiasm to attract foreign capitalists or foreign skills should not make us fail to make proper inquiries about the type of person who is coming here to avail of the concessions that are being given.  We are attracting in foreign capital and foreign capitalists.  They come here and set up industries and give some employment.  What we should ensure is that they will not be in a position to fold their tents over-night and disappear like the Arabs in the desert.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most interesting features of this debate has been to see Deputies who, over the years, have described themselves as the apostles of private enterprise&mdash; and that includes members on both sides of the House, of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael&mdash;and argued that the salvation of this country and its economy lay in the hands of private <Col N="872" /> enterprise, now with their hands out prepared to dip into the national purse for moneys to bolster up incompetent and inefficient private enterprises.</P>
      <P>That is what Foras Tionscal are doing under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  They are handing out the Irish people's money in a haphazard fashion, with no planned integration of the economic fabric, in a hit or miss fashion, so far as economic development is concerned.  We have the extraordinary position that these apostles of private enterprise, inside this House and outside it, want the people's money handed over to private enterprise, without any control being exercised thereafter as to how that money taken in taxation from the public will be utilised or what return will be given for it.  I know of no such system in any intelligently run State in the world today.</P>
      <P>The first point I should like to make is in criticism of the number of Deputies who have said here that the Minister has no function in this matter with regard to the allocation of grants.  That is where these people I describe as the apostles of private enterprise come into the picture.  They say it would be wrong for the Minister in a political capacity to have any say with regard to the direction taken by Foras Tionscal.  What do we do in this House?  We hand over to an anonymous group of civil servants the spending of the Irish taxpayers' money.  I should prefer to depend on the integrity of a politician any day than on the actions of anonymous people over whom this House has no control.  There is one definite thing: a politician or a Minister has a responsibility when he comes into this House and if he has responsibility for Foras Tionscal and for the spending of money, he is open to question in this House by every Deputy.  He is open to question on all actions and decisions with regard to that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation is that the Minister hands it over to Foras Tionscal, and if a member of the House wants to find out whether the money is well spent or badly spent, or whether <Col N="873" /> a concern is paying slave wages and utilising the services of young girls of 17 years of age who have to cycle seven or eight miles to work and draw £2 8s. or £2 15s. a week, he is stymied in asking questions and will be told by the Minister that he has no function in the matter and no responsibility for Foras Tionscal.  We have a responsibility in this House to the Irish public and to the employees.  Let us make no mistake about it: the impact made by Foras Tionscal on the employment figure is negligible.  I should like the Minister to tell us the total number of the new labour force working as a result of the activities of Foras Tionscal. What percentage is male and what percentage is female?  I should also like him to give us the average wages of both groups over the entire labour content.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal in detail with individual concerns, but I know there is a good deal of suspicion in the public mind that the money being handed out to a number of outfits is not being well spent, and that the worker is not getting a just return or a fair wage for the work he puts into the particular industry or concern.  The extraordinary thing to me is that many of these industries or factories are dependent also totally on the importation of raw materials from abroad.  We all know that no control can be exercised within this State on the price of the imported raw materials.  No control can be exercised and no guarantee can be given with regard to their availability over any long term.  Yet it is into industrial concerns based on raw materials from abroad that most of the taxpayers' money is going, so far as Foras Tionscal are concerned.  If a grant is requested for an industry based on the land of Ireland, it is a sheer waste of time to knock on the door of Foras Tionscal.  If you have a foreign accent and if you are prepared, as another Deputy said, to talk in anything from thousands upward, the magic red carpet is laid out to welcome you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on this.  As far as the efforts made by Foras Tionscal to develop the industrial potential of the country are concerned, the impact is negligible in the areas in which it should be strongest. Has An Foras Tionscal ever produced a plan for a specific area and said that, inside that area, a key industry would be started and on that key industry a number of ancillary industries would grow?  Where have An Foras Tionscal taken any section of the country in order to carry out an intelligently planned industrial operation?  Did An Foras Tionscal ever try to do something similar to what has been done in Wales and Scotland?  A Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches referred to both Wales and Scotland not twenty minutes ago.  Did An Foras Tionscal ever study the way in which the British Government between 1945 and 1950 utilised State funds and State enterprise to restore Wales to the position in which it is today and to lift the uneconomic holder and the unemployed in Scotland to the position where they have first-class wages and permanent employment?  That was not done by private enterprise.  That was not done by handing out State money <i>ad lib.</i> to any speculator or foreigner to induce him to go into a <Col N="876" /> particular locality.  It was done as part of an over-all plan and, when the foundations were laid, it was left to private enterprise then to move in and start the ancillary industries.</P>
      <P>There are no foundations laid here in the form of key industries on which private enterprise could ultimately base itself.  It is simply a question of a local development committee in a small town getting together and worrying. Ballina gets an industry.  The people in Claremorris feel they are as much entitled to an industry as Ballina.  The people in Roscommon see an industry established in Ballyhaunis or Rossmore. They ask themselves why there should not be an industry in Roscommon. A local industry starts somewhere and immediately there is a descent on An Foras Tionscal by every small town asking if that body can get a Frenchman, a German, or an American to help them to start an industry, that there is plenty of labour available.</P>
      <P>The promoter will start his industry to suit himself, not to suit the rural area or to fit into some over-all picture that may be in the minds of the Government.  He may want to live in the locality.  If he likes Killarney, he will go to Killarney and start his industry there, destroying the picturesque countryside with his buildings.  Nobody objects.  He is giving employment. He may be making cranes or warlike materials.  That is actually happening in that part of the country. He cannot make warlike materials in Germany, but he can make them in Killarney.  Is there any objection voiced?  Not at all.  If there is a bit of employment given in a locality people will sell their immortal souls, and the countryside with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no planned industrial development in that performance.  In case the Minister may say that I am wrong in that, that there is a plan in operation, and that we have one in Shannon, let us ask ourselves what have we in Shannon?  We have an industrial estate.  How many of the industries there are making the finished product out of native raw materials? What guarantee have we with regard <Col N="877" /> to even one that they will not close up within the next two years?  What control are the Government exercising, on behalf of the Irish people, over these industries which have got such substantial and generous State aid? Is it the position that we just hand over the Irish people's money to the foreign speculator, tell him it is his, that he has ten years to make his profits, that he need pay no tax so long as he exports the finished product, and good luck to him?  At the end of ten years any intelligent speculator can tell himself that he has made five times what he put into this industry.  There is no control over him in the form of a contract compelling him to stay on for another five, ten, or fifteen years. What is to prevent him getting out?</P>
    <P>I know for a fact that in Germany and France industrialists and others connected with business could not believe their ears when they heard the wireless broadcast by some Irish citizen about the wonderful attractions here in Ireland for industrial development&mdash; Come to Ireland: there is a cheap and docile pool of labour available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because that was the interpretation and the fact that it was the interpretation has been clearly demonstrated in regard to one or two concerns which came over here and said: &ldquo;We thought we would have no trouble with trade unions at all in this country.  We were told we would get away with anything we liked.  We were told `Give work to these people and you can pay them less than you would pay in Germany and France, and get away with it'.&rdquo; They got a hell of a shock when they came up against the trade unions and were told where they got off by a number of them.  They were told they were not welcome, and they are not welcome.  In my constituency within the next few months we may have an industry in which some Germans are interested.  I made it clear to these people that, as far as I am concerned, they will pay trade union wages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people put me here to express their views.  They gave me a vote far above what the Minister's outfit got in that constituency. Whether the Minister likes it or not, he will have to take it.  I offer goodwill to any industrialist who comes in to my constituency, but no industrialist will come in to exploit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closing down or shifting out of a number of concerns which got very generous help from the public purse is not relevant and I do not want to comment, but I think we should learn a lesson.  The result of that lesson should be a reorganisation inside An Foras Tionscal.  Whatever grants are made available in future for the establishment of factories, some form of control should be exercised to ensure <Col N="879" /> that these concerns cannot pull out overnight, having made their profits. The Minister has a responsibility to the people in the State from whom he gets his money in the form of taxation to see their money is well spent.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put forward that we will not get these people to come in.  What do we want?  Is it necessary to depend on these people? Is it essential for Ireland's future success in the industrial and economic field that she must depend almost completely on the goodwill of these speculative groups on the Continent of Europe and in America?  Are we putting all our eggs into that private enterprise basket?  Have we lost all confidence in our own people that they have not the skill, the technique and the training to do as well as these people who are coming in and who are getting Irish money to do a job Irishmen could do as well, as Irishmen are doing today in England, Canada and Australia?</P>
    <P>The Minister frequently speaks in London.  Whom does he meet over there?  How many Irish scientists, engineers and skilled workmen has he met in the course of his travels and, in his suave, smooth manner told: &ldquo;You can get jobs over in Ireland. We are doing our best&rdquo;?  Who is coming over?  The foreigner is coming over and the most highly skilled Irishmen are working in first-class jobs in Britain, breaking their hearts to get back here.  The Government say it is for private enterprise, not for the Government, to bring them over, but when we have a company like the Sugar Company prepared to bring them over, prepared to get down to the root of the problem in Ireland and process manufactured goods based on the soil of Ireland, what do we find?  We find that such a company is told: &ldquo;You cannot interfere with the existing private concern that is operating here.  You cannot compete with X firm who are making jam; you cannot compete with Y firm who are processing peas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is a large company prepared to draw its skilled personnel back from industries in Britain and put <Col N="880" /> them at the disposal of the Irish people in order to give employment in Ireland and process what we can at home.  No; we have no time for that.  That is Irish.  Here are the Government who talk about Irish industry and the development of Irish industry.  They are suffering, of course, from the complex that there is nothing good in this country, that we must depend on the foreigner; tip your cap as in the old times to the ascendancy; tip your cap on this occasion to the foreign speculator and depend on him to do the job, that he will in turn become more Irish than the Irish themselves.</P>
    <P>I cannot forecast, but the time is coming when a decision will be made on the Common Market.  The decision will not lie in the hands of this Government or in the hands of the Opposition but, according to the papers in the past two days, the only difference now between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on this question is that Fine Gael say: &ldquo;We would have a better team to negotiate entrance into the Common Market than Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  Did anyone ever hear the like of that when neither of them has as much say in it as the man in the moon?  However, come what may a decision has to be made on it outside this country and that decision will have a great bearing on a number of concerns which Foras Tionscal have responsibility for setting up.  At this stage, has the Minister even wakened up to the fact that in the event of Ireland being associated with or going into the Common Market, all of what Foras Tionscal are doing will no longer be allowed, if the Treaty of Rome is to be adhered to?  I doubt very much if these six European countries will say: &ldquo;We like Deputy Jack Lynch &mdash; he is a fine lad and was a great hurler; we think on account of his courtesy and his manner we should give favourable terms to the industries he has set up under protection and to which he has given State money in order to compete with existing industries in Europe.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was asked here yesterday if he was prepared to comply with all the Articles of the Treaty of Rome and the Minister and his Leader said we were, because we have no option.  We are going with our hands up politically and economically into the Common Market and we have nothing to offer except a base that could be used to close the alleged gap in the defences of so-called Christian Europe.  However, that is outside this discussion.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to admit that out of the group of industrial concerns set up under Foras Tionscal, the maximum output of 60 per cent. is for export, the remainder being consumed, I presume, on the home market.  Is he satisfied that the system which has operated since Foras Tionscal went in will be allowed in the next three, five or seven years up to 1970?  Is he prepared to say at this stage that the system will have to be altered and altered drastically?  Is he prepared even now to say: &ldquo;We want to give a certain amount of control, at any rate, to the State in order to ensure that the Irish people's money is properly spent&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>I cannot oppose the giving of the money in present circumstances.  Seeing that it has gone on for so many years, I do not think there is much point in suggesting at this stage that the money should not be given.  It must be given at the present time, but surely the Minister should be prepared, before his main Estimate comes up, to let this House know he has now prepared a plan, with the advice and assistance of all the experts he has, that will enable us to see the overall picture of development over five-year periods, that he will be able to tell us that haphazard planning is going out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were it not for the danger or the possibility of the Common Market looming up, no efforts would be made even in that regard, but the <Col N="882" /> question of the admission of Ireland into it will certainly do good, irrespective of what happens in regard to our application.  It will shake us up here and bring home to the public that the kind of cuckooland the people have been living in will be no longer possible and that this sheltered outlook that has developed over the years can no longer obtain.  The tragedy is that it is the Irish people who will suffer.  Those who come in here and get money to set up industries will not suffer.  They will have their money made and will depart and will be happy to say that this is a grand country, that there is grand scenery in it, that we are a soft-hearted people and that no other country in the world would give them the grants we gave them.  That is the big weakness in giving these people the control they have.</P>
    <P>If there is a big concern in some part of France, Britain or America and if the members of that firm wish to avail of the generous terms given in Ireland, they will do so, but if the home base finds that economic pressures are weakening, it is not the home factory that will close down but the factory in Ireland.  We know how often that has happened.</P>
    <P>This Government and Fine Gael are the same in this respect and the time for exposure is coming fast in the next two or three years.  They are both worshippers at the feet of private enterprise and their worship in that respect has brought this country to the state where we have no bargaining power with regard to our application for admission to the Common Market.  We have no healthy industrial concerns built up under this alleged industrial revival.  There are a number of concerns which were built up under private enterprise in the years gone by without any help from the Government or anybody else but since 1932, the potential built up under private enterprise is not capable of meeting the volume of competition that is going to face it.</P>
    <P>If we look at any concern built by the State in which the State itself kept control, we will see that they are the only groups within this country that <Col N="883" /> are likely to be able to stand up to the competition.  Is it not tragic that this type of development has not been applied to other aspects of our industrial potential and that these aspects have not been exploited by State or semi-State bodies?  If we had done that over the years, we would now be in a much better position to face the competition of the Common Market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>During this debate, a number of hares were raised.  I would not mind if they were live ones but they were not, so I had better shoot them down right away.  From what has been said here, one would imagine that every second industry established through assistance from Foras Tionscal had closed down.  That is completely untrue.  There is no ground whatever for these assertions.  I have mentioned that there were some 70 of these industries in production and something in excess of 50 in course of development. Of the 70 odd, we have knowledge of only two that were unable to survive. There may have been others who had difficult times.  Perhaps the promoters did not pursue the undertaking and they may have decided to change to another commodity, but we have knowledge of only two factories that were started and did not survive.  They were very small ones started with the aid of a comparatively low State subvention in the form of a grant.  By and large, there has been no history of failure, as many Deputies would seem to suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another of the hares raised was that Foras Tionscal favours foreigners. It was said: &ldquo;All you have to have is a foreign accent and the red carpet is put out for you.&rdquo;  I have tried time and time again to scotch these rumours and to prevail on people not to make assertions which they know are groundless. There is no truth whatever that Foras Tionscal favours foreigners in any way.  They would be glad to see Irishmen coming forward with proposals for new industries or the expansion of old ones in any part of the country but particularly in the undeveloped <Col N="884" /> areas which they would be able to help.</P>
    <P>The other question raised, and about 75 per cent. of the Deputies who have spoken referred to it, was that industrialists who are coming in here are hoping to undermine the trade union set-up we have here, hoping to avoid employing our trade union workers. The suggestion was made in some cases that we tried to keep from them that we have trade unions and that these trade unions insist that the workers be paid minimum rates and work reasonable hours.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to say very emphatically that Foras Tionscal, and the Industrial Development Authority, in the first instance, give prospective industrialists from outside the fullest possible information as to the industrial and labour relations background of this country.  There is no truth whatever in the suggestion that we try to delude these industrialists about cheap and docile labour.  In using that phrase, Deputy McQuillan has introduced a phrase which was never used by anybody in Foras Tionscal, the Industrial Development Authority or by me.  He deliberately misinterpreted a phrase that was used which indicated that there was here in this country intelligent and adaptable labour.  Any of us here can stand over such a phrase and, indeed, are proud to be able to use it.</P>
    <P>I was asked specific questions about the extent to which foreign capital is invested <i>vis-à-vis</i> the grants approved. The amount of grants that will have been approved by the end of this year by Foras Tionscal is about £6,141,000 out of a total investment of about £15,000,000.  The balance of £8,859,000 will be provided by the promoters themselves.  I cannot say at this stage in what proportion these promoters bring in only their own money or are assisted by investments from Irish sources.  There has been a considerable amount of such investment.</P>
    <P>I have also been asked about rates of wages as between male and female workers and the number of workers at present engaged in these industries <Col N="885" /> in relation to the ultimate number who will be employed.  At the moment, a comprehensive review is being undertaken to see in what direction, if any, we ought to change in our industrial development programme, in our system of incentives for industrial development.  Until such time as that is completed, it would not be possible for me to undertake to give details of any of these industries.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech, I said that, of the 10,000 people in the industries these grants are intended to cover, the division as between male and female labour is 5,500 male against 4,500 female.  These are maximum figures. They are only estimated figures as far as An Foras Tionscal is concerned.</P>
    <P>When industrialists come to An Foras Tionscal, their proposals are examined minutely.  They say, perhaps, they expect to employ X people; in the third year X plus Y people and, in the final year of development, maybe five years hence, 2XX people. It is from these figures, that are examined as closely as possible by An Foras Tionscal, that the estimated figures I have given are taken.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it would be impossible to say how many are employed in these industries at their different stages, without the very comprehensive review which is now being undertaken.  I suggest the figures have no meaning at present because some of these industries would necessarily have a slow start.  Maybe, in their first, second or third years, their rate of development, as far as employment content is concerned, might be considered low, while in their fourth and fifth years, we might see a big influx of new workers to bring them up to the maximum number they said they would employ ultimately.  I hope to have all the information, as a result of the review now being undertaken, before the new legislation will be introduced &mdash; which will be shortly, I hope &mdash; to replace existing legislation which will cease to have effect in 1963.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that we ought to insist on the appointment of a director to represent An Foras Tionscal to the extent of An Foras <Col N="886" /> Tionscal's investment by way of grant in the enterprise.  The greatest attraction of the grants we give is that they are without unnecessary strings.  However, they are not without strings completely. They are without strings to the extent that we do not try, and I do not think we ought to try, to direct these firms on how they should run their undertakings.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the grants are related to the viability of the proposed undertaking and, secondly, to the amount of capital these people are prepared to invest.  As the general picture shows, the proportion is very much in our favour, £9 million as against £6 million in grants.  I think that might represent a general pattern. Therefore, I do not see any foundation for the suggestion that these people, having availed of the grants paid to them here, can abscond overnight, leaving us holding the baby.  Their solid money is in it, too, and in the form of bricks, mortar, steel, machinery and other fixed assets.  Therefore, even if they go, they leave behind them what I suggest would be in each case solid security for the amount of the State investment, even though it is by way of grant.</P>
    <P>We do not want to tell these people how to run their business.  We do not want to breathe down their necks every time they turn in their factories or sit at their office desk.  I do not think that to do that would prove successful.  It would deter to a considerable extent the number of people likely to come here and, if we adopted these practices, certainly I would not be obliged to bring in a Supplementary Estimate at this time of the year, nor would there have been cause for any of the Supplementary Estimates introduced in past years.</P>
    <P>However, there is this control.  Each industrialist who receives a grant is obliged to sign an agreement with Foras Tionscal and it is a legal agreement. It was required ever since Foras Tionscal first began to give grants.  Latterly, there was some suggestion that these agreements may not fully be enforceable in the event of one of these parties trying to avoid its <Col N="887" /> terms.  Therefore, we wrote into the 1961 Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act a section in which we said:</P>
    <P>5.  Where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  the grant is made subject to any term restricting the disposal of factory sites or premises, or machinery and equipment (or any part of such sites or premises or such machinery and equipment) or, if the grantee is a company, shares in its capital, ...</P>
    <P>That means that they sign an agreement whereby they bind themselves &mdash; and that has been written into our law &mdash; not to dispose of the buildings, land or any part of it, or of the shares without first getting the approval of An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>As far as the buildings and plant are concerned, they are bound for a period of 10 years and as far as shares are concerned they are bound under the terms of these agreements for a period of five years.  Any apprehensions Deputies might have that these people can be fly-by-nights are disposed of by these three factors.  We have to see the colour of their money as our money is advanced only in relation to the advances made by these people themselves.</P>
    <P>In the published accounts of Foras Tionscal we see columns, &ldquo;Amounts Approved&rdquo;, &ldquo;Amounts Paid&rdquo;, &ldquo;Amounts Outstanding.&rdquo;  If the amount has been approved, it is not handed over &mdash; as I think Deputy McGilligan suggested &mdash; and that is the end of it: the amount approved is handed over, according as the factory is being built and the plant and machinery are being introduced into it.  That is the first point to consider.</P>
    <P>Secondly, they have to put in, in that proportion, their own capital. Ultimately, we find the factory there, which is solid security, by and large, for the amount of State grant put into it.  Bricks, mortar, steel and machinery cannot be moved overnight.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is the fact that they have that solid investment themselves and that they will not abandon <Col N="888" /> it very lightly.  We have not had any experience of these fly-by-nights or sudden fold-ups, as has been suggested. It is not fair to make such allegations.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on Deputy McGilligan, in particular, that there have not been free hand-outs and the consequences which he mentioned.  It is far from the case.  One of the important aspects and terms of our grants system is that they are free of strings that would enable or entitle the Government to control the destinies of these private enterprise firms.</P>
    <P>In respect of grants of a particularly high amount, there is a modicum of thinking that these grants should take the form of some kind of non-voting shareholding.  In some cases, that has been suggested and it may be done. At the moment, however, we have not changed direction to any extent yet, until such time as the review to which I have referred has been completed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that An Foras Tionscal direct industries to go to certain places, I would point out that under the Undeveloped Areas Act An Foras Tionscal have no power of direction.  Under the Industrial Grants Act, An Foras Tionscal are obliged to have regard to the provision enacted in this House which says:</P>
    <P>2 (1) Whenever the Board&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) are of opinion that there are sound reasons why an industrial undertaking cannot be established or developed in the undeveloped areas ...</P>
    <P>Apart from that, they have no say whatever &mdash; nor should they have &mdash; in the siting or location of industries. When they interpret that section of the 1959 Industrial Grants Act they interpret it not narrowly and not strictly, so that if a town like New Ross or Wexford or Drogheda procured an industry, or prospective industry, and if it was conveyed to Foras Tionscal that there were certain attractions in New Ross or Wexford or Drogheda that appealed to the industry and that could not be provided in a town in the undeveloped <Col N="889" /> areas, Foras Tionscal would deal with that proposition on its merits in relation to New Ross, Wexford or Drogheda and in relation to no other place.</P>
    <P>As far as location in the undeveloped areas is concerned, Foras Tionscal, far from trying to direct or influence people, are very careful to avoid doing so.  If they did, for instance, direct people to Buncrana instead of Ballybunion and if any difficulty arose in regard to the location, Foras Tionscal would have to bear responsibility in respect of that wrong location.  They approach all that in the sense that it is the man or the company putting up the money, or making the major investment, that is best entitled to say where the industry shall be.</P>
    <P>The other criticism was that I should have more control over the amount of the grants and the location of the industry. In the first place, while I am the person who must face responsibility in this House for the actions of Foras Tionscal, the House and the country generally have full confidence in the chairman and members of the board of Foras Tionscal, even though they are not directly responsible to the House.  In the second place if the Minister were the person who decides first whether a grant should be given, the amount of the grant and the location, would anybody in his sane senses believe that he would not be influenced in some way by political motives?  I say to people aggrieved because they have not got a grant or aggrieved at the amount of the grant they have got, that I cannot interfere and I do not think I ought to.  We appointed the board of Foras Tionscal in the terms of the legislation we passed and we all have confidence in them and I do not think we should ask any Minister, no matter what Government he serves, to constitute himself a court of appeal against a body such as that.  If he did so, Deputies who are familiar with the facts of life know there would be a regular procession of deputations from this town and that, fighting for the location of industries or criticising the amount of grants given.  I do not think that would be <Col N="890" /> practical politics and I am sure the vast majority of Deputies agree with the system now operating.</P>
    <P>Before leaving that general aspect, there was the suggestion that we should exercise more control.  Deputies should realise that we have not a queue of foreign industrialists waiting to come in here, that we are not the only country which gives State assistance for the setting up of industries.  Even in Common Market countries at present, considerable inducements are given.  We cannot tell these people what type of industry they should establish here, where to go or what type of labour to employ.  By and large, we must leave all these matters to themselves subject to setting out for them as plainly as we can what our industrial set-up is, the type of projects we should like to see established and the labour relations that have been part of our industrial fabric through the years.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that we might not be able to continue this operation when we enter the Common Market.  It was referred to by Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Corish and also by Deputy McQuillan in, perhaps, stronger and less responsible terms. The relevant article is Article 92 which does, as was suggested, discourage any forms of aid granted by member States &ldquo;which distort or threaten to distort competition by favouring certain enterprises or certain productions&rdquo; but sub-paragraph (3) of the same Article says:</P>
    <P>The following may be deemed to be compatible with the Common Market:</P>
    <P>(a)  aids intended to promote the economic development of regions where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there exists serious under-employment:</P>
    <P>(b) aids intended to promote the execution of important projects of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance of the economy of a Member State;</P>
    <P>(c) aids intended to facilitate the development of certain activities <Col N="891" /> or of certain economic regions ...</P>
    <P>It goes on like that.  Already, I think every one of the member countries&mdash; to my knowledge, certainly, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg&mdash;have in existence certain forms of State aid for industry, certain forms of inducement or reliefs and some of these were negotiated long after these countries became members of the Common Market.  These matters are negotiated with the commission of EEC which decides what forms of State aid may be construed, within the meaning of Article 92, as constituting a distortion, or what forms of State aid may be permissible under sub-paragraph (3).  Some existing members operate various systems of State aid, so that if we find ourselves members of EEC we shall have power to negotiate with the commission on what forms of State aid we can continue. In the meantime, it is our intention to continue the present policy to the full without any deviation and rather with greater intensity, if we can.</P>

      <P>May we take it, therefore, that in the Minister's opinion this form of aid would be all right under the terms of the Rome Treaty but that it might be challenged and that the Minister's opinion is that even if it were challenged, it would be allowed?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> I think I have dealt with most of the points raised.  I shall not chase some of the deliberately mischievous hares which were raised.  I should like to assure Deputy McGilligan that there is nothing sinister in this proposal&mdash; he seemed to suggest that there was. It is a straightforward proposal to implement further the statutes and enactments of this House, and I am very glad I am in a position to come to the House and ask for another £250,000 to increase the amount of money we made available for industrial development in the undeveloped areas this year.  This is a form of Supplementary Estimate I should be very pleased to introduce year after year if we found we were under-estimating our industrial development programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate is necessary to provide the additional sum of £150,000 required for constructional works at Cork Airport and £91,000 for tourism making a total of £241,000 against which it has been found possible to set off savings of £201,000 on other sub-heads of the Vote, together with estimated additional receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid <Col N="893" /> of £30,000 leaving the net sum required at £10,000.</P>
    <P>The excess in the case of Cork Airport is due mainly to the fact that extras and variations on the contract for the Airport buildings will exceed those provided for in the Estimate by about £100,000.  In addition, payments under the contract, excluding extras, will exceed those provided for by about £50,000.  This is due to the fact that constructional works for which provision was made in the 1960/61 Estimate were retarded by bad weather in that year with the result that expenditure in respect of the delayed works did not fall due for payment until the current year.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that as Cork Airport was a completely new project, it was not possible to give accurate estimates on all aspects of the work. For instance, demands for accommodation in excess of that originally planned arose while construction was actually in progress.</P>
    <P>As regards tourism, the functions previously vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce were transferred to me by Order made by the Government on 31st October, 1961. Since then, the sums provided for tourism in the Industry and Commerce Vote have continued to be used to finance the activities of Bord Fáilte. These sums comprise £500,000 for administration and general purposes, £100,000 for the making of grants under the scheme for the development of major tourist resorts and £100,000 for the payment of grants towards the development of holiday accommodation &mdash; a total of £700,000.  I am now proposing that additional funds be made available to the Board under two of those subheads &mdash; those for general purposes and for holiday accommodation grants.</P>
    <P>The £500,000 voted earlier in the financial year for administration and general purposes was the maximum sum that could be voted under the then existing legislation.  Deputies will recall, however, that the annual limit on the Board's general grant-in-aid was removed by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, which was enacted in August <Col N="894" /> last.  The purpose of that Act was to enable expenditure on tourism to be increased for a limited period and accordingly provision was made for a global sum of £5 million, from which payment will be made to Bord Fáilte of such sums as may be determined each year by the Minister for Transport and Power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the period of increased investment in tourism should be commenced without delay and accordingly this Supplementary Estimate includes provision for an additional £71,500 for the Board's general purposes grant for the current year. This sum will be applied towards the development of our tourist facilities&mdash; the improvement of road signposting, the provision of better access to national monuments and places of interest, assistance to schemes for the training of hotel staff and so on &mdash; and to increased efforts to attract visitors, through general publicity and advertising abroad and through special campaigns, such as the June Holiday Plan.</P>
    <P>It also includes a sum of £15,000 for the payment of interest grants on loans raised by hoteliers and guest house proprietors for improvement and development works.  These grants are paid in approved cases to assist in meeting interest charges for a period of five years.  The scheme has proved a most effective incentive and, with the other forms of financial aid offered by Bord Fáilte, has stimulated substantially increased investment by the hotel industry.</P>
    <P>More than £1 million is now being invested annually in the provision and improvement of accommodation and as a result I expect that the number of registered bedrooms, which a few years ago stood at about 16,000 and was tending to fall, will reach 20,000 next year.  Over 3,000 of these will have private baths &mdash; a facility for which there is increasing demand.  This is a very welcome development as it marks a breakthrough in the field of accommodation which was for some years a barrier to the expansion of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The increased rate of investment in <Col N="895" /> hotel development works has also involved Bord Fáilte in greater commitments for the payment of cash grants in respect of additional bedrooms and general improvement works.  These grants are financed from the fund of £500,000 established under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, and as a result of the accelerated rate of development the sum of £100,000 provided for the current year has proved insufficient by about £19,500.  Provision is therefore being made for the voting of this sum to the Board under the appropriate subhead, making a total additional sum of £91,000 for tourism.</P>
    <P>I should mention that there is expected to be a saving on the Board's other subhead &mdash; that for resort development grants &mdash; of about £22,000.  This saving is not due to any cut back in expenditure on resort development but to the fact that the initial steps in getting development under way at local level have taken a little longer than expected.  That saving will, of course, occur in the Industry and Commerce Vote and it is not possible to apply it towards the increased commitments of Bord Fáilte for the services now under consideration.  It does, in fact, reduce the additional expenditure on tourism this year from £91,000 to £69,000.</P>
    <P>It is not many months since Deputies had an opportunity, on the occasion of the passage through the Oireachtas of the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1961, for a full debate on the tourist industry.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, to undertake any major review of the industry at this stage. However, as this is the first occasion on which I have come before the Dáil in my capacity as Minister responsible for tourism, it is fitting that I should refer briefly to the progress that has been made and to plans for the future. There has been a welcome expansion in tourist traffic in recent years.  In 1960, we had a total of more than 4½ million visitors, and their expenditure here, which is an important factor in closing the gap in our balance of payments, amounted to £42.4 million.  The 1961 figures are not yet available but the upward trend was well maintained and visitors' expenditure <Col N="896" /> is estimated to have reached £47 million.  While this is on the whole a fairly satisfactory situation, I believe that even better results could be achieved by an accelerated rate of investment in tourism during the next few years.  The entitlement of workers to longer paid holidays, the rise in individual incomes and the general improvement in living standards are factors which make for continuous growth in international travel.</P>
    <P>We cannot, however, expect to get our share of increasing tourist traffic without proper planning.  We have one of the best countries in the world for holidays but we must publicise it more effectively and convince as many as possible of the people of Britain, United States and Europe that it is worth visiting.  That means imaginative and well planned publicity and advertising, not only by Bord Fáilte but by those deriving their livelihood from the tourist trade, particularly regional groups of hotels working in mutual collaboration.  We also need a special effort to extend the season and to bring more visitors in June and September.</P>
    <P>I have great hopes for the success of the Bord Fáilte June Holiday Plan which is based on reduced tariffs and a special promotion campaign.  We must try to educate our people towards holidays outside the peak months of July and August.  The country is at its best in June, the days are longer and the weather is better.  The Autumn also has its own special attractions when the glorious colours of the landscape, especially in Kerry and along the West Coast, are a delight to the eye.  Our golden Autumn could, I am sure, be exploited as a special attraction for visitors and I am confident that in this way, and with an intensive June campaign, we could achieve a worthwhile extension at both ends of the holiday season.</P>
    <P>I attach great importance to the promotion of group business through organised special-interest holidays.  This is already being done in the angling areas but it could be extended to other activities &mdash; golfing, river cruising, garden or botanical tours, cultural events and so on.  We can also offer very <Col N="897" /> attractive facilities for motoring visitors, who find our uncrowded roads a pleasant change from the congestion elsewhere.  Sailing is another sphere in which we have many advantages to offer, especially along the south coast which has everything a yachtsman could desire.  These facilities, if suitably developed and publicised, could attract considerable numbers of additional visitors from Britain and other countries.</P>
    <P>While it is important that we should engage in intensive overseas publicity and advertising, the benefits of these efforts will be lost unless we ensure an enjoyable time for our visitors.  Word-of-mouth publicity is probably more effective than any other medium and it is essential therefore that our overseas tourists should return home well pleased with their stay in Ireland. They should be made to feel welcome here and we should do everything we can to provide more indoor entertainment in our hotels, to let them hear our Irish singing and music and sample the best of our Irish foods.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and the other groups concerned with the tourist industry are doing a very good job but we must not rest on our laurels.  The next few years are of great importance if we are to maintain our place against other competing countries.  It is vital therefore that Bord Fáilte should be given the necessary funds to get on with the job and accordingly I recommend that the House approve of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that some of the money required in this Supplementary Estimate is necessary to complete the construction work at Cork Airport. I should be interested to hear from the Minister what the position is about the air fare <i>vis-á-vis</i> the train fare.  I understand there was some alteration recently as a result of the Minister's intervention. It seems to me that whatever either company finds is satisfactory is a matter which might well be left to the company concerned.  Both companies, Aer Lingus and Córas Iompair Éireann, are State companies.  Both are subsidised.  There does not seem to me to be any strong objection to subsidising <Col N="898" /> one form of transport as against another.  If a subsidy is involved, the taxpayer is paying, and it does not seem to matter a great deal whether the subsidy goes to an air company or a surface transport company. I should be interested to know the effect of the alteration in the fare.</P>

    <P>The proposal to provide increased grants for tourist development is one that will be welcomed generally.  In recent years there has been a growing realisation that the tourist industry is a valuable one; it is one in which the country gains a great many benefits for <Col N="899" /> a relatively lower expenditure than that incurred on enterprises of a different character.  It has the added advantage that the benefits are dispersed over a wide area, embracing cities and towns, and predominating in the rural areas because of the visits tourists make to different parts.  Efforts to extend the tourist season are undoubtedly desirable, just as desirable as the provision for increased accommodation and facilities generally.</P>
    <P>One of the deterrents which have operated to prevent greater advantage being taken by hoteliers and guesthouse owners of the grants and loans available is the fact that, when reconstruction or renovation work is done, premises are liable to revaluation.  That is something with which Bord Fáilte and the Department should concern themselves, even if it involves some change in the present position.  The effect must be considerable although the increased business as a result of extension and modernisation may off-set to some extent, at any rate, the disadvantages of revaluation.</P>
    <P>I should be interested in hearing the views of the Minister as to whether An Bord Fáilte and his Department consider a change desirable in the licensing laws in holiday resorts. Licensing laws invariably give rise to conflict of opinion but it would seem from views pretty generally expressed that the operation of the present licensing laws has had an adverse effect on holiday resorts.</P>
    <P>Among the most successful tourist attractions in recent years have been the events sponsored by individual organisations, either by the combined efforts of groups or the efforts of single bodies, such as the Hospitals Trust, in promoting the international golf competition at Woodbrook.  The success of these events, the fact that they are run in a most efficient way, the quality of the course as well as the quality of the reception and treatment afforded to those who compete in them and the visitors who come to watch them, have all reflected credit on the promoters. They will undoubtedly help to attract visitors here, only some of whom might <Col N="900" /> come on holiday but who come because of their direct interest or participation in the particular event.</P>
    <P>Similarly, this year, the decision to hold the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes Derby at the Curragh, which will be the most valuable flat race in Europe, must attract to this country a great number of visitors as well as those directly concerned in the race itself. If it is possible to encourage still further organisations and clubs throughout the country to organise specific events, then it seems that the success which has attended the events already organised is an indication of what value might be attached to the promotion of particular sporting events and events in other spheres, drama, theatre and so on, such as the Cork Film Festival, the Wexford Festival, which all in their own way have contributed greatly to the publicity about particular localities, as well as the skill, ability and cultural standards of our people.</P>
    <P>These events, in so far as some of them are held outside the peak holiday period, extend the tourist season.  In other cases, the event may take place within the peak period but they attract here people who might not otherwise come.  I have no doubt that if any encouragement is necessary, it will be given.  It is, I think, significant that some of the most successful events, whether sporting, cultural or musical, have been organised and promoted either by individual concerns or voluntary groups working together, rather than by any direct intervention by the Department or Bord Fáilte.  To the extent that they have been a success, the greatest possible credit and thanks are due to those directly concerned and reflect the highest credit on their ability and organising capacity.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the fact that an increased number of tourists have been coming here over a number of years will continue, more especially when the standard of accommodation provided in the hotels and guest houses here is being progressively raised.  Any criticism which visitors or our own holidaymakers have is undoubtedly a reflection on the standard of service. It is up to the hoteliers themselves and the guest house proprietors to provide <Col N="901" /> the best standard possible.  The best advertisement is a satisfied customer. No amount of publicity, no amount of propaganda, can replace a well-satisfied customer.  When he or she returns home either to Ireland or abroad, he or she is the best advertisement. I have no doubt our hoteliers and guest house owners recognise that and are making strenuous efforts to provide the highest standard of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the time for a general review of tourism and I have only a few points to raise.  First, however, I should like to say that we certainly approve of what the Minister is doing in seeking this extra money for Cork Airport and for certain other aspects of tourism.  It was, I think, a wise decision of the Government to transfer responsibility for tourism from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Minister for Transport and Power, or perhaps I should say from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to the Ministry of Transport and Power.</P>
      <P>I do not mean any reflection on the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Industry and Commerce embraces so many things and the Minister has such a heavy responsibility that the transfer of tourism to the Minister for Transport and Power is a welcome change.  Nor do I suggest that the Minister for Transport and Power is less competent than the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I think he has a certain amount of imagination.  He has shown in other Departments that he has that imagination. I know that as far as tourism is concerned, he will try to promote it in this country as an industry, which is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a simple question, which is asked by everybody in the country.  We are told from year to year that tourism means so much to the country, £30 million, £40 million or £45 million, but how do we know that?  It is very easy to say how much the country gets from industry, agriculture or the export of a particular commodity, but we get, for instance, the figure that, in 1960, <Col N="902" /> the tourist industry brought in an income of £42.4 million.  Who assesses that?  Is it a rough estimate?  Thousands of people come across here from England and there does not seem to be any check on the amount spent by them in hotels or on entertainment or gambling.  I do not question this figure but I should like to know how it is arrived at.  I know there may be a certain check on the amounts spent by visitors coming from countries other than Britain and the Commonwealth, but I cannot understand how any official can determine how much an Englishman and his family spend here.</P>
    <P>The great lack in our tourist drive seems to be in respect of advertising. Anybody who has been abroad, especially on the Continent, must be ashamed of the skimpy nature of our advertisements there.  Many of the European countries, particularly Switzerland, Denmark, France and Germany, seem to be able to afford splash advertisements which catch the eye, but you have to look for an Irish one. I know money is the important factor in this, but if we attach so much importance to tourism, we should be prepared to spend more, if that is necessary, to get the right type of advertisement.  Maybe the money is spent in the wrong direction&mdash;I do not know.  I can only judge from the type of advertisement one sees in the railway stations and other places abroad. Therefore, especially as far as Britain is concerned, we should do much more in the way of advertising.  I must say I have noticed an improvement in the British newspapers in that respect, particularly the Sunday newspapers. What effect that will have we shall not know for quite some time.</P>
    <P>While the most valuable aspects to us of travelling holidays are the number of foreign tourists we can attract, I suggest we could make a much greater effort, at the same time, to induce our own people to spend their holidays in Ireland.  I admit that it is a very good thing that our people should travel abroad, but many who do so might be induced to see their own country first.  I know there are many people here who have been in <Col N="903" /> France, Spain, Germany and throughout the continent of Europe who have never seen Killarney, who have never been to Galway or to Connemara. They do not know the beauty or the attraction of Donegal or, as the Minister mentioned, the West coast generally.</P>
    <P>We had a slogan for stamp franking in this country once: &ldquo;See Ireland first&rdquo;, but now we seem to have lost the idea of inducing our people to see their own country.  That, admittedly, would not do anything to improve our balance of payments position, but I suggest it would be of tremendous importance and assistance to the hoteliers throughout the country who have undoubtedly very lean periods in the course of a year. The Minister suggests that the peak period for holidays here is July and August, and if we could induce our own people to take their vacation in June or September, we would be doing quite a lot for the owners of hotels, guest houses and ordinary boarding houses.  It would enable these people to effect the improvements which are so badly needed to our hotels.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has come to the House asking for more money for the development of our tourist resorts.  I know some resorts which have been developed in recent years and which are, as a result, most attractive. However, it does not seem that the grants available for such development have been taken up in any big way.  I can remember a complaint in this House two or three years ago that the local authorities did not avail of grants for the development of tourist resorts.  It is desirable they should be encouraged by both Bord Fáilte and the Minister to do so.  I know how difficult it is to negotiate the sale of land and to make other arrangements necessary before embarking on any development work of that kind, but I expect that as time goes on, the idea of this type of development will become more feasible in many of our seaside resorts.  In conclusion, I would emphasise that we do not oppose this Supplementary Estimate; on the contrary, we welcome <Col N="904" /> it.  May I again ask that the Minister give the public some idea as to how he and Bord Fáilte estimate the income from tourism?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cupla focal a rá ar an Meastachán seo. Any money we spend on tourism is well spent.  Some years back, people looked in a rather sceptical way at tourism, at the time of the foundation of An Tóstal, and more or less predicted that it would be useless, but the years have proved tourism to be something which is definitely useful in helping our economy.</P>
      <P>There is a vast potential pool of tourists among our exiles abroad. There are many areas in the country where the old homesteads have fallen into decay, but the people who left them are living to-day in foreign lands, particularly in Australia and America. I feel quite sure that if the advances which we have made here and the development that has taken place were brought home to those people&mdash;the excellent hotel accommodation, the fine roads and the sunny seaside resorts &mdash;there would be a great influx here of such tourists, our own kith and kin. Perhaps there is not sufficient publicity and those people are unaware of the excellent amenities and facilities we have here.  Anything and everything that can be done to bring these facts home to these people should be undertaken, even at Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I would not be inclined to suggest that we should fall over each other in trying to cater for the foreign tourist.  We should not, for instance, wipe out some of our landscape or our individual way of life, which is, after all, the outstanding attraction for any tourist.  The Irish language and the signs put up in that language are some of the things which foreign tourists value most.  They like to see something different, something they will remember later on.  Accordingly, I suggest that in all guest houses and hotels, there should be available ample supplies of greeting cards printed in Irish, as well as a supply of craft products&mdash;mementoes which they can take home and enjoy during the winter months.  I would insist on our inscribing <Col N="905" /> them with the &ldquo;Déanta in Éirinn&rdquo; sign.</P>
    <P>More co-operation is necessary, too, between the Twenty-Six and the Six Countries.  There should be much freer travel across the Border so that all citizens of this island can enjoy unhampered holidays throughout the length and breadth of the country.  One complaint I would stress is the multiplicity of signs along roadsides put up by local development committees.  In many cases, these are objectionable, particularly since, instead of helping the motorist, they tend to distract his attention from the road.  That is something which should be controlled by a central body.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of our ancient historical monuments are not signposted. The archaeologist or the tourist with a flair for that type of thing very often passes along the country road without knowing anything about these places and monuments.  A fund of information should be built up.  Those in charge of these monuments of historic interest, in co-operation with the local authority, should see that, as far as possible, they are properly signposted so that the tourist can visit them.  It is very important that if Bord Fáilte know about organised groups coming here from abroad, they should arrange, before the visitors arrive, to supply them with up-to-date brochures giving information on matters of historic interest. That would make their tours more interesting.</P>
    <P>People who promote tours abroad for the All-Ireland Finals and other occasions and people who live in foreign countries should be given every encouragement to continue with that very praiseworthy effort.  The more people we can get here, concentrating especially on our own kith and kin, the better it is, not only for our country but also for tourism.  People who come here from abroad will thus be able to see for themselves the advances we have made in this country since we attained our freedom.</P>

      <P>Extra money is being voted for three purposes, including Cork Airport and holiday accommodation. I suppose the position is that, having <Col N="906" /> decided to put the airport in Cork&mdash; and the decision was necessary&mdash;we must face the fact that there will be additional expenditure.  There is not very much I wish to say on this aspect except to wish the Airport project well.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a word on the question of hotel accommodation.  The Minister mentioned two ways of helping hoteliers to provide extra bedrooms. One way is the funding of loans got from some agency such as the Industrial Credit Company or the banks, paying the interest; the other is the free cash grant.  I have been always attracted by this business of funding loans, paying the interest charge on loans when large capital expenditures are necessary.  If a person has a good balance sheet and can get the accommodation, as he surely will if he shows profits, then the Government can do even better by funding these loans instead of giving cash grants.  I think the five year period mentioned by the Minister is too short.  If the interest were paid over a longer period, say, 16 years, we might get an even greater capital investment, without having to produce from the capital side of our Budget moneys directly for the job ourselves. I am very much attracted by this idea of interest and interest funding.  I think it is a good departure.</P>
      <P>Cash grants are also very good.  One is quite restricted in what one can do when confined to the amount of money the Minister can get from his Cabinet.  He has to get a Cabinet decision so that the money will be expended in the financial year.  It would be much easier to get a sum that would fund loans and spend money that way than to give cash grants.  It means that some other outside financial institutions have also got their finger in the pie.  It means that they will put the hard analytical eye on the ordinary financing of the project and I think the idea of funding interest is a better one than free grants.  That is not to say that there should not be free grants but the other method is the better method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we provide bedrooms, as the Minister says we should, to the extent <Col N="907" /> of 3,000 or 4,000 extra by the end of the year, we have got to fill them on the maximum number of nights per year.  There is the big holiday period of An Tóstal earlier in the year and there are group holidays and sporting holidays.  We must face the fact that An Tóstal was a failure.  That means that, when we decide to encourage people to come here at any time other than July and August, we have got to do it pretty carefully.  We have to realise that there are things which will not succeed and things which will succeed, that there are things which are quite limited and things which are not.</P>
    <P>The failure of An Tóstal points to the fact that in a general way all over the country, the creation of small sporting events and the institution of cultural activities at that time of the year did not do the trick.  I believe that in a rather restricted way, there is more of an opportunity to fill hotel beds by sporting holidays at times of the year when otherwise they might be empty than by any other method.</P>
    <P>Hunting here is very popular, as we have seen, with American and English people.  It would be even more popular still if we could provide some subvention in relation to horses for hire. We could then get people over here who want to hunt and who will pay generously for the privilege.  It appears that Ireland is still the best place in which to get that sort of activity.</P>
    <P>We have unlimited opportunities of attracting people here to fish.  The House is well aware of what happened as a result of the activities of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  Coarse fishing has filled the small hotels and guest houses in the county which the Minister and the Leader of the Opposition represent.  It was the Leader of the Opposition who instituted the Inland Fisheries Trust.  While we ourselves would not go out to fish for pike in one of these lakes, there are literally thousands of industrial workers in England who want to do that and pay for the privilege.</P>

      <P>There is an opportunity there.  I heard a lot of people make the case that the same holds good for shooting.  That is not so.  Even if you were in Kerry, where there is a large snipe population, a relatively small number of men with guns shooting an area for a week could wipe out the sport.  That is one matter which is restricted.  It might appear to somebody who was not involved in the matter that it is not restricted.  It does not hold out the same opportunity as fishing as a means of attracting people in months other than July and August.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned extra money for amenities at seaside resorts. I know of one such amenity, a swimming pool at Blackrock, County Louth.  Through the good offices of Bord Fáilte and a grant from the Department of Local Government, this pool is being built with very little recourse to the county rates.  This is a resort where the tide goes out about three miles.  All one had was a place in which children could paddle and one had to walk several hundred yards before one could swim.  The building of a swimming pool there is a very sound way of improving the tourist potential of the area.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that amendments Nos. 1 and 2, in the name of Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, have been adjudged out of order as well as amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Colley.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section I stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We think it an extraordinary thing in a Bill of this nature that we have no definition of legal aid.  Any practitioner knows that grave difficulties may arise as to what it would be proper to allow as necessary legal aid.  It may be that some civil servant will decide that proofs which a solicitor considers necessary are not such as should be paid for out of this fund.  As no doubt the Minister is aware, a rule exists whereby the Taxing Master cannot lightly interfere with a direction to a solicitor to produce certain things or with the exercise by a solicitor of his professional discretion.  Therefore we feel that to leave &ldquo;legal aid&rdquo; in this Bill without an explanation as to what it covers or without making it quite clear that it covers proceedings as well as documents, copies of documents, expert opinions and of providing viaticum of witnesses and other necessary costs, is to create the possibility that some person ruling as to what is properly legal aid might decide that it should be confined exclusively to the provision of professional fees.  That would defeat the whole purpose, surely, of a legal aid measure.  Indeed, at times the fees and the costs which arise by reason of producing certain proofs may be far in excess of the costs of a solicitor.  It may well be necessary in some cases to bring witnesses from abroad to establish a person's innocence and to establish a person's alibi.  Not to make it clear that such an expense is legitimate legal aid may, we believe, lead to an unworkable Bill, if the necessary assistance which <Col N="910" /> the circumstances of the case may require is not provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to urge the Minister to consider this in the spirit of the amendment which has been ruled out of order, that is, on the lines urged by Deputy Ryan that there should be some broader&mdash;I was going to say some broader definition of legal aid in the section but in fact there is no definition at all.  I should imagine it is the intention of the Minister's Department that the matters referred to in this amendment, such as documents, copies of documents, transcripts of evidence and things of that sort which might be necessary in connection with a poor person's defence and who is being granted a free legal certificate, will be made available and provided for in whatever scale of charges or costs will be fixed under the Act.</P>
      <P>If I am correct in that, I suggest to the Minister that between now and the next Stage, he might consider the feasibility of writing that into the Bill in some form, if not in the definition section, then in one of these sections relating to the certificates or to the fixing of charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputies are unnecessarily apprehensive about this matter and it seems to me that they are ignoring Section 7. Section 7 provides that</P>
      <P>Where a legal aid (District Court) certificate or a legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate has been granted in respect of a person, the expenses properly incurred in preparing and conducting the defence to which the certificate relates shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that that is a fairly clear and specific statutory direction.  &ldquo;The expenses properly incurred in preparing and conducting the defence&rdquo; are the words used.  I feel that is as far as the Bill should go.  I do not think it is desirable to spell out exactly what is involved or what would be involved or what is or is not to be covered.  The regulations which will be made under <Col N="911" /> the Bill will deal with all the details. I have no reason to think that we will not be able to prescribe satisfactorily in those regulations what will be fair and reasonable.  The Northern Ireland provisions are there for us as a headline. They seem to deal with the matter in a very reasonable way and I am quite certain we shall be able to do so as well.</P>
    <P>Time and experience may show us that these regulations require to be altered.  They may have to be restricted or they may have to be enlarged. We can amend our regulations regularly to cater for any requirements which experience indicates to be necessary. It would be a different matter if we had to come back here to the House to amend the Act on every occasion.  I think the way we are approaching it is the right way.  Section 7 sets out the plan and in accordance with that, the regulations will be framed.</P>

No indication is given as to what would be proper for the Court to take into consideration in measuring the gravity of the charge or exceptional circumstances. It is possible that where a charge is not of a nature involving great moral turpitude a prison sentence may be modified.  We wonder whether in all cases where imprisonment is possible the court would not consider that it would be an exceptional circumstance or a grave charge and that it would be proper for the court to grant a legal aid certificate all other conditions being fulfilled.  So long as the personal liberty of the subject is involved we believe that is a case where a legal aid certificate should be given and it is a pity that is not being provided for in Section 2.</P>

      <P>Or in exceptional circumstances.  The wording of the section should be studied carefully. It says if it appears to the District Court that &ldquo;by reason of the gravity of the charge or of exceptional circumstances it is essential in the interests of justice&rdquo;.  The paramount thing there is that it must be essential in the interests of justice.  We feel we are absolutely right, at this stage in any event, in requiring that it should be essential in the interests of justice a legal aid certificate should be granted.  Then we give an indication to the court of the circumstances in which the danger of a miscarriage of justice could arise&mdash;either because the charges were very grave or because there were exceptional circumstances involved.  I regard the wording as entirely appropriate and I think it exactly fits the situation as we envisage it.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated to the House that I feel these words are necessary to give an indication to the court of the type of case we want to cater for.  I have said here quite openly on the Second Stage of this Bill that this is a restricted scheme&mdash;I am fully aware of the limitations&mdash;and I went on to explain to <Col N="914" /> the House&mdash;and I think the House has accepted my reasoning&mdash;that at this stage the prudent and sensible thing for us to do is to bring in a restricted scheme, see how it works and, in the light of our experience, extend and amend it in any way we possibly can.  For that reason we are beginning with the most serious cases where a miscarriage of justice is most likely to occur and restricting the Bill to those cases as a preliminary step. When we see how we get on we shall probably be able to enlarge it.</P>

      <P>The Minister need not advertise that it is a restricted scheme; that is perfectly well understood; but why restrict it even more narrowly than restricting it to criminal matters?  If the phrase is left that, first of all, the person has no means and, secondly, that it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal aid, why limit the interests of justice on either of two grounds, the gravity of the offence or exceptional circumstances? What is the necessity for the phrase &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;? &ldquo;The interests of justice&rdquo; would cover everything.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (c), lines 14 to 16, to delete &ldquo;(including the nature of such defence (if any) as may have been or is proposed to be set up)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I raised this point on Second Reading because it does seem to me that under the provisions of this section, it may be necessary for a person seeking the benefit of a free legal aid certificate to disclose his defence and the nature of his defence.</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say on the Second Reading that this was not so but is Section 3, subsection (2) (c) it is provided that a legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate shall be granted in respect of a person returned for trial for an indictable offence if&mdash;</P>
      <P>... it appears to the District Court or the judge of the court before which the person is to be tried (as the case may be) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the nature of such defence (if any) as may have been or is proposed to be set up), it is essential in the interests of justice that the person should have legal aid in the preparation and conduct of his defence at the trial.</P>
      <P>If it is not intended that the accused person should be put in the position of having to disclose the nature of his defence, and I understood from the Minister that that was not intended, then I would ask that these words be taken out of the subparagraph in subsection (2) of Section 3.  I cannot understand why they were ever put into the Bill and there seems to be no reason why they should be allowed to remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that in this Bill, restricted as it is, there is a welcome effort being made to provide a need, by giving free legal aid in a case where a person cannot provide legal aid for himself.  Section 2 of the Bill restricts it further than one would suppose from the Title of the Bill and it is now going to be restricted further <Col N="916" /> in that the judge or justice will be required under Section 3, if it remains unaltered, to take into account in advance the nature of the defence that will be raised by the accused person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that what I said on the Second Reading is correct.  We did not ever intend that the accused person would have to disclose his defence.  If Deputies will look at amendment No. 9 they will see that we are doing something about that. The words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; are crucial and they clearly indicate that the defence need not be disclosed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone into this very carefully with the Parliamentary Draftsman.  I have asked for absolute assurance that these words give us what we want, that the judge will be able, taking the nature of the defence as a circumstance, to give a person free legal aid.  These are not restricting words.  They are enlarging words.  They are intended to cover the situation where the person either does not apply for or is refused legal aid at the beginning.  Subsequently, when the defence is disclosed, the judge, having regard to the nature of that defence, on reflection may say that this is obviously a case for legal aid. He would be enabled by virtue of these words to take that circumstance into account and grant legal aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have completely different approaches to this matter.  The Minister feels it would be a merit to enable the judge or justice to take the nature of the defence into account in making up his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach is the opposite one to that.  I think it would be a better and fairer Bill if the Minister would provide that the judge or justice may not have regard <Col N="917" /> to the defence or the nature of the defence.  I do not think that anyone applying for free legal aid should be prejudiced in any way by saying what is the defence he wishes to make to the charge.  The Bill can have only a prejudicial effect as it is worded at the moment and my view is that it cannot have a beneficial effect from the point of view of the applicant.  I would prefer to see the Bill precluding the judge from having regard to the nature of the defence.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is correct in regard to the phrase &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the nature of such defence (if any)&rdquo;, it is not necessary to emphasise that by including the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; in brackets.  They could be omitted and it does not weaken the Bill in any way.  All the Minister is doing is underscoring the fact that they should have regard to the nature of the defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that at all and I think it is a complete misinterpretation of the section.  There can be no circumstances in which these words would be prejudicial to the defence.  The effect and object of the Bill is that the certificate can only be given because of the gravity of the charge or of the surrounding circumstances. At the outset of the case it might not appear to the judge that the charge was sufficiently grave or that there were exceptional circumstances but when the defence is disclosed the court might say that this was a more complicated and serious matter and that there were exceptional circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no question of that.  The only implication in the Section is that as the defence comes to be disclosed it may reveal some striking and unusual circumstances which will bring the case within the ambit of our legal aid provisions whereas it appeared to the District Justice, before disclosure of the evidence, that it was not within it.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the way this matter was approached in England.  It bears out my argument.  The provision I have mentioned has the same phraseology as the corresponding section of the Poor Prisoners Defence Act, 1930, in Britain, Section 1 (3) <i>(b).</i> This is a quotation from the <i>Justice of the Peace</i> (1943) which appears on page 25 of the Rushcliffe Committee's Report which formed the basis of the comprehensive legal aid and advice scheme in civil cases established by the 1949 Act in Britain.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Under the repealed Act of 1903, it was undoubtedly necessary that a defence should have been disclosed before legal aid could be granted; the Act of 1930, however, required the certifying authority to take into consideration the defence, if any, thus clearly implying that the disclosure of the defence is not now a condition precedent.</P>
      <P>The Committee made no comment on this quotation, from which it may be assumed that it is a correct statement of the position.  In other words, the <i>Justice of the Peace</i> and the Rushcliffe Committee both felt quite specifically and clearly that the phraseology did not require any disclosure of defence as a condition precedent.</P>

If that was <Col N="921" /> not looking into the nature of the defence, I do not know what words mean.  I know that that is coming out: I am speaking about the minds of the people who provided that.  I accept that it is not a condition precedent. Supposing we leave out the whole phrase in brackets, then consider the position.  It is a decision by a judicial person that, having regard to all the circumstances, it is essential in the interests of justice that free legal aid should be supplied.

      <P>It would allow it. Certainly it is covered by the phrase &ldquo;all the circumstances&rdquo;.  There was a celebrated trial for murder in England some years ago.  A book written about it is now the subject matter of a legal action in the English courts.  The person appearing for the Crown writes in his book that he went down to deal with this case feeling it was hardly worth while, the case being so open and closed.</P>
      <P>What the Crown had was a statement from the prisoner confessing that he killed a woman in an inn.  He had been picked up for some other purposes.  Then he said to the police who took him up first that his conscience was troubled, that he had not slept a night since the night of the John Barleycorn Inn.  He gave a very substantial account of what happened. The murder occurred during the war. A black-out curtain had been torn off the window and draped over the body of the dead woman.  He told the police how he had done all this.  First of all, he made a rather incoherent statement to them.  They got it in writing and he signed the confession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, the Crown Prosecutor felt this was a walk-over.  Counsel appearing against him simply gave a warning that the case was about to start and said, in effect: &ldquo;I shall not put any reliance on that man's statement.&rdquo;<Col N="922" /> As the case proceeded no cross-examination phrase was required to disclose what the defence was.  It was a cast-iron alibi, that the man had been in an underground shelter in London at the time when the murder was committed, somewhere down about Plymouth, I think.  Five reputable people said they were talking to him in the underground air-raid shelter.  That defence was flashed on the prosecution and the result was that at the first trial there was disagreement. When the second trial came on, the prosecution by that time knew of this alibi but had no way of countering it but, even then, a new thing was sprung on them when the defence opened by calling the distinguished British pathologist, Sir Bernard Spilsbury, to show that a man with a deformed hand could not possibly have strangled this woman.</P>
    <P>There were two surprise defences. The first was the complete surprise of the alibi of the air-raid shelter and the second was the deformed hand, buttressed up by Sir Bernard Spilsbury's evidence.  The result was that the man was acquitted.  In that case if the man were applying for free legal aid, where was the point reached when he could ask for a free legal aid certificate if he had not got aid before the case came on?</P>

I cannot understand the hesitation to accept a reasonable amendment to cut out unnecessary words.  &ldquo;The circumstances of the case&rdquo; would certainly cover it all particularly if it is going to be interpreted either by a district justice or, more likely, a judge.  As far as I can see the procedure contemplated is that the person will be sent forward for trial on indictment without free legal aid and when he comes to the court of trial, at some point his defence is disclosed and the court may then say: &ldquo;This is a matter that will require a good deal of controversy. We will now stop the trial and give you free legal aid.&rdquo;  Up to that point, <Col N="923" /> the man has been carrying on the case on his own.  The thing is nonsensical.</P>

      <P>At the outset of the case, the section stipulates that the judge will take all the circumstances into account.  The Deputies opposite are arguing that a defendant should not have to disclose his defence to get legal aid.  We are all agreed on that. At the outset of the case, therefore, if we do not want to have a situation where the defendant would have to disclose his case in order to get legal aid, we must exclude &ldquo;the nature of the defence&rdquo; from &ldquo;all the circumstances&rdquo;.  Therefore, a judge in approaching the matter, taking all the circumstances into account, would not ask what the nature of the defence was, if it had not been disclosed, and he would decide at that early stage, without regard to a possible defence, either to give or not to give the certificate. If he decides not to give it and if, as the case proceeds and the nature of the defence indicates that there is need for it because of the particular circumstances of the case, then he can give it.  I think that is a sensible and logical provision.  There is another aspect of it.  If, at the outset, the defendant does disclose the nature of the defence it is only reasonable that the judge should be entitled to take the nature of the defence into account as one of the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>And we are spelling that out in the section.  First, if it has been voluntarily disclosed, put down in black and white, the judge is entitled to use the nature of the defence as one of the circumstances.  That is one of the reasons why that provision is there. The second is that the defence may be disclosed later on.  At the outset all the circumstances surrounding the case, excluding the nature of the defence, would not indicate that free legal aid was necessary, when the judge would take into account the particular type of defence that emerged later, then legal aid might become justified.  The wording here, as in Britain, as far as <Col N="925" /> I can see, clearly indicates what we have in mind.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not gone as far as relying on the Encyclopaedia Britannica but has relied on the British to help to clarify this.  I am not sure that the Minister has succeeded in clearing up the confusion that may have been caused. It seems to me there are a number of things to be taken into account.  My personal preference would be that unless the accused sought to have it taken into account, the Bench would not be entitled to take into account the nature of the defence in adjudicating on an application.  The section as it was originally drafted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy just on that point?  For example, suppose the defence in the case of a charge of larceny is an abstruse, technical defence, would that not be a circumstance which would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  I am talking at the moment about the Bill as it was originally drafted.  The Minister in a later amendment is suggesting taking out the words &ldquo;or is proposed to be&rdquo;. As originally drafted, I have not the slightest doubt that the justice or judge to whom application for a free legal aid certificate is made could say to the applicant: &ldquo;I am not going to consider this application unless you tell me what your defence is going to be.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may disagree with me in words but he has agreed with me, at least in his actions, because he is trying to remove that danger in amendment No. 9, I think, by taking out those words.  Now we are left in the position, if we regard those words as out of the section for the moment, where we are saying to the Bench: &ldquo;You may take into account all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;  That means something or it does not.  If it means &ldquo;all the circumstances of the case&rdquo; it <Col N="926" /> means that the Bench is entitled to take into account any defence which may have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed that if the defence has been disclosed it should be a ground which would be taken into account.  We are all agreed also that it should not be necessary to disclose the nature of the defence in order to get free legal aid. This is the formula by which we achieve that.  We say: &ldquo;including the nature of such defence (if any) as may have been...&rdquo;  That makes it perfectly clear that you are excluding a case where a defence has not been set up at that stage&mdash;that is the meaning of the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo;&mdash;and it also makes it clear that if it has been set up it can be taken into account. That is the machinery to give us that alternative.</P>

      <P>The Minister need not argue any more by way of interruption. If that is his contention I cannot accept it.  He says the phrase, &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances of the case&rdquo; would not allow any judge of the trial to take into consideration the nature of the defence. Surely it does.  However, the whole thing gets &ldquo;curiouser and curiouser&rdquo; as we go on.  When is the defence to be disclosed?  I am thinking of a rather notorious case that has just finished. It did not have anything to do with murder, but it had to do with embezzlement or some way of getting money into a person's hands that did not belong to him.  Three or four points emerged from that case eventually. One was whether there was any element of conspiracy, and all the conspiracy charges were ruled out by our court.  The secondary question was whether there could be conversion by an individual of moneys that had been received by a company of which he was one person.  There were a variety of technical defences.  Of course, to lay the ground for that defence, counsel had to cross-examine State witnesses on various points.</P>
      <P>Take the case of a man faced with charges of that type, who has not got a certificate from a district justice and has been sent for trial before the Central Criminal Court.  Naturally he would not know the legal procedure and he would make an ordinary statement. At that point he would be tripped up by any judge who said: &ldquo;There is a lot of evidence you did not try to counter at cross-examination.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A person may have an alibi and he would let the evidence go on because he has an alibi in the background.  When he mentions the word &ldquo;alibi&rdquo; for the first time he has not indicated it in cross-examination about identification. He has four or five witnesses to his alibi in the background and that is the stage at which the judge of the court before whom the person is to be tried&mdash;not is being tried&mdash;learns of the defence.</P>
      <P>By cutting out the phrase &ldquo;including the nature of such defence as may have been set up&rdquo; which does not add anything, that could be taken into consideration when the judge is adjudicating on all the circumstances.  It adds nothing and is certainly limiting.  It would make people believe that if they disclose their defence they have a better chance of legal aid.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that the Deputies opposite have changed their ground twice on this issue.  The first suggestion was that we were making it mandatory on the accused to disclose his defence.  That has now been abandoned.  The net effect of what Deputy McGilligan is now arguing is that these words are unnecessary because he considers the words &ldquo;all the circumstances&rdquo; are in themselves wide enough to include the nature of the defence.  That is the exact point I am trying to make.  We want to make it clear that all the circumstances may or may not include the nature of the defence.</P>

      <P>There is.  If we were to accept Deputy McGilligan's suggestion and simply leave the wording &ldquo;all the circumstances of the case&rdquo; a judge might say: &ldquo;We have to take the nature of the defence into account.  That is one of the circumstances.&rdquo;  It is my <Col N="929" /> contention that if we were to leave the words at large as Deputy McGilligan wants them left at large we would ensure that the judge would have to find out the nature of the defence and take it into account before granting legal aid.</P>

We are making it clear that if the defence is disclosed it can be taken into account as one of the circumstances, and if it is not disclosed it is not to be asked for. As the case proceeds and the defence is disclosed the judge, if he thinks it desirable, can take it into account as one of the circumstances.  The whole idea of the wording is to achieve that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is <Col N="940" /> aware that a large number of housing applicants for council cottages in County Dublin are living in rooms in council houses; and that they have been refused new houses because they will not qualify for the two-thirds subsidy; and, if so, if he will take steps to restore the subsidy to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously stated in reply to Questions on this subject that housing authorities are not precluded from rehousing families who are sub-tenants of local authority dwellings.  The higher rate of subsidy is made available specifically in association with the statutory operation of a housing authority such as the demolition, closure or repair of unfit dwellings, the relief of over-crowding where action is taken by the authority to prevent a recurrence of overcrowding, and also in respect of rehousing on medical or compassionate grounds.  I have also stated that to enable me to consider whether any change in the present subsidy structure is justified or is desirable, housing authorities should complete the detailed survey of unfit housing which I requested some 18 months ago and which, indeed, housing authorities should carry out without any formal request from me.  In the meantime, it is open to housing authorities, including Dublin county council, to avail themselves of the normal rate of subsidy towards rehousing persons of the category to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that where there is over-crowding in a county council house, the Minister is prepared to pay the two-thirds subsidy? In one case in County Dublin we have seven people living in a room measuring 9 ft. by 10 ft.  They were not housed six months ago because they were not eligible for the subsidy. Are we to take it the subsidy will be paid in cases of that kind in the future?</P>

      <P>It means, therefore, that any person who occupies a local authority house cannot be re-housed in a new local authority house or, if he is re-housed, the two-thirds subsidy will not apply?  That is the present position and there is no change in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider specifically the position in County Dublin.  Ours is a highly industrialised area and the position has got out of control.  It is almost impossible for the local authority to allot houses because of the two-thirds subsidy rule.  In view of the very bad circumstances existing in County Dublin, would the Minister consider restoring the two-thirds subsidy in the near future?  I do not think any other county is in such a bad position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to disabuse the mind of the Deputy or the minds of any other Deputies who might think likewise.  There is no question of restoring anything because nothing has been taken away.  In regard to the question of a change I would say, as I have said repeatedly before, that this depends upon the result of the survey of unfit houses, which for the last 18 months I have been asking local authorities to complete.  Not until that is done will I be in a position to consider whether or not a change is necessary or desirable.  If they would get on with their surveys we would be able to consider the matter more quickly and it would be better than talking about it here.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Local Government if in view of the cost and complexity of road-making and repair machinery now available and of the difficulty which the poorer counties <Col N="958" /> experience in purchasing such equipment he will consider rationalising road-making and repair procedure by the establishment of a national road-making authority, financed centrally, which would, by means of regional groups, ensure that in both the construction and maintenance of main and county roads such machinery would be freely available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be serious organisational and administrative difficulties in the way of a central road authority on the lines suggested and I am not satisfied that it would either benefit the national economy or meet with the approval of local interests.  As regards the considerations advanced by the Deputies in support of such an authority, there is no indication that the costs involved in securing the use of necessary road machinery is imposing an undue strain on local resources.  In general, machinery costs are charged to the works on which the machines are engaged and in this way over half the cost of all road machinery is met out of the Road Fund.  As regards items of modern road plant which are particularly complex and costly and which may be needed only periodically, road authorities may hire such machines and charge the costs to grant in appropriate cases.</P>

      <P>In regard to the social assistance services, namely, non-contributory old age pensions, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions and children's allowances, some progress has been made towards codification of the law, but I am not in a position to say when the implementing legislation will be ready for introduction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of insurance contributions were increased to their present level by the social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960 under which a new benefit, old age (contributory) pension, was introduced and existing benefits improved.  When that measure was under consideration in the Dáil <Col N="962" /> it was pointed out that the general principle followed in deciding on the increases in rates of contribution was that each rate should bear its due share of the cost of the new benefit and of the improvements in existing benefits to which it gave title.  Following that principle the ordinary rate of employment contribution for a man or woman was increased by 3/6d. a week.  This increase in the contribution applied to a male domestic, who is insured for all benefits, while the increase for a female domestic, who is insured for all benefits other than unemployment benefit, was 3/3d. a week.</P>
      <P>It will be seen that the increase in contribution in the case of a male domestic worker was the same as in the case of the ordinary employed contributor and that the increase in the case of a female domestic worker was smaller because allowance was made for the fact that the contribution in this instance does not give title to unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I do not propose to change the rates of contribution for domestic workers.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider introducing some system to ensure that domestic workers will be eligible ?  The Minister must be aware &mdash;I am in any case&mdash;that many domestics who become unemployed leave this country because there is no allowance available for them on which to exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They refuse to be employed because the wages offered by certain people are insufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, that is the reason why they have not so far been insured for unemployment benefit. It was considered that was a risk which did not exist in regard to that particular class of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to concern himself about the type of employment. It is not very highly paid employment.  There are many girls in <Col N="963" /> this country who will go into domestic service, although it is the lowest paid employment in the land.  The Minister should concern himself with the fact that many of them, when they become unemployed for a period, go to Great Britain because they cannot get unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my Department is concerned, the only such proposals contemplated relate to the amendment of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  These proposals, which represent a further stage in the long-term process of comprehensive revision of the fishery laws, include the following aspects which may be regarded as coming within the description of law reform, viz. a general revision of penalties for fishery offences, including substantial increase in those relating to poisoning and pollution; revision of the procedure for applying conservation measures; revision of the procedure for election to Boards of Conservators; and extension of certain powers of search, seizure and forfeiture in relation to fishery offences.</P>
      <P>It is hoped to introduce this amending legislation within the present session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is at present dealing with 122 offers of land for State Forestry purposes in Laois, involving a total area of 6,767 acres. Possession is about to be taken of two areas totalling 71 acres.  Price agreement has been reached in 18 cases with <Col N="976" /> a total area of 552 acres and title to these areas is in course of clearance. Negotiations for the purchase of 30 other areas totalling 1,602 acres are in progress and the remaining cases are at the preliminary stages of investigation. As regards general State Forestry development in Laois, the position is that plantations totalling 17,000 acres had been established at the Laois Forests up to the end of 1960-61.  In the current season additional areas totalling 600 acres are being planted. The rate of expansion in future years will be determined by the rate at which new areas can be acquired for development but I can assure the Deputy that all possible steps will be taken to speed up the intake of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if in view of the fact that the decision to transmit from the Mount Leinster television transmitter on Channel F will result in total obliteration of the U.T.V., Channel 9, programme over a large area of Dublin and the Midlands, and that the decision to transmit from the Galway transmitter on Channel A will very seriously interfere with reception on Channel 1 from Belfast over a large area of Dublin and the Midlands resulting in serious depreciation of the usefulness of existing TV sets worth over £1,000,000, he will make alternative arrangements, particularly in view of the large number of alternative frequencies available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of separate channels available for television stations operating in the frequency bands in general use for television purposes is quite small and under the Stockholm Agreement many television stations in the European area share each channel.  Sharing is possible because the service area of any television <Col N="984" /> stations is limited and administrations accept that it is not practicable to prevent interference from other stations in fringe areas of reception. Dublin and the midlands are, of course, well outside the service areas of the transmitters in the Six Counties, which are operating on Channels 9 and 1 and the signal strength of these transmitters is very much below the minimum on which the degrees of protection obtaining under the Stockholm Agreement were based.</P>
      <P>The problem is how to ensure that no Telefís Éireann transmitter will cause serious interference to, or will suffer serious interference from, any other transmitter situated in any part of Ireland or outside Ireland in the respective service areas of the transmitters.</P>
      <P>My Department is in communication with the British Post Office on the question of making some minor frequency adjustments with a view to minimising mutual interference between the Mount Leinster station on Channel F and the stations in Great Britain and the Six Counties which are operating on Channel 9.  It will, however, probably not be possible to avoid interference with the U.T.V. transmissions in fringe areas of reception.</P>
      <P>My Department has also consulted the other Administrations concerned regarding a change from Channel A to Channel B in the frequency allocated to Gort Station under the Stockholm Agreement and if this change is approved the station should not interfere with reception from the B.B.C. transmissions on Channel 1.  An announcement in the matter will be made in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs considers it more important not to interfere with foreign users of television than to meet the requirements of Irish viewers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not ask me that question in the beginning. He should remember that broadcasting is not a free for all and that the frequencies are allocated by agreement between the administrations concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that we were originally allocated 20 different frequencies?  We are on a fringe area and should not interfere with other frequencies but some officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have decided, for their own narrow purposes, to use the same frequencies as the Belfast station and so cut it out.  Telefís Éireann would not exist today if thousands of people had not been using the U.T.V. and B.B.C. stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs how television viewers in the North Cork area <Col N="986" /> who receive the Kippure 405 line transmissions at present will be affected when transmissions commence from Mullaghanish on 625 lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>When transmissions commence from Mullaghanish on 625 lines, viewers in the North Cork area who receive the Kippure 405 line transmissions at present will not be able to receive the Mullaghanish transmitter, unless they have their receivers adjusted for the reception of the 625 line standard transmissions. Provision for conversion has been made by manufactures in some sets of recent design but many receivers could not economically be converted.</P>
      <P>When the Mullaghanish transmitter comes into operation, it is probable that the reception of Kippure in North Cork will be adversely affected, due to radiation from the local transmitter.</P>
      <P>Viewers in this area are recommended not to purchase television sets unless they are suitable for the 625 line standard.  Should they decide to buy receivers for the 405 line standard they should consult a radio dealer and ensure that the sets can be converted economically to the 625 line standard in order to receive the local station.</P>
      <P>Prospective viewers should bear in mind that there are practical limits to what can be done to reduce electrical interferfence and viewers receiving weak signals from Kippure will, in general, be much more subject to interference from local electrical equipment than those who tune their sets to the Mullaghanish transmitter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread dissatisfaction in many parts of the country owing to the extremely protracted delay in <Col N="991" /> installing telephones?  What good reason can there be for withholding telephones from people who are ready and willing to pay for them and to contribute to the revenue of the telephone service by using a telephone?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the anxiety in the country in regard to delay in providing connection.  I am also aware that the telephone system is just about capable of carrying the amount of traffic on it at the moment.  I have directed the Engineering Branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to bend their energies towards the task of improving the trunk network system so that we will be in a position to give an efficient service to our present telephone subscribers and to the people awaiting connection.  At the same time, we hope to continue to take in new subscribers to the system as fast as we possibly can in the circumstances.  The whole programme must be related to the limitation of capital imposed upon the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, if there is an opportunity of using capital which will finance itself and if the telephone service is earning a substantial profit, as it is, it is folly not to anticipate the expanding demand and to allow this build-up of arrears to occur year after year?  When will the Post Office anticipate demand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am doing.  I am anticipating the demand that is coming by providing a system which will give telephone subscribers an efficient service.  It would be folly to continue at an accelerated pace taking in new subscribers and not be in a position to give them the service they thought they would get when they got the telephone.</P>

      <P>Clonmel is not included in the two- to three-year programme at present being carried out. In 1957, they tried to solve the difficulty. New switchboard equipment was put into Clonmel.  The use of that switchboard equipment had to be taken into consideration also.  Because of the decisions that were taken then, and because of the reduction in capital, the exchanges at Clonmel, Kilkenny, Wexford, Carlow and Tralee have had to be postponed until after the two- or three-years' programme is completed.</P>

When this report is received and, if it indicates that the site is suitable, the necessary steps towards the sanctioning of a grant will be taken.</P>

      <P>I assume that the schools to which the Deputy refers are the Finglas East girls' and infants' national schools and the Finglas Village boys', girls' and infants' schools.

      <P>Sanction was given on 2nd December, 1961, to the County Laois Vocational Education Committee for the purchase of a site for the proposed new school at Mountmellick.  I understand that the legal formalities in connection with the purchase are being attended to by the Committee's solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of expediting the arrangements for the erection of the new school is one, in the first instance, for the Committee concerned.  As the Deputy is aware, the Committee decided in February, 1961, that projects for the extension of the existing schools at Portlaoise and Portarlington, <Col N="1002" /> and for the provision of new school buildings at Abbeyleix and at Newtown, would take precedence over the Mountmellick school project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention had been drawn to reports appearing in the press that members of the Garda Síochána were investigating the organisation of the National Farmers' Association, and taking the names of officers and members of that organisation; whether such activity on the part of the Garda Síochána is in fact taking place; and, if so, what are the reasons for such a procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Justice whether, as reported, police have raided the homes of members of the N.F.A. to find out the names of the officers and members of the Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions 113 and 114 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen no press report suggesting that there has been anything that could be described as a &ldquo;raid&rdquo; on the homes of members of the National <Col N="1006" /> Farmers' Association and nothing of that kind has taken place.</P>
    <P>I understand that, in one area, officers of the Association were asked by the Garda Síochána about the local membership and that that information was unhesitatingly given.  Apart from that, members of the Gardaí have been present at meetings recently held under the auspices of the Association, but that is a normal and indeed routine duty of the Garda Síochána wherever a public meeting of any kind is being held.</P>
    <P>As members of the House are aware, a number of meetings have been held under NFA auspices in various parts of the country in recent weeks.  As I need hardly say, the Association is perfectly entitled to hold these meetings and their right to hold them, without interference by the Garda Síochána, has not been and will not be questioned, subject to the usual requirements about the maintenance of law and order.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, however, some members of the Association have, in connection with these meetings permitted themselves to make threats that resort would be had to illegal actions, including violence if necessary, if the objectives of the Association are not secured.  According to press reports these threats were made on more than one occasion and by more than one person, and, moreover, by persons holding office in the Association.  I must mention, in particular, a reported threat against members of the County Council&mdash;the elected representatives of the people&mdash;if they did not act as the Association wished.</P>
    <P>Against this background, there should be no surprise if the Garda Síochána displayed an interest in what was said at some subsequent meetings of this kind.  Threats of violence or any incitement to violence could not possibly be tolerated as a means of securing the objectives of any organisation. That would be the road to anarchy and a Government that would permit it would be failing in their first duty to the community.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say, however, that since these threats were made, the <Col N="1007" /> leaders of the Association have left no room for doubt that the Association emphatically repudiates all such threats by their members.  I accept without hesitation that this repudiation is genuine and reflects the Association's considered policy.  This being so, there should be no further difficulties and the excellent relations which have in the past obtained at all levels between the NFA and the Garda Síochána can continue unimpaired. For my part, I am glad to have had this opportunity of explaining that any special inquiries made by the Gardaí were made in the particular circumstances that I have outlined and that there has been no intention or wish to interfere with the lawful activities of the Association or any of its branches.</P>

In practice, applications for admission by persons who claim political <Col N="1010" /> asylum are never rejected by Immigration Officers without referring the matter to my Department even when the question arises at night or otherwise outside normal office hours. The Deputy will appreciate that I am answerable for all decisions on questions submitted to my Department and that it is not the practice to disclose details of internal Departmental administration.
