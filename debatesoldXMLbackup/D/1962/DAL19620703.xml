    <P>This Resolution is necessary because of the additional duty which was imposed on tobacco on 14th June by the Imposition of Duties Order which will expire on 9th August.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution is designed to impose a duty that was mentioned in the Budget, as well as the amount mentioned in the Imposition of Duties Order, as from 9th August.  It will mean that the duty on tobacco, as imposed by the Imposition of Duties Order which came into operation on 14th June, will remain the same hence-forward. It deals with both customs and excise duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I entirely misheard the Minister, his explanation of this Financial Resolution is wrong, but I forgive him in view of the fact that he has been laid up and will not make the same remark to him as was made to me by a member of his Party when I was ill on a similar occasion. This Financial Resolution deals solely with the additional penny imposed on tobacco because it starts as and from 10th August, 1962.  It relates solely to the supplementary Budget which the Minister introduced on the last occasion we had this measure before the House.  The amalgamation to which the Minister refers is the amalgamation which will take place on the Report Stage.  We earlier had a Financial Resolution on the primary Budget and this is the Financial <Col N="1242" /> Resolution which the Minister promised on the last occasion, unless he has gone back on his promise.</P>
      <P>I would have been less critical of the Minister if he had had the good grace to withdraw what he said on the last occasion in Column 144 of Volume 196 No. 1.  On that occasion, he said that this erroneous method, this improper method of imposing this taxation on tobacco had been used before by me in relation both to beer and tobacco.  The relevant passage in the Official Report is:</P>
      <P>Special Duties were brought in under it and these included beer and tobacco as far as I remember.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: No.</P>
      <P>Dr. Ryan: I may be wrong.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: You are.</P>
      <P>The Minister has since been proved wrong by the reply given on 20th June, 1962, at Column 580.  He was referring at the time to the special import levies which had been introduced by me but which did not include beer, tobacco or spirits, the three main revenue duties.  The extraordinary thing about it will emerge in relation to the previous usage of this Order.</P>
      <P>There have been three previous occasions on which the Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, was used to deal with revenue duties&mdash;four including the one on 13th June.  The other three were all for the purpose of remitting and reducing the duties quickly.  On this occasion, the Minister used the method for the purpose of imposing an additional duty.  Since that day, it has been accepted universally that the country was deeply shocked, first, by the proof and evidence given that the Government did not know their own minds from month to month, in that within a month they had to introduce another supplementary Budget and, secondly, that when they did it, they introduced this extra taxation by Government decree rather than by the normal practice and procedure that had operated in the case of these revenue duties&mdash;by Resolution of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> I understand and accept that the Order made by the Government was effective only until 10th June.  That is immaterial.  What is material is that it is entirely wrong that the provisions of the 1932 Act should be used for revenue purposes as they were on this occasion.  The 1932 Act was introduced for the purpose of imposing protective tariffs in relation to home industries, for the purpose of ensuring that there would be a speedy method to prevent stockpiling and dumping, in anticipation of a tariff.  It was used by me for the same purpose, to provide for a reduction in imports, but here, for the first time in the past 30 years, the Minister has utilised this procedure, not for the purpose for which it was introduced into the Dáil, not for the purpose for which it has been utilised in the past 30 years but, as he has been frank and open enough to admit, to provide an easy method for the Government to raise taxation. Whether it is on a permanent or temporary basis, that is improper and something that has never been done before.</P>
    <P>As far as the Resolution itself is concerned, apart from making those comments on it, I think it would perhaps be better that the actual further discussion on the substance of the Resolution as apart from the method should be reserved until we come to discuss the new Section 5 which is being introduced by the Minister as amendment No. 2.  I am always anxious to be orderly in so far as I can and it might be repetitious if I used the same arguments on both occasions. Therefore, we will reserve our other comments in relation to the matter until then.</P>
    <P>There was also, in relation to the Financial Resolutions passed on Budget Day, a query addressed by me to the Minister on the subject of one of the forms of duty here provided.  I have some doubt about the answer.  I asked how much Cavendish and Negrohead is being manufactured in the country.  The Minister said a small amount.  Both must be manufactured in bond and I think the answer should be that there is none&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that therefore, shall I say, the Minister was chancing his arm on the last occasion. However, be that as it may, this is a fault which is very minor indeed compared with the manner in which the Minister has chosen in this supplementary Budget to utilise a procedure that was brought into this House for an entirely different purpose.  I do not think it is going too far to say that the Minister, by so doing, by introducing revenue duties of this sort in this House, has broken faith with the House and has broken faith with the arrangements that were laid before it and the implications made in 1932 and again when the Act was amended at a later stage.  The method is most undesirable.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Government were unable properly to plan their scheme of financial arrangements for the whole year, or even for a part of the year, caused a very great shaking of confidence throughout the country. The people not merely feel that it was extraordinary that having introduced, first, a Budget in relation to postage and telephone charges and then the ordinary normal Budget to which we are accustomed the Government should subsequently, within a matter of six or seven weeks, introduce another Budget.  Wherever one went in the country, either from supporters of the Minister or from opponents of the Minister, one heard the same thing said: &ldquo;When they have done this on this occasion, what can we expect them to do in the future?  The worst.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>It is proposed to make a change in the law relating to applications by aliens acquiring property in this country to have the lower rate of duty charged.  The change may involve a <Col N="1246" /> charge and therefore this Financial Resolution is necessary.  At present, if an alien buys a property with less than five acres of land, the low rate of tax applies, but there have been a few cases where property has been bought in two parts, the house and less than five acres in one part, and the remainder of the land separately.  It is the sort of practice we feel we should deal with and it is therefore provided by an amendment, which is to come later, that two Lay Commissioners will examine applications of this kind and make recommendations to the Revenue Commissioners.  They will, of course, have knowledge of transactions of the kind I mention and would in the ordinary way not recommend a mitigation of the duty; in other words, they would advise the Revenue Commissioners to charge the full duty.  I take it we will discuss the amendment when it comes along.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Resolution is designed to introduce a new procedure where aliens purchase a house with land not in excess of five acres annexed thereto.  Whatever the merits of this new procedure here envisaged are, I am quite clear in my mind that not-withstanding anything that has been said from the Government benches, a serious social problem is arising in rural Ireland connected with all these transactions in land.  I have pointed out here before that it is a generally agreed policy and that it is a good thing to induce foreign capital to come into this country to establish industrial enterprises but several countries in Europe and elsewhere have experienced the embarrassment of foreign capital being invested in the purchase of land.  It is not a problem peculiar to Ireland but it is interesting to observe that almost every other country in which that problem has arisen has taken energetic measures to control it. Take Denmark.  This problem began to cause considerable embarrassment to the Danish Government and I understand that the law in Denmark has now been amended to provide that nobody, not even a returned Danish emigrant, can purchase land in Denmark, without having first established five years residence in Denmark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> The present position in Ireland is that a variety of devices are being operated to transfer the ownership of land to non-nationals.  The argument is made that in many cases the land is more of an amenity than agricultural land in the full sense of the term.  We do not know the facts about that because there is no means of finding them out.  We have set up some rather inadequate machinery providing that where non-nationals purchase land and come within the provisions of the 25 per cent. tax referred to in this Financial Resolution, these transactions shall be recorded in the Land Commission; but the plain fact which is known to us all is that there is a great deal of land being acquired by aliens which does not come within the grip of the Commission.  All the people in the country know it to be so.</P>
    <P>An argument can be made that this competition for land from abroad is improving the price of agricultural land and that may be true but you can purchase affluence at too high a price.  Here is the danger&mdash;we want foreign capital for the promotion of industry; if promiscuous purchasing of agricultural land goes on by non-nationals, there will grow up in this country, as it has grown up in every other country where that has happened, a strong prejudice against all foreign capital.  That, in my opinion, would be a most unfortunate development.</P>
    <P>However, I want to suggest to the House in considering this Financial Resolution, which is designed specifically to exempt from the 25 per cent. purchase tax houses and amenity grounds surrounding them, that we should not make any such exemption without at the same time effectively taking measures to ascertain the real truth about the acquisition of agricultural land by foreigners and the declaration by the Government of their resolve to control that process so as to avoid any general impression arising in the country that there is a wholesale transfer of land to non-nationals.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can stop at agricultural land <i>per se</i>.  We have got to see that if coastal land, that is, properties on the seashore, come into the <Col N="1248" /> hands of non-nationals the traditional rights of people living in the vicinity will not be abrogated by the new owners.  That is not an easy thing to do for this reason&mdash;that those who have owned property, particularly property controlling access to the seashore, have in the past readily facilitated their neighbours in permitting them to cross the land to reach the seashore and sandy land adjoining the seashore for picnics and the like.</P>
    <P>That friendly relationship has existed between the neighbours without ever being positively legally defined. You now get a non-national acquiring such a piece of land and putting up notices warning all and sundry that trespass of any kind will be prevented and legal action taken against any person engaging in such trespass.  That sort of thing gives rise to acute local misunderstanding and bitter resentment amongst people who believe that strangers are acquiring rights in land to the grave detriment of the ordinary people living in the neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>I believe the appropriate method to deal with this problem is, first, to devise machinery, if necessary placing upon the legal profession an absolute obligation of notifying the Land Commission or some other appropriate authority of any transfer of land in which they engage which involves the transfer of beneficial ownership to a non-national.  If we could get that effectively done, we would at least have before us constantly a true picture of the size of this problem.  I am obliged to tell the House that in my considered judgment the true picture of this problem shows a much larger problem than the official version would have us believe.  I think it is folly for Parliament or for the Government to stick their heads in the sand and say: &ldquo;There are the official figures of the land acquired by aliens and that is the size of the problem&rdquo;, when all of us in the House know that it is not the size of the problem and that the continued growth of the process is raising, possibly not serious economic problems, but undoubtedly serious social problems in the anxiety and <i>malaise</i> that is being created throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> Having set up effective machinery truthfully to reveal where the beneficial ownership of land has passed into the hands of non-nationals, we should then consider whether certain legislation analogous to that which is being passed in Denmark is not necessary here, bearing in mind that we, of course, have certain resources at our disposal that other countries may not have.  We have in Ireland, under the Land Acts, powers to resume or compulsorily acquire any land whether it is in the hands of nationals or non-nationals if it is required for the relief of local congests or for the other purposes set out in the land code.</P>
    <P>That gives us in Ireland here a very solid basis of reassurance that this problem of the acquisition of land by aliens cannot get completely out of control but we should not allow it to reach a point where a large part of our people begin to feel that it is getting out of control because if we do the prejudice understandably generated by the investment of foreign capital in Irish land will spread to the investment of foreign capital in Irish industry, which would be a most unfortunate development.</P>
    <P>Some people may ask why is there this tendency for foreign capital to be invested in Irish land.  I think there are two reasons.  One is that the price of land in Ireland, compared to the price of land obtaining in Germany, Holland and Belgium, appears relatively low.  The second reason why foreign capital is invested here as far as I can find out is that certain residents in Germany and on the Continent are desirous of removing part of their capital from Continental Europe into what they regard as safer surroundings either in Great Britain or in Ireland.  That is a very understandable reaction but it must be brought home to everybody concerned with this business that it is producing reactions here and that they are of an extremely dangerous character which could give rise to the most unfortunate public opinion in Ireland.  It is our duty to take effective measures to prevent a thing of this kind arising rather than wait until it has developed as a major <Col N="1250" /> problem and then attempt remedial steps when the damage has been done by the excitement of a strong public feeling on the subject of the investment of foreign capital in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have very much to say on this.  I can see that Deputy Dillon is troubled about the invasion of the land and that many people are troubled in regard to the same issue.  The difficulty is to find out how to deal with it.  Deputy Dillon may have given the impression that we were easing the position here. We are not.  Actually, we are only tightening up the position because in this Resolution, the Lay Commissioners are given the power to recommend against the mitigation of duty in certain cases.  To that extent, the regulations are becoming tighter on the acquisition of property by aliens.  It also means the Land Commission will have a record of all land acquisition from now on.  If we look at the Resolution, we will see that any property which is acquired as a private residence will have to come before the Land Commission for their recommendation and they will therefore have a record of all acquisitions of property by aliens, if the Resolution, with the necessary amendment, is agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's serious attention to this fact: I submit that it does not give anything like the complete record merely to have regard to the transaction in which the alien is the principal, on the one side, and the Irish vendor is the principal, on the other.  Over and above that, transactions of that character&mdash;and there are very substantial transactions taking place, involving the transfer of very considerable areas of land through the employment of some legal device, the exact nature of which I do not understand&mdash;involve the transfer of the legal title in the land either to nominees or to trustees or to a company formed for the purpose and you get the situation where a man, recently speaking to me&mdash;a large landowner in County Meath&mdash;was able to say: &ldquo;My four neighbours on all four sides of me are now aliens.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet I doubt if any one of those <Col N="1251" /> substantial parcels of land was transferred directly to an alien in the documents of transfer&mdash;in the deeds.  They had been transferred to, say, XY company or to AB securities, or else to a nominee.  The real difficulty that arises in this situation is that we are tempted to have regard only to transactions where the principal in the contract to purchase is an alien on the purchaser side and an Irish person on the vendor side.  I want a system of supervision, which I am asking to have established, to cover not only such transactions but any transaction where the beneficiary title passes to an alien, and unless we can impose some obligation on the legal profession to notify the Land Commission or some other appropriate authority of cases in which, in their knowledge, property and the legal title to an Irish company is transferred to an alien, we will not be able to get a real picture of the background of this whole situation.</P>

      <P>That the Government may make Orders under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 (No. 7 of 1957), applying qualification, limitations, allowances, exemptions or preferential rates in relation to any customs duty, excise duty or stamp duty and applying drawbacks in relation to any customs duty or excise duty and may by Order revoke or amend any such Orders.</P>

That work was a very big job and when it is done, it will, of course, come before the Dáil for approval.  The Government have not got power under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, to make certain charges such as the qualifications or limitations that might be given in certain duties and it will be necessary in making this change-over to deal <Col N="1252" /> with qualifications and limitations and other matters the Government have not power to deal with at the moment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a paragraph in relation to the 1932 Act but I do not know whether or not this gives power that is not there already.  It is immaterial to me whether I raise it here or on the section.  There was recently in a newspaper caustic comment on the fact that the Minister had refused a duty-free licence in respect of certain safety equipment being brought into the country.  I do not know whether that can be more appropriately dealt with on this Resolution or on the section, but, as I said, since I raise it once, it is immaterial to me which. There has been public comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, under the 1932 Act, a provision that a duty-free licence may be given on the recommendation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That has been interpreted as meaning a case in which a duty is a protective duty alone.  It has been interpreted, I <Col N="1253" /> understand, that where the duty in question is a revenue duty, as apart from a protective tariff, there is no power under the 1932 Act, but I think there would be under this Financial Resolution.  Therefore, I want to raise the matter with the Minister at this stage.</P>
    <P>I understand there is one case that was put to the Minister in relation to the introduction into the country of a form of safety precaution for ensuring the safe transport of timber.  There was a similar case previously in relation to the introduction into the country of safety belts for use in motor cars.  After some considerable time, the motor car safety belts were allowed in duty free, but in relation to the problem before the Minister at present&mdash;precautions to ensure the saftey of life and limb in relation to the transport of timber&mdash;the Minister has steadfastly refused to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>To put it mildly, that is most reprehensible. The amount of duty involved is a matter of no consequence. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has made it quite clear that as far as he is concerned there is no tariff or protective element involved and that he would not have the slightest objection to the articles in question being imported without payment of duty.  It may well be that the articles in question are already within the scope of the definitions&mdash;I think the reference is T154&mdash;and that, since a revenue tariff is concerned, the Minister is unwilling to breach a hole in the whole of the tariff reference. That is understandable, but it is not understandable that the Minister is not prepared to make the necessary order to ensure that this particular type of safety equipment is outside the terms of the order in question.</P>
    <P>It seems to me it is sticking one's head in the sand.  This is a very small matter from a duty point of view, but it is a matter that could have very far reaching effects.  In fact, I think the Minister will agree with me that if this type of equipment had been used in Oughterard in Galway, a young man there would not have lost his life last month.  It was because of the absence of any safety equipment of <Col N="1254" /> this sort that the load in question was not tied in the way it should be.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough that the Minister will do nothing about it, but it is quite improper altogether that the Minister should hide behind the type of letter he has issued in relation to the matter.  For a Minister for Finance to write to anybody and to say that the Revenue Commissioners are not prepared to issue a duty free licence and that that ends the matter is sheltering behind somebody else for something that is his own responsibility. The Revenue Commissioners are there to administer the statute law as it is laid down here and to administer the administrative law as it is laid down by the Government in relation to the Imposition of Duties Acts.  It is a matter for the Minister to stand up to his responsibility and to ensure, if he wishes to ensure, that this particular type of equipment is not covered by a revenue tariff which the Revenue Commissioners feel they are not empowered to remit.</P>
    <P>Far too often one hears criticism of Departments&mdash;I am regarding the Revenue Commissioners as a Department for this purpose&mdash;when in fact it should be criticism of the appropriate Minister.  The Department is there to carry out the law, statute and administrative, as it is laid down.  The Minister is there to see and to recommend to the Oireachtas any appropriate changes there should be in the law.  If in this instance the Minister is not prepared &mdash;and he should be prepared&mdash;to ensure that safety equipment of this sort can come in duty free, he should be man enough to stand over his own decision and verdict and take responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what the objection is in relation to this.  There cannot be any objection on a broad balance of payments ground or any objection because of the amount of duty that would be involved.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has certified there is not any objection on the ground of hurting any Irish industry.  One can see that the Minister has chosen to go his own obstinate way and has refused to consider the amelioration that <Col N="1255" /> should be considered as a matter of public safety and in the general public interest.  I do not know for certain but I believe that at one time the same applied in relation to safety belts for passengers in motor cars and that, as a result of public feeling, the stand in relation to that was waived and the necessary action taken.  There is every bit as strong a case in relation to this &mdash;stronger indeed because the amount of duty that would be lost would be even less than in the other case.</P>
    <P>This is clearly a case within the Minister's own purview and he should himself take the necessary decision and steps to ensure that the administrative law under the 1932 Act is altered in such a way as to provide that this type of equipment is classified differently. It is not a question of the Revenue Commissioners implementing the law as it is; it is a question of the Minister amending the law.  We all know, of course, that as soon as that law is amended, the Revenue Commissioners will administer the new law and grant the duty-free licence required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards hospital in-patients the total number treated during 1960 in health authority hospitals was of the order of 170,000.  These included about 40,000 surgical patients. As most accident cases would require surgical treatment they would be included in this figure of 40,000.  This figure, of course, also includes the patients receiving surgical treatment for conditions which did not arise out of accidental injury.  It is clear, therefore, that accident cases would represent a small proportion of the total of the 170,000 in-patients treated in the health authority hospitals in that year.</P>
      <P>Information of this nature in relation to voluntary and private hospitals is not readily available but I am satisfied, in view of the experience in the health authority hospitals, that the proportion of cases admitted to these hospitals as in-patients for the treatment of injuries due to accidents is also small.</P>

A ratepayer dissatisfied with a valuation as revised by the Valuation Office valuer can appeal against it to the Commissioner of Valuation and subsequently to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to accept the suggestion implicit in the Deputy's question, that the valuations being put by the valuers on new and reconstructed buildings are very high, and that they constitute a grave hardship on the people concerned and a deterrent to progress.

      <P>In 1935, the Dublin Brigade Council of the Old IRA suggested that because of the <Col N="1265" /> associations of the site with national activities the northern part of the Rotunda Gardens should be taken over by the Government and converted into a public park to be dedicated to the memory of all those who gave their lives in the cause of Irish Freedom and to be known as the Garden of Remembrance. The suggestion was adopted by the Government and the site was acquired from the Rotunda Hospital authorities in 1939.  Work on this part of the scheme is in progress and will, it is expected, be completed in 1963. The estimated cost of the scheme, exclusive of the cost of the Memorial Sculpture, the design of which has not been fully decided upon, is £144,000 of which about £50,000 has been expended to date.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Islands River is part of the catchment area of the River Suck, a tributary of the Shannon.  The Clogher, Killukin and Feorish rivers too, flow into the Shannon and the Lung and Breedogue Rivers are in the Boyle catchment area which has its outfall into the Shannon.  Drainage works on all those rivers must be considered in relation to the treatment of the main River Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a substantial grant has been made available for the drainage of one of the largest tributaries of the Shannon, the Inny, on the eastern bank of the Shannon, can the Parliamentary Secretary now state why it is not possible to make small grants available for the rivers concerned in Questions No. 23 and No. 22 where a sum of £4,000 in one case will restore to an arable condition 1,500 acres of land and in another case where expenditure of £4,500 will restore almost 3,000 acres to an arable condition?  These figures are given by the local county surveyor. In view of this will the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that there is every justification for granting a small amount of money in an effort to bring these holdings back to a condition in which the people living on them can make a decent living?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Inny was a unique case in which officials of the <Col N="1270" /> ESB and Office of Public Works engineers agreed that drainage would have no deleterious effect on the level of the Shannon because it is possible to take advantage of the balancing effect of large lakes in the Inny catchment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the sum involved in the case of the Inny would be something like forty times the expenditure involved in the case of the rivers I mentioned and, in view of that, is the Parliamentary Secretary seriously suggesting that the drainage of these small, minor rivers would have any dangerous or harmful effect on the Shannon valley as a whole?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am sorry to inform the Deputy that our expert advice is that while one of these small rivers might not have any deleterious effect, nevertheless the accumulated effect would aggravate the position of the Shannon.</P>

Owing to the late season the quantity of onions imported before the usual ban on imports was imposed on 10th May last has proved insufficient to meet the demand until the home crop is available and I have, therefore, decided to allow a limited quantity of onions to be imported under licence.  In accordance with established practice licences are being granted to all firms which imported onions during the &ldquo;open period&rdquo; in the last three years, that is, the period when any firm which so desired was able to import onions without limitation as to quantity.  I have no information regarding retail prices, but I understood that Chilean onions on Dublin market last week were sold at up to 55s. per four stone bag as compared with 34s. in the corresponding week of last season.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>There is no statutory authority by which direct control could be exercised over cross-channel shipping freight, nor would it be practicable to exercise effective control on a unilateral basis.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question on 26th October, 1960, a National Shippers' Committee was established in May, 1960 to consider problems of cross-channel transport, particularly in relation to freight rates and to discuss them with the representatives of the ship-owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was informed by the Irish and British Traffic Association of the proposed increases, and advised by the National Shippers' Committee that an impasse had been reached, I invited representatives of both Organisations <Col N="1275" /> to meet me.  The Traffic Association indicated at this meeting that the proposed increases would not be sufficient to compensate them for the increased operating costs, and they instanced, <i>inter alia</i>, substantial increases in wages here and in Britain and increased harbour dues at certain British ports.  The Tribunal of Inquiry into cross-channel freight rates which reported in May, 1959 concluded that the cross-channel companies were not then making excessive profits.  Without detailed up-to-date information as to the receipts and expenditure of each of the companies it would not be possible for me to determine the extent to which the present increases may be justified.</P>
    <P>At the meeting with the two parties the National Shippers' Committee indicated that they would submit a memorandum to me and I have asked them to deal as far as possible with the possible effect of the increases on our export costs.  I endeavoured, I regret to say without success, to secure a reduction or a postponement in the proposed increases.  The Traffic Association have, however, undertaken to consider representations regarding specific traffics when it can be shown that the increase is detrimental to the interests of the trader.</P>

Is the Minister aware that the statement made when the 1958 Act was going through was that there would be no railways torn up without full consultation with the people in the areas concerned and that that undertaking was not carried out?</P>

      <P>That is a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.  The reports of CIE have to be presented to the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas has been and will be providing money for the development of the railway system.  The Deputy must use commonsense.  There are ample precedents.  A great number of Acts have been passed in this House where in regard to the strict letter of the law, there have been policy trends clearly indicated by the Minister of the day.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give any specific instance where as a result of representations or consultations in the past between CIE and interested groups in regard to a proposal to close a railway line, such representations had any effect in preventing the closing of the line?  In view of the situation in the past is it not quite apparent that the statement made by the Chairman of CIE means that, irrespective of whatever representations or consultations may take place, his mind is made up, unless the Minister makes time available in this House for Deputies to reconsider the mandate they gave that CIE become a paying concern by 1964?  Does the Minister propose to make time available for a discussion on the necessity for revising that legislation?</P>

      <Col N="1280" /> Full depreciation of the fleet for 1961/62 amounted to £691,472 from which was deducted the sum of £200,000 out of amounts overprovided for depreciation in previous years leaving a nett charge of £491,472.  The comparable figures if the fleet were depreciated at (a) 5 per cent. per annum would be £598,938 and £398,938; and (b) 6 per cent. per annum £718,725 and £518,725.</P>

      <P>Proposals for the cleaning, levelling and sowing with seed of seven open spaces at the rere of houses in the Marino and Croydon Park area have been received in my Department from the Dublin Corporation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that there are at present 987 applications <Col N="1285" /> for rehousing on the Dublin County Council waiting list.  Layout plans for 100 cottages, including plans received on 21st June for 66 dwellings at Stillorgan, are at present under examination in my Department.  The housing authority's records do not, I understand, give the figures of eligible applicants for each dispensary district nor have they a firm figure readily available for the number of applicants who are at present residing in council dwellings.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, concerning the rehousing of sub-tenants of council houses, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question by Deputy P.J. Burke on 1st March last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government what is the present legal position of a county <Col N="1288" /> council which desires to provide an internal water supply to vested cottages in respect of the expenditure on such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a similar Question by the Deputy on November 30th last, county councils are not empowered under the Housing Acts to incur expenditure on the provision of internal services in vested labourers cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he proposes to introduce legislation to enable a local authority, when providing an internal water supply for non-vested cottages, to undertake at the same time on some mutually acceptable terms the provision of a water supply for vested cottages in the same original scheme of houses?  Otherwise, we may have a situation in which half the houses in the scheme will have a water supply and the other half will have none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that a provision, which I hope the House will discuss in the very near future, will be introduced which, I trust, will meet the circumstances of the cases outlined by the Deputy.  I do not think it would be true to say, however, that legislation is being promoted with a view to enabling councils to provide services to houses already vested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch the first portion of the Minister's reply. Did the Minister say there are already powers there or did he say powers will be devised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say either. What I did say was that there will be facilities available to owners of vested cottages to enable the owners themselves to connect up with the services.</P>

      <P>Land Commission records are related to financial years and are not kept by reference to constituency areas.</P>
      <P>Land Commission activities in County Mayo are heavily concentrated and involve numerous estates and holdings.  Many of the properties are of modest size and include remnants of Congested Districts Board estates, land surrendered by migrants and small residues of allotted estates.  The Deputy will appreciate that the extraction of the detailed information requested would entail a disproportionate expenditure of official time and labour which would not be warranted.  Moreover, as regards lands in the possession of the Land Commission for distribution, the position is subject to constant fluctuation&mdash;depending on progress on intake and allotment&mdash; and the extensive information sought, even if staff were to be diverted specially to extract it, would be out of date within a very short time.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, perhaps, it would meet the Deputy's requirements to know that during the financial year ended 31st March, 1962, a total area of approximately 9,600 acres was distributed amongst some 360 allottees and that, at 31st March, 1962, the Land Commission had on hands in County Mayo&mdash;apart from substantial areas of mountain, turbary, etc.&mdash;an aggregate area of about 2,650 acres of arable land for use as a working pool for land settlement in the county.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education to what extent each county and county borough has availed itself in its estimated expenditure for 1962-63 of the increased provision for university scholarships, stating in each case the number of scholarships granted per year before the introduction of these provisions, and the number of scholarships it is proposed to grant in the coming academic year.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a table giving the number and total value of university scholarships awarded by each council and borough council in the year 1961/62 and their financial provision for the award of scholarships in the year 1962/63.  Because of the different values of scholarships, it is <Col N="1298" /> not possible to estimate how many scholarships each council and borough council will award in the year 1962/63.</P>

      <P>Some of the items in the 1916 Collection were in a faded condition before they were acquired by the National Museum.  It was, however, observed that some fading also occurred during the special 1916 Twenty-fifth Anniversary Exhibition when the Collection was displayed in the central court of the Museum, then roofed with plain glass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consequence the following steps were then taken to prevent further fading or deterioration:&mdash; (1) the collection was transferred to its present <Col N="1302" /> location where daylight is excluded and artificial illumination provided; (2) the Roll of Honour has been installed in a cabinet with sliding panels to minimise exposure to light; and (3) the plain glass in the roof of the central court has been replaced by insulated glass.</P>

    <P>(d)  Estimates of future enrolments at different levels of education, and by subject of specialisation, according to the alternative assumptions mentioned above.</P>
    <P>(e) Interpretations of estimated enrolment figures in terms of the expansion of educational resources, i.e., teachers, buildings, equipment, etc., taking into account possible improvements in the quality of teaching.</P>
    <P>(f) Evaluations of the expenditure entailed by the various alternatives for the expansion of educational resources&mdash;the evaluations <Col N="1304" /> should be expressed in relation to macro-economic data, such as GNP and volume of investment.</P>
    <P>(g) Consideration of arrangements necessary to ensure the review of the position at intervals in the light of changing circumstances in the field covered by the study.  In this connection to recommend the nature and extent of the additional statistical data concerning current activities which should be collected and the methods and frequency of such collections.</P>
    <P>(h) The extent to which the foregoing assessments might be influenced by the provision of educational facilities in Ireland for students from other countries and of educational aid in the form of teachers and other trained personnel for service in the emergent countries.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Sweetman with regard to my functions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners have the duty of carrying out the law with regard to customs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and revenue and if they say a certain custom duty is payable, I accept that.  The fact that I may put that in writing is no proof whatever that I am trying to hide behind the Revenue Commissioners.  I am saying what the Revenue Commissioners have decided and that is that.  With regard <Col N="1306" /> to amending the law, that is a different matter altogether.  In the particular case to which the Deputy refers, I am not satisfied that amending the law is justified. The particular device that was imported by the person referred to by the Deputy would in the ordinary way be regarded as part of the equipment of the lorry concerned and would therefore be subject to duty and I do not see why an exemption should be sought. The exemption was sought for two reasons: one, that it made for efficiency, and secondly, that it made for safety.  If the person concerned thought it was very necessary from a point of view of safety, it is up to him then to refuse to pay the duty or not as he decides.  I do not see that the Revenue Commissioners or I can be held responsible for the fact that he did not import this article because duty had to be paid on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that the Revenue Commissioners certainly cannot be held responsible because it is their job to administer the law as it is, but the Minister could, if he wished, change the administrative law in this respect.  If there is responsibility, and there is, it lies fairly and squarely on the Minister's back.  For the Minister to say, as he did in the letter, that there is nothing further he can do to be of assistance is frankly not true because he could make a new order or get the Government to move a new order, if he wanted to.  I do not accept that the responsibility is solely that of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners have carried out the law as they see it and if the law covers this safety device and the Minister feels that the safety device should not be introduced duty free because of its assistance in the production of timber, number one, and because of the safety element number two, the remedy is in his own hands and if he does not adopt it, the blame is equally on him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  I said I was not prepared to recommend a change in the law because the plea was made of greater efficiency and safety.  The safety matter could be carried a long way. A person might apply for a permit for tyres which were not made in this country but which were much safer, or for a type of brakes which were not made in this country because they were safer than brakes made here, and for many other things like that. If the person thinks it is going to make all the difference in regard to safety, it is up to him to pay the duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very big difference between degrees of safety with regards to motor cars and the safety element in the equipment which is under discussion here.  Suppose some person is injured by reason of the absence of the equipment, it would be open to the person, or the next of kin, if the person dies from the injuries, to bring the matter before a court of law and any judge or jury in the circumstances would say these persons were guilty of negligence because they did not have available a safer system of working. If an issue were to arise as to whether or not a particular make of tyre was safer than another, I cannot imagine any judge or jury accepting the boast of the advertiser that one tyre was safer than another.  There is a vast degree of difference and I do not think it was good enough for the Minister to seek shelter behind regulations which I believe were never intended to discourage Irish employers from making available to their workers a safe system of working.  What the Minister is doing is utterly deplorable. The Minister should bear in mind that if he refuses to do anything about it, he will not have heard the last word about it.  For instance, we had duties put on safety belts and crash helmets here, but in the long run the Department gave way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister personally, of course, is involved in the making <Col N="1308" /> or not making of these regulations. I am quite certain that if the Minister is not prepared to give way on this point, the trade unions will quite properly raise a storm about it.  It is deplorable that where employers are prepared to go to the expense of providing a safe system of working, they should be penalised.  That is what the Minister is doing.</P>

      <P>That is all very fine.  If Deputy Ryan were on the jury, he could blame the Minister, but the first letter that came from this firm was based on the plea of efficiency and there was not a word about safety. When it was rejected, however, they turned to the safety device in order, I suppose, to get sympathy and evidently they have got it from Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Ryan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations in relation to a document that has come into my hands within the past couple of days.  This provides money for the various facets of Government; therefore, I am in order in referring to this type of money that has been provided for.  In the particular case I have in mind, the chairman of a public company here has, in his accounts and statement which he circulated to his shareholders, thrown doubt, by implication, on the statement that has been made that financial assistance will be available to industry as a whole.  The actual words he used in one place are:</P>
      <P>We look to the Government to support established Irish industries such as ours and to implement their promises to give financial assistance so that a Company of our standing may have a fair chance in these days of fierce international competition. We are an Irish Company and proud of it but we do deplore foreign industrialists being subsidised at our expense in the production of certain articles for sale in Ireland and which are also made by us and for which we have received no financial aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company in question is a wellknown company in this country.  I cannot see any possibility of the chairman making that statement, unless he felt it was true.  I thought it was clearly understood in relation to the various types of inducements that were made available for people to start up new industries here that the purpose of their work was not to compete with already well-established industries but <Col N="1310" /> to strike out in a new market, strike out very often in relation to the export market and certainly to form a sector of public marketing different from that which was catered for already.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 1956 Grants Act, as well as I can remember, there was a specific statement that the grants could not be made available if the industry was going to compete with existing established home industries unless it could show it was necessary to fill a further sector of the home market.  I hope the Minister will agree with me when I say that while we are all anxious&mdash;and desperately anxious &mdash;that every possible inducement should be given to industrialists to start up new industries, it does not help the national effort as a whole if it is merely a question of starting in one place and taking away from another.</P>
    <P>It would be grossly unfair to existing concerns if public money were made available to enable a new industry to take away from existing concerns the business, the trade and the commercial undertaking they have built up at very great expense.  As I say, I find it difficult to believe that such would be the case but I cannot understand the Chairman of a public company of the size involved and with issued capital of £1,500,000 making that statement unless he had clear evidence before him that he was justified in his comments.  I cannot understand it unless he feels he is justified in making it and justified in his duty to ensure that the public funds which we provide under this Money Resolution are not used for the purpose of injuring existing industries by taking from them the share of the market they already have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a general knowledge of the subject raised by the Deputy but as far as my knowledge goes, grants for new industries are not given where it is a matter of competing against a home industry, especially where the home industry is capable of supplying the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>And is supplying and capable of supplying, yes.  The grants are usually given, as far as I know, to <Col N="1311" /> companies which are about to undertake an export business.  In fact, it is often stated that a certain percentage only would be sold on the home market. I would, of course, have to have the names of the companies concerned before I could make any inquiry.  I am sure the Deputy would have no hesitation in giving the information.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the re-enactment for a further year of the statutory provisions in relation to taxation which were enforced on 5th April last.  It is the means whereby we are giving a new chapter of life for yet another year to an income tax code which is over 150 years old, which was designed by a grand old English gentleman in the year 1803.  It is such a hardy annual in our Finance Bill that henceforth we should urge our Ministers for Finance to pay some little tribute every year at this time to the memory of Sir William Pitt who designed an income tax code for English conditions 150 years ago.  Our reluctance to change that code in any fundamental respect and our extreme conservatism in our approach to tax reform gives one grounds for doubt as to why we really bothered to obtain self-Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one takes a look at provisions such as these, one could validly argue <Col N="1312" /> that we do not deserve to have the right to govern ourselves if we just year after year renew British legislation which was never designed with this country in mind and which is clearly obsolete and archaic not only in Irish conditions but in British conditions also.  Of all our Ministers for Finance, I regret to say that it seems to me our present Minister for Finance manifests that extreme conservatism which I consider deplorable.</P>
    <P>Our tax code is based on the British Act of 1918 which, in turn, goes back to much earlier Acts, the framework of which was laid down by William Pitt over 150 years ago.  It bristles with anomalies and injustices.  Some of those have been the subject of a report by an Income Tax Commission set up some years ago by Deputy Sweetman when he was Minister for Finance. Most of the recommendations of that Commission have been rejected by the Government in a White Paper circulated by the Minister last year.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendation of the Commission which has been implemented was that in favour of a system of pay as you earn for the collection of income tax from wage and salary earners.  It was advocated very strongly by the trade union movement in this country and I said at the time we were introducing it that I thought the trade union movement, and the labour movement in general, in the interests of the workers were ill-advised to press for the introduction of pay as you earn in this country.  Over the short term it has been in operation, pay as you earn has made it easier for the individual worker to pay his income tax but it has had the second effect of making the worker a much easier mark than ever before for the tax collector so that the Minister finds himself in the position of relying more and more on the workers, the wage and salary earners, for direct tax revenue.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly&mdash;and it cannot be too often repeated in this House&mdash;that the extent to which wage and salary earners are being fleeced for income tax is grossly inequitable in relation to the other sections of the community. It is most desirable that our tax code should be an equitable one, based on <Col N="1313" /> justice and fair play, on good Government and on morality, and for as long as we continue to perpetuate an inequitable direct tax code we are leaving many people labouring under a deep sense of grievance, under a feeling that they are pulling their weight while others are not.</P>
    <P>The direct tax revenue which is being collected from wage and salary earners under Schedule E of the tax code is continuing to increase year after year.  That is in part because wages are going up, but in the year just ended approximately £11,000,000 was collected by way of income tax under Schedule E.  Most of that would have been collected before the eighth round increase in wages and salaries was given effect to.  Five or six years ago only about £5,000,000 was collected in income tax from wage and salary earners.  It is therefore a fact that we are relying out of all proportion to their share of the national income on wage and salary earners for our income tax revenue.  They are a section of the community whose employers not only have to act as income tax collectors but on whom the impact of the income tax code weighs very severely.</P>
    <P>There is no section of the 1918 Income Tax Act which has been more severely criticised by judicial authorities in Britain and here, and I know it is an old British maxim that equity is a stranger to income tax. It is a maxim which we should be prepared to accept in this country. There is great need for the tax code to be respected by the community at large.  One is told by those competent to express opinions on these matters&mdash; moral theologians&mdash;that there is no obligation on the individual to pay an inequitable or unfair tax and as long as this unfair situation prevails here there is a very grave obligation on the Minister for Finance and on the House as a whole to rectify it.</P>
    <P>When faced with this criticism last year the Minister for Finance indicated that his method of approaching it was to reduce the standard rate of tax rather than to effect reforms in the code for one section of the community <Col N="1314" /> rather than another.  On the face of it, the Minister's approach might appear to be a valid one, but in so far as the suggestion goes that a reduction in the standard rate of tax relieves all sections of the community who are paying income tax&mdash;not all sections do pay income tax&mdash;the differential position as between wage and salary earners and sections of the business community who are taxed under Schedule D in respect of trade profits favours the latter class.  Any criticism of Schedule E tax in Britain must apply with much greater force in this country by reason of the fact that to a far greater relative extent than in Britain we are relying on wage and salary earners for so much of our direct tax revenue.</P>
    <P>In particular, there have been many suggestions made as to what form of differential relief we should make in respect of the tax-paying wage earner. I do not propose to go into them now but the Minister must be aware it is possible to argue very much more strongly for a higher rate of relief for wage and salary earners than in respect of other sections.  I feel entitled to ask the Minister whether he is aware of these problems and, if he is, what he is doing about them.</P>
    <P>There are now nearly 180,000 people paying tax under pay as you earn and while it is true that up to some years ago the number of taxpayers was much more restricted and that therefore it was possible then that the impact did not fall on so many people, the greater number of people labouring under this imposition now increases the Minister's responsibility.  The Income Tax Commission have now issued their final report dealing with these problems. That report has not yet been circulated so I am at the great disadvantage of being unable to comment on it.  I sincerely hope that if the Commission have recommended reliefs in income tax relating to wage and salary earners the Minister will pay greater attention to them than he has done in respect of the Commission's four earlier reports. As I said, the bulk of the important recommendations of the Commission have been rejected by the Government and we are in the position of having this archaic and obsolete income tax <Col N="1315" /> code inflicted on us not only for another year but indefinitely, to all outward appearances, unless our entry into the Common Market makes any significant difference to the position.</P>
    <P>In that connection it behoves the Minister to advise the House of what are the likely effects on our taxation and fiscal system which may result from our entry into the Common Market.  Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome provides that the Commission of the European Union shall consider in what way the law of the various member States concerning turn-over taxes, excise duties and other forms of taxation can best be harmonised in the interests of the Common Market. The Commission shall submit proposals to the Council, which shall accept them by means of unanimous vote.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Budget, the Minister referred very briefly to the fact that he was having a study made in his Department of the effects on our tax laws which might result from our entry into the Common Market.  It appears to me that Article 99 relates only to indirect taxation and refers only to the harmonisation of the indirect taxation codes of the various States in the European Union and not necessarily to the tax codes.  Harmonisation in this case, perhaps, may be a very different matter.  It is a fact that a great deal of intensive work is going on in the EEC not only in relation to indirect taxes but also in relation to direct taxation in studies of various European systems to see how they can be measured up to a single design.</P>
    <P>One of the impacts of such an integration may very well be for us a complete change in the income tax base so far as industrial taxation goes, a change which could very well subject our corporate taxpayers, limited companies, to a form of capital gains tax.  I say that because it appears to me that in most of the countries in the Common Market at present their tax base, that is the base sum on which income tax is computed for the equivalent of limited companies, is very different from ours.  We <Col N="1316" /> are assessed on an income basis whereas they are assessed on a nett worth basis, which has regard to changes in the capital position of the company from one year to another rather than to the trading income which the company earns on a revenue basis.  That is a form of automatic, built-in capital gains tax.  It would cause a great deal of dismay and apprehension among corporate taxpayers here if they felt they were to be subjected to a capital gains tax as a result of our entry into the Common Market.  I throw out that point merely as one of a number of urgent problems concerning our entry into the Common Market on which we are entitled to information from the Minister.</P>
    <P>It may be unfortunate that the Income Tax Commission has suspended its work and gone out of existence without adverting to the impact of our entry into the Common Market, if we get in, on our tax code.  I certainly hope that, if we do get into the Common Market, we will exercise some common sense in relation to taxation. No survey of the tax position here can be made without adequate statistics. Too frequently questions are put down by interested Deputies looking for information on one aspect or other of the tax code and the Minister has to say &ldquo;I am sorry.  The records of the Revenue Commissioners are not kept in such a way as would enable me to answer this question&rdquo;.  One asks a question about the cost of collecting Schedule A income tax, for example, and the Minister has to give the preposterous answer that he does not know what the cost of collecting Schedule A income tax is.  That position is not good enough.  It is a position which could be readily rectified.  In his Financial Statement the Minister adverted to the fact that he was installing electronic equipment for collecting tax.  I hope that equipment will be used for the analysis and assimilation of revenue returns and that we will get something really informative in the way of an annual report from the Revenue Commissioners.  Their present annual report is not sufficiently informative for anyone seriously interested in the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> I have other things to say on this Finance Bill, particularly in regard to Schedule A tax, the tax on the owners of residential houses, but as it is the subject of an amendment by Deputy Ryan, my remarks can be deferred until then.  The Minister has given every indication that he is going to outdo the British Tories in conservatism so far as tax reform is concerned. No later than a few weeks ago the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was able to indicate that next year he is going to abolish Schedule A income tax on owner-occupiers.  The British Chancellor is not in the position the Minister for Finance here is in.  He has not had a report from an expert commission recommending the abolition of such a tax, whereas our Minister for Finance has had such a report and has indicated very strongly he is not accepting that report.  I would respect the Minister if he were to say he thinks there might be something in the recommendations of the Commission on Schedule A but cannot for the moment, for revenue reasons, implement those recommendations.  The fact that he would appear to have committed himself and his successors to a rejection on doctrinaire grounds of the Commission's report is to me a matter of great disappoinment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise merely to put a few facts straight.  I am sure the wage and salary earners of the country would be delighted to be here this evening to find they had so many friends in strange places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing strange about it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid they have not the same ideas about tax collection as some of the people who purport to speak for them.  It is quite true that the trade union movement and the labour movement campaigned to have a PAYE system introduced here. They agreed, as I agree, that any system of income taxation which is inequitable should be abolished, if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If income tax must be paid, surely a system by which it is collected weekly from the wage earner and the salary earner is a far better system than the <Col N="1318" /> one which operated previously under which no tax would be collected for perhaps a period of years, and then suddenly, an unfortunate person got a bill for more money than perhaps he might earn in the next six months.  On many occasions that happened when someone had got married and was setting up a home, and he found that all the money he had saved for that purpose had to be paid to the income tax authorities.  According to the system laid down it was due.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in my opinion&mdash;and I speak with the authority of the trade union movement&mdash;the collection of income tax under the system of PAYE is the only system which is fair to all concerned.  It is a fact that many people were getting away with it before this.  If income tax has to be paid it should be paid by everyone who has the same income and outgoings. There is no point in having those who can be easily caught paying all the time and those who are, perhaps, earning more and cannot be so easily caught, getting away with it. That was stopped with the introduction of PAYE.  While I would like to see income tax abolished if at all possible, and a better system introduced, so long as it must be retained the better system for the working people is the PAYE system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations on the report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  The Minister indicated in his Financial Statement that he had received the final report of that Commission, and that he hoped to publish it soon.  I am not quite clear as to whether or not it has gone to the printers, but I want to make the point that the report should be published as soon as it is printed.  It would be wrong for the Minister to retain it until such time as he has had an opportunity of coming to conclusions himself on it, and until such time as the Government had also decided whether or not to implement such recommendations as he might put forward with regard to that report. The sooner we get the report to study and consider what is best arising out of its recommendations, the better for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> The Minister mentioned in his Budget speech, or on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, that the report of the Commission now totalled some thousand pages, or thereabouts. I do not know the size of the last volume, but if the Commission has not yet been finally disbanded it would be a great advantage if a summary in one volume&mdash;rather than several volumes &mdash;of their outstanding recommendations could be made available to the public.  It is difficult for the public as a whole to find their way through the maze of what undoubtedly is and must be such a technical document as the Report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  In terming it &ldquo;the maze&rdquo;, I do not want in any way to suggest that they have made their reports to date unduly difficult of assimilation.  On the contrary, they have gone, in some instances, so far to attempt to be simple that it is a little difficult to follow what they had in mind.  The subject, of course, is a highly complex one, and complicated to the last degree, to be dealt with by an ordinary person.  Therefore, a summary in one document of the outstanding points would be of assistance to the general public, apart from those people who may, perhaps, be skilled in the interpretation of the various matters concerned.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I say that I want to join in the tributes that have been paid to the members of the Commission on several occasions over the years.  I must confess that I realised when the Commission was being set up that I was asking the people to whom I issued an invitation to serve to do something which would involve them in a very heavy sacrifice of time, trouble and energy.  The task of examining our income tax code was obviously a very weighty one, and it was obvious from the very beginning that the people who were asked to sit on that Commission were being asked to undertake a burden of very, very considerable dimensions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has paid his tribute to them already and I merely want to <Col N="1320" /> join with him.  I think it is true that there is little understanding in the public mind of the amount of work that was involved in their task, and the painstaking manner in which they went about it.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with any of their recommendations one must recognise the merits of the Commission which set a headline for voluntary national service in a task of this sort.</P>
    <P>On the whole the State has been extremely lucky throughout the years in the people it has got to serve on one commission after another.  Many of them have given an immense amount of time to the task which they were asked to perform.  The Capital Investment Committee was another such Commission that I set up myself.  While I disagreed with some of their recommendations too, the fact remains that they set about their task in a painstaking manner and a spirit of patriotic service, and that should be acknowledged and honoured just as we should acknowledge and honour the task and the trouble of the Commission on Income Taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must disagree with Deputy Byrne on a few points at least.  I do not think he is right in saying that the fact that wage earners and salary earners are paying their income tax through PAYE makes them an easier mark for the Minister.  After all, the bigger the number paying income tax the more likely the Minister is to be deterred from increasing income tax, and also the fact that there is a bigger number paying and a more efficient collection makes it easier for the Minister to be satisfied that with what he is getting he would even be able to reduce income tax either by way of reliefs or a reduction of the standard rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also said that wage and salary earners were paying more than their share of the national taxation. When I brought in the Budget I was attacked by members of that Party, and the Labour Party, on the point that we were taking more than the proportion that should be taken by way of indirect taxation.  That, of course, was used as an argument against the increased duties on beer, <Col N="1321" /> spirits and tobacco.  It is true that a reduction in the standard rate will give a higher aggregate benefit to the high salary earners than it will to the wage earners, but we have not confined our reductions in income tax to the standard rate.  When bringing in PAYE, the earned income tax allowance was increased and so was the personal allowance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.  The Commission on Income Taxation began by coming to the conclusion that income tax was a good system and the Government agreed with that.  The Government, in their White Paper last year, said that we shared the view of the Commission that income tax was, in principle, a good form of tax and must be retained as part of the tax system.  Deputy Tully said he would like to see income tax abolished.  I am sure very few would not agree with that.  The only alternative given so far is a purchase tax and I do not think Deputy Tully would be enamoured of that tax, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission, to give them their due, did, I think, recommend a sort of half-and-half system, reducing income tax substantially and making up the balance by purchase tax.  The Government did not adopt that recommendation but it is always there for any future Government to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to harmonisation of taxation in EEC, there are two paragraphs, 113 and 114, on page 52 of the White Paper recently issued dealing with that matter.  It is pointed out that nothing definite has been done. They have been working on the matter and I presume they hope to reach some agreement on the harmonisation. That does not go so far as to say that we must have exactly the same tax and the same rate of tax. That would be impossible because <Col N="1322" /> some countries will require a little more than others.  Therefore, it cannot be done in that way.</P>
    <P>We have so far issued all these reports as we got them from the printers.  We did not wait for the Government to consider what view they might take of them.  As soon as the seventh report comes from the printer, I intend to have it published and distributed and I have already undertaken to have the Government decide on the various recommendations before the next Budget.  I presume there will be a White Paper issued as was done in 1961, on the remainder of the recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the benefits&mdash;I might put it that way &mdash; of the electronic system when it comes in will be to make it possible to supply useful statistics in regard to income tax.  These statistics will be published with the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1323" /> so that everybody will have the benefit of the figures produced.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, as and from the passing of this Act, premises not exceeding £30 valuation, in which an owner-occupier normally resides shall be exempted from Schedule A tax on owner-occupation and residential premises exceeding £30 valuation shall be similarly exempted on the owner-occupation element in the first £30 valuation, the exemption to apply to the residential portion only of the premises not exclusively occupied as a residence.</P>
      <P>This first amendment which we suggest in the form of a new section is taken almost word for word from the second report of the Commission of Income Taxation.  It is a recommendation from the Commission which received the almost unanimous support of the Commission and was endorsed by many people who submitted evidence to the Commission itself.</P>
      <P>I think it appropriate at this stage to refer to some of the authorities which supported the recommendation, but, before doing so, I should like to explain briefly the effect of the amendment. At present, we have the archaic income tax code to which Deputy Byrne referred and which he very properly castigated as being a code which we have on our souls as a national original sin and which we have left in our economy while those who gave birth to the income tax code in question have to a large extent erased the sin from their own souls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this archaic code, a peculiar situation arises in this country.  We encourage people to save in many respects.  If a man keeps money on deposit in a bank, he will pay no income <Col N="1324" /> tax on the first £25 of interest he earns on that deposit.  If a man has money invested in saving certificates, he will pay no income tax on the profit accruing to him from that saving. There are certain types of securities which will give him similar exemption from income tax and, of course, substantial exemption from estate duty. There are also various forms of insurance which will likewise give a person exemption from income tax.  It appears that all these exemptions are given for the very worthy purpose of encouraging people to save but the one form of saving which we deliberately discourage under the income tax code is the investing of saving in a private dwelling.</P>
    <P>On that account, Deputy Byrne and I have felt it was time to have a discussion in this House on this issue.  Being ourselves of a mind that Schedule A income tax on private dwellings should be abolished, we were fortified in that belief by the report of the Income Tax Commission and we felt we might avoid some argumentation here if we used the words of the Commission's report and recommendation.  That is what we have done.</P>
    <P>We accept that a valuation of £30 as set out in the amendment is itself an arbitrary limit and we are, as it were, punishing a person who decides to put more of his money into a dwelling than some other form of investment but we feel it will be readily admitted that £30 valuation under our valuation code represents a fair valuation of a normal dwelling and I think the overwhelming majority of private houses of our people would be of £30 valuation or under.  There are some which are above it.  I have in mind, in particular, for instance, the fact that there are houses in Rathmines and Rathgar which at one time might have housed the well-to-do of the city of Dublin but which are, at this day and age, owned by elderly people who may, or may not, let portion of them.  It might seem unfair that they should be compelled to pay Schedule A tax while a person living in some modern suburban house which is easier to run and which has a valuation of less than £30 may be exempt.  However, as the Minister will no doubt say <Col N="1325" /> in reply and as we all appreciate, once we have a tax code of any kind, there will invariably be some inequalities. That is something we cannot get over unless we abolish Schedule A tax.</P>
    <P>A great deal can be said in favour of abolishing Schedule A tax <i>in toto</i> because the situation that arises in relation to business premises is somewhat Gilbertian.  If a business is subjected to Schedule A tax, then allowance is made in respect of that tax payment under Schedule D.  Therefore, we have the farcical situation of one arm of the State spending a lot of money, time and effort levying tax which another arm of the State has to spend as much money, time and effort giving back.</P>
    <P>However, we are primarily concerned with the social desirability of encouraging people to buy their homes. There is a very positive reason.  We believe the State will be the more stable, the more mature, if it is a property-owning democracy in which people are living in houses which they have bought or are buying under mortgage.  The community is then living in its own savings box and the people really appreciate the value of their savings.  It is perhaps the most sensible form of saving.  If a person invests money in other ways, there is a danger that the drop in the value of money may reduce the capital value of savings, but if there is any inflation, the benefit of inflation usually accrues to house property as well.</P>
    <P>The support to be found for our amendment is so overwhelming that the Minister should seriously consider what we propose.  I have no doubt that sooner or later the Minister or his successor will do it, not because the amendment has any particular merit but because it was announced in England that it would come into effect next year.  The situation is apparently that many of our Ministers for Finance have been afraid to introduce any improvements in our income tax code until the &ldquo;Old Lady&rdquo; who introduced the iniquitous scheme originally carries out such improvements; then something which was regarded as unorthodox, revolutionary and not quite respectable becomes <Col N="1326" /> very respectable and is accepted overnight.</P>
    <P>The Income Tax Commission received from a number of people recommendations which support our amendment.  The Federation of Irish Industries recommended that the present system of regarding the Schedule A valuation as an addition to income should be discontinued, at least for valuations of up to £40.  They went somewhat above the figure recommended by the Commission and that suggested by Deputy Byrne and myself but it will be observed that the Federation of Irish Industries representing people in Irish industry recommended to this Commission that the system of collecting income tax under Schedule A should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>The Association of Chambers of Commerce in Ireland and the Federated Union of Employers wrote:</P>
    <P>The majority of assessments which arise under Schedule A are for small amounts, mostly in respect of owner-occupied houses.  It is considered that on social grounds Schedule A should not be assessed on this type of holding.  Every encouragement should be given to extend the range of property owners in the country and the most suitable means of achieving this is to facilitate in every way possible the owner-occupied system.  It seems probable that the discontinuance of Schedule A tax for this type of property would not involve any ultimate loss to the Exchequer as the savings achieved in assessment and collection expenses would almost certainly exceed the present yield of tax from this class of holding.</P>
    <P>I might pass the comment that the Revenue Commissioners did not completely agree with that submission. What they did say was that the cost of implementing the amendment which is before the House would be about £200,000 but that against that allowance could be made in respect of the saving which would arise by reason of no longer having to administer what I call this Gilbertian arrangement. Unfortunately, the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1327" /> do not know much about their own labour costs and they are unable to say how much they are costing the State.  I have a feeling the saving would be quite substantial and any loss in revenue certainly would not exceed £50,000 a year.  I might err on the side of generosity in favour of my own argument, but even if you double the figure, you would still find a relatively small loss would accrue to the State. The social benefit which would flow to the nation as a whole justifies it.</P>
    <P>Let us go further.  Another submission to the Income Tax Commission came from the Workers Union of Ireland.  They submitted a copy of the resolution passed at the 1957 annual delegate conference which reads:</P>
    <P>That no income tax be levied on a person in respect of the ownership of a house occupied by the owner and which does not exceed £3,000 in value, and where no other house-property is owned by the same person.</P>
    <P>That purchase value of £3,000 suggested by the union would cover to a large extent houses of £30 rateable valuation and less.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland who are persons familiar with the income tax code and the manner in which it affects people, said that the Schedule A income tax is complicated and inequitable. That comes from people who are skilled in income tax affairs.  They say:</P>
    <P>The loss of tax from owner-occupiers of property would, to a large extent, be made good by the receipt of tax on the excess of net rents over Schedule A valuations of furnished and unfurnished lettings.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through all the recommendations but I think it would be pertinent to list some of the other persons who recommend that our suggestion be adopted.  The Civil Service Alliance recommended it and others who recommended it are the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, Mr. T. Donovan, a retired Special Commissioner, Mr. C. J.F. McCarthy, a certified accountant <Col N="1328" /> from Cork, and several other accountants came before or wrote to this Commission on Income Tax recommending the abolition of Schedule A income tax in relation to owner-occupied property.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand how this ever came to be levied.  The notion apparently existed that because a person held house property, there was a national income deriving from that property.  It was argued by the Revenue Commissioners that because a person had house property, that person was saved the expense of renting a dwelling from somebody else and that on that account he was more fortunate than his fellow citizens.  It is time the State considered what the result is of discouraging people from owning their own dwellings.  This policy, to a large extent, compels the central and local authorities to subsidise housing for certain sections of our people.  Now, we all accept readily that we must provide dwellings for those of our people whose incomes are limited and who cannot, therefore, afford to provide houses for themselves.  We will always gladly provide subsidies for such people.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many people living in rented houses, subsidised by public authorities, who could well afford to purchase their houses.  On the one hand, we exhort people not to be parasites on the community, if they can afford to provide their own houses and, on the other hand, we say to them: &ldquo;If you do so, you will for the first time be subjected to a new form of taxation, a penal form of taxation because you invest your savings in a private dwelling for yourself and your family.  If you invest that money in investments, securities, savings certificates, and so on, to yield you a profit year in and year out, and provide you with cash into your pocket, we will give you exemption.&rdquo;  That is the situation at the moment.  All the State garners is £100,000.  I believe that if Schedule A taxation were abolished, it would save the State far more in the long run; it would certainly save the State more than the £100,000 annually because far more people would provide their own homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> There is another amendment dealing with stamp duty with which I do not propose to deal now.  It, too, is put down for the purpose of encouraging the citizens to purchase their homes. These two amendments are directed to one object, namely, to encourage people to live in their own savings boxes.  We believe that, if the people did that, the State as a whole would benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is likely that in a few moments the Minister will tell us that the yield from Schedule A taxation is in the region of £1,000,000 because the report of the Revenue Commissioners shows the gross assessments resulting in a yield of something like £1,000,000.  It is, however, a fact that the only effective payers of Schedule A tax are residential occupiers of their own private dwellings. In so far as the tax is levied on business properties, and this is where the bulk of the yield comes from, an allowance is given under Schedule D, the Schedule under which trading profits are taxed; and the yield under that Schedule is therefore correspondingly reduced.  What is gained on the swings is lost on the roundabouts.  If Schedule A tax is abolished, the loss to the State, having allowed for reduced administrative costs, will be very little indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an illogical tax which has survived from the time when the principal form of real property was land.  In William Pitt's time, when income tax was first introduced, the vast bulk of the revenue resulted from this property tax, or Schedule A tax, on land.  That was before the development of industry on the scale it has reached nowadays.  Before the repeal of the corn laws, the principal industry was, in fact, agriculture.  This idea of taxing a notional income, which does not exist in real terms, is most illogical. It is based on an obsolete economic doctrine.  Economists of the last century who laid down the basic principles upon which this tax is based have been largely discredited.  There are other forms of goods and chattels which could, in theory, be subjected to this notional tax on ownership.  The <Col N="1330" /> fact that they are not so subjected is further proof of the illogical nature of this tax.  The person who owns an expensive yacht&mdash;mark you, Dublin Bay is one of the principal yachting centres in Western Europe&mdash;could, in theory, be subjected to taxation on the ownership element according to these antediluvian economists.  It would be just as logical to tax him on that ownership as it is to tax a struggling worker making sacrifices to purchase his own house.</P>
    <P>There is not a great deal one can add to what Deputy Ryan has said. He has covered the case very comprehensively, but I urge on the Minister that this tax cannot be divorced from local rates, which are, it is generally agreed, a form of taxation, too.  The householder pays rates on his house, a form of taxation. Then the Revenue Commissioners come along and tell him that he has a notional cash income from the ownership of his own house and they subject that notional income to taxation.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that this Schedule A tax is a very real benefit to the landlord who, notwithstanding the fact that he rents dwellings and may collect considerable sums in rents, will still be subjected to taxation only on the notional element related to the poor law valuation of his property. You have then the paradoxical situation in which the landlords reap a benefit from this Schedule A property tax while the residential householder is penalised.  There are, of course, many theoretical and doctrinaire arguments in favour of the taxes and these have been referred to at great length in the White Paper circulated a year ago by the Minister as justification for rejecting the recommendation of the commission of inquiry. One argument at paragraph 24 of the White Paper is highly doctrinaire and, in my opinion, utterly illogical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was argued at Paragraph 24 of the White Paper that if the Commission's recommendation were accepted and Schedule A tax on <Col N="1331" /> the owner-occupier abolished, it would be necessary to give a corresponding allowance to the tenant-occupier in respect of the rent he pays. I do not see the sense of that argument at all.  I believe that the person who owns his house, who is perhaps buying it out on mortgage, is in a very different position from the person who is renting a house.  The owner-occupier is a person who, for social reasons, deserves to be encouraged.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Minister may have in mind the cost arising out of that point made in Paragraph 24 of the White Paper, he should get rid of the idea.  Many of the arguments raised in the White Paper&mdash;I do not want to go into them in detail&mdash;are highly doctrinaire and theoretical.  As Deputy Ryan pointed out, other forms of savings are encouraged under the income tax code.  Surely the most desirable form of saving of all is the provision of one's own home.</P>
      <P>The most compelling argument in favour of the abolition of Schedule A tax is that it is a grossly uneconomic tax which is unwieldy and costly to administer.  I remarked half an hour ago that when I asked the Minister a year ago what was the cost of administering the Schedule A tax, he was unable to provide the information. It is a preposterous situation if the Minister has considered the recommendations of the Income Tax Commission and rejected those recommendations without having regard to the real cost of administering the tax. The real cost as pointed out in some of the submissions to the Commission, is bound to be high by reason of the unwieldy nature of the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Minister did tell me a year ago that there were upwards of 40 clerks employed in the Schedule A section of Dublin General District. It is a fact that some of these clerks are engaged in the exercise, the Gilbertian exercise, of notifying Schedule D of assessments when raised &mdash;the amount collected&mdash;and other details so that the Schedule D section may set about the process of cancelling out the assessments.  You are then in the absurd position of losing on the <Col N="1332" /> swings what you gained on the roundabouts. When I questioned the Minister on this matter of administrative costs, he pointed out that the only figure available to him was the cost of administering the income tax code as a whole and that it was only 3.8 per cent. of the revenue collected.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is labouring under the delusion that it is costing him only 3.8 per cent. of the amount effectively collected under Schedule A to administer it, then it is time he rid himself of that impression.  The cost of collecting the tax, having regard to its effective yield, is much more likely to be 50 per cent., or more, than it is to be three per cent.</P>
    <P>Again, as I pointed out previously, in Britain this year, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, under pressure from his own back-benchers, has indicated that next year he will start the process of abolishing Schedule A tax.  We are therefore in the position that a Conservative British Chancellor can adopt a more progressive approach to this question of tax reform than our Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance&mdash;a factor which merely confirms the growing impression of many people that Fianna Fáil are, in reality, a high Tory Conservative Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's views on this matter were set out in paragraphs 15 to 30 of the White Paper on direct taxation which was laid before the House last year.  In Paragraph 30, it was said that in present circumstances the Government were not convinced that owner-occupiers should be relieved of income tax where there is a liability under existing law.  Deputies Ryan and Byrne think that because they recommend the abolition of tax, they are progressive.  You can be progressive by abolishing all tax, if you want to, but where will you progress to?  Then, if I say we are going to retain it, I am a conservative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could we not approach this matter in a less childish manner than to talk about Conservatives and Progressives? If this tax is abolished, it has to be assumed that money will be found in another way.  I do not know what the Deputy will suggest as a progressive <Col N="1333" /> way of getting money, if this is conservative. Perhaps he has something in mind.  We should like to hear what his progressive ideas are.</P>
    <P>The cost of collection in this case is not very high.  The Deputy surely knows that when filling up your income tax form, you state that the valuation of your house is so much, say, £45, that the ground rent is, say, £15, and that you pay income tax on £30, if you are liable to income tax.  Whatever the Revenue Commissioners or their officers may do in checking on that, I do not see how the expense could be very high because it is only part of the income tax collection, in any case.</P>
    <P>It is calculated that at present the yield from this tax in respect of valuations, under £30, is about £300,000. That is higher than the amount given last year by reason of the fact that this year more people are liable to income tax.  Therefore, there are certain houses, I suppose, coming into the income tax orbit that were not there a year ago.  Deputy Ryan, I think, said the tax was complicated and inequitable. I do not know if it is inequitable; I shall have more to say about that. However, I cannot see how this tax is complicated.</P>
    <P>If we decide to abolish the tax on houses up to £30 and to remit the first £30 on houses above £30, that would appear to me to be getting a little bit complicated.  At least you would have the additional task of taking £30 from the total in your income tax form and, to that extent, it would be more complicated.</P>
    <P>The argument was used, in relation to this White Paper, that if there are two people with, say, £2,500 each, and one buys a house while the other puts his money into Government loan, the man who puts his money into Government loan at present will get a dividend of about £150 on which he will pay about £47 in income tax.  The other person, having bought his house, with, say, a valuation of £30 and £10 ground rent, pays on £20, which is about £6, and which is a very big difference indeed.  I think it is hard to justify making the comparison between the two individuals.  A man who has his <Col N="1334" /> £2,500 invested in Government securities is paying rent for his house which, of course, is higher, naturally, than what the owner-occupier is paying by way of ground rent and income tax, if you like, and rates on his house.</P>
    <P>Take then the other case of a man who has no money and who borrows money to buy a house.  He is free of income tax on the amount of interest he pays on his loan.  The house he gets is relieved from rates for some years and there are also grants payable, if it is a new house.  Deputy Ryan pointed out that if this provision were done away with, he could afford to pay for his house, but if it is not done away with, he will have all these reliefs and it is only fair that he should pay something. If the loan is secured by an insurance policy, he is saved the amount of the tax on the premium on that policy as well.</P>
    <P>I do not see that there is a great case to be made for the abolition of this tax.  Deputy Ryan said that we are likely to do it because Britain has done it but the conditions are different in Britain.  Valuations are much higher there and there is a comprehensive revaluation taking place in Britain and Wales in which valuations are being increased twofold and three-fold. If this tax were left in Britain, it would be a serious burden if it were increased twice or three times, as it would be.  It is also a more costly tax to collect in Britain where they have allowances for repairs and for alterations in the houses which are not allowed here because the rateable valuation is supposed to take account of all these things.</P>
    <P>The valuation is based on the net letting value, the net letting value being the letting value, less outgoings such as repairs.  We have a different system of valuation and our valuations are much lower than they are in Britain. There is not the same justification for the remission of income tax on an owner-occupied house here as there is in Britain and I am therefore against the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is really begging the question.  He has made no attempt to make any justification for <Col N="1335" /> this tax and he has made no attempt to explain the cash value of this theoretical income.  He has made no attempt to explain the anomaly between the owner of his own house and the owner of some other goods or chattels.  It is unjustifiable and theoretical income based on outmoded economic concepts evolved by economists who have been discredited in their own country.  Sooner or later, we are going to get around to abolishing this tax, probably some years after Britain has done so.  Some years ago, we had a repairs allowance under Schedule A which was abolished by Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly when he was Minister for Finance in a year in which he probably raised another £10,000 or £15,000 as a result of that abolition.</P>

      <P>This is the section by virtue of which the Minister is taking the increased tax on beer.  It is very significant that in the Minister's Budget speech, the reason he gave for increasing the tax was that it had remained at the same rate since 1952; in other words, the tax remained at the same rate since Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, imposed the very steeply increased rates in 1952.  The effect of this tax in the first quarter of this year, in so far as it is reflected in the figures for excise, is that even though the Minister has increased the tax on beer and spirits, we have got less money from excise taxation than in the first three months of last year.</P>
      <P>I know that excise taxation includes other things than beer and spirits but they are the main tax headings in that section.  It is significant that in spite of the increased rates, the Minister has, in fact, got less money.  We indicated in the Budget debate that we were opposed to this increase and for that reason we oppose the section now.</P>

    <P>Question proposed : &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 is the similar section that deals with the imposition of duty on whiskey, and, again, the only reason the Minister could find in his Budget speech for the introduction of this increase in duty was that the tax had remained at that figure since Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, imposed his substantial increases in 1952.  Just as the imposition in the last section was an imposition which had its effect peculiarly on the less well-off sections of our community, to many of whom a pint of stout is, in fact, almost food, particularly for those who are working hard and who have to take a meal in the middle of work away from home, so also this section has another effect. It will prevent the distillers from having sufficient funds in their resources adequately to bolster up their export sales abroad.</P>
      <P>We all know that it is impossible for a business which has to carry as high overheads as distilling successfully to carry out any export trade, unless that export trade is based on a high home production and, therefore, a high home consumption.  The distillers and the distilling industry are people who are particularly hit, having regard to the amount of their working capital that is affected by any increase in the amount of duty.  We know they have not to pay such duty until the spirits, be it whiskey, gin or even vodka, which is produced here now, is taken from bond.  From the moment it is taken from bond and when the duty goes up, the amount that has to be laid out before it comes back is substantially increased.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the distillers will find that one of the effects of this tax will be to reduce their working capital and by that reduction of their working capital, to hamper them in the drive for exports and for increased sales abroad, sales which not only every member of this House desires from a balance of payments and a balance of trade point of view but also because of their immense effect on the farmers through the production of barley throughout the country.  Ultimately, this tax will be a tax not merely on spending but on industry and on the efficacy of that industry to promote an export drive.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 has the effect of confining the duty as it stands in the Finance Bill to 9th August, 1962.  It also confines hard pressed tobacco to the same period&mdash;9th August, 1962.  Amendment No. 3 then fixes the duty from 9th August, 1962, onwards as it stands in the Finance Bill, plus the equivalent of one penny on the packet of 20 cigarettes as imposed by the Imposition of Duties Order of June last, so that the increased duty, as far as the Finance Bill is concerned, comes into effect on 9th August.  The extra penny is repeated under the Imposition of Duties Act from the time of its imposition in June until 9th August so that, in fact, the extra duty is collected during all that period.  The Schedules are the new Schedules setting out the rates of duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, amendment No. 2 is the amendment which implements the Budget proper up to 9th August, 1962, and amendment No. 3 is the amendment <Col N="1342" /> which adds on to it the supplementary penny Budget.  The two of them are complementary in so far as both of them deal with Section 5, with tobacco as such.  We made it clear on the Financial Resolution relating to tobacco that, in our view, it was highly improper that the Minister should have used the Imposition of Duties Act for the purpose of imposing a revenue duty, such as he did in this case.  We also made it clear that it was in relation to the section rather than the Financial Resolution, we would express our disapproval in the positive way of walking through the Division Lobbies.</P>
      <P>I noted on the Financial Resolution that the Minister made no effort whatever to defend the improper method he had adopted of imposing this type of taxation.  It is not without precedent that a Minister for Finance who wanted an additional Budget should introduce additional Financial Resolutions. The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Aiken, did that in the preparations in this House for the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947.  Much though one objected to the additional impositions made at that time&mdash;impositions remitted in large part almost immediately afterwards by the inter-Party Government as soon as they got into office&mdash;one could not criticise the procedure adopted.  That is not the case now.  This is the crystallisation in Finance Bill form of the procedure adopted by the Minister for Finance on 13th June last when he utilised this Act, which was put through this House for the purpose of protecting Irish industry, as the means of obtaining Government revenue and as the means, self-confessed, of obtaining Government revenue because it was easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have heard about how easy it is to start on the slippery slope.  I want to make it perfectly clear by our recording our views in relation to this that we do not approve of the scheme adopted by the Minister, that we do not think it is right that taxation should be levied in the initial instance by any method except by Resolution of this House and that we do not think it is proper that the Government should know so little about <Col N="1343" /> their own business as to change their mind within a period of six or seven weeks after the original Budget was introduced. We had several attempts at Budgets this year.  Within a period of six or seven weeks after the main Budget, we had the Minister for Finance coming in here, admitting that all his claims in relation to what was going to happen to the economy in the current year were wrong and that he had to bring in a supplementary Budget. That is exactly what it was.  It was not a supplementary Budget which was going to produce any benefit to anybody but which was to restore something removed in the period of a few weeks previously and on which our Leader, Deputy Dillon, and I expressed strongest objection at the time.</P>
    <P>But, leaving out entirely the reason for or purpose of raising the taxation, to do so in this manner was all wrong. To do so by deliberately setting town against country in the manner in which the Minister segregated the proceeds of a particular tax for the purpose of meeting a particular demand has started a new and entirely unsatisfactory discussion throughout the country.  It has created bitterness of feeling between town and country that all previous Ministers for Finance have always properly avoided.  It would be just the same if, say, in relation to the taxes we have just been talking about on beer and spirits the retailer in a shop said categorically &ldquo;I am adding a penny to the price of that glass of whiskey so that I can pay my man Michael an additional wage there and then on the spot.&rdquo;  That is not the way in which Ministers for Finance should operate and not the way in which taxation should be imposed by Government duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I detest the method whereby this tax is put on.  It strikes at the fundamental process of our system of Government by seeking to withdraw from Dáil Éireann the exclusive prerogative of imposing taxation for revenue purposes.  It was a careless, shiftless thing for any Minister for Finance to do and it has established a most undesirable precedent which, if adopted hereafter, <Col N="1344" /> materially abridges the authority of Oireachtas Éireann.  I detest the method.  I detest the slipshod procedure of a Government which, well knowing that Bord Bainne had levied a penny a gallon on milk, presented its Budget to Dáil Éireann, made no provision for any compensatory payment and then subsequently shifted its ground and introduced by this disedifying method a new tax to raise additional revenue to offset the penny per gallon that had been levied on milk by Bord Bainne.</P>
      <P>It is an interesting fact that the operation of collecting the levy and restoring the penny will cost £30,000. Simply because the Government wobbled between the imposition of the levy on milk and its restoration from the Treasury, this country will have the pleasure of paying £30,000 towards meeting expenses in order to cover up the vacillating tracks of a Government that do not know their own mind and have not got the guts to stick to their own policy for a fortnight on end.</P>
      <P>I detest this tax because although in this year we have appropriated £5,000,000 for the salaries of civil servants, although we have appropriated a substantial sum to increase the salaries of the judges, although we have appropriated large sums to confer increases over a very wide range of public employees, in no single case has it been stated in Dáil Éireann that any specific tax was appropriated for the purpose of paying this additional remuneration save when it came to restoring the penny per gallon to milk which this Government had, through Bord Bainne, taken off.  When that falls to be corrected, we are informed that tobacco must be taxed in order to give farmers a penny a gallon on milk.  That is exacerbated by the fact that the penny a gallon referred to was the penny a gallon this Government by their legislation took off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when they brought into this House the Bill to establish Bord Bainne, I warned Dáil Éireann that the sole function of Bord Bainne was to act as a cover up for the Government when they wanted to levy milk, so that the Minister could come in here and <Col N="1345" /> like Pontius Pilate, wash his hands and say: &ldquo;I had nothing to do with it; it was done by Bord Bainne&rdquo;&mdash;and that is exactly what happened.  Then when the pressure became strong enough the Minister says: &ldquo;Very well; we must tax tobacco to give back the 1d.&rdquo;  The final and most egregious element in the insult is that the people who will pay the greater part of the tax are the farmers themselves.</P>
    <P>The 1d. they will get out of this tax &mdash;and they will pay more than half of it themselves&mdash;represents no addition whatever to the income they enjoyed in 1957.  In 1957, every other element of the community got a substantial increase in their incomes, save only the farmers.  When will Dáil Éireann wake up to the fact that the bulk of the farmers are self-employed?  They are as much labouring men as any trade unionist in Ireland; they are as much labouring men as any bus conductor, railway employee or building labourer; but they work for themselves. They have no employer other than themselves, but their income, far from growing since 1957, has tended downwards.</P>
    <P>They had a considerable volume of employment in rural Ireland in 1957 out of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That is now gone.  They had an income from turkeys and fowl. That is gone.  They had some income from eggs.  That is gone.  They are now producing milk and they are told tobacco must be taxed in order to restore it to the level of the price which obtained five years ago.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, they are asked to pay more tax on drink, more tax on tobacco, more for bus fares, more for electricity where they have got it, more for almost any service they enjoy.  What is the result?  They are leaving the land.  And what is the remedy?  The Government set up commissions to make reports to tell them what is happening and why the people are flying from the farms in the west and north-west, the south and south-west.  They do not know.</P>
    <P>Who is driving them off the land? Who is making it no longer possible for people to live on holdings of 20 or 30 acres?  The Fianna Fáil Government. <Col N="1346" /> They are doing it because they have piled up consistently on the people who occupy holdings of that kind growing volumes of expenses, and burdens of taxes which they have admitted required the sixth, seventh and eighth rounds of wage increases to compensate the judges&mdash;with £6,000 a year&mdash;the Civil Service, the Garda and the employees of local authorities. All those must have two or three rounds of increases but the small farmer who will have to pay at least half of this tax is to be grateful&mdash;he is expected by the Fianna Fáil Party to be grateful&mdash;for being given back the 1d. they took from him on his gallon of milk, with the proviso that he must pay one half of the restoration out of his own pocket.</P>
    <P>You are all mad.  The Fianna Fáil Party are tearing to pieces the social fabric of the best part of the country. They know it, and their remedy is to set up commissions to tell them what to do.  There is one remedy for the disintegration of the property-owning community on the land of Ireland, and that is for the Fianna Fáil Party to vanish.  If they do not, we may well lose the whole pattern of the small farmers of Ireland and if we do, we will wake up one morning to discover that the country has become like the Cheshire cat&mdash;a smile without a body behind it.  Posterity will have a verdict to pass on that achievement which will be even more shocking than the verdict they will pass on the history of Fianna Fáil to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon started his speech by implying that he is a prophet; he ended by being a demagogue. The small farmers of Ireland will see to it that Fianna Fáil do not vanish and the Deputy may make his mind easy on that point.  There are, undoubtedly, problems to be solved for the farmers, but they are not solved by trying to cloud the issue, at which Deputy Dillon has been an expert for the past 20 years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why can we not go back and take this matter step by step and see what has been done?  Does not every Deputy know that the people in the milk industry, the dairy industry, were clamouring for a marketing board?  I <Col N="1347" /> have heard it here for years&mdash;a marketing board&mdash;and the Fine Gael Party also favoured it.  A committee was appointed, composed largely of people from the creamery industry, to find out what type of board we should have. They gave a report, and a Bill was brought in to implement it.  That Bill was passed, by the way, with the full support of every member of the Dáil. Fine Gael tell us now that they warned us about certain things and that they did not like certain points, but they did not vote against anything.  It is no great trouble to get Fine Gael to vote against anything.  They challenge divisions often enough and they are not a bit shy about it, but they did not do that when that Bill was going through.</P>
    <P>The Bill went through and the board was set up, again composed largely of people from the creamery industry.  It was a statutory obligation on that board to impose a levy to pay part of the export bounty, which they did. That was their part of the business. When that was done, we had to consider whether the dairy farmer should be asked to bear a cut in his income from milk and we decided we should compensate him and at least bring his income up to the point at which it was previously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman said we did not make proper provision in our Budget. It was because I thought we had made the exact provision necessary, and no more, that I expressed my opinion to the Government that we would have to <Col N="1348" /> raise taxation to recoup ourselves and we decided that a tax on tobacco was the least objectionable tax that could be imposed to meet the situation, and it was done in that way.  I do not see how we could avoid the situation in which some people would say: &ldquo;We are paying this tax to compensate the dairy farmers.&rdquo;  If people are saying that&mdash;and I do not know if it is general for people to make that remark&mdash;it cannot be helped.  As regards the method by which it was done, I suppose there is room there for a difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>I have explained before that at the time it was urgent to do something, if we were to get even the greater part of what will be paid out during the year.  It was obvious that it was being done only a few weeks&mdash;about three weeks&mdash;before the Dáil would have an opportunity to discuss it, as it is discussing it now.  I do not know if we can be accused of any great sin in raising money in that way but, as I say, there is room for a difference of opinion on that point.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;( )  For the purposes of the Licensing Acts and the Registration of Clubs Acts a meal served in any premises after the commencement of this Act shall not be deemed to be a substantial meal unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the meal is such as might be expected to be served as a main midday or main evening meal or as a main course at either such meal, and</P>
    <P>(b) the meal is of a kind for which&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii) if meals are not normally served in the premises, having regard to all the circumstances,</P>
    <P>it would be reasonable to charge a sum that is not less than&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I) the sum (if any) that for the time being stands fixed under subsection (2) of this section, or</P>
    <P>(II) if no sum stands fixed for the time being under the said subsection (2), five shillings.&rdquo;&mdash; (Minister for Justice.)</P>

      <P>When we interrupted the debate on the last occasion, I was explaining that the definition of a substantial meal is important from two different aspects. It is important in so far as it governs the circumstances in which restaurants of the various types I mentioned are permitted to serve drink after the ordinary closing hour to customers who are having a meal.  The definition is important to ensure that that provision is not abused and that the position will obtain where people will be having a <Col N="1356" /> drink with their meals and not having a meal as an excuse to drink after hours.  We want to bring about a situation in which a person who is <i>bona fide</i> having a substantial meal will be entitled to have a drink with that meal up to a certain hour.</P>
      <P>The definition is also important in another respect.  The Bill contains important provisions governing the sale of drink in dance halls.  The definition is of very considerable importance in that regard.  Broadly speaking, the Bill provides that an unlicensed dance hall will not be able, apart from four occasions in the year, to serve a drink at which a substantial meal is provided and similarly in regard to the type of function such as an annual &ldquo;at home&rdquo; of a sports club.  Again, it will be possible to procure an occasional licence for a function of that sort only if a substantial meal is provided. Therefore, Deputies will realise that the definition is of very considerable importance in regard to these two aspects of the licensing laws.</P>
      <P>I feel that the definition we propose is a reasonable one.  I think it will close the loopholes which exist in regard to this matter at the moment. I feel that the sum mentioned, 5/-, is a reasonable one.  However, in the event of its proving to be unrealistic, the Bill provides that the Minister for Justice may, by order, from time to time increase it to whatever figure he thinks is necessary.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say, in view of the objection from urban and rural areas, that he would be prepared to consider the point I made about places in urban and rural areas which are not capable of providing a substantial meal at dances?  I know it is not in the section.  I want to tie it in with the point I made before.  When we come to Section 9, would the Minister say he will consider the point I am making?  It is not possible to comply with what the Minister suggested without depriving some rural and urban people of the right to hold a dance with a bar.</P>

      <P>I think the trend which has been increasing in recent years, that all dances must have a bar and must have drink sold at them is socially undesirable.  One of the principal features of this Bill is an endeavour to control that tendency.  The Bill provides, in effect, that six special festive occasions in the year are allowed to every dance hall and that, normally, it will not be possible to sell drink at the ordinary 5/- hop, as we call it.  It may be sold only at a special type of dance&mdash;for instance, the annual dance of a club or the staff dance of a factory, or an organisation of that sort &mdash;at which a meal is provided.  The idea behind the Bill is that the sale of drink at the ordinary dance is to be done away with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to bother the Minister but I must put the point of view to him as I see it in my area. The Minister speaks of six festive occasions in the year.  I take it that that is for different premises within a particular area.  Take an area where there is only one premises.  In such a case, would the Minister be prepared to accept the extension of the number to, say, ten?  I am not looking for anything impossible.  I know what the Minister is trying to eradicate.  However, I want to give a fair chance to the people in the area I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am 100 per cent. behind the Minister in what he is seeking to achieve by this Bill.  At the same time, I want to be fair.  Can the Minister give me an assurance, even on Report Stage, in regard to the point I am making now and will make when we come to the section?  Can he say he will be prepared to consider extending that number, say, to ten, where there is maybe only one dance hall in existence in an area?  Would the Minister be prepared to consider that?  I want to vote with the Minister.  I do not want to oppose the Bill because I <Col N="1358" /> think it is a good Bill, but I do not want to be tied in with what I think might be awfully wrong for my constituency.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to conceive what kind of a meal a person could get for 5/- in any decent restaurant, especially at night.  You are always overcharged at night because the owners of these places have to pay overtime to their staff after a certain hour.  In Paris, it would cost £5 for a substantial meal but we are not in Paris.  What would you get for 5/- after 12 o'clock at night here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to clear up this point because I know there is a case pending and we have several borderline cases in my constituency.  The questions put to the Minister by Deputies Belton and Sherwin are the very questions that have been put to me by the people concerned.  They are these borderline cases of a Guard going in while John Murphy or Paddy Burke are sitting down in a restaurant, a meal having been ordered and a drink comes about half a minute before the meal.  These are cases of people who went in for a meal and had a drink, and I should not like it to be part of our legislation that these people could be prosecuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like this section to be left so wide that a pernickety man can come along and question the whole thing.  I would like an indication given that the section will be administered reasonably, without being left open to abuse.  We had a case in south County Dublin recently in which a section of the old 1903 Liquor Act was cited.  I have not got the section with me but <Col N="1360" /> the prosecution case was that while the people had quite a substantial meal, they were finishing up with a drink and, under the meaning of the Act, they had not had a drink with the meal.</P>
    <P>If a person genuinely goes in and gets the top of the bill in a hotel or public house with a restaurant licence we should not make this section possible of interpretation by perhaps one per cent. of the Garda so that that person can be accused of not having the meal with the drink.  I appeal to the Minister, before the Report Stage, to consolidate this section in such a way that when a person goes in for a substantial meal and has a drink, he cannot be put in Sally Jones's locker and prosecuted and the proprietor also prosecuted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on what Deputy Burke has said, I should like to say that it is accepted by the public and accepted also by the licensed trade that if I go into a hotel or restaurant to have a meal at 10 o'clock at night and remain sitting at the diningroom table after the conclusion of the meal, I will be permitted to sit there and continue drinking until 12.30 a.m.  I gather that that is the position under this section.  The public and the licensed trade at the moment believe that is the position and that is the way they operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this section, the question arises for several Deputies and myself of what is a substantial meal.  The Minister is going to make it possible for anybody with a restaurant licence to run a very late night session and to make a good profit for himself.  If people are out for an evening or a night, there are young people and older people who will take advantage of this and you could have people running restaurants who would be glad to take advantage of those two words &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo;.  I can visualise a man advertising traditional Irish dishes on the inside or the outside of his premises.  He would be doing a fair business during the day and in after hours when people wanted a drink, he could serve two or three people, who were prepared to pay <Col N="1361" /> for it, with bowls of porridge.  If the Guards came, he could stick to his claim that it was an Irish dish and say he was serving stirabout.  It would be very difficult for a judge to say that a bowl of stirabout was not a substantial meal.  This section will leave itself open to great abuses and will cause great hardship to clubs in the country. Take, for example, an area where there is only one dancehall and there can be only four dances in the year which can be licensed without serving supper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We will stick to the substantial meal.  A friend of mine came from Donegal the other day and what happened to him was the reverse of what Deputy Sherwin was talking about in regard to prices.  I believe there is a very good fish and chip shop in County Donegal and this man was served grilled salmon and chips for 3/6d.  It could be possible in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible in times when there is a glut or even in times when there was no glut, for a man to serve salmon at that price.  This is only a ticket to allow him to serve drink after hours.  It is another abuse of a substantial meal.  I am sure the Minister should be able to find in his records, or from the officials of his Department, cases in which the law was set at nought in London by night clubs illegally serving drink with the substantial meal.  The substantial meal sometimes consisted of a plate of chicken bones from which the people had not eaten but which were placed before them as an excuse to run an after hours business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Minister is opening up and as surely as he passes this, that is what will happen.  I should like the Minister to say how the 5/- is to be measured.  You can be charged 5/- now in a restaurant for anything, especially <Col N="1362" /> if it is served after hours.  It is only a means of holding up a customer for an extra 5/- because he wants to get a few drinks after hours.  I do not think the Minister is justified in bringing in this section.  As I said on other sections, I do not think there is any demand for it.  If we are to have drinking in a licensed premises, let us have drinking in a licensed premises so that a man can go in and stand at the counter or sit down in the lounge and have a drink served, but do not provide this excuse of the substantial meal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with the Minister on this question of a substantial meal.  I think he is doing the right thing.  I also think that Deputy Lynch has been posing questions to the Minister which he has answered.</P>

If he reads the amendment, he will find that the Minister has made it quite clear what a substantial meal is, as clear as it is humanly possible to make it, plus a costing.  This is an extension of the drinking hours, over and above what the ordinary public house has a right to, for hotels and restaurants. All that I want to say other than that is that the only fear I have is: if I vote with the Minister on this amendment will I trap myself into agreeing <Col N="1363" /> to something on Section 9?  If the Minister could give me an assurance on that, I should be glad to go into the lobby and vote with him.</P>

Apart from the fact that it is always a pleasant thing for him to do at any time, he will not be committing himself with regard to the point he wants to make on Section 9.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is also of importance with regard to the occasions on which we will permit dancehalls to serve drink but this section is concerned only with defining a substantial meal for that purpose.  It does not say anything about the number of occasions on which we are going to permit that sort of licence to be granted.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies are unnecessarily worried about this matter.  As the law stands at present, there is a concept of a substantial meal.  That concept is important in relation to a number of matters.  There are a number of situations in which it is permissible to serve drink after the ordinary hours, provided that drink is served with a substantial meal.  Up to now, no attempt has been made to define a substantial meal.  Section 7, as it is proposed to amend it, is concerned with rectifying that and with stipulating what we really mean by a substantial meal.  When we provide in the Bill at any point that drink may be served with a substantial meal, we mean that and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not anticipate any difficulty <Col N="1364" /> in the operation of this section.  I have wellfounded and justifiable belief in the capacity of the Garda to administer this sort of thing in a reasonable, commonsense way.  I think that every Deputy will agree with me in that belief.  We have no reason to believe that the Garda are going to take finicky, pinpricking prosecutions in relation to this matter.  The intention of the legislation is quite clear that where a person is having a substantial meal in certain circumstances, he will be entitled to have a drink with it.</P>
    <P>We could go into all sorts of abstractions but the simple issue is this: If you are having a substantial meal, in those circumstances, you are entitled to have a drink with that meal.  At what time the meal ends is something we need not worry about.  If this provision is just used as an excuse to serve drink after hours illegally with a porkpie or something like that, then a prosecution will be taken.  I have complete faith in the capacity of the Garda to administer it in a sensible and realistic way.  I am sure they will not go in for any of these pinpricking prosecutions about which Deputies seem to be worrying.</P>
    <P>In matters of this sort, experience will dictate whether or not anything further should be done with regard to the operation of this by administrative action.  In a large number of these matters, it is necessary from time to time for the Commissioner to issue instructions for the guidance of the Garda throughout the country as to how to interpret various sections so that the interpretation will be uniform. If there are any really serious discrepancies arising out of the administration of this Act, they will be dealt with in that way by simple administrative instructions to the Garda by the Commissioner.  I do not anticipate that there will be any&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Only an hour is right.  The Minister mentioned pinpricking. I am drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that the Guards will have difficulty in administering the law and making up their minds as to what a substantial meal is.  That is where the difficulty lies.</P>

      <P>If a restaurant owner wanted to dodge the law, he could sell bowls of porridge and if any Guard said that was not legal or that it was not a substantial meal, he could tell the Guard something about where he came from and so forth.  I am pointing out the great loophole in this.  Someone spoke about fish and chips.  One could <Col N="1367" /> have a little bit of salmon and a few chips but again you are dodging the column.  You are charged 5/- and this is a ticket to enable you to drink for an hour.  As much drink can be called for as people want, provided they are prepared to pay for it.  The Minister stated he was hoping to restrict the amount of drinking but I do not think he will restrict the amount of drinking at all.</P>

Of course, the person desiring fish and chips would be entitled to drink a litre of wine or whatever amount of wine he wanted.  I agree with the Minister's predecessor that there should always be provision whereby a person can get a drink with a meal.  There were loopholes in the past to such an extent that the purchase of a sandwich was adequate to secure a drink but I cannot see that happening in the future, having regard to the prospect of uniformity.  I accept the Minister's assurance that certain directions will be issued to the Garda, in which case I agree with this provision in the Bill, although I cannot say I agree with certain other sections.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), lines 35 to 37, to delete &ldquo;of special festivity that will be likely to attract a considerable number of persons&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;during which a considerable number of persons will be likely to be attracted&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 as originally proposed in the Bill was designed to cater for problems that arise especially in small towns when there is a gala occasion&mdash;an <Col N="1368" /> occasion when there are festivities of such a nature that they are likely to attract considerable numbers of people from all over the country.  This is not, of course, a question of facilities for drinking.  It is a question of providing shelter, meals, toilet accommodation&mdash; facilities of such a kind as are often strained to the limit on occasions of this kind.  Some people have pointed out to me that in certain places in the country there are occasions where these very problems arise just as severely as they do in the case of a gala occasion, but they were not covered in Section 8 as originally devised.</P>
    <P>The section speaks specifically of the period of such festivity and the purpose of the section is to grant to any one town during any one period in the year a period not exceeding eight days when it can have specially extended hours such as the district court may decide.  The original Section 8 spoke exclusively of periods of special festivity.  Deputies will not have any trouble in thinking of certain areas where the same situation obtains once a year but where it could not be described as a period of special festivity, so the simple purpose of these two amendments is to remove from Section 8 the notion that festivities are essential to the granting of this concession.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the Minister's amendment but it is necessary that we should be careful in designing sections such as this.  When discussing his last amendment, the Minister referred to the fact that the intention of the Legislature was such and such.  I did not want to interrupt him then when he was talking <i>vis-à-vis</i> the enforcement of the intention of the Legislature through the courts.  I think the Minister will agree it is the task of the courts to interpret the law as passed by the Legislature in the words in which the legislation is framed and that the courts cannot interpret the intention of the Legislature. For that reason we have to be careful that the words we use convey the intention of the House.  In dealing with his amendments on this section, the Minister said this provision is intended to apply to any town.  The <Col N="1369" /> wording in the section, which I took to be deliberate, was &ldquo;any locality&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>During the discussion on this section it is appropriate to call the Minister's attention to a state of affairs which this section will remedy if it occurs in the future. The fleadh ceoil was held in Swinford in 1961 from, I think, 20th to 22nd May.  It was a three-day affair.  The town of Swinford normally has a population of not more than about 1,000 people and has something like 50 licensed premises.  During the three days of the fleadh ceoil in May, 1961, the population of the area was swollen to something between 30,000 and 40,000 and a state of affairs existed there in which all these thousands of visitors had to get accommodation as best they could.</P>
      <P>They were accommodated all over the place, in private houses, business houses, licensed premises and elsewhere. In fact, a number of them had to sleep in their cars because they could not get accommodation.  I must be careful on this because I do not want to discuss something which to some extent may be <i>sub judice</i>, but I think the Minister is aware that in the particular circumstances, in the confusion existing in that place and the urgency of the occasion, a number of holders of licences found it quite impossible to get their premises cleared within the permitted hours and as a result there were floods of summonses issued against publicans in the town, all related to offences alleged to have been committed within the three-day period of the fleadh ceoil.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind. It would be relevant on the section, but having gone so far, I might as well <Col N="1370" /> complete the point I am making to the Minister.  As the law stands at the moment, though all these summonses related to a particular special period, the licence holders are in jeopardy, if convicted on foot of more than three summonses, of losing their licences because of endorsements.  Section 8, particularly with the amendments which the Minister proposes to make in it, will to a great extent safeguard against that kind of thing happening again.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I am correct or not, but it may be because of the experience in relation to the fleadh ceoil in Swinford that this section was introduced into the Bill.  I want to ask the Minister to consider between now and Report Stage the possibility of giving this section retrospective effect to the extent of indemnifying the publicans of Swinford who were caught in that unfortunate position in May of last year.  I do not think it would be doing any injustice to look at the matter in that light and it would in fact relieve the publicans of what could be intolerable hardship.  The Minister is providing that from now on in similar circumstances, no offence will be committed against the licensing code.  I do not think anybody in the House would feel that an injustice was being done to any section of the community by legislating to that extent retrospectively in this section.</P>

      <P>The only point I wanted to make clear is that Section 8 is expected to cater for precisely the sort of situation which arises when a fleadh ceoil is held.  The fleadh ceoil is only one of the types of function we have in mind.  There are race meetings, opera festivals, music festivals and so on.  The idea is now becoming more common throughout the country that every locality should have at least one of these special occasions during the year.  We will all agree that that is eminently desirable. This section is designed to allow each locality eight days in the year for such an event.  The fleadh ceoil is the function that comes immediately to mind.  To my mind, the fleadh ceoil is one of the most wonderful and encouraging things that have emerged in rural Ireland in recent times.  It is a tremendous thing that 30,000 people can come together, perhaps in a small rural town, to listen to traditional Irish music, as happens on occasions of this sort.</P>

There were festivals in Cork, Dublin and other places which brought starlets nobody ever heard of before or after, but who cost a lot of the taxpayers' money.  The idea was to attract tourists, but no tourists came, only the starlets. <Col N="1372" /> We had places where they had opera nobody ever heard of or wanted to hear.

I asked some of the high executives of the Tourist Board what they thought of it and they admitted to me that it was the first time they saw so many tourists coming.  They came in droves from South Wales and many other places.  They made merry and the danger in this section is that these people might be able to have wassail on only eight nights of the week and have to have sackcloth and ashes on the other nine.

      <P>I said on Second Stage that the section refers to &ldquo;any locality not in the county borough of Dublin&rdquo;.  There are occasions when the festivities or parish activities would comply with what is proposed in this section.  In my constituency there is the Kimmage-Crumlin Sports Development Association.  It is a registered association and it holds what is known as a Kimmage-Crumlin week every year, which includes such activities as might take place at a fleadh: Irish traditional music, dancing, boxing, football matches, and eventually they hope to have a swimming gala in the parish.  It is now proposed to build a swimming pool.</P>
      <P>The planning of the activities of the association is very good.  Children in the area took responsibility for the trees.  Boys were put in charge of one tree each.  The period of these festivities is regarded as a special occasion for one week.  The type of exemption they would look for would be to have the public houses open between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>For the organisers and adults of the association to have a sandwich and a drink.  That place is not overloaded with cafés and restaurants&mdash;there is no demand for them&mdash; but there are several licensed premises that serve small meals.</P>
      <P>The main question is whether or not this section should apply to Dublin.  I think there is good reason why it should.  Another matter I have in mind is that this week in Dún Laoghaire&mdash; admittedly the weather spoilt it to some extent&mdash;the International Yachting Club held its regatta.  Next Saturday the Royal St. George Yacht Club are having their regatta.  The Dublin Bay Sailing Club decided to run a regatta for an entire week.  Last Saturday there were over 200 boats sailing at that regatta and from Cork, Waterford, Wicklow and Dublin large numbers of people came to witness the festivities.  The club had an extension and the regatta was very successful, but there are other activities such as prize givings during the year, and they cannot be expected to use up all the extensions for this one week's activities.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure every Dublin Deputy knows of parish activities in respect of which a case could be made for an exemption under this section, particularly during the midday closing hour rather than after 11.30 p.m.  I think 11.30 p.m. has been generally accepted as late enough for everyone, if we are to close public houses at all, as I said before.</P>
      <P>Whatever the administrative difficulties might be, I should like the Minister to consider making this section apply to Dublin.  If you like, the word used in the section could be &ldquo;parish&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;locality&rdquo;.  The wards would probably be far too big. There is very good reason why the section should apply to the whole country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say in reply that Deputy Lemass has answered himself?  Of course, nothing would please me more than to make this concession available to Dublin, but it just simply would not work.  It would be impracticable.  The section provides that the application must be <Col N="1375" /> made by the holders of licences who have been able to show, &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Court that the application has the approval of a majority of the holders of licences in respect of premises so situate...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, the majority of the publicans in the locality must agree on what period is involved.  Of course, that just would not work in Dublin.  There is always something going on in Dublin and you would never get a majority of the publicans to agree on any one period.</P>
      <P>That is the simple practical consideration but we have to have regard to the fact that one could think of at least ten different periods in the year when one would like to invoke this provision for Dublin City, but what would we pick?</P>

      <P>I should like briefly to draw the Minister's attention to a consideration of a matter which I raised already.  I think it is more in order to talk about it on the section.  I refer to the Fleadh Ceoil held in Swinford in 1960.  As I explained briefly&mdash;and the Minister is probably well aware of the position already&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for three days in May of 1961, Swinford, which normally has a population of about 1,000, found itself confronted with a situation where there was an influx of visitors to the extent of 30,000 or 40,000.  They had to be catered for <Col N="1376" /> and they were, I understand, extremely well catered for through the energy and kindness of a local committee which went to endless trouble to see that the national Fleadh Ceoil held in Swinford was a success.</P>
      <P>Owing to the very, very large influx of visitors which, as I say, increased the population from some 1,000 souls to nearly 40,000 souls for the two or three days, it was necessary to have those people billeted all around the town, and it was necessary for licensed premises as well as private houses to take them in.  The licensed premises which had to take them in, in the national interest&mdash;I do not think that is putting it too far&mdash;found that they were unable to clear their houses inside the permitted hours.  Summonses have been issued to them arising out of that very limited period.</P>
      <P>As the law stands at the moment, if these publicans are convicted, their licences are in jeopardy.  I cannot help feeling that the house as a whole would think it was not fair that that situation should be allowed to arise. I know it is extremely difficult to word an amendment which will cover that kind of contingency exactly, but I would appeal to the Minister to ask his advisers to see if they can bring in an amendment which will safeguard the publicans in Swinford who unfortunately found themselves in the position I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the prosecutions in Swinford arising out of the Swinford fleadh ceoil have not yet been determined has led a lot of people to believe that the prosecutions will be dropped.  As things stand at the moment, that is not the position. Various questions arose in the country and the justice adjourned consideration of a number of the prosecutions pending the outcome of a certain case stated to the Supreme Court.  I think in the result the Supreme Court was no help to Swinford, so that the position is that these people are not in danger but they are certain to lose their licences by endorsement as things stand at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Swinford was responsible for the framing of this section, that <Col N="1377" /> what happened in Swinford last year must certainly have influenced the Minister in drafting the section which caters precisely for the situation which arose at that time.  It is also fair to say that when the 1960 Act was passed, that sort of situation was not envisaged so that Swinford people found themselves in a situation which was not envisaged when new legislation was passed in the previous year but which, as a result of their experience, is now being covered in the next year.</P>
    <P>While I do not approve of the attitude taken up on behalf of the publicans, more particularly by those who sought to make Party political capital out of it, I still think it would be unfair to victimise these individuals. The justice accepted beyond doubt that the owners, some permanent, some temporary, of the premises at which this enormous influx of people arrived were literally helpless.  They could not get the throng out of their premises. I was present at one of the fleadh ceoil and I confirm that it would have been humanly impossible to get these people out of some of the more densely-packed licensed premises.  One man, even with a staff of 12 and assisted by a half-dozen Gardai if they could be spared, would be quite incapable of removing what Peter Sellers once described as &ldquo;the vast concord of people&rdquo;.  They could not be got out. That was abundantly proved and fully accepted in the court but the position at the time was that the law was there and had to be reckoned with.  That is still the position but that will not happen again, as a result of the passing of this section, and the next time there is a concourse of people in Swinford or Ballydehob, they can avail of the provisions of this section to have extended hours for refreshment.</P>
    <P>In backing up what Deputy O'Higgins has said, I suggest the Minister should insert a short section that would not be drafted in any vague way so as to tend to disguise what we are doing.  That section could be put in to deal specifically with the Swinford situation and could empower the justice to dispose of all the cases by fine.  If such a section were put in, <Col N="1378" /> I think fair play could be achieved all round.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is appropriate to mention on this section the position that arises in regard to &ldquo;Reek Sunday&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reek week-end&rdquo; as I suppose it should properly be described, when people start climbing the mountain any time on Saturday night or the following Sunday.  It seems to me that the people of Westport could not avail of the provisions of this section because they would need them, possibly, for the sea-angling festival or something else of longer duration. Again, I think experience has proved in the past two years that the 1960 Act, while making a very laudable effort to put everybody into the same straitjacket failed to do so because situations arose which had not been envisaged and for which, in fairness as apart from statute, provision should have been made.  The principle of uniformity was the sacred cow at the time and that was why the straitjacket had to be applied in circumstances where it should not have applied at all.  I strongly urge the Minister, even though I have nothing to gain in any way as regards the people of Swinford because they are no longer constituents of mine &mdash;if they were, it would not make any difference &mdash; that, in fairness, they should get this provision.</P>

      <P>I wonder if the Minister would clarify this point?  I have not been a very good attender for this discussion but if the Minister has said so already, he can reply in a few words.  Does this period of special exemption mean but one period in the year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That means if there is a period of special festivity lasting, say, for two days in any town, the other six days are just wasted.  It also means that if the Waterford Light Opera Festival, the Wexford Music Festival or the Swinford festival do not extend for the full eight days, any other <Col N="1379" /> society cannot take up the balance.  It, therefore, means that places like Waterford, Wexford and Cork and perhaps Swinford, if there is a period of special festivity in one of them, cannot have two festivals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on behalf of my neighbours in Swinford which was the principal town in the old constituency of East Mayo.  There are special circumstances in this case. For the fleadh ceoil, I think 30,000 people descended on the town, a town with a population of about 1,100.  It was generally assumed, I think, that some relaxation of the regulations would be sanctioned when that happened. These things look very different in retrospect from what they look in the presence of an emergency, but I think it is true that everybody in Swinford, including those in the most responsible position, took the view that the emergency of catering for the people was such that it was fantastic to send them away without any refreshment.</P>
      <P>There is a peculiar situation obtaining in certain towns in that part of the country, the exact historical reasons for which I do not know, but it is a fact that in Swinford, with a population of between 1,000 and 1,100 people there are 56 public houses, with the result that if all these houses at that time were to conform to the licensing law as it then stood, it meant that practically every catering establishment in the town was closed against the people and there was no means of giving them any refreshment at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general principle, people ought not to disregard the law, but in practice if you are dealing with an <Col N="1380" /> emergency, you do the best you can. I do not see how any rational community with 56 licensed houses could say to 30,000 people whom they had invited into the town: &ldquo;We decline to open for any purpose, good, bad or indifferent in order to provide you with refreshment.&rdquo;  It would be wiser, of course, if they had anticipated that problem and chosen another day or done something of that kind, but we cannot have a fleadh ceoil except on a Sunday and they walked into it.</P>
    <P>It is now becoming abundantly clear that we are prepared to take cognisance of this kind of situation in the amending legislation before us.  If the law is strictly enforced as it stood in 1961, many of these publicans must lose their licence because they have received three, four, five or some of them, six summonses in respect of the one day.  Whatever we may feel about the strict observance of the law, I doubt if there is any rational Deputy who feels that the publicans of Swinford, having met the emergency which undoubtedly existed as best they knew how, should now find themselves faced with being put out of business altogether.</P>
    <P>I am just wondering if Raheny were a little more remote from the city of Dublin and the Minister and his neighbours had been concerned as to how they should cater for 30,000 in a similar situation, would he on that occasion have advised the publicans to close their doors and send the people away or would he have said to them: &ldquo;We are faced with an emergency.  We had better make the best fist of it we can <i>ex post facto</i> in the situation which confronts us and which was never anticipated in the licensing laws in the past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I look upon myself as a law-abiding man and attach great importance to the observance of the law in its letter by responsible people.  I am not at all sure that if I had been consulted in regard to that matter while there was that multitude in the town of Swinford I would not have said: &ldquo;You will have to feed the people; make the best fist you can of it <i>ex post facto.</i>&rdquo; I do not believe the Garda authorities or the Executive can be so unreasonable <Col N="1381" /> as to assert that no exception should ever be made, even in the presence of an emergency.  If the parish priest and the others responsible for organising the fleadh ceoil had come to any of us and said: &ldquo;If we cannot invite the people to some refreshment, we cannot have any fleadh ceoil.  We want to bring 30,000 people into the town to have an enjoyable day and go home happy&rdquo;, how many of us would have said: &ldquo;You should not have a fleadh ceoil?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These fleadhanna ceoil are a very desirable rural development.  If I had been asked before they were ever started was there any prospect of their succeeding, I would have taken the view there was not the slightest but, simple as is the amusement, concerned with Irish music, dancing, fellows playing the melodeon or fiddle or singing songs, they are a greater success than more elaborate and better organised festivals.  I have seen feiseanna which have drawn a couple of thousand people but a fleadh ceoil can draw 20,000, 30,000 or 40,000 people.  I suppose it is the informality of the whole affair.  They seem to constitute part of a very desirable form of rural occupation.  If we do not do something <i>ad hoc</i> to meet these people who fortunately are politically a very mixed bunch, so far as I know&mdash; Fianna Fáil publicans, Fine Gael publicans, Clann na Poblachta publicans and neutralist publicans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I catered for the independent publicans.  However as the Minister will readily see there seems to be a general atmosphere of goodwill for the publicans of Swinford <Col N="1382" /> which is a pretty clear guarantee that they are a mixed bag politically.  They are my neighbours, not my constituents, so on behalf of my neighbours of east Mayo, I urge on the Minister that equity, if not the letter, of the law requires that some step be taken here.</P>
      <P>The Minister may very properly say: &ldquo;If I am asked to intervene by an executive act in a matter of this kind, I might open the door to all sorts of abuses for which this might be construed as a precedent.&rdquo;  I would therefore advise him to draft some suitable amendment for Report Stage and deal with the matter <i>ad hoc</i>.  I see difficulties because there may be other prosecutions outstanding in relation to the breach of the law, but this was one occasion.  I would not ask the Minister to make any exception except in respect of offences committed on this day.  Was there only the one day, Sunday?</P>

If there is, I think everybody will feel that substantial justice has been done and that these people are not under what would be a very cruel grievance if, by the enforcing of the letter of the law in their regard, their livelihood were taken from them. Remember that under the law as it stands, there may be no discretion left to the district justice to forbear from endorsing their licence with the fatal three endorsements which would deprive them of the only means of livelihood they have.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of this and the two next following sections a locality that is situate in a county or other borough, a town (whether or not having commissioners under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854) or village, shall include the whole of that borough, town or village, as the case may be, and any surrounding built-up area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what the Deputy means.  There are several ways the problem could be met in Dublin city.  In the type of situation visualised by Deputy Lemass, where a yacht club might be running a regatta, such a club would be entitled to 15 extensions.  The number at the moment is 12, but it is proposed to extend that to 15.  I would not give them very much credit for using up seven of the 15 in regatta week.  Apart from that, there is provision for occasional licences to cover other functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>

They will be entitled under this section to (a)  proof of the number of publicans in the area and (b)  to the personal attendance of the majority of such publicans for the purpose of testifying on oath that they, in fact, approve.  Alternatively, it might be <Col N="1385" /> accepted if a solicitor were to get the signatures of the various publicans and testify in court as to the various signatures.  As the Bill stands at the moment, I am quite satisfied the district justice could base it on the personal attendance of the majority of the licensed traders in, say, a place like Mallow or Mullingar, not to mention the whole of Cork city.</P>

      <P>With regard to the points made by Deputy Sean Flanagan, <Col N="1386" /> I do not anticipate any difficulty about the mechanics of the thing.  In Section 21 there is machinery whereby a certificate of the district court clerk shall be evidence of the number of licence holders in an area.  There will be no difficulty in establishing the number of licensees.  It will then be a simple matter of court mechanics to establish whether or not the majority are in favour of a particular period.  I should imagine the situation would be that some solicitor would go into court and indicate he represented the majority of the publicans, that they agreed to the particular period, and then the court would satisfy itself whether or not he spoke for the majority.  I am quite happy that the ingenuity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and advocacy of the legal profession will be sufficient to solve the problem in the different areas.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Kyne as to why the publicans should decide, the simple answer is that somebody must be the judge as to what is the most appropriate period in any locality.  I think a majority of the publicans is the answer because they more than anybody else will be alive to the realities of the situation.  Their profit will be involved and they will wish to cater for the most appropriate period in the year.  Nobody other than the publicans would be as quick to realise what would be the most appropriate period in any locality.  I believe they would reflect more closely than anybody else the popular demand in this regard.</P>
      <P>The simplest way of dealing with the situation is to take the period agreed upon by the majority of the licensees&mdash;not because of any particular merit on their part to decide the period but because they would be very anxious to reflect the popular demand.</P>

I would ask the Minister to take the wind out of these people's sails by taking steps to protect the interests of the people of Swinford.  If the law takes its course, the position will be that there will be either one or two publicans in Swinford in the near future instead of the 50 odd that are there now.  In the interests of everybody concerned, that would be a ridiculous situation.  After all, what happened there is something which will not happen again.  It cannot happen again if this Bill goes through and, anyway, I do not think it would happen.  I am glad the Minister indicated that he will give consideration to the troubles of the people of Swinford.</P>

      <P>The Minister was referring, in reply to my point about including Dublin on a parish basis rather than the whole of Dublin, to the activities in Dún Laoghaire this week.  On Saturday, the hosts to the visitors were the National Yacht Club. They used their permission to have an extension in that club.  Next Saturday, the Royal St. George will be hosts. They also will be using their permission to have an extension.  In between, the hosts are the Dublin Bay Sailing Club who have only small premises. They have no licence.  Therefore, they are not in a position to use exemptions to deal with this problem.  I think the Minister himself probably brought forward two of the best examples as to when this matter might be considered, as has been done in the past, and that is in relation to the Horse Show and the Spring Show.</P>

I want him to be reasonable to the extent of saying he will consider between this and the Report Stage what has been proposed to him by Deputy Kyne.  The breaking up of the eight days may seem a formidable task now.  If the Minister will consider it, he will go a great way towards making this section more workable than it is likely to be.  I can foresee the conflict that has been described by Deputy Kyne.  I forget whether or not Waterford is in the Munster Championship.  Here is a possibility.  On the first Sunday in September you have the All-Ireland Hurling Final.  On the first Monday of the month, if Waterford, for example, win it, the people will be tremendously happy and enthusiastic about receiving the team.  The application would have to be made beforehand. In any case, the people would feel somewhat cheated if they could not celebrate the homecoming of the team and their victory.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider the difficulties?  It would be very bad to see a conflict between the GAA soccer associations or rugby associations with, say, the Waterford Opera Society, the Cork Film Festival, the Wexford Musical Festival and various other such functions. Therefore, if it could be broken up into four twos or two fours, it would be much more satisfactory.  The publicans have a vested interest.  They only want to sell drink but the Minister has emphasised the importance of tourism and that interest will have to be taken into consideration as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what body should determine the interests of the community as far as tourism is concerned. It may be said that the corporation, or the town commissioners or the urban council ought to have some say.  There should be consultation between a body <Col N="1391" /> like the public bodies I have mentioned and the publicans as to what there should be.  To have eight days and eight days only might in many cases cause conflict between the publican, the drinking public and those interested in the various festivities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the answer is to abolish them completely and not give them any responsibility at all.  They reflect public opinion more than the vested interests of the publicans. They have to stand every five years before the public and give an account of their actions and very few other people have to do that except Deputies. I recommend to the Minister that even if the publicans make a recommendation, that recommendation should be considered by the urban council or whatever local authority has control over the area where the festival is held. In that way, you will get a reflection of public opinion.  The district justice, the Garda and probably the parish priest will all make recommendations and I think that we should endorse the right of the local authority to give the view of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with what Deputy Kyne and Deputy Corish have said.  In a matter such as this, there will be conflict of interest amongst the publicans themselves. Certainly there will be no unanimity amongst them.  At the present moment and for the past four or five years, particularly where Dublin is concerned, the licensed trade is split up.  There are the Dublin County Vintners' Association and the City Licensed Vintners' Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Down through the <Col N="1392" /> country, members of the licensed trade belong to one or other of these two associations.  The only way to solve the problem is to leave it to the discretion of the local authority in the area concerned.  That body is representative of all sections of the community and can see a truer picture than the licensed vintners can see.  If a NACA event gives better results than a rugby event the publicans will vote for the NACA event.  If a GAA event brings in more than a soccer event, the publicans will vote for the GAA event.  That is just what the publicans will be doing when they meet in committee.  My advice is to take this matter completely out of their hands because there are other people involved and a fair way of dealing with the matter would be to leave it in the hands of the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this matter will cause great disruption in many towns.  As I have already said, if the Waterford Opera Festival gets six <Col N="1393" /> nights what will happen to any other type of celebration that might take place at another time of the year?  It would mean that that function could not get a special concession.  Even the six nights would not be any good in the case of the Waterford Opera Festival because it will last for 17 nights.  I can see that there will be great difference of opinion in this matter.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Kenny last week talk about the Reek Sunday in Westport. I do not need a licence to talk about this matter as it concerns the whole country.  If the people who run the very successful Westport Angling Festival get the six occasions there will not be any special concession for the Reek Sunday.  A similar difficulty can arise in many places all over the country.  It will not be a matter for the publicans but for the people who will jump the gun and get the six occasions. There will be people left at the post and there will be no special concessions for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dungarvan, in my constituency; it is possible that we may be celebrating an all-Ireland victory, or it is possible that we will have a successful fleadh ceoil but which of them will be regarded as the special occasion?  If the fleadh ceoil is regarded as a special occasion, it will mean that no provision can be made for another occasion if it arises.  It is not a matter for the publican.  It is a matter for various clubs and local groups who run or administer promotions such as drama festivals, light opera festivals, angling festivals and so on.  Outside of these there are other occasions which the people would want to celebrate.  A place like Killarney will use up the eight days for some of their promotions. If Kerry won the football final, they would be coming home to a Kerry in which there would be no toasts and no wassail.  You, Sir, have had experience of this in Cork, I am sure.  In places about that distance from Dublin, where the teams play on Sunday and travel on the Monday, their homecoming is reasonably slow, especially when they get to their home county and have to stand for the <Col N="1394" /> cheers of their supporters.  It is often very late when they get to Cork city, say, in the case of Cork, or Killarney or Tralee in the case of Kerry.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make provision for such occasions because the eight nights as a hard and fast provision rules out any second promotion or festival.  As I pointed out before, if some of these people jump the gun and get permission, and even if they use only two nights, it is considered that the eight nights have gone.  That is where the section is not good.  There should be provision that if two nights were used for one festival or special occasion the rest of the nights should stand to the credit of the area.  Even then there is a difficulty because there would be a certain amount of bidding between people to get in before others. The people who would be really caught would be the promoters of a game.  In a national championship, for instance, they cannot anticipate what will happen and there is no provision for them at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally there is a misconception among Deputies as to the purpose of this section.  To relate it to the victorious return of the Waterford team, or any other team, subsequent to an all-Ireland Final is to miss the whole point of the section and the situation for which it is meant to cater.  In many towns and localities, there is usually only one period in the year in which traditionally the town is <i>en fête</i>.  You have the Galway Races, the Listowel Races&mdash;I do not know whether there is anything in Ballaghaderreen or not&mdash;and a fleadh ceoil is held in a particular town.  Deputies can think of many others.  There is the Wexford Festival, the Waterford Festival and so on.  This provision is designed to cater for that sort of situation and my approach to the matter, as I have outlined all along, is to make the ordinary licensing laws capable of catering for the sort of situation referred to by Deputy Lynch and Deputy Corish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am endeavouring in this Bill to provide normal hours of opening which will be such that whether there is a football match in town on Sunday, or whether there is a team coming home <Col N="1395" /> from winning an all-Ireland Final on a Monday, the reasonable needs of the people will be catered for with regard to such special events.  I am somewhat amazed, when I hear the comparatively liberal views expressed by Deputy Corish and Deputy Lynch, that they did not vote for my proposals earlier in Section 2.

It is an eminently reasonable and sensible provision and in most areas and localities there will be no trouble at all.  The people of Galway will settle for Galway Race week and the people in Listowel will settle for the Listowel Race week.  The people of Ballaghaderreen will settle for whatever Deputy Seán Flanagan asks them for.</P>

Everybody in a locality will know what period of the year the locality always goes <i>en fête</i> and they will be fairly unanimous on that.

      <P>The tourist end is bound up with the festivals mentioned.  We all like different types of festivals and music.  While Deputy Lynch may be enthusiastic about the Waterford light opera festival and I might be somewhat over-enthusiastic about the Wexford festival, there are people in both Wexford and Waterford who do not put much pass on these festivals at all. There is the possibility that those interested in the fleadh ceoil may decide in each of the provincial towns and big centres to have their weeks during the year.  There you have a conflict.  Contrary to what Deputy Lynch said, I think 8 days may be too long for certain places but what I would say in respect of all of them is that if they had three, four or five days for this special exemption, they would be satisfied.  It would be an awful conflict, say, between those who want to have a festival of Irish dancing and music as against those who want to put on Italian light opera.  That is a situation that could arise in a very short time.  The people who run the fleadh ceoil may decide to have something similar to a feis for four or five days, or a week of Irish music, dancing and drama.  It is for that reason that <Col N="1398" /> the Minister should consider breaking up the eight days into two fours or four twos.</P>

      <P>Having listened to all the arguments made by Deputies from all sides of the House, I am inclined to think that this is not flexible enough.  I take this section to mean that the people in any area can apply for a licence once a year and they may have that up to eight days.  They may apply only once.  I do not think that meets the case.  The Minister ought to be more flexible.  He has not given an answer to the recent suggestion of Deputy Corish that the eight days might be broken up into several periods.</P>
      <P>Wexford has a festival which goes on for about a week.  As well as that, annually we have the Barry memorial celebrations.  Barry was the founder of the American Navy to whom we have a statue erected in the town of Wexford.  In fact, the Wexford people are hoping that they will be able to get President Kennedy, when he visits Ireland, to come down to that function. I do not know whether that is possible but, as Shakespeare said, &ldquo;hope springs eternal in the human breast&rdquo;.  If that comes about, we would have to make another special occasion of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not allowed in this section.  Let me refer to the town of Gorey.  We had the fleadh ceoil this year, as the Minister knows. Under the existing Act, nothing could be done.  We also have the GAA park in Gorey where championship matches are played also.  The Minister is restricting particular areas to local initiative and enterprise but he is adopting the wrong point of view and is revealing a lack of knowledge of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to say that this is the final Bill which will settle all the doubts and difficulties which have existed heretofore.  These are weaknesses which we are trying to point out to the Minister and he ought to take cognisance of them.  A suggestion was made by some Deputies as to its being a matter for the local authorities.  I am not a member of a local authority.  The only thing I have ever aspired to is Dáil Éireann.  I never sought to be on an urban council.  If you are going to arrange anything in a town in rural Ireland where there is a mayor or corporation, they are called in for discussions in the matter.  In the town of Gorey, where we have town commissioners, they are called in to discuss matters. They are members of political organisations. They make representations to the leaders of particular Parties they represent and they are briefed by the people concerned.  They are actively concerned with the furthering of this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think they should be seriously concerned.  They would be able to get a better opinion and they would not even be giving their own opinions but opinions which they received from other people.  I would be strongly inclined to favour the idea that these local authorities should have a say in <Col N="1400" /> these matters.  That is what they are elected for.  They are elected to represent public opinion and the Minister ought to give serious consideration to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixteen days because of the fact that in subsection (8) the area defined may be a village and any surrounding built-up area.  In practically every village in the Twenty Six Counties, there are two villages in every parish and we could have a situation in which during the 12 months one village in the parish might be celebrating the winning of a hurling match or a championship, and might apply for an exemption.  The next village might then decide, if they win the football championship, to apply for an eight-day exemption.  If they are not lucky in those events, they might find it necessary to apply for and get an exemption in respect of another event as, for instance, cock-fighting or some such event.  The provision here does not say what the population of the village may be.</P>

      <P>In rural Ireland, the people are not slow to concoct excuses for celebrations.  In some parts of my constituency, if it so happened that they were not in luck in respect to sporting events, they might come to an agreement to apply for an exemption in one village, if, say, the Minister were to pay a visit, while in another village, they might be more pleased to see Deputy Dillon arriving.  It is amazing how they can dig up a reason for a festivity and this section leaves it wide open.</P>

      <P>When the Tostal festivities were first established in Cork and when they were very popular, with international choral concerts and so forth, provision was made whereby each publican, on payment of a special licence, could open until 12.30 at night. Certain publicans applied for those licences and others did not, and the following year those who did not apply checked up on the success or otherwise of those who had applied.  In the second year, the licence fee was increased to £2 but the net result was that after 11.30 at night, there were very few people in the public houses, even though the festivities went on fairly late.  The individual publicans had to decide whether or not it was worth while applying for these licences and eventually the problem solved itself when it was found that after last bus time, after 11.30, people went their way home and very few of them stayed in public houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not influenced by what Deputy MacCarthy has said because the experience on that occasion was that many people did not attend these festivities.  The situation is different where you have large crowds of visitors and in such cases it is undoubtedly necessary to have special exemptions.  Another question arises as well.  With the enormous number of people who come in only to see their own friends performing, come others as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Waterford, we have the annual <Col N="1402" /> festival, which is attended by a great number of people, many of whom stay in Tramore.  Tramore, at a different period of the year, holds one of the oldest traditional race meetings in the country.  There would be no exemption available in respect of Tramore, with its hotels and boarding houses, during the Waterford festival if they had availed of the exemption in respect of the race meeting earlier.  Accordingly, people staying in Tramore during the Waterford festival would arrive home to find the public houses shut.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

Many people attending the Waterford festival would be compelled to stay in Tramore because of lack of accommodation in Waterford.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of this situation and of what has been said about it from all sides of the House.  I often ask myself who thinks up these things&mdash;surely not the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that there is a place in this State which has not yet seceded from it&mdash; Waterford&mdash;where more than 80 per cent. of the publicans are united on a certain line; yet the Minister cannot see eye to eye with them.  He protests to the House that he is prepared to listen to the organised publicans in Dublin and to organised labour in the Dublin public houses but not those in Waterford.</P>
      <P>It was pointed out previously that in places where there were three or four villages within a reasonable distance of one another the people there could have some form of cats dancing, make it a great occasion and have open house.  That can be done under this and will be done.  I am finding fault with the Minister because he is not giving a chance to centres where there is more than one legitimate activity.  The Minister says, for example, that he has catered for Puck Fair; but if Kerry win the All-Ireland, the people of Killorglin will not be able to celebrate it.  Of course, they probably will celebrate it and break the law.  The Minister should be prepared to meet the House on this.  I am only adding my voice to the voices of Deputies who have already spoken and laying particular emphasis on the situation in Waterford city and county. I would ask the Minister to consider, if there is a four-day special occasion in a centre, putting the remaining four days to the credit of that place to be used as wanted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of the Deputies who have contributed on this section, but I think it would be better if the eight day period were broken up.  The Minister should seek the opinion of the Minister for Transport and Power, as the Minister responsible for tourism, regarding the encouragement of tourism in the off period by breaking up the concession and placing the incentive before such areas to organise special events in the off-season and so extend the tourist season.  This marathon of eight days will be used only where there are very important events.  I agree that the publicans in the area are the best people to decide on the most suitable <Col N="1404" /> occasion to avail of it.  On the other hand, there will be very serious difficulties in deciding which event will be entitled to avail of the provision.</P>

I can see cases like that arising.  On the other hand, I cannot see any other group being in a better position to decide than the licensed traders.

There has been a great deal of exaggeration about all this.  I do not think it would require even the Minister's delicate electronic brain to control the whole thing.  I am sure that every one of these functions has an organising committee that will row in with the local publicans to decide whether they will stand in or not.  That is the position for which machinery has to be provided to deal with and I would be the Minister not to intervene but to withdraw the proposal and leave it to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will consider something I said this <Col N="1405" /> night week.  The Minister looks at the Dublin Show as the greatest show in the world&mdash;we will leave it at that. If the Cork Festival takes all the days, what will the Cork Show do?  What will the shows in New Ross, Wexford and Gorey do?  They are special occasions in those places, but they will be ruled out.  On these occasions, the country people come in to see and, perhaps, to criticise what their neighbours are doing.  One of the great attractions in a country town after the show is to go into a public house and discuss it.</P>
      <P>Now the Minister comes along with his proposal for eight days.  That is all right for one special occasion.  The Minister is telling the people: &ldquo;You can have only one special occasion.&rdquo; But if any really special special occasion arises&mdash;if Waterford won the All-Ireland Final, for example&mdash;we would not be able to celebrate the homecoming of our team.  The team usually arrives back about 7.30 p.m. or 8 p.m.  They go to the City Hall for a civic reception and attend a GAA dance.  That is important for the GAA because they get a great deal of money from the dance.  A dinner is also arranged but, if this Bill is passed, they would not have time to attend it.  This kind of dinner usually starts at 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m.  There they would be and they could not have a few drinks.  Most of the boys who win these All-Irelands are not in the habit of celebrating in that way, but the people who follow them are. We all know that they like to toast the victors, but according to this Bill, there will be no more of that in Clare, Kerry, Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 deals mainly with the granting of occasional licences for different functions.  My particular interest is in dances.  It is true that formerely permission was got from the Revenue Commissioners and now I understand that due to the change in this Bill, it will come direct from the district justice.  The effect is the same. It will take effect up to sunrise, which I understand has been agreed at eight o'clock in the morning.  I have no interest in the time.</P>
      <P>I am mainly interested in two facts. One is that in the rural areas a substantial meal must accompany the dance.  As I have already indicated to the Minister&mdash;and I shall not repeat myself because I do not believe in holding up the House&mdash;in the rural and urban areas, the means of providing a substantial meal are just not there.  In my own little town with a population of 5,000, we have a town hall which serves for holding dances, plays, and other functions and in their own way, the people there confine their activities to the town hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no means there of catering for and providing a substantial meal. On occasions, we have up to 200 or 300 couples attending dances which they enjoy, but they require the same stimulation for dancing as is given in Dublin or anywhere else.  I have <Col N="1409" /> already suggested to the Minister&mdash; apparently he has not listened to me&mdash; that unless we have a substantial meal, we cannot have a dance with a licence. If that is his attitude, I must, much as I regret it, vote against this Bill and challenge a vote on this section.</P>
    <P>I expressed my general attitude to the Minister earlier&mdash;perhaps I was out of order&mdash;that he might consider an extension of the number which is limited to four dances in the area.  Four dances could be taken up by four clubs.  I do not want to name them or put them in any order, but the local GAA club, the soccer club, the Labour Party club or the Fianna Fáil Party club are entitled to have dances. They are used mainly as social functions and to build up the financial support which their supporters are willing to give.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be doing a severe injustice to the rural and urban areas if he insists on this substantial meal as a condition on which a licence can be given.  I suggest to him that we should have some confidence in the ability of the district justice in the area to decide whether or not it is a lawful occasion, whether or not the licence should be issued, with the right to the superintendent of the Garda to come and object, with the right to the clergy and to any well-meaning or ill-meaning citizens to lodge their protests.  Let the district justice, in his wisdom, as heretofore decide whether it is a function within the meaning of the Act to which he should give a licence, with such limitations as he may decide, whether it should be from 12 to 2 a.m. or whatever hour he decides.</P>
    <P>Normally, in my town, a bar licence consists of an extension from, or opening at, 12 o'clock and closing at 2 o'clock.  That is two hours.  The dances usually continue until 3 o'clock and there is no drunken spree, nothing but a means of refreshment for those taking part.  If the Minister insists on the section as it is, I fear he is doing a most unfair thing to the people in my area. Certain privileged classes&mdash;I say this with all respect to them&mdash;such as those who run the hunt ball, may charge say 35/- for a ball and can bring reputable <Col N="1410" /> caters from Dublin or Naas and can include the 5/- in the entrance fee.  I ..... suggest that is wrong because the local hurling or soccer club, the local Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party or Fine Gael Party&mdash;except perhaps the golf club&mdash; should not be penalised because they are not able to ask their supporters to pay an entrance fee of 7/6, which is normal for a four- or five-hour dance, plus 5/- for a meal, which in most cases none of those attending wants to eat and even if they did, there is usually no means of catering for them.</P>
    <P>I suggest this is an impractical provision. I suggest it will stop, with few exceptions, urban areas from holding social functions, with a bar.  If the Minister says he wants to do that, let us be clear that is class legislation and I shall vote against it.  I shall demand a division.  I think it is rotten and wrong.  I hope the Minister is not going to do that.</P>
    <P>In a county or area where there is only one centre at which such functions can take place, instead of four occasions in the year, we should give, say, ten special occasions when they can have dances without this special meal. I think ten would suffice.  Under the present Act, all we get, I think, is nine. I appeal to the Minister to be reasonable. This is not a question of trying to get a <i>bona fide</i> trade set up when the remainder of the town is closed down.  This is something that will give social life to a country town which can be very dull, give an opportunity to those who live there to carry on their normal lives and pursuits, encourage Gaelic, tennis, soccer or social clubs.  I am not much of a dancing man; I go to dances only by compulsion.  I am not speaking for myself but I believe I am expressing the view of my constituents as a whole in saying that the Minister should reconsider this.  If he can give an undertaking that he will do so, I am prepared to allow it to go to the Report Stage to see what he produces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the previous speaker extended his arguments to Section 10 as well as to Section 9 but I suppose they are related to some extent.  There are a <Col N="1411" /> few things I am worried about such as the reference to four occasions for dances in any locality as described in the previous section.  In other words, in the entire city of Dublin on four occasions, the Shelbourne, the Gresham, the Metropole and Clery's, if they can come to an agreement, may have one dance a year without a dinner.  This will leave out all other ballrooms that have run well-conducted licensed dances in the past.</P>
      <P>I have also come across some charities that raise a great deal of money at ordinary licensed dances, particularly in the Metropole.  They include, for instance, the Benevolent Fund of Irish Actors' Equity which raises between £800 and £1,000 a year; the Variety Club of Ireland which raises about £1,500 a year; UNICEF which raises about £2,000 a year; the Polio Fellowship which raises about £4,000 a year; and the Inkblots group which raises about £900 a year.  That is about £10,000 raised for charitable purposes.  I am a member of Skerries Sailing Club. They had a meeting last week and we find that from this type of dance&mdash; they had one last Friday&mdash;they raise about £400 a year which, in effect, means the difference between whether or not that club can continue in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, it is.  I should say that a great deal of pressure was probably brought by the Vintners' Association who I believe have been very strong in their views if we read their magazine which is sent to us each month.  I think the associations are hitting at one particular <Col N="1412" /> ballroom to protect one particular publican.  I wonder if that publican is making a mistake.  It is true that people go to a particular ballroom at the weekend to attend dances which are fully licensed but it is also true that nearly all of those people stop at this particular publichouse on the way out.  I suggest to the chairman or the secretary of this association&mdash; I am not sure which he is&mdash;that he should consider this very carefully because he might be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.</P>
      <P>Against that, there are other ballrooms that make use of licences invariably in connection with charitable activities.  I know from my own experience of being on committees and political Parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and other organisations&mdash;that sometimes the fact of having a licence is an added attraction.  That applies particularly in the case of a sports club where you have members who pay their subscriptions and attend these functions not to dance but in order to relax and discuss the activities of the club.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is anxious to introduce some control, I think to suggest four occasions for the city of Dublin is absolute and utter nonsense.  A better type of provision would be something like 24 occasions for each ballroom that has facilities.  That would enable numerous groups, house associations, and charitable organisations which reap about £10,000 a year for disabled children and such purposes, to have some opportunity of continuing their activities.  When one comes to think of it, 24 occasions would not be sufficient when one considers the Metropole and other ballrooms of that nature.  The Minister might be better advised to take out that section or reframe it entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading this section, I could not but remember the preceding one.  I was wondering therefore was it not possible for the Minister to do exactly as he did in the preceding section and leave the county borough of Dublin out of this section.  I say <Col N="1413" /> this in support of what Deputy Lemass has said: I am satisfied that to charge 5/- for a substantial meal, as has been decided, will make this type of dance completely unattractive and will undoubtedly prevent people from going to that type of entertainment.  It also involves class distinction because an admission fee of 15/-, £1 or 30/- to a dance means nothing to people who can afford it.  That type of person can also afford to dress up for a dance. A number of working people are averse from doing that because it is often a problem for them to find even the admission fee.</P>
      <P>If this section goes through, a considerable number of people in Dublin City will be told: &ldquo;We have no further use for your services.&rdquo;  I am referring to the staff who are employed for the purpose of serving drink on occasions such as this.  I am not only referring to the waiting staff. There are also cloakroom staff, kitchen staff and wash-up staff.  In the two major establishments in Dublin practically 250 people would lose their employment.  That is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the Minister's desire to regularise the position in regard to dances but in regard to the two establishments I have in mind and to which licences are attached, there has not been a prosecution against them in the past 30 years.  If this section is passed, these establishments will be put in the position of having to run informal dances with no licence and people who come out of the public houses at 11 o'clock or 11.30 p.m. will come in with a flask in their hip pocket and will attempt to consume drink in the dance hall.  It will be extremely difficult to keep track of them.  You will find people drinking in toilets and in corners.  This will all be brought about because the establishments concerned will have ceased to be allowed to serve drink on these occasions.  One of the most difficult nights in that regard would be a Sunday night.  One can well imagine that people who would get into the habit of drinking in dance halls to <Col N="1414" /> which there is a licence attached would also develop the habit in regard to dance halls to which there is no licence attached.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this is that people who want to go out to enjoy themselves dancing do not deliberately go out to look for drink.  In regard to any establishment where there is a licence attached or a licence granted for the purpose of serving drink the people concerned know full well there will be drink sold at that dance.  As Deputy Lemass said, many charities have been afforded an opportunity of making a considerable amount of money through sponsoring dances. The people who attend these functions have planned nights beforehand to do so and therefore we are not catering for the fellow who rushes in out of the public house.</P>
    <P>What about the person who goes to the dress dance?  He can go to a public house with a lounge bar and then go on to the ballroom to drink as much as he likes because he can pay 15/- or 20/- for a ticket.  That is undoubtedly class distinction and that should not be.  I would appeal to the Minister to take into consideration the moral aspect of what may happen because of lack of control.  It is rather ironical if the Minister is to give a licence to people who sell drink on dog tracks and elsewhere where there will not be the same control.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to make a check with the police in Dublin city and with Dublin Corporation.  I am satisfied he will find that the establishments I have in mind are well-regulated and well-controlled. If there is a case for control of other establishments, it is wrong that the type of establishment I have in mind should suffer.  Therefore I would ask the Minister to consider between now and the Report Stage changing this section so that establishments to which licences are attached will not come within the ambit of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an idea that the Minister is aiming this section mainly at myself because there are <Col N="1415" /> some loyal supporters of mine in part of County Waterford who run a dance once a year.  They get a great deal of money out of this dance which is well conducted and which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, and I know also what will arise in relation to the four occasions for which there will be a great demand.  The ICA will be there fighting for one of these occasions, as also will Macra na Feirme, the National Farmers' Association, the hurling club, the soccer club, the ploughing association, the rugby club, the hunt club, the beagles, probably the Gaelic League, Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil.  The charge for that type of dance is 5/- or 6/-, including supper.  It would be a physical impossibility to serve supper to all the people who attend the dances in these places.  Really they do not go there for the supper and if the Minister compels us to charge 5/- for the dance and 5/- for the supper, we will, like CIE, lose our customers because we will be pricing ourselves out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of the young people arrive at the dances about 11 p.m. The bar opens at midnight.  The majority of the young people do not go to the bar, but a great many of the non-dancers, like myself, do patronise the bar.  The bar is a draw where they are concerned.  There are some young people who go to the bar; it does them no harm because the bar is under the control of the committee and, therefore, all is well.  Now if the Minister insists on this 5/- for dancing and 5/- for supper, which the young people do not want anyway, there will be no bar.  That means that we will suffer what always follows in the footsteps of prohibition&mdash;the hip flask and the drink brought in the cars to the dances.  That is something over which the committees will have no control at all.  The Minister is actually taking away control out of the hands of the people who actually know how to control. He is giving only these four occasions in the year.  My colleague, <Col N="1416" /> Deputy Kyne, said it should be ten. I have enumerated some of the occasions for the Minister, just a few of the reputable organisations that I know run dances.  I am sure if I had time I could treble the number.</P>

      <P>One hall&mdash;Clonea in County Waterford.  The trouble is the Minister is thinking in terms of Dublin which is thick with halls and where this provision does not apply. Hunt clubs could hold a dance in a hotel, charging 50/- for a double ticket.  The more they charge, the more people attend because of the snob value, if you like.  The Beagle Club in Waterford is a very old and a very excellent club.  It is run practically out of the proceeds of a big dance they hold.  I can imagine what will happen to these people if they have to charge the kind of prices the Minister wants them to charge.  They will lose their customers.  These dances in future could not be made a financial success.  The Fine Gael dance run in the hall I have mentioned is run by a local Fine Gael committee in Dungarvan. They have been running that dance now most successfully for the past 15 years, I am glad to say.</P>

It would be a mistake for the Minister to take away a concession like that from the rural areas. The people's lives are dull enough. Dances are more of a social occasion for them.  The older people come along to these dances run by the local hurling or football club.  The Minister will ruin that.  With the best will in the world, the committee running these dances could not possibly cater for all the people who attend these dances. The people would have a grievance <Col N="1417" /> then if they had to pay 5/- and could not get supper.  The Minister will create a very confusing situation indeed.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  It arose in connection with exemptions for festivals and so on.  The Minister will give so many nights to a hall.  That will mean that all these clubs will be competing with one another trying to find out who will be the favoured one where licences are concerned.  Unknown to himself, the Minister may be opening the way to a racket.  He is certainly bound to create a good deal of misunderstanding and senseless competition between the various clubs and organisations.  I can appreciate how furious my colleague, Deputy Kyne, would be, or my colleague, Deputy Ormonde, if I managed to get one of the nights and they failed.  I know how furious I would be if they succeeded and I failed.  I think the Minister should seriously consider what Deputy Kyne has said, but I go further than Deputy Kyne.  I say ten nights would not be enough for each dance hall.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that we have had much more of them than his poor supporters have had&mdash;much more of them.  That is the reason, maybe, the Minister is putting this into the Bill.  He wants to try to stop us from having them.  However, the dance from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. is what we are talking about.  I think the Minister's idea and the figures and statistics he got were in relation to dances from 8 p.m. to midnight or from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m.  They are what we call &ldquo;hops&rdquo;.  There is no supper at these and no bar.  The most that can be got at them are ice cream, lemonade, and so on.  However, the dances to which I am drawing the attention of the Minister, and which the Minister is trying to &ldquo;down&rdquo; in this section, are dances at which people can have supper, if they pay for it.</P>
      <P>A young fellow will come along and buy a ticket for himself and his girl and they go dancing.  She might say she would like supper.  He will tell her that the funds would not permit it and that they can manage without supper.  Then, I have often seen starry-eyed young men impressing their girl friends, but they are not the majority.  They are only a very small minority of the people who attend these dances.  They will go in and have supper, but they are the minority. If all the people came in starry-eyed and demanded supper, it would be impossible for the promoters of these dances to provide a supper for everyone concerned.  Therefore, it is a great amenity, when the bar closes at midnight.  A whole lot of people can go in and can have a few drinks at these dances&mdash;especially these.  Fine Gael dances I am talking about, which are so successful that the floor is crowded and we need to get a bar open to try to get a number of people into the bar so that the remainder will have more room for dancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as, say, Tramore and Waterford city are concerned, there <Col N="1420" /> are very big, well-run dance halls there, but they are commercial dance halls, and there are three hotels that have very good ballroom accommodation. I do not know what will happen these hotels and how they are to divide up, say, their four nights among their customers.  The Minister will say&mdash;I am sure he will bear with me&mdash;that the majority of the people who belong to these clubs are people who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The commercial dance halls often lend the hall to clubs. The clubs make a reasonable amount of money out of their dances.  They plug their dances and have a certain amount of supporters.  It is not a case of the same people supporting each of these big dances.  There may be a regular crowd of very young people who follow dances but you have a section of people who go to a certain dance.  I forgot about the golf club: that is another one.  Golfers and their wives and people to whom they would sell tickets go to these kinds of dances. A golf club needs to make money from its ticket dance every year.  It helps them out in balancing their budget.  Only four clubs&mdash;if there will be any at all&mdash;will get the four nights from the commercial dance halls because, if I know the commercial dance halls, they will wait to hold their great gala night dances and they will hold them for the house, for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation will have a terrible effect on the finances of various clubs <Col N="1421" /> and organisations.  The Minister should stay his hand in this.  He must consider the ordinary people.  Earlier on this Committee Stage, the Minister said he was not so much inclined to go by what the licensee says.  I am pointing out now that the people concerned with the running of these dances are big groups of the ordinary people.  I forgot to mention the club that runs dances in a few of the commercial dance halls&mdash;the Waterford Golf Club and the Waterford Bohemians soccer club, a very prosperous club because they run very successful dances with a bar licence. The South End Club go to Tramore. They have been running dances all during the season in the Atlantic Dance Hall and over the week-end, they run late dances in Tramore.  The Minister should take note of that.  I do not know what will happen these clubs if they are debarred from having their usual licensed dances when you pay 5/- to go into the dance, with the option of buying supper.  I would ask the Minister to take the condition out of the Bill that people will be compelled to buy supper and if he wants to restrict the number of licences for each dance hall, the number should be ten.</P>

      <P>Deputies have spoken of discrimination: I agree. Like them, I would not stand for discrimination. But perhaps we may approach it from a different angle from that from which they approached it and that would be to give no exemption. Mention has been made here of &ldquo;hops&rdquo;&mdash;8 p.m. to midnight and 1 a.m.  I have had experience, as a spectator, in various parts of the country of these so-called or so-termed &ldquo;hops&rdquo;, 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. or 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.  When there was no drink there, I could see that the people enjoyed themselves far more than at some of the dives where the so-called swell dances and big dinners are held. If we are worrying about social life in rural Ireland, if we are really anxious about it, this section is very important. If we oppose it at all, it will be solely because we are giving special concessions or facilities to certain classes to have what I believe no section should <Col N="1422" /> have, namely, drink until the early hours of the morning at what we hear is supposed to be a social event, a happy event, a dance.</P>
      <P>I am not speaking as a member of an organisation.  The name has been mentioned here very freely during this discussion.  I am broad-minded about it. However, social life in halls for &ldquo;hops&rdquo; in these areas&mdash;particularly in County Cork&mdash;is a lot more happy, more wholesome and much more sociable than at some of the centres where now, apparently, we are giving the facilities for plenty of drink with a substantial meal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has justified the introduction of subsection (3) of this section.  My reading of the papers has <Col N="1423" /> been that cases of misbehaviour or wild activity at dances which are licensed have been more usual at functions that are very expensive and that are supposed to attract only the best of the social set.  Some of these have got headlines not only in the Irish but in the English papers.  The more modest events have caused less trouble in this regard.</P>
      <P>Any of the small dances with which I am familiar are well conducted and give no cause for complaint.  If this subsection is persisted in, it can only result in what Deputy Mullen described as hip-flask drinking.  I cannot see why a practice that has grown up over the years should be thrown away without an explanation.  There are a number of ballrooms in Dublin and there are many of these that have licensed nights.  Under the provisions of this Bill, one might hog the whole lot or three or four of them might get together and divide them between them and have one each and there might be one or two which would not have any night on which this drinking might take place.</P>
      <P>Dublin has extended considerably in recent years and I do not know whether we include in the city for the purposes of this Bill places like Finglas and Ballyfermot, which are in County Dublin.  If I am forced to do so, I shall certainly table an amendment for the Report Stage, if the Minister is not prepared to consider this matter at this stage.  I have agreed with every provision in the Bill, with the exception of this one, and I think the Minister has been ill advised with regard to this.  He has listened to everybody except the people who are adversely affected.  If he were to start all over again and see the direction in which he is going, the arguments might balance out the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a serious problem for employers in the principal ballrooms of the city of Dublin.  The Minister cannot suggest that there is any abuse of the provisions of the old Act in places like the Metropole.  I cannot accept that although that is the implication <Col N="1424" /> here.  Take Skerries, for instance.  The Rugby club there, the Gaelic club and the sailing club&mdash;there is only one ballroom&mdash;are dependent almost entirely for their very existence on this type of function.  They run these functions in the tourist season and they have to ration out amongst themselves whatever nights the ballroom proprietor is prepared to give them.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of the interference there would be with desirable clubs of this kind in a place like Skerries, there is no doubt that, despite what the Minister may say, he is doing a great disservice to the people in general. Everybody gets attached to some club at one time or another and is interested in raising funds for that club.  In Skerries, one way of raising funds is through dances in the Pavilion Ballroom in the tourist season.  In Waterford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I have gone a little to the west.  In Waterford, there used be a substantial ballroom&mdash;I do not know whether it is still there&mdash;which had a separate portion where a substantial bar could be run by the promoters and which was organised by one of the local publicans. They said to the promoters: &ldquo;There is your stock; take it; we are going home and that is that.&rdquo;  At these functions which I attend &mdash; I do not attend dances now, though I did years ago&mdash; there are two distinct groups.  There are the younger people and the more mature, married people who are interested in discussing the general affairs of the club, how it is doing and what money is coming in.  Husband and wife may have one dance during the night.  The attendance of these people will certainly be reduced and there will be a serious loss of revenue to these organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal source of revenue of my own trade union&mdash;apart from one or two raffles in the year&mdash;is the dance. We found the cheaper dance with the meal&mdash;you could have the meal, if you liked&mdash;at 7s. 6d., with the meal inclusive, was better from the revenue point of view.  Twice a year, we hold such a <Col N="1425" /> dance at Malahide.  I cannot see travellers rushing home on Friday night to dress up to get to Malahide.  This is a very important section of our trade union.  When people run out of benefit, when they have been unemployed or have been sick for a prolonged period, the only way the union can provide for them is out of the benevolent fund.  I am aware of one case where a man has been sick for a very long time.  Only the odd few pounds from the benevolent fund keep him alive.  Unfortunately, he is one of those people who will not apply for a blue card&mdash;I am sure he is entitled to one&mdash;and he has to pay for very expensive drugs.  When you bring it down to the more human point of view, this section has not taken any consideration of that human feeling.</P>
    <P>The Minister has simply said: &ldquo;I am legislating that the closing hour will be such and such, something different with meals, and rather than stop having the licensed dance entirely as we know it, we will allow it four times a year.&rdquo; It is going to devalue some properties which have had facilities built to cater for that type of trade.  It is a retrograde step and I seriously appeal to the Minister to reconsider this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to straighten out a few of the basic elements of this situation.  First of all, the law of this land is, in the main, that intoxicating liquor is to be sold on licensed premises.  We have in our legislation adhered to that principle and we have instituted a pretty rigid control over the manner in which and the times at which drink is to be sold on these licensed premises.  That is the principal aspect of this matter.  The Legislature has taken note from time to time of the fact that there are possibly certain social occasions on which it may be desirable to depart somewhat from that rigid principle and we have had the conception incorporated into the law that unlicensed premises may on certain very special, limited occasions have the privilege of selling intoxicating liquor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any Deputy will challenge that fundamental basis of the situation.  The position, broadly speaking, obtained also that dance <Col N="1426" /> halls could, for very special functions on their premises, procure an occasional licence, that a club or group or association might once or twice a year wish to run a special function and for that function the law said: &ldquo;Very well; because of the special social nature of the occasion, we will permit the sale of intoxicating liquor on this unlicensed premises.&rdquo;  I want to emphasise that we are dealing with unlicensed premises, with what Deputy Lynch referred to as the commercial dancehall, the hall not licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor but for dances.</P>
    <P>I want to put to the House this broad proposition that drinking and dancing are two separate elements of entertainment and the desirable situation is that in the main dances, particularly dances for our young people, should be an entertainment in themselves and not be linked with the sale of drink.  That is the philosophy behind my proposals.  We have had to face up to this situation.  The law, as I said, was there and the broad effect of it was that you could have functions in dancehalls at which intoxicating liquor could be sold because of the special nature of the function.  But we found a tendency creeping in where more and more of the dancehalls applied for licences for the ordinary &ldquo;hop&rdquo; as we call it and not for the special social function, for the ordinary, run-of-the-mill &ldquo;hop&rdquo; of 5/- or 7/6d.  Do we not all know that in the main the people who go to these 5/- or 7/6 or 10/- &ldquo;hops&rdquo; are young people?  It is no good trying to tell me that elderly people go out for a night to them.  Ninety per cent. of the patrons are young people.</P>
    <P>It is undesirable that we should drift more and more into a situation in which all the dances in the country would have practically an unlimited sale of drink for the young people attending them.  That is my simple objection.  In this Bill, I set about dealing with that situation and this is the machinery I devised to deal with it.  I have started off with this principle that there should be no sale of drink in dancehalls.  That is the rigid adherence, to my mind, to what is the <Col N="1427" /> desirable position&mdash;that dancing is one form of entertainment and drinking is another.</P>
    <P>We have to be reasonable about these things and have regard to the humanities, as Deputy Lemass said, and see if we will give some concessions. I feel there is still an argument for the special social function held in the dance hall and I have in mind the annual dance of the GAA or the hurling club, or the annual factory outing and anything of that sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to make reasonable provision for the type of organisation, group and club about which Deputy Kyne and other Deputies appeared to be so concerned. There are two concessions set out in Section 9.  One is where it is the special annual function or dance, and a substantial meal.  It need not necessarily be a hunt ball dinner.  We amended the definition in Section 7 to include what is properly called a meat tea. All that is involved is the serving of a meat tea costing 5/-.  In addition, there is the extra concession involved in Section 9, namely, that four days of the year can be specified as four special festive days.  Any Deputy can readily visualise the sort of day we have in mind.  On those days, without a meal, no drink can be served at the dance in the unlicensed dancehall.</P>
      <P>As I said, the provisions of Section 9 appear to me to be essentially reasonable and eminently desirable. The trend which is increasing in recent years of more and more bars at ordinary dances attended in the main by young people is something of which we must take serious note.  I do not think that the ordinary dance-going public, the people who frequent dances, will be one bit upset by this provision.  Most of the ordinary decent young people going to dances do not want bars at them.  Dancing is usually far more enjoyable for the young people, if they want to dance, if there is no bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter put to me is that a number of sporting and charitable organisations will go out of <Col N="1429" /> business if they are not allowed run these licensed dances.  Surely that is an absurd proposition?  What are Deputies really suggesting?  This is what they are suggesting: Unless these clubs are, in effect, allowed run an after-hours public house business, they will not be able to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it amounts to.  I am told that the dance becomes a profitable commercial proposition only if you are able to have a bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you not cut it out for all groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is involved? The club or organisation concerned wants to be allowed to operate a public house after the other public houses have closed.  That is an unfair and absurd proposition.  If the sporting organisation or the charitable organisation cannot support themselves without running an after-hours public house, I suggest they should seriously examine their conscience.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need for anyone to lose his temper about this section.  Most Deputies realise what the Minister is aiming at and realise the arguments that are weighing with him.  I think the disagreement is as to whether or not under subsection (3) of the Bill he is making sufficient provision for these special occasions where a licence might be permitted for drink without a meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not at all subscribe to the view that it is necessary to have a bar and to have the sale of drink at a dance in order to make money.  The Minister might be disappointed to know that a unit of my organisation in County Wicklow held a successful dance last Sunday without a bar and without drink.  They made a great deal of money so that I can appreciate the force of the Minister's argument that it is not necessary to have drink at a dance in order to make money.  This <Col N="1430" /> dance was very successful and a lot of money was made without drink.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are a number of organisations &mdash; Deputy Lemass spoke on behalf of some and Deputies Kyne and Lynch mentioned others&mdash;which genuinely feel that this section will do them a great deal of damage.  I personally, am doubtful if it will but the question has been raised in a serious way by these people and by Deputies to such an extent that I feel the Minister would be only fair to himself and fair to the Deputies concerned by having another look at this matter.  It is not a thing that should be a matter for political controversy at all.</P>

      <P>That is how it may appear to some Deputies.  If we can have regard to what we see in the newspapers, a number of branches of the Minister's organisation feel he is going too far here.  I have a cutting from the Dublin <i>Evening Mail</i> of 23rd May which is headed: &ldquo;City Fianna Fáil Clubs Jib.&rdquo;  It goes on to point out that certain Fianna Fáil clubs were joining with other organisations to protest against this very section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Now we are told that the <i>Evening Mail</i> is completely misleading.  I do not think it could be entirely misleading.  Deputy Lemass has come in with very strong views and he is rather more than a mere member of the Fianna Fáil cumann.  He is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil.  I have no doubt that he is able to get the ear of the Taoiseach occasionally.  All I am saying to the Minister is that I am not personally in any violent disagreement with him.  In view of the force of the <Col N="1431" /> arguments and the obvious sincerity of the views that have been put to him, it might be as well for him to have another look at this section.</P>
