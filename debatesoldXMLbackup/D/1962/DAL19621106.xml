    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has had any communication from the Prime Minister of India concerning the present Chinese hostilities against India; and whether he will make a statement on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently received a personal message from the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Nehru, concerning the attacks made by the forces of Communist China on the Indian frontier.  In this message, Mr. Nehru gave me a summary of the events preceding these attacks and of the Chinese operations, and he expressed the hope that, in the struggle in which his country is at present engaged, he could count on our sympathy and support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our people have, of course, always had especially friendly feelings for India and her people.  We admired and sympathised with the struggle of India for independence, and we were among those nations which most rejoiced when India achieved independence in 1947.  Gandhi was a leader whose name, in Ireland, was synonymous with unselfish dedication to the cause of national freedom and self-determination, and Prime Minister Nehru has long been known and admired in this country as a worthy successor of Gandhi and one of the great statemen of our time.  Indeed, Deputies will recall that, in order to mark our esteem for Mr. Nehru, Dáil Éireann, <Col N="400" /> in a unique gesture, received him formally on the Floor of the House in April, 1949.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, natural that, by reason both of our devotion to the cause of freedom and of our special affection for India, the attacks to which Indian territory has recently been subjected should evoke here a strong feeling of resentment.  And our resentment is all the stronger because Chinese aggression against India is not only contrary to the principles of peaceful negotiation which should, in our view, replace war as a means of settling disputes, but also jeopardises the rather delicate balance which has hitherto prevailed in relations between Asiatic States and thus adds to the dangers of conflict in that vast area, where peaceful conditions are so important for the maintenance of the peace of the world.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Chinese aggression on India constitutes an unprovoked attack on a country which has tried, by every reasonable method, to maintain friendly relations with China and that it also represents a sudden and deplorable rejection of the mutual discussions which India has always favoured and which had, indeed, been proceeding&mdash;if only spasmodically&mdash;for some time.  We recall, of course, that China had already taken violent action, some three years ago, to suppress the autonomy of Tibet and the freedoms of its people&mdash;an action against which, as Deputies will be aware, the Minister for External Affairs protested in the strongest terms and which, on our initiative, was condemned by the General Assembly of the United Nations.  This, however, only heightens our sense of reprobation of the present arbitrary action against India and our grave anxiety about its possible consequences.</P>
    <P>When the Indian Chargé d'Affaires in Dublin delivered Mr. Nehru's message to me, I spoke to him on the foregoing lines.  I also asked him to assure his Prime Minister of the fullest sympathy of the Irish Government and people with the Government and people of India in their present struggle, of our wholehearted moral <Col N="401" /> support in the defence of their rights, and of our earnest hope that they will triumph over this brutal aggression.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether, in connection with the recent reported statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the fact that Ireland did not accede to NATO was due to special circumstances, he will state what were the special circumstances referred to; and if any significant change in those special circumstances has taken place since the decision not to join NATO was made which would justify the taking by Ireland of a different stand in relation to NATO at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies are aware that the statement to which they refer corresponds precisely to what I said in Brussels on the 18th January last.  They are also aware that the reasons why the then Government did not participate in the negotiations for the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949 are set out in the White Paper issued at the time by that Government.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question I would refer the Deputies to my remarks in this House on the 8th March, 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the implications of the special circumstances refered to in regard to NATO were in connection with the right of Britain to hold the Six Counties? If we joined NATO in 1949, according to the Government's interpretation at the time, we would thereby be recognising Britain's right to the <Col N="402" /> Six Counties.  In view of the fact that the Taoiseach himself asserted in Ottawa in 1954 that that was the position, may I ask the Taoiseach now if the special circumstances have now changed in so far as that interpretation of the Articles of NATO is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking so that the public will know.  Is it or is it not a fact that the Taoiseach himself has changed his mind in the past six months about the interpretation of the Articles of NATO and that he now feels that the Articles of NATO do not imply recognition of Britain's right to the Six Counties?  Is that the position at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we take it then that the Taoiseach stands by the decision taken in 1949 by the inter-Party Government, and supported by Fianna Fáil at the time, that support being reiterated in 1954 and 1955 by himself?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether or not he considers valid now the reasons that were given in the White Paper in 1948-1949 as to nonparticipation in NATO?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears now there has been some radical change in the Taoiseach's attitude to NATO, or any similar defence organisation, in the light of his statement that he accepted defence commitments without any reservations at all.  Arising out of that statement, would the Taoiseach say whether he has given an undertaking on Ireland's behalf to accept, if asked, the complete re-occupation of Ireland by British troops, by German troops or French troops&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that the Medical Research Council of Ireland is at present having a census carried out of the number of children born deformed in this country; and that this census will also give the number of deformed children born as a result of the use of the drug thalidomide; and whether his Department will undertake any scheme to aid these children and their parents, and to help the rehabilitation of these children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann <Col N="405" /> Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>In October, 1960, I authorised the payment of a special annual grant for a period of four years from the Hospitals Trust Fund to the Medical Research Council of Ireland to finance an investigation into the incidence of congenital malformations in infants born in Dublin city.  The investigation is proceeding.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I approached the Medical Research Council with a request that they should, as a matter of urgency, extend the scope of this survey to provide information&mdash;so far as is practicable&mdash;as to the number of babies born in each health authority area with deformities which might be ascribed to the consumption by expectant mothers of thalidomide.  The Council agreed readily to undertake this further project, and the work is now proceeding.  I am advised that a special report on this aspect of the general problem will be available to me in about two months' time, but that present indications are that the size of the problem here is relatively small.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, at my request, the question of the facilities which are needed to deal with the problem, including highly specialised artificial limb fitting, is being considered by the National Organisation for Rehabilitation. The organisation are actively engaged in devising appropriate arrangements.</P>
      <P>I presume that Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde, in his question, used the word &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; loosely in the sense of making appropriate facilities available and not in its more usual sense.  Assistance in availing of the facilities provided will, of course, be given in accordance with the terms of the Health Acts, under which as Deputies are aware, services can be provided free or at subsidised rates for those within the eligible limits and for hardship cases outside those limits.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if in view of the fact that certain cafés and restaurants have recently closed down for not conforming <Col N="406" /> with the sanitary regulations of his Department he will give details of the inspection of cafés and restaurants, including the number of inspectors employed in this work, the types of cafés and restaurants inspected, and the frequency of inspections carried out by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In his question, the Deputy has referred to sanitary regulations. I may say that the Minister for Health is not the responsible Minister in sanitary matters.  I presume, therefore, that he has in mind the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950 to 1961, which prescribe standards of hygiene for food premises.  These regulations are administered by health authorities. The inspection of cafés and restaurants is carried out mainly by health inspectors appointed by such authorities. There are 156 such inspectors, most of whom have the duty of inspecting food premises as part of their work.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health, I have no knowledge of the total number of cafés or restaurants which may have been closed down.  The main functions of the Minister for Health under the regulations are appellate and such inspections as are made by my officers are solely for the purpose of assisting me in determining appeals against refusals of health authorities to register food premises including cafés and restaurants.  Since the beginning of the year, 11 such inspections were carried out, of which six were inspections of restaurants or café premises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The holding of night dispensaries in the areas mentioned by the Deputy would be a matter for the Dublin Health Authority in the first instance and I have received no proposal for the holding of such dispensary sessions from that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Night dispensary sessions were held <Col N="407" /> in the North Crumlin Health Centre at Curlew Road from 1951 until the end of 1956.  They did not, however, prove a success and it was found that the numbers coming to them gradually dropped down to eight; it was also established that some of the patients attending at night could have attended the morning sessions.  In view of this, the Health Authority decided to discontinue the sessions as from 31st December, 1956.  Since then, I understand that towards the end of 1960 the Health Authority had the question of night dispensaries at this centre under consideration, but they decided that there was no need for the holding of such sessions.</P>

      <P>There are only 377 persons eligible for general medical services in the Tullaroan dispensary district.  This is a very small quota for a district medical officer and I asked the Health Authority to examine the possibility of reorganising dispensary districts in the area with a view to affording some relief to the district medical officers in the Kilkenny Nos. 1 and 2 dispensary districts who have large numbers of eligible persons in their districts.</P>

      <P>Unmillable wheat cannot be regarded as a substitute for pollard and as home production is insufficient to meet requirements imports of pollard are permitted, under licence, from various sources.  Imports from &ldquo;Iron Curtain&rdquo; countries are at present licensed on a restricted scale only with a view to securing an improvement in our balance of trade with those countries.

When, on the other hand, we encourage farmers to grow feeding barley, we have to make arrangements for the marketing of that crop.  For a number of years, we have arranged with the feeding-stuff manufacturers for the taking up of the barley crop, which amounted to 262,000 tons this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been sufficiently humane to accept the case made to stop the export of horses of a certain age.  That, I think, is generally appreciated by the people concerned. What is the Minister's case for not taking the same action in regard to the present age group of horses which are being exported under similar conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The case is one which I have made repeatedly.  In the first place, I never admitted, as Minister, that hardships and suffering were inflicted on horses as a result of export. I did admit, when establishments were erected here for the slaughter of horses, that it was a desirable development and that it was only right that limitation should be imposed upon the export of horses.  After considerable thought and discussion, I decided that a ban should be placed on the export of horses over seven years.  I believe, in the first place, that it was necessary to do that in order to establish the non-acceptance of the case made against the export of horses; secondly, it was necessary to do it in order to protect the farmers and the owners and the people who have horses for sale and to ensure that they would get reasonable and fair prices for them. These were two very important considerations, and briefly they form the basis and the foundation on which this decision was made, which, as I have said, is to me and to many others who know this problem very well, a very excellent one.</P>

When I announced recently that the branch had been set up, I said that it would co-operate with industry in every way and, particularly, with the adaptation councils which it is hoped to foster in all branches of industry.  The Committee on Industrial Organisation in <Col N="425" /> its third interim report recommended that in each industry where an adaptation council is established, a standing advisory body should be established by the trade unions representing workers in the industry and that this body should be consulted by the council on matters affecting the interests of workers.  These arrangements will enable the new branch of my Department to keep in very close touch with the interests concerned.</P>

The general position in relation to the procedure for payment of grants is under constant review in my Department and every effort is made to minimise delays which, I may mention, are not always attributable to the Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not take us more into his confidence in regard to the delays referred to in these and the previous questions? While it is true that the officers of his Department are extremely helpful in resolving specific cases, is the Minister aware that it is becoming a cause of embarrassment to Deputies the number of letters they are required to write to the Department and the load of work it must throw on the shoulders of the officers of the Department answering their inquiries arising from delays in this matter?  If there is a reason other than a shortage of inspectors or something of that kind, could the Minister not tell the House so that he might seek the co-operation of Deputies in resolving the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>When inspectors were in short supply, I made that quite clear as the reason; I am not making that the reason at the moment, nor am I satisfied that there are such undue <Col N="438" /> delays in any appreciable number of cases.  I am inviting members of the House who become aware of any such undue delays to furnish me with particulars. As many Deputies know from complaints such as those submitted by them in the past, both to myself and my officers, not always are the facts as they were supposed to be; in other words, very often the case is not complete when submitted to a Deputy. However, let me say that one of the big factors in this matter is the rise in the number of applications for grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason, would the Minister not think he should, if possible, get more inspectors, because as far as my experience goes, the delay in payment and the delay in concluding the grant is due to waiting for inspection?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The House might appreciate this, that on 1st September I asked for figures in relation to a particular county, and I need not tell the House the county happened to be my own county.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a number of complaints that appeared to suggest there were undue delays.  I found there had been three inspectors operating in County Donegal over the summer months and at 1st September, only 59 cases were on hands.  One of the inspectors was therefore transferred to another county where the number of files on hands was greater and justified the transfer.  Three weeks later, the total number of files on hands in County Donegal had risen to over 300. That is inexplicable, both to me and my Department.  The cases just come in plumps.  At one time there are enough inspectors in the county and three weeks later there are too few inspectors.  There is no method of always having available in any county the requisite number of inspectors as the cases come due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the change in arrangements he recently made of substituting an inspector <Col N="439" /> from the Department for the old authorised officer, a locally-resident inspector, has not in some measure contributed to the fluctuation in expedition with which claims are dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the posts of these officers to whom he refers were abolished some considerable while ago and that their function solely related to the inspection of the site of a new house.  The delays being complained of here, as mentioned by some Deputy, are those occurring in the final payment of the grant. These people never dealt with that matter so that their being there or not being there does not affect the situation.</P>

      <P>Amendment of a scheme of differential rents is, in the first instance, a function of the housing authority concerned.  The only proposal submitted to me this year for amendment of the scheme operated by Dublin Corporation was a proposal to exclude from the assessment of the income of tenants, the increases in social welfare allowances which became payable from 1st August, 1962. I approved of this proposal.  All proposals in connection with differential rent schemes which housing authorities consider it proper to make and which statutorily require my sanction are considered by me on their merits.</P>

      <P>It was originally expected by Dublin Corporation that the bridge would be completed in August of this year.  I understand that February 1st next is now expected to be the opening date and that the delay is due mainly to foundation difficulties encountered in the course of the bridge contract and to bonding difficulties which arose in connection with the maintenance clause in the contract for the reconstruction of the approach roads and which held up the signing of this contract and the commencement of work on the approach roads. This work is now in progress and is expected to be sufficiently advanced by 1st February to enable the new bridge to be opened to traffic.</P>

      <P>At 30th June, 1962, there were 117,800 persons in receipt of noncontributory old age pension at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of £9,182,000 in the current financial year. The 2/6d. a week increase which was granted in these pensions from 3rd August, 1962, was estimated to cost an additional £783,700 a year.  The cost of a 5/- increase would be twice that amount or £1,567,400.</P>
      <P>There were 35,901 recipients of old age contributory pensions at 30th September, 1962.  On the basis that the Exchequer contributes approximately one-third of the cost of all benefits payable from the Social Insurance Fund, the yearly cost to the Exchequer of these pensions is estimated at £1,800,000 from January next, when a 5/- increase in pension rates and a similar increase in the associated allowance payable for a wife or invalided dependent husband comes into effect.  The estimated yearly cost to the Exchequer of the 5/- increase is £217,000.  A 2/6d. increase would cost half that sum, or £108,500.</P>

    <Title>Official Secrets Bill, 1962&mdash;Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>12.  In page 6, line 7, after &ldquo;which&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the opinion of the Court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy McGilligan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy McGilligan explained, the purpose of this amendment is to bring the courts into Section 9 by providing bluntly in the Bill that where any matter comes before a court, which under this section is a matter touching on the question of the security or safety of the State, it should be so if the court so finds.  The section as worded lists a number of matters in respect of which if information is given in a manner prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State, an offence is committed. It sets out in subsection (1) four or five particular matters which are to be regarded as touching on the safety or preservation of the State and then in No. (v) it sets out &ldquo;any other matter whatsoever information as to which would or might be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State&rdquo;.  The earlier matters referred to in the section are matters which are, so to speak, defined in the section, matters such as munitions of war, the operation or projected operation of any of the Defence Forces, any measures for the defence or fortification of any place on behalf of the State, but No. (v) in that subsection is a very general power&mdash;&ldquo;any other matter whatsoever&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in particular in relation to that <Col N="448" /> general kind of omnibus clause imported into the Bill that Deputy McGilligan suggests the Minister should make it quite clear that the people who are to determine whether or not it might be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State are the courts.  If my memory serves me aright the Minister's view, as expressed on the last occasion when this was discussed, was that this was unnecessary, that the Bill as it stands does mean that the court must adjudicate on the matter and come to a conclusion that the particular matter referred to, the subject matter of the charge, is prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State.  Deputy McGilligan's point of view is that that is not clear and that, in any event, it is not any harm, even if the Minister's argument is right, and that it is not detracting from the Bill to include the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the court&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has interpreted my mind correctly.  In my opinion, the insertion of these words is unnecessary. Whether we put in the words or not, it would still be a matter for the court to decide whether or not the safety or preservation of the State is involved. Indeed, there would be a danger in putting in the words in this particular instance because their insertion here might be regarded as a precedent.  One could visualise a court subsequently looking at some other Act of Parliament and saying: &ldquo;Well, in the Official Secrets Act, it was considered necessary specifically to insert these words.  Therefore, we read from their absence in this Act that the opinion of the court is not involved.&rdquo;  It is important not to create such a precedent by inserting these words which are not necessary at all.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 5, 6 and 7 and insert: &ldquo;that the publication of any evidence or statement to be given or made during any part of the hearing would be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State, that that part of the hearing should be <i>in camera,</i> the&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> On Committee Stage, the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy McGilligan argued in regard to Section 12 that once the prosecution made the case that the publication of any evidence would be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State, the prosecution could then compel the court to hold any part of the hearing <i>in camera,</i> not necessarily the part relating to evidence, the publication of which would be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that view of the words by the Leader of the Opposition is straining them very considerably. Nevertheless, I have asked the draftsman to put the matter beyond all doubt and to remove any possibility whatever of ambiguity.  It is for that reason that the amendment is proposed.  As the House will see from the wording of the amendment, it makes what we have in mind crystal clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14, on behalf of Deputy McGilligan:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 8, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister himself used the expression when moving his amendment, I do not suppose he will resent my using it now.  This section enables the State to compel the court, whether the court thinks it proper or not, in certain circumstances to hold a hearing or part of a hearing <i>in camera.</i> The section as it is worded, even allowing for the amendment which the Minister has introduced, provides that if the State makes an application to the court and bases that application on the statement that the publication of matter concerned with the trial would <Col N="450" /> be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State, once the application is made, it cannot be refused under this section.  The court may think it is the greatest nonsense, that it is an effort by the State or a Minister of the State to cover up something they do not want published, because it might not suit them to have it published. They may feel the safety or preservation of the State has nothing, good, bad, or indifferent, to do with the matter.  But if the application is made and if it is based on a statement by the State that the safety or preservation of the State is in question, then the court must make an order either determining that the entire hearing will be heard <i>in camera</i> or whatever part the State makes the application in respect of should be heard <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <P>The suggestion in Deputy McGilligan's amendment is to try to remedy that to some extent by making the section permissive to the court rather than mandatory on the court. Deputy McGilligan suggests that instead of using the words in this section &ldquo; . . . the court shall make an order to that effect,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be deleted and the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; substituted instead.  I believe it is important that the Minister exercise the reasonableness about which he boasted a few minutes ago in connection with this amendment.  To my mind, and to the minds of a number of other Deputies on this side of the House, this whole Bill is a very dangerous measure.  It is a measure which, as I said earlier, if wrongly used, either by this or any other Government, could be fraught with extreme danger for individual citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>Time after time, in section after section of this Bill, the discretion is taken away from the courts to deal with matters which are offences under this Bill in a manner which they might think these matters should be dealt with.  The courts are not allowed to decide what or what is not to be regarded as official information.  The courts are being compelled to accept as conclusive evidence a certificate by the Minister that a particular matter is official information.  Here again in <Col N="451" /> Section 12 there is no question of the courts&mdash;after all, they have been set up by the State and their function is to interpret the laws and administer justice on behalf of the State&mdash;being allowed any discretion to do their job as it ought to be done.  They are being told by the Minister in this Bill that, whether they like it or not, they will have to make an order simply on an application being made by the State.</P>
    <P>I feel that is dangerous.  This whole Bill is dangerous, particularly in the matters I have mentioned.  We have already discussed a section in this Bill which enables the State to arrest a person thought to be guilty of an offence under a section of this Bill, to put him in jail and to keep him in custody without ever bringing a charge against him.  The only safeguard is that further proceedings under the Bill, when it becomes an Act, cannot be taken without the consent of the Attorney General.  The person may be arrested, lodged in jail and kept in jail without the consent of the Attorney General or anyone else.  Now we have added on to that the fact that when eventually he is brought before the court, presumably with the consent of the Attorney General, the State may on its own decision compel the courts to have the case heard <i>in camera,</i> simply on a statement made on behalf of the State that the subject matter of the prosecution or that information which may come out during the trial may be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State.</P>
    <P>The State are not required to give any evidence of that.  There is no authority under the Bill to anyone to have the Minister or the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or anyone else go on oath in the witness-box and express their opinion that the statement made on behalf of the State is correct. There is no machinery at all for any kind of proof being brought before the courts.  An application is simply made by counsel or solicitor on behalf of the State and the court must, under the terms of the Bill if it is allowed to go unaltered, make an order providing for the hearing of the entire case or <Col N="452" /> whatever part of the case is referred to <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister even at this late stage to have some regard to the position of the judiciary and to their responsibilities.  I suggest he should take the view in this matter that the judiciary are a responsible body of men; and if they have an application made to them of the sort envisaged in the section, they should be allowed exercise their own discretion and intellect to decide whether or not the safety or preservation of the State is in fact involved or whether the situation might not be that the hearing of a case <i>in camera</i> might have undesirable consequences, not only for the State but for the individuals affected by the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy O'Higgins will not regard me as flattering him when I suggest he is a much more reasonable man than his colleague, Deputy McGilligan.  It is for that reason I feel I can appeal to him to see my point of view in this matter. I want to emphasise to the House that this section deals exclusively with a life and death matter of the safety or preservation of the State and offences connected with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section merely sets out to stipulate that where the prosecution indicates to the court that the publication of a particular piece of evidence would be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State, then the court shall direct that that particular part of the trial shall be held <i>in camera.</i> I think that is a perfectly reasonable proposition.  I cannot see that anybody's life or liberty is going to be adversely affected by it.  Essentially, it is the Executive who must decide in a matter of this sort.  It is the Executive or the Government who are entrusted with the preservation of the safety and security of the State and it must be left to them to decide whether the disclosure of a particular piece of evidence would be prejudicial to that trust and it should not be left to the discretion of the court.  Only the Executive, in my opinion, are in a position to decide such a matter.  I think it is reasonable that, where the Executive stipulates to <Col N="453" /> the court that the very existence or the safety of the State is involved in a particular piece of evidence, the hearing of the relevant part of the case shall be held <i>in camera.</i> The section does not stipulate anything about the manner in which that part of the case shall be conducted but merely that it should be conducted behind closed doors and not in public for the whole world to see, to the detriment of the safety of the State.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputy O'Higgins to see what I think is the utter reasonableness of that proposition and to leave the section as it is; in other words, to leave it to the prosecution to be able to insist that a particular part of the case shall be held <i>in camera</i> where the Executive are of opinion that anything else would be to the detriment of the very existence or safety of the State itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see from the point of view of the Executive it is perfect to have this kind of power but I think the Minister's duty, when he brings a Bill like this to the House, is to look at it not merely from the point of view of the Executive but also from the point of view of the citizens.  I think the Minister would concede that the whole argument against the amendment was onesided if one looked at the matter through the eyes of the Executive.  Only in looking at it from the point of view of the citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety or preservation of the State as defined by a member of the Executive and not as found so by the court.  I may tell the Minister, although I do not set myself up as giving a legal opinion or being an expert on constitutional law, that as an individual Deputy, I have the very greatest doubts of the constitutionality of this section.  What the Minister is doing is, in effect, arrogating to himself and his colleagues in the Government the right to decide when a matter is prejudicial to the safety and security of the State and <Col N="454" /> taking it out of the hands of the court to decide it.</P>
      <P>The Minister says this only refers to matters where there is a question of life or death for the State.  It also refers to offences under Part II of the Bill.  If the Minister comes to the conclusion that the offence under Part II of the Bill was committed in a manner which, in his view, was prejudicial to the safety and security of the State in Part II of the Bill, the part which the Minister himself found it necessary to tone down by amendment on the last occasion that this was discussed, Part II refers to the disclosure of official information and this goes back to the definition of official information which is information designated as being official by certificate of a Minister of State.  So that we go right back the whole way to Section II of the Bill even though we are dealing with this section here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall apologise if I am not correct but Section 12 refers to proceedings for an offence under Section 9 or for an offence under Part II committed in a manner prejudicial to the safety and preservation of the State.  Part II deals with official information and, in Part I, the definition section, subsection (3) gives the Minister of State power to decide what is official information and to enforce acceptance of his decision by the court simply by signing the certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not that it is committed in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the State.  He cannot certify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he can decide that in coming to their decision, he can direct the court to have the hearing held <i>in camera.</i> That is the power he is given under Section 12, so that it is, in fact, the Minister who is coming to a decision and forcing the court to accept that decision, even though it may be entirely wrong. That is where I quarrel with the Minister on the wording of this section and with the whole idea of making <Col N="455" /> this section mandatory rather than discretionary so that it would be permissive to the court to make or refuse to make an order on the application by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the court is allowed discretion, as suggested by Deputy McGilligan's amendment, then the court retains the right to decide whether or not the particular matter is prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State: if the court is not allowed that discretion, <Col N="456" /> then the Minister is arrogating to himself the right to make that decision and I should be very surprised if there was not a very strong argument, at any rate, that such a provision would be repugnant to the Constitution in that it allows the Minister to set himself up as a judge on this matter and takes it out of the hands of the court who are the people established under the Constitution to decide matters such as this.</P>

      <P>In page seven, line 27, after &ldquo;offence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;under section 9&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to confine the operation of subsection (2) of Section 14 to offences under Section <Col N="457" /> 9.  If the amendment is accepted by the House the Bill will provide that it will only be in the case of persons charged with an offence under Section 9 that proceedings by way of arrest, or other preliminary proceedings, can be taken without the consent of the Attorney General.  Deputies will remember that we had some discussion on this particular subsection on the Committee Stage.  At that time I suggested to the Opposition that I would probably be prepared to make this amendment if it would meet their point of view.  I am hoping that it will.</P>

      <P>This does, I think, improve the section somewhat, but the position still is that a person who is charged with an offence, or who is going to be charged with an offence, under Section 9 may be arrested and jailed, and kept in jail, without the consent of the Attorney General.  However, the amendment is an improvement.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 26, to delete &ldquo;Minister for Justice&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;High Court <i>ex parte</i> in a summary manner and <i>in camera.</i>&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment has been put down by Deputy McGilligan.  It is designed to allow the courts to have some say in this Bill.  Section 17 is a section which gives extraordinary powers to chief superintendents of the Garda Síochána. I do not know if the people generally are aware of what the Minister is doing in this section.  The section provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent has reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence under section 9 has been committed and for believing that any person is able to furnish information as to the offence or suspected offence, he may apply to the Minister for Justice for permission to exercise the powers conferred by this subsection and, if such permission is granted, he may authorise a member of the Garda Síochána not <Col N="458" /> below the rank of inspector to require the person believed to be able to furnish information to give any information in his power relating to the offence or suspected offence and if a person required in pursuance of such an authorisation to give information fails to comply with the requirement or knowingly gives false information he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>This is a power which is being vested in chief superintendents, a power of obtaining permission from a Minister.  If a chief superintendent has reasonable grounds for suspecting the commission of an offence he can go along to the Minister and get the permission of the Minister to require someone else, whom he believes may have information, to give that information. Even though the chief superintendent may be wrong in his belief, he can get that authority from the Minister: and, if the person confronted with the demand for information does not give it, he is guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will point out that this refers only to an offence under Section 9, in which the safety or preservation of the State is in question.  That is so and, for that reason, we believe that it may be necessary certainly, from time to time, that drastic action should be taken, and that it should be taken immediately. Our suggestion to the Minister, however, is that he should allow the courts to have some say in this matter.  We have made this suggestion, too, in earlier sections.  If the Minister is agreeable, I think we might take these two amendments together because they are really part of the one amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are suggesting that, instead of having the chief superintendent put in the position of operating these powers on the permission of the Minister, he should be required to ask the High Court <i>ex parte</i> and <i>in camera.</i> He need not give any publicity to the fact that he <Col N="459" /> is seeking the permission.  We suggest he should apply to the High Court and state his reasons and the Court then, if it thinks fit, should be empowered to authorise the operation of the powers under this section.  That is subsection (1).</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of the Bill deals with the case where a chief superintendent has grounds for believing that, in the interests of the State, immediate action is necessary.  The subsection provides that he may exercise the powers conferred in subsection (1) without applying for, or being granted, the permission of the Minister for Justice.  As the Chair has pointed out, the amendment suggested here is consequential on the earlier amendment.  If the Minister accepts amendment No. 16 it will be necessary to alter in subsection (2) the words &ldquo;Minister for Justice&rdquo; and insert instead the word &ldquo;Court&rdquo;. I do not think it is necessary to discuss the second amendment any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My defence of this particular proposal is, of course, on the same lines as my defence of the other matters we have been discussing. Briefly, my case is that we are concerned entirely in this regard with situations in which the safety or preservation of the State is concerned. For that reason we must be prepared to give to the police and to the Minister for Justice exceptional powers where they, in the exercise of their official functions, deem that such powers are necessary.  I do not think it is difficult for any of us to visualise the sort of situation in which it would be necessary for the police to invoke the powers given to them here in Section 17.</P>
      <P>I can see all sorts of difficulties, not the least of which would be technical difficulties, arising out of the proposal incorporated in Deputy McGilligan's amendment, but apart from the technical difficulties involved in this proposal, there is a question of principal and a question of policy also involved.  Again, this is a case where the Executive must take the responsibility for deciding what should be done in the interests of the security of the nation as a whole.</P>

I am putting a brake on the police authorities in that they must go to the Minister for Justice of the day and get his permission before proceeding under Section 17.  As the law stands at the moment, under Section 6 of the 1920 Act they do not have to apply to anybody.  They can proceed on their own initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to eliminate from the statute book enactments or parts of enactments which, although not specifically repealed, are in fact dead or obsolete. The present Bill deals only with Pre-Union Irish statutes, that is, Acts passed by a Parliament sitting in Ireland at any time before the Union of 1800.  It is intended as the first of a series of Bills for the removal of unnecessary matter from the statute book.  Further statute law revision Bills, dealing with English and British statutes still applying in the State, are in course of preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The passage of these Bills will enable a comprehensive chronological table and index to the whole of the statute law in force in the State to be produced.  Such a work is badly needed. At present, a person seeking information on a particular subject of statute law may have to consult three indexes, of which two are out of print.  These publications are: the Index to the Pre-Union Irish Statutes, contained in the Irish Statutes Revised, 1885; the United Kingdom Chronological Table and Index to the Statutes (37th edition, 1921) and the latest Index to our own statutes, 1922-58.  Every enactment referred <Col N="462" /> to in either of the first two works must be checked against the Chronological Table of Effect of Legislation in our own Index to ascertain its subsequent history and present state.  It is not feasible to produce a comprehensive index until the great mass of absolete legislation is cleared away, as is now proposed.</P>
    <P>The work of statute law revision has a further great advantage: It will make possible the publication of a series of volumes containing the whole body of the living statute law.  At present this legislation is contained in approximately 170 volumes, taking account of the Irish Statutes Revised, 1885, as one volume and ignoring the separate volumes of Pre-Union Irish statutes. There is a British series of Statutes Revised, down to 1920, in 24 volumes, which is extremely convenient but has to be used with caution as it is not fully revised for Ireland.  All of the pre-1922 annual volumes are long since out of print; many are difficult to procure; their condition is deteriorating and they contain an increasingly large proportion of dead matter.</P>
    <P>Previous Statute Law Revision Acts, dealing with Pre-Union Irish statutes, were enacted by the British parliament in 1878 and 1879.  No general revision has since been undertaken although a certain number of them have been repealed by particular statutes, notably by the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, the Administration of Estates Act, 1959, the Defamation Act, 1961, and the Civil Liability Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>The Acts of the Parliament of Ireland (1310-1800) are printed in full in the Folio Edition in 20 volumes, which was printed pursuant to an order of the Lord Lieutenant, dated 27th April, 1762.  Following on the passage of the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Acts of 1878 and 1879, a revised edition of the Irish Statutes, in one volume, prepared by William F. Cullinan of the Irish Office, West-minister, was published in 1885.  This volume, commonly known as Cullinan's Edition, contains all the enactments then surviving, together with a chronological table of all the statutes.</P>
    <P>I think that at this stage it might <Col N="463" /> be useful to Deputies to know why the various enactments in this Bill are considered appropriate for repeal.  In the first place a number of the statutes reprinted in Cullinan's Edition were even then clearly obsolete, but were reproduced in that Edition because they had been left untouched by the Statute Law Revision Acts.  For example, statutes relating to ecclesiastical courts and ecclesiastical law ceased to be in force on the coming into operation of the Irish Church Act, 1869, by which the Church of Ireland was disestablished.  Section 21 of that Act abolished all ecclesiastical courts and provided that on and after the 1st January, 1871, the ecclesiastical law of Ireland, except in so far as related to matrimonial causes and matters, should cease to exist as law. Effect, however, was not given to these provisions by the Statute Law Revision Acts, 1878 and 1879.  Again, the various Acts relating to the settlement of Ireland, and others of a similar character, which, having long since served their purpose, would be regarded as spent were left untouched by those Acts and are included in that Edition.</P>
    <P>The Pre-Union Irish Acts were, after the Union, continued in force by virtue of Article 8 of the Act of Union which provided: &ldquo;all laws in force at the time of the Union, and all courts of civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the respective kingdoms, shall remain as now by law established within the same.&rdquo;  Those which still survived on the establishment of Saorstát Éireann were continued in force by Article 73 of the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann to the extent to which they were not inconsistent with it.</P>
    <P>Statutes relating to the Pre-Union Irish Parliament, so far as they may have survived the Act of Union by which that Parliament was abolished, are inoperative since the establishment of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I am sure, have noticed that in this Bill we are, in what might appear to be a somewhat casual manner, repealing the Act of <Col N="464" /> Union of 1800.  I am essentially a modest sort of person.  I feel that, for that reason, I should make it clear that the effective work in this regard has been carried out long ago by men better than I.  However, the Act was still on the Statute Book.  I think it is of some interest to us, at any rate at this stage, to note its final passing into oblivion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said that the Act of Union was, in substance, repealed by the coming into operation of the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann but the Act still remains on the Statute Book.  It is proposed now in this Bill to get rid of it in shadow, as it has long since been got rid of in substance.</P>
      <P>Statutes relating to the style or title of the Crown, or succession to or demise of the Crown, so far as they survived the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act, 1936, and the Executive Authority (External Relations) Acts, 1936, were impliedly repealed by the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enactments relating to practice and procedure in the superior courts have been superseded by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877, and by Rules of Court made under that Act or under the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1961.  Section 26 of the Act of 1877 provides: &ldquo;the jurisdiction by this Act transferred to the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal respectively shall be exercised (so far as regards procedure and practice) in the manner provided by this Act, or by such Rules and <Col N="465" /> Orders of Court as may be made pursuant to this Act; and where no special provision is contained in this Act or in any such Rules or Orders of Court with reference thereto, it shall be exercised as nearly as may be in the same manner as the same might have been exercised by the respective Courts from which such jurisdiction shall have been transferred, or by any of such Courts&rdquo;.  The Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961, establishes new courts pursuant to Article 34 of the Constitution and provides for the disestablishment of the pre-existing courts. The Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Act, 1961, provides for the vesting of jurisdiction in the new courts, including all jurisdiction which before the commencement of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, was vested in or capable of being exercised by the courts established under the Act of 1877 and was, before the commencement of the present Act, vested in or capable of being exercised by the then existing courts.  Section 14 of the Act provides that any such jurisdiction shall be exercised so far as regards pleading, practice and procedure generally, in the manner provided by Rules of Court, and, &ldquo;where no provision is contained in such Rules and so long as there is no rule with reference thereto, it shall be exercised as nearly as possible in the same manner as it might have been exercised by the respective existing courts or judges by which or by whom such jurisdiction was, immediately before the operative date, respectively exercisable&rdquo;.  It follows that the repeal of any Pre-Union Irish statute regulating pleading, practice or procedure will in no way affect the exercise of the jurisdiction of the courts.</P>
    <P>These are the main types of enactments which are being repealed by virtue of section 1 of the Bill.  The Schedule, to which the section refers, also provides for the repeal of enactments which are otherwise obsolete or spent.  The italicised notes in the second column of the Schedule are by way of explanation of the reason for repealing each of the enactments concerned. These notes will not, of course, appear in the printed Act and are intended <Col N="466" /> to facilitate those who wish to study the Bill in detail.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill sets out the saving provisions.  It provides, one might say, <i>ex abundanti cautela,</i> that &ldquo;this Act shall not effect any existing . . . established jurisdiction, form or course of pleading, practice or procedure, notwithstanding that it may have been in any manner derived from, affirmed or recognised by any enactment hereby repealed.&rdquo;  The section also preserves any existing principles or rules of law or equity and maintains in force any statute which may have been revised, confirmed or perpetuated by any enactment repealed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The reason that the saving provisions might be regarded as being excessively cautions is that they are in addition to those provided for by Section 21 of the Interpretation Act, 1937.  I think it well to indicate what the general safeguards are in cases of repealed enactments and perhaps Deputies will bear with me if I quote the whole of subsection (1) of Section 21 of the Interpretation Act.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where an Act of the Oireachtas repeals the whole or a portion of a previous statute, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal shall not&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  revive anything not in force or not existing immediately before such repeal takes effect, or</P>
    <P>(b)  affect the previous operation of the statute or portion of a statute so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder, or</P>
    <P>(c)  affect any right, privilege, obligation, or liability acquired, accrued, or incurred under the statute or portion of a statute so repealed, or</P>
    <P>(d)  affect any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred in respect of any offence against or contravention of the statute or portion of a statute so repealed which was committed before such repeal, or</P>
    <P>(e)  prejudice or affect any legal proceedings, civil or criminal, pending at the time of such repeal in <Col N="467" /> respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, offence, or contravention as aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The following are examples of the effect of this section:</P>
    <P>Firstly, Section 10 of the Statute of Distribution, 1695, refers to a custom then existing in Ireland under which if a person died leaving a wife and children his personal estate was divided into three equal parts, one of which went to the wife, another to the children, the third part only being subject to his disposition by will; if he left a wife only and no children then his estate was to be divided into two parts of which one was to go to the wife and the other half he was free to dispose of by will.  Section 10 of the Statute declares this custom to be &ldquo;henceforth absolutely null and void&rdquo;. This section is included in the schedule of repeals in the present Bill but this repeal will not revive the ancient custom since it will not have been &ldquo;in force&rdquo; or &ldquo;existing&rdquo;&ldquo;immediately before such repeal takes effect&rdquo; as required by subsection (1) (a) of Section 21 of the Interpretation Act.</P>

      <P>I hope so.  Secondly, the Bill also proposes to repeal the various Plantation statutes, for example, the Act of 3 and 4 Philip and Mary (1556) chapter 2 declaring the title of the Crown to the counties of Laois and Offaly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The repeal of these statutes&mdash;I am glad to assure the descendants of planters who may be amongst us&mdash;will not affect any title acquired under or derived from it because of the provision at subsection <Col N="468" /> (1) (c) of Section 21 of the Interpretation Act.</P>
      <P>Deputies will, I feel sure, agree that this Bill, being a purely technical measure, is entirely non-controversial, though, as I hope I have indicated, a highly desirable piece of proposed legislation.  It is as such that I commend it to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, in effect, repeals the statutes passed between 1459 and 1800 by Parliaments then sitting in Ireland.  It is the kind of Bill which, as the Minister says, is entirely non-controversial and is also of a very technical nature.  It is in fact the kind of Bill on which it is impossible for Deputies to know, in the absence of some kind of Select Committee, whether or not the repeals being carried out in it are the correct ones.</P>
      <P>We must accept the Minister's word that they are, and that the staff of his Department have gone through these statutes with a very fine-tooth comb before the measure was introduced.  It would be virtually impossible for individual Deputies to go through the Bill in detail for the purpose of satisfying themselves on it, even given the extremely helpful marginal notes which appear in the Bill.  The Minister asks the House to regard the Bill as desirable and non-controversial.  I think he is right on that.  As far as we are concerned, we are prepared to give the Minister his Second Reading and the rest of the Bill, if he wants it.</P>

      <P>As far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, we have the same views as Deputy O'Higgins. The Bill is so complicated that it would be much better if it were left to a Select Committee so that it could be properly dealt with.  The repeals provided in this measure are long overdue.  Somebody said to me recently that if we went to the trouble of finding out the Acts of Parliament which are still in operation in this country which preclude us from doing many things which most of us do, we would look the most ridiculous race in the world.  Yet we do not seem to be doing anything about it. <Col N="469" /> I am glad that the Minister has taken his courage in his hands and has decided to do something about it.  It is rather a pity that it does not affect the title of certain people who got quite substantial properties in this country by force of arms many years ago.  Perhaps it would be unfortunate if this situation were reversed now but it would be poetic justice, if it were done.  We have no objection to the Minister getting the Bill today.</P>

In the Schedule&mdash; perhaps we could take one or two at random&mdash;on page 13, there is a Statute of George I of 1721, the Boundaries Act, and the note is that it is &ldquo;spent and obsolete&rdquo;.  Another one is on page 15, an Act of George II, the Tippling Act of 1735, of which the note says &ldquo;spent&rdquo;.  In the operative part of the Schedule, it will appear in the Bill when passed into law that the whole of that Act is repealed, but elsewhere the suggestion is that only portions of Acts are to be repealed.  If the statute is spent, why does it not say so, for instance, in the case of the Boundaries Act?  The extent of the proposed repeal of that Act is defined in the Schedule in this way:</P>
      <P>In Section 1 the words &ldquo;from and after the first day of February in the year of Our Lord One thousand seven hundred and twenty-one&rdquo; and the words &ldquo;with treble costs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Why are not the words &ldquo;whole Act&rdquo; put in?</P>

      <P>I agree that the placing of the italicised words may cause confusion but they will not appear in the final form.  I am grateful to the House for its reception of the Bill.  I should like to mention one point to which I did not refer when I was moving the Second Reading, that is, if we get this Bill through, we should be able in a comparatively short time to produce a new edition of Cullinan.  It will be a very slim volume. The production of that volume will be a very considerable help and advantage to lawyers generally.  The revised edition of Cullinan would be prepared by the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office.  I do not think there is much to be gained by a Select Committee.  Deputies have pointed out the technicalities which are inherent in the Bill and they will realise that a Select Committee would not make them any less technical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House would give me all Stages of the Bill now, I would assure any Deputy who is interested in any particular matter dealt with in the Bill that I will see to it that an official of my Department, or from the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office, will attend on any such Deputy to give him a full explanation of any <Col N="471" /> particular points, or any particular statute, in which he is interested.</P>
    <P>I might mention, with regard to what Deputy Tully said, that if, as he suggests, it were desirable that the Bill should operate to cancel out some of the effects of the Plantations, that, from my point of view, would be an excellent thing because I would then re-inherit, after a lapse of many centuries, by far the greater part of the Kingdom of Ulster, which once belonged to my ancestors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar is eol do Theactaí, d'aontaíodh meastacháin mo Roinne-se i mí Iúil seo chaite gan aon díospóireacht.  Tá Meastachán Foirlíontach á thabhairt <Col N="472" /> ós comhair na Dála anois chun caoí a thabhairt do Theachtaí cúrsaí leasa shóisialaigh a phlé.</P>
    <P>Tá trí Meastacháin le h-aghaidh na seirbhísí as a bhfuil mo Roinn-se freagarthach, mar atá, Vóta 51-Oifig an Aire, Vóta 52&mdash;Árachas Sóisialach agus Vóta 53&mdash;Cúnamh Sóisialach. 'Sé suim iomlán na dtrí Meastachán seo ná £26,001,600.  Beidh suim bhreise ag teastáil le h-aghaidh seirbhísí na Roinne sa bhliain seo nuair a chiurtear san áireamh costas na bhfeabhsanna ins na scéimeanna leasa shóisialaigh a fhógair an tAire Airgeadais san Cháinaisnéis, agus a reachtaíodh in Acht Leasa Shóisialaigh na bliana seo.  Tabharfar Meastacháin Fhoirlíontacha ós comhair na Dála níos déanaí chun an t-airgead bhreise a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá iomlán na dtrí Meastachán níos mó de £87,700 ná iomlán na dtrí Vótaí seo anuraidh mar aon leis an Vóta Fhoirlíontach le £135,000 a deonadh sa bhliain sin le h-aghaidh Cúnaimh Sóisialaigh.</P>
    <P>I gcás Vóta 51&mdash;Oifig an Aire Leasa Shóisialaigh &mdash; is faoi FoMhírcheann A atá an deifríocht is mó i gcomparáid leis an bhliain roimheseo. Táthar ag lorg £98,000 sa bhreis faoin Fho-Mhírcheann seo de bhrí gur méadaíodh rátaí tuarastail oifigeach na Roinne i rith na bliana seo chaite.</P>
    <P>San Meastacháin le h-aghaidh Árachais Shóisialaigh, táthar ag lorg £6,241,000 ón Stát-Chiste, sé sin laghdú de £80,000 i gcomparáid leis an bhliain 1961-62.  Séard is cúis leis an laghdú ná go bhfuiltear ag súil le £462,000 sa bhreis san ioncam ó rannaíocaí árachais shóisialaigh sa bhliain seo. Meastar go mbeidh an chaiteachas níos mó chomh maith, mar shompla, £153,000 sa bhreis ar Shochar Mhíchumais, £96,000 ar Shochar Cóireála, agus £102,000 ar Phinsin Ranníocha Baintrí.</P>

Séard is cúis leis an méadú ná go bhfuil costas na bhfeabhsanna a rinneadh ins na scéimeanna Cúnaimh Shóisialaigh le h-éifeacht ó thosach <Col N="473" /> mí Lúnasa 1961 iníochta ar feadh na bliana seo go léir.  Cosnóidh na feabhsanna seo £250,000 sa bhreis ar a gcostas sa bhliain seo chaite, nuair nach raibh siad i bhfeidhm ach ar feadh ocht mí.  Táthar ag súil áfach le spáráil faoi Fho-Mhírchinn Áirithe, agus dá bhrígh sin ní rachaidh an bhreis costas thar £129,000.</P>
    <P>Faoi Fho-Mhírcheann A &mdash; Pinsin Seanaoise &mdash; tá méadú de £182,000, ach nuair a cuirtear an Meastachán Foirlíontach san áireamh níl ach £42,000 sa bhreis dá lorg i mbliana. Bhéadh níos mó ag teastáil faoin Fho-Mhírcheann seo murach go bhfuil laghdú i líon na bpinsinéiri de thoradh na scéimeanna pinsean ranníochach.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú de £94,000 faoi Fho-Mhírcheann D &mdash; Pinsin Neamhranníocacha Baintreach agus Dílleachtaí, ach nuair a chuirtear an Meastachán Foirlíontach san áireamh, táthar ag lorg £1,000 níos lú ná an t-iomlán a deonadh anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Sa mhéid atá ráite agam, do mhínigh mé na fáthanna is bun leis na príomh-athruithe idir na meastacháin don dá bhliain atá i gceist. Más mian le Teachtaí a thuille eolais d'fháil ar sheirbhísí áirithe, tabharfaidh mé dhóibh é.</P>

    <P>I should like to make it clear that the sums mentioned for social insurance and social assistance do not take <Col N="474" /> account of the cost of the improvements in the social insurance schemes and the increases in the social assistance rates announced by the Minister for Finance in the Budget Statement and given effect to in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1962.  The necessary provision for these will be made by way of Supplementary Estimates later in the financial year.</P>
    <P>The total of the three Estimates, apart from the token sum of £10, is £26,001,600, an increase of £87,700 on the total of £25,913,900 for these Votes for the previous year, including a Supplementary Vote of £135,000 for Social Assistance.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare a net sum of £532,600 was provided to meet the salaries and other administration expenses borne on that Vote.  The main variations, as compared with the previous year's Vote, are an increase of £98,000 for salaries and wages under Subhead A and an increase of £64,660 under the Appropriations in Aid subhead.</P>
    <P>The increase on Subhead A is mainly due to the pay increases granted to civil servants with effect from various dates last year.  The Department's costs of administering the social insurance scheme are chargeable to the Social Insurance Fund. These costs are met in the first instance from the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, but the Vote is recouped from the Fund through the Appropriations in Aid subhead.  The increase of £64,660 under this subhead is mainly due to the increased provisions for salaries and wages of staff administering social insurance schemes.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for Social Insurance, provision was made under Subhead A for payment by the Exchequer into the Social Insurance Fund of the estimated amount by which the expenditure of the Fund will exceed its income in 1962-63.  The estimated amount was £6,241,000, a decrease of £80,000 on the provision for 1961-62.</P>
    <P>The expenditure of the Fund in 1962-63 was estimated at £17,719,000 made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The income of the Social Insurance Fund in 1962-63 was estimated at £11,478,000.  It consists of £10,750,000 from employment contributions, £613,000 in income from investments of the Fund and £115,000 in receipts under reciprocal arrangements.</P>
    <P>The decrease of £80,000 in the amount of the Exchequer contribution as compared with 1961-62 is the net result of variations, up and down, in the items constituting the expenditure and income of the Fund.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side, the main increases are £153,000 for disability benefit, £102,000 for widows' and orphans' (contributory) pensions, £96,000 for treatment benefit and £100,000 for administration costs, offset by a reduction of £65,000 in the provision for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The increases for disability benefit and treatment benefit were based on expenditure in 1961-62, which shows a rising trend.  The increase in the requirement for widows' and orphans' (contributory) pensions is due to an anticipated continuing rise in the number of widows' contributory pensions in 1962-63.  The reduction in the provision for unemployment benefit was based on experience in 1961-62.</P>
    <P>The increase of £100,000 in the provision for administration costs is mainly due to the Civil Service pay increases already mentioned.  On the income side, the total Estimate shows an increase of £463,000 over the previous year's provision.  This increase is almost entirely due to estimated additional income from employment contributions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> As regards social assistance, the net Estimate for 1962-63 is £19,190,000, an increase of £129,000 on the provision for 1961-62 including the Supplementary Vote of £135,000 for that year.  I should mention that the figures shown in the 1961-62 columns in the Estimates Volume do not include the increases in last year's estimates rendered necessary by the improvements in the Assistance services which took effect from the beginning of August last year.  These increases were voted in a Supplementary Estimate which was passed in March last after the Volume of Estimates was published. The net amount of the Supplementary Estimate for Social Assistance for 1961-62 was £135,000.</P>
    <P>The increase of £129,000 on the revised provision for 1961-62 arises out of the necessity to provide for the cost of the increases in rates and other improvements granted from August, 1961, for the whole of 1962-63 as against eight months in 1961-62.  These increases and improvements were estimated to cost an additional sum of £250,000 in 1962-63 compared with the cost in 1961-62.  The increase on the 1961-62 provision would, therefore, have been £250,000 were it not for certain anticipated savings in 1962-63.</P>
    <P>The provision of £9,182,000 for old age pensions is £182,000 higher than the original estimate for this subhead last year.  The increase is, however, reduced to £42,000 when a supplementary provision of £140,000 for this service last year is taken into account. The increase is due to the provision for a full year for the rate increases and other improvements effected by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1961.  The increase would have been greater but for a reduction in the number of non-contributory old age pensioners resulting from the continuing impact of the contributory pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The provision of £1,100,000 for unemployment assistance in 1962-63 is £10,000 less than the provision of £1,110,000 in the original Vote for 1961-62, notwithstanding the fact that the estimate for unemployment assistance for 1962-63 includes £206,000 to cover the estimated cost in this year <Col N="477" /> of the increases and concessions brought about by the 1961 Act already referred to.  The reduced provision for 1962-63 was based on the improved unemployment position in 1961-62.</P>
    <P>As regards widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions, the provision of £1,842,000 for 1962-63 is £94,000 more than the original provision of £1,748,000 for this service in 1961-62 but £1,000 less than the revised provision of £1,843,000 effected by the Supplementary Estimate for that year. The decrease in the provision for 1962-63 is due to an anticipated continuance in this year of the downward trend in the number of non-contributory pensioners.</P>
    <P>The provision of £338,000 for appropriations in aid in 1962-63 is little different from the original provision of £334,500 for the previous year.  This latter figure was, however, altered to £435,000 by the Supplementary Estimate for 1961-62.  The increase of approximately £100,000 in that year was mainly due to a large volume of adjustments between the Social Assistance Vote and the Social Insurance Fund in respect of interim payments of non-contributory old age pensions which arose in 1961-62 following the introduction of the old age contributory pensions scheme and the removal of the upper age limit of 70 years for widows' contributory pensions in January, 1961.</P>
    <P>I have explained briefly the causes of the main variations between the provision for the current year and that for last year.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the matter in any greater detail, but I will of course give Deputies any further particulars they may require in relation to specific items.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, the Estimate for Social Welfare would present the House with the only opportunity it would get during the year to examine the administration of the Minister's Department but it so happened this year we have had a number of opportunities presented to us.  The Minister's statement is one which is swamped with a lot of figures, comparative and otherwise, and it would require considerable time to examine <Col N="478" /> them in detail against the figures that were quoted for other years.  However it is clear from listening to the Minister's statement that any increases in the Estimate for this year have been created by increases in wages and salaries to a very great extent.  This prompts one to comment on the necessity for applying to the beneficiaries the money is intended to reach that measure od support which they would need in these times to meet the cost of living that now operates.</P>
      <P>When the Minister mentions here and there in the course of his statement increases, improvements, and so on, he fails to advert to the fact that during the years to which he refers the country has suffered a constant reduction in the value of money.  It was only last week that the Taoiseach's Department informed us that what would in 1945 provide 20/- worth of goods and services will now provide only 11/10d. worth.  Even making a comparison with last year, the quantity of goods one could purchase has again decreased inasmuch as it would require more to buy the same quantum of goods and services that could be bought this time last year. The complete abolition of food subsidies drove the cost of living figure into an orbit which it is in since the Government decided upon that course and it is in that light we must view the efforts being made since then to ease the situation on some sections of the community because of the impact of this increase in the cost of the necessities of life.  Each one of us in his own locality, and in his own constituency, knows there are many people whose incomes have not been increased in such a manner as completely to cancel the effect of the drastic increases in the cost of living which have occurred over the last four or five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the administration of the Department, the extension of the areas of the investigating officers will exacerbate the situation that unfortunately exists where the local sub-committees are not in that degree of touch with the investigation officer that one would like.  Many members of local sub-committees are frustrated in their efforts to advance the interests <Col N="479" /> of the people whose circumstances require assistance.  It is unfortunate that so many officers have been withdrawn. We know the reason for it, the absorption of so many non-contributory pensioners by the contributory scheme.  Nevertheless, I think it is a retrograde step.  It would be a helpful thing if there were better liaison between these officers and the local sub-committees.  I do not know why these officers cannot attend the local sub-committee meetings and confer with these members of the community who in this day and age are prepared to devote their time to looking after the interests of their less fortunate neighbours.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I have referred on previous occasions and to which I should again like to refer.  It is the anomaly of a transferred farm to a son or daughter being recognised at a certain valuation for the purpose of obtaining the old age pension.  This incentive exists and is helpful in encouraging people to give over their farms at a particular age and transfer the ownership to more active members of their family.  We have cases, however, of childless couples adopting a niece or nephew at a young age.  Their children give their time without recompense in the hope of becoming owners of the farm at some stage.  In those instances the transfer is not recognised for the purpose of the Social Welfare Act.  I would ask the Minister to look at that situation and I would impress on him that these people are as deserving of recognition as the closer relatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual for members of the Labour Party when speaking in this debate each year to draw attention to the fact that, in the opinion of the Party members, the benefits under the various headings are altogether inadequate.  It is just as usual for the reply to come back from the Government benches that they are giving all that is economically possible to give them, or for the reply to be in the form of the sally: &ldquo;What did you do when Corish was Minister?&rdquo; I hope the Minister will listen to this debate in a different spirit.  In fact, I hope to forestall both those answers during the course of my remarks. <Col N="480" /> In connection with the statement that those in receipt of State benefits under the social welfare code are getting all that the economy of the country can afford, I suggest to the Minister that if he looks at the figures for tax revenue <i>versus</i> social welfare benefits, and the proportion of social welfare benefits which includes national assistance and national insurance plus administration and studies, the expenditure <i>vis-à-vis</i> tax revenue from the year 1957-58 up to the present, he will find that there has been a gradual decline in the proportion of money allocated to these people, who, in my opinion, are the most deserving in the State.</P>
      <P>In the year 1957-58 tax revenue was £102.7 million and social welfare expenditure was £25.5 million.  That, expressed as a percentage, is 24.8.  In 1958-59, tax revenue rose to £104.1 million and social welfare benefits decreased from £25.5 million to £25.4 million and the percentage declined to 24.4.  The year 1959-60 shows a further decline.  There was an increase in tax revenue up to £107.3 million and social welfare expenditure was £25.5 million, representing 23.8 per cent. That is a continuous decrease.  In 1961-62 and up to 1963, there was a similar decline so that in 1962-63, when tax revenue was £136 million, social welfare expenditure was £27.1 million, that is, 19.8 per cent. of the tax revenue.  To put it another way, between 1958 and 1962, there was an increase of £32 million in tax revenue and of this increase, less than £2 million increase was given to social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that that debunks the claim that the social welfare group are getting all that it is economically possible to give them in present circumstances. I would further suggest that in view of the increased contributions being paid by the ordinary workers throughout the country not only did the increased contributions pay for the increase in contributory benefits given to those who qualified for them, but that the Minister's Department made a handsome profit on the deal.  I would further suggest that not only the Minister's Department but several other institutions in the State made <Col N="481" /> considerable gains out of the provision of contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a single old age pensioner.  Prior to the increased contributions, and prior to the benefits being increased to £2 a week, he was in receipt of 30/- a week old age pension. If he had been entitled to a special allowance for IRA services, he had a varied sum of money, depending on his means, up to perhaps £2 a week.  As well as that, he was probably entitled to free turf and, in addition, he was very likely in receipt of a disability benefit or home assistance from his local authority. Immediately his pension was increased, his IRA pension and his special allowance were similarly decreased. His home assistance was cut off and he was deprived of the right to free turf under the free fuel scheme.  I suggest to the Minister that, on the whole, not only did the State not give out anything extra but that it actually gained by the introduction of that much lauded improvement in social welfare.</P>
    <P>Again, I would suggest, to deal with the catch cry &ldquo;Why did Corish not give more than 2/6d.?&rdquo;, that while it is true that in 1955 the inter-Party Government increased old age pensions and other non-contributory pensions by 2/6d., that 2/6d. in 1955 cannot be compared with the 2/6d. increase given last August.  In 1955, the cost of living was much different from what it is in 1962.</P>
    <P>I should like to read for the benefit of the Minister some figures of the variations in prices since 1955.  In May, 1955, butter cost 3/9d. per lb. and in mid-May, 1962, it cost 4/7d.  Milk cost 5d. a pint; it now costs 6½d. a pint. A 2 lb. loaf cost 9d. then; it now costs 1/4d.  There was an increase of practically 100 per cent. in the price of flour, from 4/2¼d. per stone to 8/3d. per stone.  Tea cost 4/11¾d. then; it now costs 6/2½ per lb.  There have been increases in other items which go to make up the cost of living index figure. In respect of clothing, the figure stood at 100.2 in 1955; it is now at 109.4. The fuel and light figure was 103.2; it is now 119.8.  Housing was 105.6; it is now 131.8.  Those are substantial increases which have had the effect of <Col N="482" /> devaluing the present 2/6d. as against the 2/6d. given in 1955.</P>
    <P>Not only is it desirable to give an increase in social welfare benefits to people who, through no fault of their own, have the misfortune to have to try to exist on State aid, but it is desirable to give such an increase also because we are contemplating entering the European Common Market.  It may be thought that the question of the Common Market is a far cry from social welfare benefits in Ireland, but I suggest there is a very close connection between the two.  I was looking up some figures in page 2 of the September issue of the magazine <i>Trade Union Information.</i> In it there is a report of a sub-committee of the National Employer-Labour Conference under the heading &ldquo;Common Market&rdquo;.  I quote from the magazine:</P>
    <P>One of the Sub-Committees set up by the National Employer-Labour Conference, 1962, studied the possible repercussions on labour relations and social policy in the event of Ireland joining the Common Market.  Among the matters on which the Sub-Committee reported to the plenary session of the conference held on 11th July were labour costs, productivity trends, hours of work, paid holidays and social security.  The following are extracts from the report of the Sub-Committee dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>It goes on to give a long account, but I should like to quote what I regard as the important parts of the report. Under the heading &ldquo;Labour Costs&rdquo;, it says:</P>
    <P>In particular, any comparisons with continental countries must take account of the incidence of social charges borne by employers which in some cases represent a high proportion of wages.</P>
    <P>It then goes on to give figures for the average hourly labour costs in manufacturing industry, taking April, 1959, as the only year in which full details were available.  The table shows that in the United States, yearly earnings amounted to 15/10d. per head, to <Col N="483" /> which was added a figure of 3/2d. for social security benefits giving a total figure of 19/-.  In Sweden, the figures were 6/8d. with 1/- added, making a total of 7/8d.; in Germany, 3/10d., with 1/9d. added, giving 5/7d.; in Switzerland, 4/9d., with 9d. added, giving 5/6d.; in the United Kingdom, 4/10d., with 8d. added, giving 5/6d.; in Belgium, 4/-, with 1/3d. added, giving 5/3d.; in France, 3/4d., with 1/9d. added, giving 5/1d.; in Italy 2/6d., with 1/10d. added, giving 4/4d.; and in the Netherlands, 3/2d., with 1/11d. added, giving 5/1d.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that no figures are available for Ireland because Ireland did not come under review in this report. However, I quote again from the same paper:</P>
    <P>Figures for Ireland were not included in the French study.  It has been estimated, however, that a roughly corresponding figure here for average hourly labour costs in manufacturing industry in March, 1959, was approximately 3s. 5d. of which social charges accounted for about 4½d.  This estimate is a very rough approximation only and the resulting position of Ireland in the table of labour costs should, therefore, be interpreted with caution.  It would appear, however, that hourly labour costs here were somewhat less than in the Netherlands and Italy, but appreciably below the other Common Market countries and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Is it likely that the Common Market countries will fall over themselves to welcome into their fold a country whose average rates of earnings in industry are so low as to place those countries in an unfavourable competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am passing from it anyway, Sir.  I agree that increases in social welfare benefits would require legislation, but surely it does not require legislation to tell the Minister that the existing benefits are too low and that legislation should be introduced to improve them?</P>
      <P>We have heard the Taoiseach and various Ministers saying that in the Common Market the Border will melt away.  But is it likely that will happen? Social welfare benefits in Northern Ireland are considerably better than in the 26 Counties.  I should like to take a simple example.  A husband and wife in Northern Ireland get £4 15s. 6d. national assistance, which corresponds to unemployment assistance here.  All they would get here would be £2 2s. 6d. in urban areas and £1 14s. 6d. in rural areas.  Surely it is most unlikely that anyone in Northern Ireland, be he Unionist or Nationalist, would be prepared to relinquish his rights to these benefits, which are so much better compared with ours?  Is it not reasonable, if we are serious in our efforts to unite this country, that one of the first and most vital steps is to bring up our social benefits to correspond, so far as is humanly possible, with those in Britain?  I am not foolish enough to think it possible for us to go the full way but I suggest the difference between us is of vital importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One small matter to which I have already drawn the attention of the Minister's Department is this.  I should like the Minister to investigate a report I received in my constituency a couple of weeks ago in which it was claimed by Irish sailors resident in Ireland but working on British ships that when they receive an injury in the course of their employment, because <Col N="485" /> they were using Irish insurance stamps&mdash;they were insured in Ireland under our social welfare code&mdash;they were not eligible for workmen's compensation. One of those, after three or four weeks' illness, got no workmen's compensation, although admittedly he was injured in his employer's work on the high seas and applied to the Department of Social Welfare here as a substitute.  All he got was a reply stating that in view of the fact that he was at his work when the injury occurred, the Department had no responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I should like to clear up any misunderstanding that might exist in connection with this Bill.  Irrespective of any change in Standing Orders that may have taken place recently, Private Members' Bills still get preference over motions and this Bill would be taken tomorrow evening one way or another, even if there were no change in Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself is a very simple measure.  It seeks to change the vital section in the 1958 Transport Act.  The subsection it seeks to change deals with the general powers and duties of the Board of CIE and it reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be the duty of the Board to conduct its undertakings so that, as soon as may be, and in any case not later than 31st day of March, 1964, its operating expenditure, including <Col N="486" /> all charges properly chargeable to revenue, shall not be greater than the revenue of the Board.</P>
    <P>In plain, blunt English, that simply means that there is a duty on the Board of CIE to make CIE a paying proposition by 1964, irrespective of what may happen in bringing about that situation.</P>
    <P>It is crystal clear to me and to Deputy Dr. Browne that Dáil Éireann in 1958 gave its consent to the policy which is now being so ruthlessly operated by the Board of CIE.  Undoubtedly it was Government policy in 1958, the policy of the then Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, and his colleague, Deputy Childers, to give preference to road transport over the rail and canal system.  That was well known to all members of this House and in order to achieve their purpose of eliminating the railways, the then Government, with the assistance and co-operation of the House, passed a measure that would enable a hand-picked Board chosen by the Government to discharge that responsibility, to get rid of the railways and get back to a private enterprise system which in time would leave the road services at the mercy of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>There was never any doubt in the mind of any Deputy that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport and Power favoured road instead of rail transport and in order to carry out their policy, they selected for the Board of CIE men who thought likewise. It is interesting to note that the then Opposition, when the 1958 Transport Act was being discussed, did not object to that subsection which conferred those very drastic powers on the Board of CIE.  The particular section, Section 7, was dealt with on the Committee Stage in less than half a column of the Dáil Debates, as far as discussion is concerned.  I checked carefully and on the Committee Stage, there was not a peep or a murmur out of any member of the major Opposition Party against the subsection which we believe will be deleted from the records of the House by the time this Bill is completed.</P>
    <P>Seeing there was no division in the House and no critical opposition on <Col N="487" /> the part of the Opposition, it appears they also must have then favoured the Government policy of reducing the railways to make them so uneconomic and unattractive that it would be only a matter of time before they disappeared from the countryside.  Deputy Browne and I all along have been opposed to the idea of closing our railway lines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I shall deal with that point in the course of my speech.  We have been opposed to this closing spree embarked upon by CIE for various reasons.  I want to get clear if the major Opposition group clearly understood the implications of the decision they supported in 1958 conferring these powers on CIE.  The Opposition knew the mind of the then Tánaiste and of the present Minister for Transport and Power, that they were prejudiced against rail transport. If it should be suggested that it was through ignorance on the part of the major Opposition groups that this section was allowed to pass, all I can say, when such a serious matter was involved, is that the people who allowed this section to go through without a protest or a division were not fit to hold their responsible position in Opposition.  If they did realise the implications of the powers being conferred on CIE to eliminate railways, it is hard to understand why they failed to oppose this section, unless they saw an opportunity at a later stage to play politics when the actual unpopular moves and decisions were made to close branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from the evidence available to us that that assumption of mine is correct because on the Order Paper there are two motions dealing with the situation in CIE, one from the Fine Gael benches, signed by no fewer than 11 responsible Deputies, and the other signed by the Labour Party.  It is well known that motions in this House in that connection cannot be implemented.  If the motion which Fine Gael have on the Order Paper in regard to the prices of bus fares in Dublin were to be implemented, it would mean that this House <Col N="488" /> was trying to direct the Board, contrary to the powers conferred on the Board by the House in 1958.</P>
    <P>The case has been made here by a number of Opposition speakers that the West Cork railway should not have been abandoned.  There have been yelps and howls from Opposition Deputies about the proposed closing of certain midland lines.  These Deputies are representing themselves to the innocent public outside as the defenders of the rail system and as being anxious to prevent the Government from closing them whereas they themselves walked into the division lobbies here to confer on CIE the power to take the steps which it considered necessary in the interests of economy.</P>
    <P>That is the position.  If these people in Opposition are serious about reversing the decisions which have been made by CIE and about preventing the closure of rail lines, it is not by motions in this House that they will tackle the problem ; it is by getting at the root of the problem, which is the Act itself.  The Act to which I refer is the 1958 Act.  This Bill gives an opportunity to all Deputies who are interested in the preservation and the proper utilisation of our transport system, in particular the railway system. If Deputies are so interested at this stage, before any further damage is done, they can support this measure to ensure that the powers and the directions given to CIE will no longer be available to it and that its hands will be tied as far as the closing of further lines is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, at a meeting of Roscrea Muintir na Tíre Guild had this to say, that the substitution of road services for the railway on 396 route miles of branch lines during the past three years had been justified on the grounds of satisfactory services at an economic cost.  When we examine the accounts of CIE over the past 12 months, and listen to the public protests in the areas where lines have been closed, I do not think we can take the Minister seriously as far as that suggestion is concerned, but it is worth noting that he has admitted that over 396 route miles of branch lines <Col N="489" /> have been closed in the last three years.  He went on to state that CIE is considering the substitution of road services for rail services on 23 additional branch lines.  That statement was made only last September, that there are 23 additional branch lines for the knife as far as the Board of CIE is concerned.</P>
    <P>The closing of those branch lines will impose serious hardship on the people in the areas involved.  I shall deal with that matter at a later stage, but I should just like to quote further from the statement made by the Minister for Transport and Power in Roscrea.  I can only describe him as gloating at what had happened to the railways.  He referred to the &ldquo;truly remarkable achievement of CIE in the brief period of four years&rdquo; and then attributed the deficit of £1.6 million for the year ended March, 1962, to the eighth round wages increase. It is apparent from that that this Minister &mdash; and I presume he speaks for his Government &mdash; is in complete agreement with the policy of CIE as operated up to the present, namely, the closing down of what can be described as absolutely economic lifelines to the rural community for transport purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer to my charge is that we are going to provide a proper road transport system instead. I do not think any Deputy who gives serious consideration to the implications involved in leaving the country almost dependent on road services for transport will agree that, nationally, that is a safe or a sound decision to make.  I do not think it is.  I do not think that many members of the Minister's Party would agree with his outlook in that regard</P>
    <P>The annual report, to which I have referred in connection with the Minister's speech, shows a bias against rail transport and the rail system.  It shows that bias very clearly.  It shows the extent to which the board of directors favours the road services over the rail system.  Let us take the figures given for the passenger service on the railway.  In the 12 months ended March, 1962, over 900,000 fewer passengers travelled on the railway <Col N="490" /> than in 1961.  In round figures one might say that 1,000,000 fewer passengers travelled on the trains in 1962 than in 1961.  Despite the fact that there were almost 1,000,000 fewer travellers, CIE showed a loss of only £21,000 on this service.  That was due solely to the increase in rail fares that they were able to secure.  CIE were able almost to balance the takings evenly between 1961 and 1962 despite the fact that there were almost 1,000,000 fewer passengers carried on the railway.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, that showed a deliberate attempt on the part of CIE to make the rail system unattractive in the eyes of the travelling public.  My view on that issue is that there is no justification for suggesting that if the rail fares were left as they were, those one million passengers would have gone away from the railways and would have travelled by other means. It was a signal to me at any rate that these people were most anxious to get away from the rail system.</P>
    <P>Let us take now the goods train traffic.  In the financial year ending in 1962, CIE carried 138,000 tons less than in 1961.  In spite of that, their takings increased by £60,000.  Again there we have a situation in which an increase of £60,000 came about as a result of very steep increases in the charges for carrying goods by rail. Was there any justification for that increase in charges?  Is it not fair to assume that there would not be this falling off of 138,000 tons of freightage on the railways had there been no change in freight rates?  But the freight rates were changed in the hope that the volume of traffic would go down considerably, thereby prejudicing the public against the railways and in favour of road transport.</P>
    <P>In the annual report, they go on then to deal with the revenue from road freight and road passenger services.  The revenue from road passengers increased by £478,000. This is the most interesting aspect, to my mind; the number of passengers carried was over 303,000,000, the greatest number carried so far in the history of the undertaking.  As I pointed out, we had almost 1,000,000 fewer passengers carried on the rail <Col N="491" /> system last year.  I am sure the major proportion of those passengers have now gone over to the road and are being carried by the road system.  The incentive to travel by train was no longer there.  The suggestion is now made that these people prefer to travel by road.  If one system is made more attractive in the eyes of the public, naturally that is the system people will adopt.  People are not fools; they will opt for what is more attractive.  If certain people think it is desirable to get rid of railways, the best way to do that is by turning the public against them, by shoving up the charges and making road services appear more attractive.</P>

      <P>It is suggested in the annual report that as far as the closing of railway lines is concerned everything in the garden is lovely.  We are told that the system in West Cork, where the railway was closed in the not too distant past, is working in a most satisfactory manner.  I should like to hear the views of the Deputies from the south on that.  I should like to hear the views of the public in the area which has been deprived of its rail system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar claim has been made by the Board of CIE in connection with the closing of the West Clare railway. A similar claim is made in connection with the Waterford-Tramore line.  The claim is there in black and white in the report.  It is suggested that the present service is a better service and that the public&mdash;traders and everybody else&mdash;in these areas are perfectly satisfied and prefer the road system to the rail system.  That is the statement made in the report.  I do not profess to speak for the south.  I am sure there are many Deputies here who will speak for it.  I should like, however, to comment on the most recent pronouncement made by CIE.  I refer to the decision to close four branch lines in the Midlands.  It is proposed to close the Clara to Banagher line and save £8,510; it is proposed to close the Birr-Roscrea line and save £8,881; it is proposed to close the Portlaoise-Mountmellick <Col N="492" /> line and save the huge sum of £1,152.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to close the Portlaoise-Kilkenny line and save this vast sum&mdash;vast in the mind of the Minister for Transport and Power, moryah!&mdash;of £6,625.  These four lines provide an essential service. They are the links from the west to the south, and to Dublin.  They are being closed to save CIE a sum of some £44,000 a year.  There has been no indication from CIE as to how travellers in the west of Ireland will be facilitated, if they want to visit Deputy Lynch's constituency of Waterford after 1st January next.  Up to now people from Athlone, and the west generally, could get connections at Portarlington and Portlaoise for Waterford.  As far as I can find out, there is no provision for these people after 1st January, no facility to enable them to go down south.</P>
      <P>I regard this decision to close these four lines as a retrograde decision.  It is an arrogant decision on the part of those who have been given these powers.  The same mentality has been displayed by CIE in relation to our canals.  Personal experience over the past eight or nine years has convinced me that the Minister for Transport and Power hates the sight of a canal. In their annual report, the Board of CIE show the same attitude towards canals as they have displayed towards the railways.  In the past 12 months, a decision was taken to close a number of our canal branches.  The branch lines between Naas, Kilbeggan and Ballinasloe were closed by CIE. What is their condition to-day?  They are derelict sites.  Legislation was passed here within the past 12 months empowering local authorities to take action against private individuals for failing to clear derelict sites and put them into decent condition.  Here we have a State body, with the consent and approval of the Minister, changing the face of the countryside and making it anything but attractive to tourists or to our own citizens.</P>

    <P>We had a decision to close the Royal Canal.  That decision has been <Col N="493" /> implemented as to portion of the canal.  I admit, and I make no secret of the fact, that, for navigational purposes, this particular canal was not used very much in recent years.  That is understandable when we remember the attractive propositions made by CIE and private hauliers to encourage road transport.  It was inevitable the transport on the canal system would fall.  As soon as it did fall, that was the excuse to decide to close it. They closed down about 30 miles of it, I think, in the Minister's former constituency from Ballinacargy over to the Shannon at Tarmonbarry.  When that stretch of the canal was closed, it was assumed that the water would be left there but even that amenity was removed.  This 30 mile section was drained, although many people believed that the level of the water at that time would be maintained.</P>
    <P>What has been the position along there?  First of all, the farmers in the locality were deprived of water which was at their disposal for the past 100 years for their livestock.  Secondly, the canal bed has become a death trap for animals, having regard to the mud that is there now.  The local anglers who use the canal for fishing purposes have no longer the opportunity to do so. The small guest houses which were attracting foreign tourists and anglers to come there and fish were placed in jeopardy.  It is a well-known fact that in England there is no end to the number of ordinary citizens who are very keen coarse fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I not give the reason to the House why CIE should not be allowed to retain these powers?  I have tried to suggest that damage is being done in the areas where the Royal Canal has been closed; that damage is being done to the farming community and to tourism.  In addition to that, the canals themselves are, in my opinion, a public nuisance at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me get back to the section itself and to what Deputy Cunningham wanted to know.  He wanted to know what were our views on the closing of branch lines.  Let me make it quite <Col N="496" /> clear.  We do not stand for, advocate, or want to see inefficiency or waste operating in the transport system.  We have plenty of examples of incompetency at the top in the running of CIE.  We do not propose to deal with those during the course of this debate but we do say that it is not in the national interest to insist by law that CIE shall operate without financial loss.  We cannot put it simpler than that.  We maintain that the road system is completely inadequate to carry the present&mdash;and I emphasise that&mdash;heavy commercial traffic which uses the road system, to say nothing at all of the ever-increasing number of vehicles coming on the road from now on.  In my opinion, the roads as they are are not good enough in many areas to carry the light cars that run on them.  Under the 1958 Act, the Board of CIE would have responsibility for the safety of operation of vehicles.  I think they are forgetting about it, in their mad rush to get rid of railways.</P>
    <P>No good, sound evidence has been adduced to this House or to the public that the capital cost involved in the purchase of lorries, heavy machinery, spare engines, tyres and spare parts is less than the capital cost of replacing or improving the rail system.  It is beyond denial that our roads today are a death trap.  What do the Minister and CIE propose to do?  They propose to divert more and more of the heavy merchandise from the rail and to have it carried by these big CIE trucks on roads that are inadequate to carry them.  It would be a simple thing, in a few years' time, for CIE to suggest that they are a paying proposition, having got rid of the railways and got on to road transport, but who is paying for the roads?</P>
    <P>Who is paying the capital cost of making the roads?  Is it not the taxpayer? It may be suggested that CIE are paying portion of it.  They are paying only a limited portion. However, for the damage they are doing, they are not paying anything like what they should.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the maintenance of roads, we have a still heavier charge. <Col N="497" /> Anybody who knows anything about roads knows that the upkeep of steamrolled roads is a very heavy cost on the Exchequer and on the rates. County and link roads are now being used by heavy CIE lorries although these roads are not fit to carry that type of traffic.</P>
    <P>Where is the money to come from to put these roads in a condition to enable them, over the next ten or 15 years, to carry those heavy trucks? The cost of making these roads per mile is fantastic.  We hear nothing from the Minister about these costs. They must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Without again referring to the canals in any detail, I suggest that many heavy and bulky goods could be carried by rail and canal.  It should be mandatory that such goods&mdash;I shall not specify them now&mdash;be carried by rail and canal.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for allowing certain types of goods which are transported by road at present to be carried by CIE or indeed by private hauliers.  I mention petrol as one of them.  We have the fantastic position that every day of the week a stream of monstrous petrol lorries move out from this city on all the trunk roads and move from the trunk roads to the county roads.  They go down as far as Galway, and to the South and up to Sligo.  Is there any reason why that petrol, in bulk, could not be transported by rail to key centres&mdash;say, in Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon, Galway and others&mdash;and then the deliveries made by light petrol wagon?</P>
    <P>Consider the saving to the rates and to the central Exchequer in respect of money that is now being expended on roads to facilitate foreign combines to make profits at the expense of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It is a crime on the part of the Minister to allow a vested interest the use of the roads to destroy them, as is happening at present.  There is every justification for legislation which will make it mandatory on a group such as the petrol retailers to carry their goods by canal or by rail.  There is no justification for suggesting that a few <Col N="498" /> thousand gallons must be delivered in a hurry from Dublin to Athlone.</P>
    <P>If an example were made there, if the decision were made so far as petrol is concerned, it could be followed up in many other spheres in respect of many other types of goods which are at present being carried on the roads.  I believe that this will have to be carried out.  Somebody has said that there are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with butter.  If they are not prevented by law from doing it then motor taxation of a very heavy nature could be imposed in respect of these weighty vehicles.  That would be one way of dealing with it.  Get them off the roads by making it so expensive for them that they will carry their goods by rail.  If the Minister were serious about keeping our railways and about preventing them from being disused, that is the action he would take.  However, we know that his interest lies in the road system, for a start, and finally in getting back to the private haulier.</P>
    <P>Deputies have mentioned the responsibility on the Board of CIE to look after the interests of the workers.  We know the position well.  There is no co-operation at the moment.  There is no understanding between management and men.  There is a feeling of complete mistrust brought about by the actions of a dictatorial board, backed by a dictatorial Minister.</P>
    <P>The livelihood and the future of men does not seem to count with the Government or with the Board of CIE.  They are the Government who talk about the steps they propose to take when we enter the Common Market to look after the welfare of our workers.  If their attitude is anything like their attitude towards the workers of CIE, who will be redundant in the next three to four years, it is a poor outlook for our workers who are not in State or semi-State employment. What will happen to those who are depending on private employers?</P>
    <P>A long-term view should be taken of the question of transport.  The fact that hurried decisions were taken in other countries that railways are a thing of the past, are old-fashioned and are out of date&mdash;a view held on parts <Col N="499" /> of the Continent and in parts of America&mdash;is no reason why we should ape these people in every respect.  A decision has now been taken in a number of continental cities, in particular, and even in America, to restore rail services in heavily-populated areas because the situation had been arrived at that the huge volume of traffic on the roads had led to chaos and the police and the authorities cannot cope with the traffic problems.  Coming into certain cities it was a frightening position to find traffic jams brought about because people were no longer using rails and they have decided in many places, as far as I can gather, to restore the rail system, especially leading to industrial centres.</P>
    <P>Is it not common sense to use the railway as often and as much as we can and keep as many people off the roads as possible while, at the same time, giving them a good, constant, ordered, efficient and punctual service? Apart from any other consideration, it would probably save lives because we know what has happened in this country in the past twelve months&mdash; the accident rate is something frightening. The Minister and the Government should take a long term view of this.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to add, except that this is an opportunity being given on this very important measure to Deputies on all sides to express their disapproval of the policy of the Board of CIE in getting rid of railways and canals and leaving this country, as may well happen at some stage in the future, dependent on its transport on countries abroad.  We know what happened in Suez.  We do not want the position that this country would be dependent on petrol supplies and other forms of liquid fuel from abroad, if any serious international situation arose.  We would be a nice sight in such a situation.  That is what this Government are bringing about, unless we are accepting completely defence commitments in a new European <i>bloc.</i> Undoubtedly in those circumstances, we would get plenty of petrol but we might get a hell of a lot of other things as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Seán Dunne Mr. Seán Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand this Bill, it seeks to bring about a change of policy and a change of attitude on the part of the Government, on the part of the majority of members of the Dáil, in so far as the running of CIE is concerned.  I agree with Deputy McQuillan that the policy which is being pursued by the Minister for Transport and Power, and by any of his predecessors who thought like him, has brought about a disastrous condition of things in so far as transport in this country is concerned.  That policy has put into office an individual, a politically appointed civil servant, as I might describe him, who has shown nothing but contempt for the ordinary people of this city and particularly for the ordinary people of my constituency, the working people of Ballyfermot.</P>
      <P>The policy which he has been implementing has been one dictated by the Government, based on the proposition which could only have emerged from the morbid brain of a political pachyderm, that this nationalised system should be placed on the same basis as a commercial business, that it should be made to pay a profit.  That has not been mentioned but the assumption is that it should in time be made to pay a profit; that, in other words, the vital needs of the nation and the vital needs of the people for transport must surely fall into the same category, in terms of necessity, as provisions for the health of the people.  It must surely fall into the same category as provisions which we make for the social welfare of the people.  The proposition is that the transport of the nation be placed on the same basis as one would place a huckster's business in some small town.  The test that is being applied to it is whether or not it will pay.  Of course, in the implementation of this policy of trying to make it pay, the question must arise as to who is in fact being asked to pay the maximum part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Herein enters the political twist. One might think a Government which firmly believe this policy would say: &ldquo;Let the more well-to-do sections of the community bear the heaviest end <Col N="501" /> of the load; let the wealthier farmers who ship cattle for export or to the Dublin market bear the heavier end of the load.&rdquo;  But they do not say that. They take the most vulnerable section of the people, and a very big proportion of that section live in Ballyfermot, and they exact from them the last possible halfpenny in increased bus fares for two purposes: to ensure that the wealthier farmers will not be hurt politically, that they can be kept in the voting train of the Government Party, and to justify this eighteenth century concept of how a public service should be run, this Dickensian idea that it must be made to pay and that that is all that counts.  It does not matter if you leave whole rural areas without branch lines or, in fact, transport of any kind; it does not matter if a man with six in family, living in Ballyfermot and being robbed by a differential rent system of anything up to 36/- a week, who has to work, say, in Blackrock in County Dublin, must pay 17/- a week in bus fares out of a wage of perhaps £9 or £10 a week.</P>
    <P>That does not concern Iron-man Andrews or the Minister for Transport and Power.  The thing they, and with which we in this House, are concerned in our lofty eminence, is to get a balance sheet in which the figures will even out, will balance out nicely, and this artistically-produced annual report, with its multi-coloured design, which must incidentally have cost a queer penny, will show that we are living in the true tradition of capitalist economy, without any regard whatsoever for anything except the need to make CIE pay.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at one of the internal activities in this institution. They have a thing there called time and motion study and I invite the attention of the House to this exercise. An individual standing with a stopwatch in his hand watches men working, times them and gets £50 per week for it.  This is part of the economy being practised by the people who run CIE at the present time.</P>
    <P>Now, whenever we try to raise matters such as this, such as the matter of the pistol-to-the-head policy in so <Col N="502" /> far as bus fares are concerned, we invariably find the Minister ducking behind this pretence of having no official responsibility.  Surely we are the authority here which provides the funds which make it possible for these civil servants and clerks, whom I have observed not using buses or trains but driving in luxurious cars to their headquarters at Kingsbridge, to make the running of this operation possible, and surely we must have a responsibility, and we must have an inherent right, to get this information when we ask for it.  I have had at least a half a dozen questions relating to CIE disallowed by the Chair&mdash; unavoidably, I know, because of the Chair's position&mdash;on the ground that the Minister pleaded no official responsibility.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity I have had, at any rate, of airing the grievance I feel, and which the public seldom or ever get a chance of hearing about, in connection with this matter.  This Bill provides us with an opportunity of examining the activities of this company and the manner in which its activities are being cloaked and hidden by the Minister for Transport and Power.  Not on one occasion but on very many occasions has the Minister defended the actions of this Board.</P>
    <P>What is the attitude of the Board towards the members of this House? As recently as six months ago, it was announced that it was proposed to inflict a still further increase in bus fares upon the people of this city. Quite a representative meeting of members of Dáil Éireann from city and county constituencies was held in this House with the object of inviting the Chairman of CIE to come here to the Parliament of the country to meet us&mdash;not myself or any one Party but a group of members representative of a group of Parties&mdash;and hear our views as to why the people of the city should no longer be mulcted in the manner and fashion which has been pursued for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Do you think that Iron-man Andrews saw fit even to answer us? We did not get even a reply from <Col N="503" /> him.  We got a reply from one of his staff&mdash;the secretary, I think&mdash;but certainly not from the great oracle himself, not from the great man who brings to my mind memories of Bord na Móna, the turf camps and the workers without food or water.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy McQuillan has said in this matter.  This is, if you like, a device whereby we can raise these issues.  It is high time the Government decided to scrap this ill-conceived policy of making this vital industry the plaything of interests which do not seem to have at heart the real welfare of this country.  As I mentioned before, the notion that an amenity which is a social need, such as railways, buses, canals and so on, should be operated purely for the purpose of becoming an economically, viable capitalist venture, is immoral. It is wrong; it is against all modern economic thinking; and it is in complete conflict with the welfare of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I avail of this opportunity once more on behalf of the people I represent, especially, the people living in the suburbs of Ballyfermot, Walkinstown and County Dublin, to denounce the policy of the Board.  This policy which we are trying to change by means of this Bill has resulted in increasing the cost of living very considerably for them.  It has resulted, to my personal knowledge, in hardship for families in the Ballyfermot area particularly.  I am certain, of course, that our appeal and our effort will prove fruitless, but at least with the help of the Fourth Estate, we will have shown that at least some people in this House care about the real needs of the people.</P>

      <P>I am glad this Bill gives me an opportunity of saying something to the Minister because it is impossible to get an answer from him as you, Sir, are well aware.

      <Col N="504" /> I regret that I have had to disallow the Question addressed by you to the Minister for Transport and Power regarding the dismantling of the railway line where a branch railway has been closed . . . .</P>
    <P>It is good to get an opportunity of facing the Minister and asking him questions, but whether he will answer them is another matter.</P>
    <P>I have read the Report of CIE and I say that it is produced in a dishonest way.  On page 5 of that report for the year ended 31st March, 1962, in paragraph 3, we read:</P>
    <P>Road services were substituted for the railway on the West Cork Section as from 1st April, 1961. Operating results during the year showed that the financial betterment from this substitution and from the substitution of road services for the West Clare and Waterford/Tramore railway lines last year was approximately £90,000.  The substitute services have worked efficiently and have met with general approval from the traders in the area.</P>
    <P>The reason I say that is dishonest is that I have here an opus by Dr. C.S. Andrews, Chairman of CIE, an address delivered to the Institute of Public Administration at the Custom House, Dublin, on Wednesday, 27th June, 1962, on &ldquo;The Future of CIE&rdquo;. At page 12, at the end of Paragraph 3 he said:</P>
    <P>. . . I emphasise that substituting a road service for rail does not mean giving a worse service.</P>
    <P>That is No. 1.  He also said that the most expensive monument that was ever erected to a poet was the West Clare railway.  He boxes the Waterford-Tramore railway with the West Clare railway for the purpose of bringing out a dishonest figure.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister a Parliamentary Question today about the Waterford-Tramore service.  He referred me to the reply given by him on 28th February, 1962, to a Question about the number of passengers carried, to which he said he had nothing to add.  I asked him to say what were the latest returns from the CIE Waterford-Tramore service over the past 12 months in passengers carried and in gross revenue taken; and whether the service was showing a profit or a loss.  I am entitled to ask that question and I am entitled to get an answer from the Minister.  I will not have the Minister stand up here and tell me to write to CIE for that information.  I will not write to CIE for it.  It is the Minister's duty to reply here to Deputies.</P>

      <P>Here we are told it is a better service.  I shall speak for my own constituency.  When the Tramore railway service was running, it brought people into and out of Tramore for 1/9 return.  This service of the Minister brings them out for 2/8d. and that is supposed to be a wonderful service.  The women with the big families, the women with the children were not in Tramore last summer, regardless of the weather.  They could not and did not travel on the Minister's buses because the Minister priced them out of it.</P>

    <P>When the Minister and CIE came along with their ultimatum about taking up the Tramore railway, my colleagues and I came into this House and reminded the Minister for Transport and Power that the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, when the CIE Bill was going through the House, gave a solemn undertaking that no railway <Col N="506" /> line would be taken up without full consultation with the people concerned, local authorities, local people or local groups of people.  A deputation led by the Mayor of Waterford representing the Corporation of Waterford and including the chairman of the Waterford County Council and the Deputies from Waterford were invited to Kingsbridge to meet representatives of CIE.  We were informed we were not allowed to discuss the closing or the removal of the old railway line, the railway line which was then in existence and running. This was the fair and open consultation that was promised here by the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Who ran out on whom, I do not know, but I would say the Minister for Transport and Power and Dr. Andrews, the Chairman of CIE, are responsible for what happened.</P>
    <P>We had to adopt many subterfuges. We put down motions; we put down Parliamentary Questions but we were shelved off by the Minister.  However, I remember speaking on an Adjournment Debate with my colleagues and we pointed out to the Minister for Transport and Power and we also pointed out on another occasion to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that if this small railway, seven miles long, was closed down, it would cost the Exchequer, the Waterford County Council and the Waterford Corporation a colossal amount of money to put the road in order for these buses.  We were pooh-poohed by the Minister for Local Government and by the great pooh-pooher himself, the Minister for Transport and Power: there was no such thing.</P>
    <P>Waterford Corporation never received any more than £5,000 out of the Road Fund, out of the Exchequer, from the proceeds of motor taxation. It is no harm to say that we paid out £550,000 over a period of ten years and we got back £40,000.  This year, there is an increase of £22,000 on that allocation and that is to take down Sheepsbridge on the Tramore railway. The first figure we were told Tramore railway was losing was £3,000 a year. Then there was some elastic accountancy brought into operation and we <Col N="507" /> were told it was £9,000.  I am still convinced that none of those figures was right.  If CIE were doing their business in a proper manner and in a manner which was open and aboveboard and if they had not been prejudiced in wanting to close down the railways, that small railway line could be made to pay because there were no stationhouses on it.  However, two Ministers of State said there would be no such thing and now there is this colossal amount of money being spent outside Waterford city within the borough boundary and the county council will have to pay for it; they will be next when operations extend to the Metal Bridge.</P>
    <P>The only time I saw real efficiency in CIE was at the time of the destruction of the Tramore railway. The order to close it came into operation at 2 o'clock on a Saturday and in the teeming rain, in the most malicious, vindictive and devilish manner, men were paid extra money to pound down this Metal Bridge and make sure this railway line was broken up so that there could be no agitation by local people, by the Waterford County Council, the Waterford City Council or by the Fianna Fáil cumann.  They tore it up and would have shipped the rails to Czechoslovakia, were it not for the fact that we protested very strongly in this House that these rails be sold by tender, because they had been giving them away without tenders before that, and an Irish firm was able to tender and get these rails.</P>
    <P>That is the sorry story of CIE, with the result I have already mentioned, that we have the Chairman of CIE in a fenced-in place, the right place for him to go, the Institute of Public Administration at the Custom House, Dublin &mdash; I would nearly say he had to make this under guard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not going to cover up the position regarding the boxing together of the Tramore-Waterford railway and the West Cork and West Clare lines and that he will separate them for us.  I want to remind the Minister that he has an appointment with me later on in regard to my Parliamentary Question. It was said here by the Minister and by the Minister for Local Government, when it was pointed out that all was not well when we were tearing up these railway lines and doing away with them, that it was all right for the people who must not be spoken about in CIE to make the decision, or for the Minister to make the decision, and tear up the railway lines, but we claim, and many Deputies claimed, that we would have to pay through the nose again for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a famous occasion when we were pooh-poohed by two Ministers in connection with a line about which you know something, Sir, in Donegal, a line which was taken up.  For the benefit of the House, might I say that for the past two years, the Exchequer has paid, and for the next three years it will pay, £75,000 each year.  That is fantastic&mdash;a total of £375,000 paid by this Dáil for the roads in Donegal.  Of course the people whose names we are not to mention will be able to say: &ldquo;All is well; we will be able to make this pay; we are reducing the deficit.&rdquo; That is what is happening.  Deputies <Col N="511" /> in the Opposition were told it would not happen.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was mentioned by Deputy Dunne is the way the roads are being pounded to pieces by these monsters which are supposed to carry 20 tons but actually carry 40 tons or 45 tons.  The Minister himself is the greatest culprit.  We are now sending out loads of petrol and oil on the roads.  On one of the rare occasions on which I go to the cinema, I saw recently in a Pathe Gazette film a tremendous fire caused by one of these containers which exploded.  It blew a whole factory to pieces as well as half the council houses in the area.</P>
    <P>Many people were injured.  Yet we allow such containers to go through our streets in hundreds and on CIE lorries.  These monsters are ploughing up the roads and they are not paying the amount of road tax they should be paying for the damage they are doing to country roads.  I saw a very good job done on what we call a secondary road, a job which would have lasted for many years with tractors and ordinary traffic, cars and lorries, passing over it, but a couple of these monsters so damaged the road that it was practically ruined.</P>
    <P>The policy of CIE seems to be to go on to the roads all the time but the difference is that the railways maintained their permanent way, their own stationhouses, and their own offices. Now they come to the Waterford Harbour Commissioners to ask that a piece of the quay be given to them free of charge for a bus stop.  That is the kind of thing CIE are trying to do.  We have these fine railway lines and if there were consultations between the Minister and the people whose names we are not allowed to mention, and people in industry in general, and a great deal of heavy traffic on the roads diverted to the railways, there would not be such &ldquo;ochoning&rdquo; in Kingsbridge.</P>
    <P>There are many things I could say about the people whose names we are not allowed to mention.  There is a certain amount of disquiet about the manner in which CIE do their business, especially when it comes to the big money.  Recently, tenders for <Col N="512" /> locomotives were sought but it has been stated that the tender accepted was not the lowest and that the difference between the price of the locomotives bought by CIE and the price of the locomotives in the lowest tender was nearly £6,000.</P>

      <P>I was about to conclude when the debate was interrupted by Private Members' Time.  I was telling the Minister of an unusual case that had come to my notice in my constituency a short time before and details of which I have already submitted to the Minister for his examination.  Not having had a reply to my letter up to now, I was hoping that the Minister might enlighten me as to whether it is a fact, as alleged, that Irish nationals paying social welfare contributions in this State and employed on British ships are not entitled to workmen's compensation if injured in the course of their employment and are not entitled to disablement benefit either. If that is so, something should be done about it.  I am not sure it is so, but that is what has been alleged to me by at least three persons employed on British ships trading into this country. I have submitted one case in particular to the Minister and he will have details of it in his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> There is just one other complaint I should like to make in connection with the administration of social welfare services.  I refer to the long delay which occurs in the case of old age pension appeals.  I usually keep a record of any case I submit in writing giving details in support of an appeal in an old age pensions case.  Very often it is six to eight months before a reply is issued or a decision made. You would completely forget the case, were it not for the fact that the people concerned continually pester you, asking if any decision has been come to. Many of these cases have been admitted after that long delay and back payments have been made. Something should be done to reduce that period of waiting.  Very often genuine cases, who have been later upheld, have had to exist on home assistance or some other charity for six to eight months during which they were legitimately entitled to the old age pension.  I feel sure there will be no misunderstanding of that criticism. The delay is probably due to the appeals officers being flooded out with cases and possibly there is a need to appoint further officers to reduce the amount of work.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by paying a tribute to all the social welfare officers I have come in contact with, personally, over the telephone or in correspondence.  At all stages I have received co-operation and explanation, so far as lay within the power of the officers to give them.  I should like to express my appreciation of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister a few aspects of social welfare.  First, I should like to deal with old age pensions. When a person signs over a farm or his means, he can do so only to a married son or daughter.  In all other cases, the Department think very badly about granting the pension.  I know of a case where a man signed over his place to a niece, and that was not accepted.  The same can apply in the case of an adopted niece.  This is particularly hard when a man or woman reaches the age of 70 years and is unable to look after himself or herself.  In such cases, a girl might be <Col N="514" /> the best person to look after the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister's experts should look into this matter and consideration should be shown for these old people. They should be allowed to sign over the place to anybody looking after them.  I know of one case where a gentleman signed over his place to a second cousin.  This man was married and had a large family.  When the case came up before the appeals officer, it was turned down.  Yet this man had done everything possible.  There may have been other nearer relations, but he preferred this cousin to come and live with him and the cousin has been living with him for quite a while. It is unfair that he should be victimised and should not get the pension. If you are giving away anything, you like to give it to the person to whom you want to give it; and the Minister should allow these old people do the same.</P>
      <P>The qualifying age of 70 years for the pension is rather high in some cases.  The pension is given at 65 in Great Britain and in other European countries at 68.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>To alter that situation would require legislation and it is not in order to advocate legislation on an Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  At present if a person is 65 years of age, he can apply for unemployment assistance for the next five years and get 32/6d.  If work comes, he must take it. If anything could be done to leave the situation so that he could get an old age pension in that case, it would be welcome.</P>
      <P>The marriage gratuity is extremely good but at present one must have 156 stamps to qualify.  Many girls getting married do not have that number, which represents three full years' employment, and if they could get portion of the marriage gratuity, even though they do not have their full number of stamps, it would be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important matter is the income level at which one may be insured.  At present it is £800, but I hope the Minister <Col N="515" /> is keeping an eye on the consumer price index, as it is used to judge incomes, because the Minister will find, if he consults with his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, that Minister in August last raised the income level from £800 to £1,000 for qualification for housing grants.  Many would like that level to be applied to Social Welfare also.  The last round of wage increases was, I suppose, one of the highest ever given and, as a result, many people went over the £80C limit. It can rightly be said that this wage increase was brought about by the increased cost of everything one has to buy, so that although the money value of the income has gone up, in fact the buying value has not gone up or only by very little.  I appeal to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to raise the level from £800 to £1,000, but if he cannot go so far, I should be quite pleased with £900.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of the length it takes an appeal to go through the Minister's Department, we usually find it takes three to four months, which seems rather long.  Even though payments are made back to the appropriate date, it is hard on old people who do not know what they are going to get, to have to wait.  They would like a decision to be reached in a month or six weeks.  Could anything be done to hurry up such appeals?  I know there must be a great many of them but perhaps extra staff could be assigned to the job so that decisions could be reached fairly quickly.  People are disappointed at having to wait so long and they naturally come to Deputies like myself for information.  It is rather embarrassing <Col N="516" /> to have to say that a decision has not been reached, that it takes rather a long time.  It is hard for them to understand that.  I trust the Minister will bear in mind the points I have made and see if something can be done to improve matters in each case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words regarding old age pensioners. In common, I am sure, with every other Deputy, I feel a moral obligation to consider their plight.  I often think, and I am sure it must occur to many others, that there is something seriously amiss with our standards as a Parliament, if not indeed with our standards as a people. During the year, we had the experience of seeing proposals pushed through the House for very substantial increases for gentlemen in very high offices. Arguments were made to justify these increases which, whatever their application, whatever merit they may have, when you put them in contradistinction to events which occurred at the same time in relation to old age pensioners, are bound to give the public, and certainly me as a member of the public, reason to wonder if membership of the House puts us into some sort of rarefied mental condition that we lose touch with reality.</P>
      <P>It would appear so because certainly we have not done anything like justice to the old age pensioners.  I am particularly concerned with the old age pensioners receiving non-contributory pensions, most of whom live in cities, very often struggling in single tenement rooms, very often not wanted by their relatives, or in small towns similarly situated.  I am not going to expand on that vast mass of old age pensioners who are in fact farmers owning land and who qualify for the pension by the device of visiting the local solicitor and making a will or settlement of their land.  I have feelings on that also but I am not going to say anything about it because I suppose people have little enough without trying to deprive them of what they already have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider seriously in the near future doing something substantial for the old age <Col N="517" /> pensioners.  The half-crown given this year, I am sure he must admit in his heart of hearts, was a very poor effort.  I have no doubt that the Minister is as concerned as I am about this problem.  With my own experience of supporting Governments, I am sufficiently familiar with the mechanics of Cabinet administration to know that a Minister does not always get what he wants in relation to proposals he makes for the improvement of particular classes with whom he is concerned but I want him to attack this problem in future with fanatical zeal because in no other fashion can any substantial result be achieved.  The entire history of this State has proved that it is only when a Minister or the individual having responsibility is charged with an overwhelming desire to do a particular job that the job is done effectively and well.  Our recent history shows that, at one time in the case of housing, at another time in regard to health.  I would ask the Minister to adopt a similar attitude towards this question.</P>
    <P>I say there is something wrong with our standards.  At 70 years of age, a person becomes entitled to an old age pension of 30/- a week.  On average, his life expectancy would not be much more than five years.  We will say that, with good luck, he may draw a pension for ten years.  At the end of that period, he will have drawn £700 in old age pension, having, very probably, given from 50 to 60 years' service of one kind or another, often of the most laborious, and occasionally degrading, type to the community.</P>
    <P>I say there is something wrong with our standards because in Volume 191, No. 6 of the Official Debates for Thursday, 13th July, 1961, there is evidence of the amount received in pension by a former member of this House whose stay was not unduly long and was marked by one event more than any other, that is a reduction in the old age pension of 1/- a week.  I do not need to mention any names but I notice that he had received up to last year over £11,000 in pension for that short tenure of office, for so significant a contribution to the welfare of our community.</P>

      <P>If I may resume, may I say that I do not intend to press that point?  I agree with Deputy Corish, but we can cover the matter very easily by talking about this Estimate and the inadequacy of what is being done under it and that, surely, is relevant. It is inadequate.  Old age pensioners are the one really depressed class in <Col N="519" /> our society today.  It is purely in an effort to urge the Minister to do something really worth while on behalf of these people, when he gets the opportunity in future, much more than he has done in the past, that I rise at all. I have mentioned the case of one person, whom I do not know, whom I merely read about as an historical figure of a kind, to show how cockeyed our standards are; when we are dealing with people whom we regard as being in high office, how we recompense them; and the manner in which we treat the people who really matter, the people who do the hard work that keeps this country going and that produces the wealth to make it possible for us to have all that we have here, including the báinín curtain.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that I have found the Minister and his Department in my experience over the past 12 months, to be very helpful and very co-operative in any matter which I had occasion to raise with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to dwell on the question of the adequacy or inadequacy of the Minister's Estimate.  The cost of living has increased, as is evidenced by the action of the Department of Social Welfare at various stages in providing the very modest additions to the amount of payments.  I want to emphasise on this occasion something I have said previously and in connection with which I hope for action by the Minister.  I refer to the manner in which departmental regulations are operated to deprive persons of a pension or allowance to which they believe they are entitled.  There is a means test.  There is no doubt about the courtesy of the officials operating the means test.  I have been in touch with them in dealing with cases. Invariably, one finds oneself up against some regulation which prevents the applicant from getting the pension or allowance.  The mere fact that over the years increases have been given by the House in social welfare payments is sufficient proof of the case for alleviation of the means test. I have had practical experience of dealing with cases and I find it very <Col N="520" /> difficult to understand how it is that while, on the one hand, increases are held to be necessary to meet increased living costs, on the other hand, regulations are made under which the merits of an application are measured by a different standard.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to the belief that the Department is a Department for the administration of social welfare rather than a Department of Social Welfare. A Department of Social Welfare should present the case for those who need social welfare and should be prepared to argue that case with the Department of Finance and be able to secure the benefits to which social welfare recipients are entitled.</P>
      <P>In the past few months, the Taoiseach has informed the House and the country of the desire on the part of the Government to get owners of land to surrender these lands to their families and that it would be made easier for them to obtain old age pensions.  The House is aware, but I do not know that the country is so well aware, that once the poor law valuation of his holding is over £30, the person seeking an old age pension will find himself being quizzed as to his reason for surrendering his property.  That is one of the factors in Irish life impeding the transfer of property from elderly people to younger people.  I suggest to the Minister that that is one of the regulations he should consider most seriously in his Department.</P>
      <P>The level of family income used as a yardstick to decide whether or not an applicant should get a pension also needs readjustment upwards, in the light of present day conditions.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether it is not a fact that at the present time the labour, keep and clothing of an adult man or woman working on a family holding is valued at something like £175 per year.  If that is the standard, then we certainly are not doing much to encourage people to give up the reins and hand them over to someone else.  We are certainly not giving to these people the reward to which I believe they are entitled after their life's work on such holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind some cases of the type to which I refer.  I am aware that <Col N="521" /> there is an attitude in the country that, because of these types of cases, applicants are not perhaps as truthful as they should be with regard to their means when they are questioned by officials.  I neither deny nor condone that.  Life savings accumulated against death in order to meet funeral expenses should not be taken into account against an applicant for an old age pension.  I know that an applicant has a right to have upwards of £700.  A man and his wife may each have £700.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact, however, that if the applicant does not state, in the first instance, that he has got these savings, that is held against him afterwards, as if he intentionally did not disclose his means.  This investigation of means is one of the least likeable features of these regulations. It imposes on an official an inquiry into the means of a private individual and his family history.  I have in mind a particular case where a wife did not know of the existence of a small sum in the bank.  She was penalised for her ignorance afterwards.  That type of regulation certainly needs amendment. These regulations should be reviewed and amended as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Again, an applicant may have a property valued in excess of £30.  He may be willing to pass the property over when he comes to 70 years of age.  He is immediately confronted with the fact that, if he does rid himself of the property, he is classed as having got rid of it in order to qualify for an old age pension.  That is something that needs clarification.  I said on a previous occasion here that we ought not to hide these regulations. They should be publicised and people should be made aware of the qualifications which will deprive them of their right to a pension.  When these people reach the end of their working lives and are passing on the means by which they earned their livelihoods, and becoming partially dependent on the social welfare system of the State, they should not be made to feel that they are being harshly treated in the evening of their lives.  Some get; others do not.  The regulations under <Col N="522" /> which these awards are made should be publicised so that these people may know what the position is.  Very often in these cases, there are appeals.  The departmental records will show many appeals against the decisions of local officers, but the local officers are merely implementing the regulations laid down for them.</P>
    <P>I believe all this springs from the fact that the Minister and his Department are working within an Estimate, keeping strictly within an Estimate, and the regulations are framed in favour of the Department of Finance rather than in favour of the recipients of social welfare.  The best proof of that is the fact that over the years the Department has been able to surrender substantial sums at the end of the year. In 1958-1959, there was a surrender of nearly £43,000 on old age pensions. In 1959-1960, the surrender had grown to £68,900-odd.  In 1960-1961, it had grown to £228,769.  I believe the Department should operate in favour of the people it is designed to help. During the year, a particular case was brought to my attention.  A widow, a non-national, applied for assistance here.  The children were the children of an Irish national.  There was a long delay in dealing with her case, despite the fact that a foreign Government was assisting that widow in this country.</P>
    <P>I have always felt very strongly in this matter.  The operation of the means test leads to a sense of grievance particularly in the case of old people.  The grievance of old persons is all the more bitter because, looking back at life's close on their efforts and their struggles over the years, they are inclined to feel much more acutely the harshness of what appear to them to be adverse decisions.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to look into these regulations and see whether it is not time to up-grade the standards on which this means test is operated.  If the volume of the money has been increased, while its buying power has not gone up, as has been admitted here tonight&mdash;I admit it has been done to step up the amounts to these recipients&mdash;it is the best argument why the standard we apply to the means test also needs a <Col N="523" /> radical upward revision.  If that were done, I believe that the anomalies which exist at present and the grievances under which people labour&mdash; some of these may be imaginary grievances&mdash;may be eliminated.  At least, people would understand that there are certain sets of regulations and that we cannot afford the type of social welfare for all and that there has to be a means test.  People would then feel that they had not been deprived of something which their neighbours had got and to which they think they are equally entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it could be regarded as repetitive to state again this year what I think most Deputies who spoke on this Estimate say in respect of the general administration of the Department of Social Welfare.  I refer to the compliment that is paid, and deservedly so, to the Secretary, the various other officers and those who work beneath them or the Minister in the Department.  These tributes have been paid again this year and, as I say, they are well deserved because, whilst we may appear to be angry with the Minister and his officials from time to time, I think that all Deputies in any case have reason to be grateful for their co-operation and their help when they are written to, spoken to or phoned in regard to matters which are controlled by what one could describe as a complex code of legislation, that is, the social welfare code under which we work.  The help given to public representatives by the Department is typical of the co-operation we expect from the Irish Civil Service generally.</P>
      <P>Sometimes we forget to appreciate that they are merely carrying out regulations, the orders of this House, so to speak, and merely administering the law enacted by this House, whether or not individuals in the House were in favour of a particular piece of legislation.  Therefore, whilst paying tribute to the officers and the Minister for their courtesy in any dealings we may have had with them, I do not think it would be amiss to make some criticisms as a whole on the general policy of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> Theoretically, we should not advocate new legislation on this Estimate but I think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the House will appreciate it is very difficult to talk at all on an Estimate such as this without appearing in any case to advocate new legislation.  Therefore, I want to commence by saying that we are dissatisfied with the amount provided by these three Estimates for Social Welfare generally.  It is not today or yesterday that we expressed this dissatisfaction. Any remarks I may make tonight are directed not so much against the Minister for Social Welfare as to the Government to induce them to decide in the near future, at least in the next Budget, that much more money will be devoted to social welfare.  All of us agree that more should be devoted to social welfare and that much more could be devoted to social welfare.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it would not be any harm to pay a tribute to the ordinary rank and file members of the Fianna Fáil Party who, I believe, induced the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare at their last Ard-Fheis to provide for many of the increases that were included in this year's Budget.  Therefore, it is not out of place for any of us on these benches to press the Government, through the Minister for Social Welfare, to do much more, at least in the Budget of 1963.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is not necessary at this stage to talk about the increase in the cost of living or the change in money values.  Deputy Crinion has done that pretty well in the speech he delivered tonight.  He recognises the need for an increase in the amount of money to be devoted to social welfare.  So do we, and I am sure the Minister does as well.  We merely want to strengthen his hand when he presents his Estimate to the Government next month, the following month or the month of January, seeking a greatly increased figure for social welfare services.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on these figures at any length but I think they are worth repeating.  It is demonstrated from the figures the Government have produced that less and less has been spent on social welfare since the year <Col N="525" /> 1957 and the year 1958.  It is true that it is not necessary to spend more in certain directions.  It is true to say, for instance, that less is needed for unemployment assistance and less is needed for unemployment benefit by reason of the fact that there are fewer registered unemployed who might be eligible for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>I will spare the House explaining how the unemployment figures seem to go down so much and content myself with saying that the Exchequer and the funds of the Department of Social Welfare were saved quite a lot by reason of the emigration we had over that particular period.  We were always led to believe by a former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Kennedy, and, certainly from the Minister for Health, when he was Minister for Social Welfare, that the Government, and they, would gladly give the money to increase substantially old age pensions, unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit, if the money were there and if the money were obtained from the public.</P>
    <P>The money has been got from the public.  There has been a tremendous increase in the money extracted by the Exchequer from the public and called tax revenue.  It is estimated to have increased as between 1957-58 and 1962-63 to £136 million.  That means that tax revenue has increased by £32 million.  The public are now paying more in taxes&mdash;a sum of £32 million.  I do not advocate, nor did I advocate over those years, that all this money should have been devoted to the old age pensioners, the sick person and the unemployed person. But, frankly, I do not believe, and the Labour Party do not believe, that a fair proportion of that increase of £32 million has been devoted to people who really needed some increase.</P>
    <P>Of the £32 million, only an approximate £2 million was devoted to social welfare, devoted to giving an increase to old age pensioners, widows and orphans, unemployed people, sick people, children's allowances and others embraced by the social welfare code.  Therefore, we believe that next <Col N="526" /> year, in the next Budget&mdash;naturally, we would welcome it before that&mdash; the Minister or the Government should decide, in view of the increase in tax revenue, to give something substantial to, say, a person who is now dependent on 24/- per week unemployment assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely demonstrating why much more money needs to be given to the Minister for Social Welfare to alleviate the distress that undoubtedly exists among certain sections of the community.  Take the man who is unemployed and who is not eligible for unemployment benefit.  A single man in an urban area gets 24/- per week.  Some Deputies may say that this fellow is probably living in a household where the father, the brothers, or the sisters are working. I concede that there are such cases and I concede also that such a person may regard that 24/- per week as pocket money.  However, there are those in receipt of unemployment assistance who live on their own, who live, maybe, with another person who is on unemployment assistance or who is in receipt of sickness benefit or who may live with parents who are in receipt of old age pensions.  Such people are in a pretty bad way.  They are not in a position to clothe and feed themselves as persons should normally be expected to clothe and feed themselves in this country.</P>
      <P>We voted against the General Resolution in connection with the Budget in order to express our dissatisfaction with the amount being devoted to social welfare.  Of course, the cry from some of the members on the opposite side of the House was, in effect: &ldquo;You want the money but you will not vote for the means to increase it.&rdquo;  We considered the increase too small.  We were disgusted at the way these people were being treated in the light of the fact that so much money was available to the Exchequer.  I do not want to flog that aspect of these Estimates.  I just want to say that we expect that next year much more money will be devoted to the people for whom I have been speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> I am at one with Deputy Jones about the over-zealousness of some of the investigating staff of the Department. I appreciate that they are doing their jobs according to the letter of the law but they can be over-zealour.  Let me give two examples of cases where I believe they are going just too fat. It seems to me that some of these officers are so zealous that they should be in the employment of the Revenue Commissioners rathere than in that of the Department of Social Welfare. They are so good at their job that if they were sent after certain people.  I believe they would succeed in getting millions of pounds by way of income tax and in that way the tax revenue would become very much greater than it is.</P>
    <P>When speaking of fraud in respect of a State service in this country, one point must come to midn.  In nine cases out of ten, one hears of fraud by the poor man.  Cases in the district and other courts of fraud perpetrated by the Unfortunate unemployed man are always publicised; of fraud alleged to have been perpertrated by the old age pensioner who did not disclose some means; of fraud alleged to have been perpetrated by the rural worker who, it si alleged, was signing for employment assistance while at the same time he was working.  Some mercy should be shown. Let me give one example.</P>
    <P>There is an old lady of 91 years of age in my constituency.  Last week, she received a bill from the Minister for Social Welfare demanding £9 in respect of the overdrawing of pension by her late husband and £68 for an alleged overdrawing of pension byu herself.  If that unfortunate woman of 91 years of age did anything wrong, she did not do it in any criminal sense; she did not do it maliciously; she did not do it fraudulently.  she did not disclose &mdash; because she did not think she should disclose it &mdash; that he husband had been working intermittently over a number of years.  She herself had been a cleaner, I think, for an hour or two per week in the local church, for which she got 5/- She did not disclose that, I think.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> At 91 years of age, the thanks she gets from the State is a demand that she pay a sum of £9 in respect of her late husband's pension and a sum of £68 in respect of her own.  The law may be administered to the letter, but what sort of feeling must that unfortunate woman have towards the State when, at 91 years of age, she is asked to pay back a sum of £77 and she is blandly asked to tell the Department as quickly as possible what arrangements she will make to pay back the £77?  I do not say this in any personal sense but what does the Minister expect her to do now?  Should this lady attempt to borrow the £77 from the bank?  Should she attempt to get all her neighbours to sign a bill in the bank to enable her to borrow the £77 to pay it back to the Department of Social Welfare?</P>
    <P>We hear only of fraud in respect of the Department of Social Welfare and in respect of poor people.  Every year, hundreds of thousands of pounds are given out in grants by, for instance, the Department of Local Government.  We never hear of a fraud in respect of a grant.  I have not heard of frauds in respect of reconstruction or building grants.  It is inconceivable that some frauds in that connection have not taken place in the 26 Counties.</P>
    <P>We never hear of the Minister for Local Government asking for a refund in respect of a grant that was wrongly given or that was fraudulently accepted on foot of false information. Many grants are given by the Department of Agriculture, by the Department of Industry and Commerce, by this Department or by that Department. We never heard of cases, not do we ever hear of court cases, where people are alleged to have got grants wrongly and where there is a demand to hand them back.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, through wrong judgement or may be because of false evidence in their applications, indsutrialist&mdash;not so much in this country but from Germany, Holland, Switzerland, America, Britain and so on&mdash; give such phoney information to the Department of Industry and Commerce or some of their agencies that they succeed in getting hundreds of <Col N="529" /> thousands of pounds by way of grants. After about three months, they fold up because they have given wrong information to these Departmental officials who took them at their word. When it is found out that they have given fraudulent or misleading information, there is never any demand to get back any of the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit the Minister has not the slightest responsibility for it.  I have admitted already that even in the case I cited, legally the investigating officer was right; the secretary was right in making the demand; legally the Minister was right.  All I am trying to bring about is that there be an element of mercy and compassion in the justice the Minister feels he has to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give another example of a blind person who, it is alleged, got a pretences, by not think there was any criminal intent on her part &mdash; it was through pure ignorance that she failed to report there was a change in her circumstances.  Again, this blind woman has been asked to say what arrangements she can make to repay £268 to the Minister.  It may be suggested&mdash;and I suppose it is the only suggestion which can be made&mdash;that if she is now entitled to a pension, she could make arrangement to have deducted from her pension 2s, 6d, 5s, or 10s. per week, but it will leave her in a bad way.   It will also leave in a bad way the unfortunate woman of 91 years of age whom I mentioned earlier who is living on her own and who has been asked to pay back the <Col N="530" /> sum of £77.  Of couse, the officials cannot be expected to know the personal circumstances of these people and must apply the law, but where such cases arise, there should be some element of mercy and compassion rathere than strict application of the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the delays which occur in making decisions.  When I say delay, I am not for one moment saying that all delays are not justified.  I know that certain procedure has to be applied and that inevitably delays occur.  A case came to my notice revently involving the insurability of a particular worker.  As a consequence of the dealy in making a decision in the Department, this man's claim for unemployemtn or sickness benefit&mdash;I forget which&mdash;was held up for a period of six or nine months.  Surely a decision could have been made more quickly?  I am not making the allegation in a general sense, but I do say an effort should be made to speed up decisions in respect of insurability, the means test and so forth.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister do something to help insured persons, especially those who have occasion to apply for the benefits available under the social welfare code?  Many people who come to me for assistance on social welfare matters breathe fire when speaking about the Department of Social Welfare in cases where there appear to be delays in payment of sickness benefits, particularly where there appear to be underpayments of disability benefits. In nine cases out of ten, I must confess these delays occur through the furnishing of wrong information by the applicants&mdash;a wrong number may be given or the applicant may have failed to include the towns in the address. There are cases of married men who omit to furnish the necessary information in the part of the form which asks him to describe his state or whether or not he has children.  I get many cases where a number of them fill in the forms as if they were single men, ignoring the fact that they have wives and children and that there are allowances in respect of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should appreciate that many of these people do not feel competent <Col N="531" /> to fill in these forms, simple though they may appear to us.  I suppose every Deputy has, over the years, filled in scores of applications, particularly in respect of old age and widows' and orphans' pensions.  In the forms through which application is made for disability allowances, it must be stated whether or not it is workmen's compensation or disability allowance that is being sought.  Some assistance should be given to such applicants rather than have them coming to their local representatives.  In fact, many of them do not bother going to their local representatives.</P>
    <P>There should be somebody in the Department's local offices or in the Garda stations, as the case may be, who would be prepared to advise and assist them in the filling out of what may appear to many applicants to be complicated forms.  In places where there are still insurance agents, they assist applicants for disability benefits and other things, but I do not know whether such facilities are available in the employment exchanges or in branch offices.  Both the Department and applicants would be saved a lot of trouble, a lot of work and annoyance, if there were some system whereby applicants could be assisted to fill in these complicated forms.</P>

      <P>Before I forget it, I should like to express agreement with Deputy Corish on the question of the forms which some poor people, often uneducated, have to fill in.  I do not claim to be very educated myself but I am a man of experience and I must say even I have to get down to it as if it were a legal document.  All these forms should be simplified.  The people who draft them should be prepared to stoop to the level of the most ignorant person who may have to apply for benefits under this code instead of making it like a doctor's prescription.  I am often puzzled myself by many of these forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish made the point that his Party did not object to the legislation necessary to provide the money to pay the increased pensions under <Col N="532" /> the social welfare scheme.  He pointed out that their objection was to the amount.  I am willing to accept that on the part of Deputy Corish, but I am not prepared to accept it in respect of all the others who voted against that legislation.  I am no fool; neither are many others in the House.  It is an unpopular thing to vote for higher expenditure.  There are thousands of smokers and drinkers in proportion to each single old age pensioner and I am pretty sure the Deputies who objected to those proposals had in mind all the enemies they would make among those thousands.  I am pretty sure a number of those Deputies said that if they voted for this legislation, they would get it later on in their local pubs.  As I said earlier, I am prepared to accept what Deputy Corish said in this respect because he is an honest-to-goodness, straight fellow, but I am not prepared to accept it in respect of others.</P>
    <P>Many of the Deputies I have mentioned were only too conscious of the fact that if they voted for that £1 million extra for social welfare benefits, they would have to answer a lot of awkward questions locally.  I voted for the legislation and I had to answer for it.  I had to explain that the money had to be got.  Then these ignorant people asked why we did not get it in some other way.  It is a difficult thing, a most unpopular thing, to vote for increased expenditure and if the Opposition want it believed that they are honest about this, it would be a very good thing if they intimated each year to the Minister that if he is bringing in legislation to increase such expenditure as this, they will or will not vote for it.  I feel sure the Minister will be only too pleased to be made aware in advance that no matter what he does, when it comes to the provision of the money, he will be opposed.  He can then say: &ldquo;I, like any other member of the House, have my Party to think about.  I cannot give too much because it will mean coming to the House to pass the necessary legislation. I cannot put my Party in the fire either. I have to go slowly.&rdquo;  Let us be honest about it.  If people want the Minister to give more for social benefits, I will vote for them.</P>

      <P>The question of refusing pensions to people who have a little money saved up was referred to by other Deputies.  I think that is rather unwise. I could understand it in the case of a person who had a fortune saved up, but the average person can save only a certain amount in his lifetime, and then only by depriving himself of other things.  A man who does not smoke, drink or back horses can save some money&mdash;not a fortune but a small sum &mdash;for the rainy day, and why should he suffer on that account I do not know, when the man who &ldquo;beers&rdquo; his money and is &ldquo;in the red&rdquo; is all right for his pension.  I think that income only should be considered, unless the amount saved is very large.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point with the Minister which I have several times raised by way of Question during the year.  It is something which I do not think requires legislation and, therefore, can be dealt with very easily.  It is the question of the <Col N="535" /> average number of stamps required to qualify for a contributory old age pension.  When the Act dealing with contributory old age pensions was brought into operation, an average number of stamps, minimum and maximum, was laid down.  Nowhere in that Act could I find any reference to the fact that they must be put on within a certain number of years before the person reached the age of 70, and yet the regulation, as administered by the Minister, lays down that they must be put on between the ages of 55 and 70 or 60 and 70 years, whichever is the more advantageous to the insured person.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister, when introducing that regulation, felt that he was doing a good turn for a big number of people who might not possibly have the average number of stamps for the whole period, but nevertheless, by doing so, he prevented people who had stamped cards for 30 or 40 years, and who, because of their thrift, had succeeded in saving enough money by the time they had reached 60 years of age to start a small business or buy a small piece of land, and ceased to be insurably employed, from getting the benefit of the contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>Many of those people were over-ambitious and sank whatever money they had collected in some enterprise, and in a short time, found they were killing themselves and getting very little in return.  When they reached 70 years of age, they had no money.  They also had no stamps, and they are now dependent on the non-contributory old age pension, when, in fact, their stamps should have qualified them for a contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather paradoxical that if a person has only ten years' stamps from the age of 60 to 70 years and if he had one stamp on before he reached the age of 60, he can qualify for a contributory old age pension, but if he started to work at 20 years of age and worked until he was 60 years and had 40 years' stamps but was not in insurable employment between the ages of 60 and 70 years, according to the regulation as administered by the <Col N="536" /> Minister, he is not entitled to a contributory old age pension.  I would ask the Minister, as it would not require legislation because it is simply a regulation laid down by him, to reconsider this matter because it is causing very great hardship to a number of decent people.</P>
    <P>In regard to the non-contributory pensions, I agree that there has to be some type of means test because otherwise people with very high incomes would unashamedly apply for something for nothing.  We all know that, but still I feel, with a number of Deputies who have already spoken that the officials who investigate these cases go far too deeply into this matter.</P>
    <P>I know a particular case of an old man who was in the position I have described.  He started a little business when he was 55 years of age.  He ceased to be insurably employed and by the time he was 70 years, he had nothing.  He tried to making a living working here and there.  He was a good judge of stock and he was employed at fairs to buy a few head of cattle or sheep for someone, or to sell them.  For that he got the odd few pounds.  When he had the money, he occasionally took on the 11 months' system a small acreage of land, usually a field of six acres.  If he could raise the price to stock it, he usually did so.</P>
    <P>When this man applied for a non-contributory pension, his application for a contributory pension having been refused, I was amazed to find that the social welfare officials who interviewed him and examined his case produced evidence at the sub-committee to prove that on those six acres of land, this old man who was almost 75 years of age was making an income of £1,000 a year.  If he could do that, he should be lecturing in some university, or he should be here in the Dáil telling the farmers how to make more money.  Out of six rented acres, according to the social welfare officer, his income was £1,000 a year. Of course, it was subsequently found that what the social welfare officer had done was to go from saleyard to saleyard and assess the number of <Col N="537" /> cattle and sheep he had bought and the number of cattle and sheep he had sold and arrive at the conclusion that his income should be £1,000 per year.</P>
    <P>That is the type of thing the Department of Social Welfare should seek to cut out.  That official thought he was doing what he was supposed to be doing.  I believe he was one of these people who was conscientious about his job, but it was quite evident to everybody, even to himself, when the matter was brought to law, that he had made a bad mistake.  I suggest the Minister might discreetly pass the information along to his investigating officers that their job is not to go outside the usual investigating channels for the purpose of doing everything to deprive some poor person who has got nothing to eat from getting whatever few shillings he will get by way of non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>The question of the long delay in appeals has been mentioned.  I do not know what causes it.  I am sure the officials are as anxious as we are to see the appeals dealt with quickly, but it is a fact that very long delays occur particularly in old age pension appeals.  I was notified of a case less than a week ago in connection with a contributory old age pension where a person has been awaiting a decision for almost 12 months.  Surely it should have been possible to give a decision in a shorter time than that?</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to unemployment benefit appeals.  I have an instance of a man who was disallowed unemployment benefit because the work he was doing was cutting hedges and some Department welfare officer got the impression that the amount of hedge which had been cut did not represent the number of weeks which was supposed to have been spent on it and he said a number of stamps, two, to be exact, were fraudulently put on the card.  As a result, the man was disqualified.  He appealed, but since May, he has been attempting to get a decision and, since May, has an income of nothing.  I met him yesterday in Navan and he told me he had been hungry; he had reached the stage where nobody would give him <Col N="538" /> credit; he could not borrow money, and so he has nothing.  It is not good enough to be told the case is coming up for appeal shortly.  After all, we are dealing with human beings, not with animals, and that is not the right way to deal with these matters.  The Department should endeavour to have these matters dealt with more quickly. There may be some reason why these matters are held up but it would need to be a very good reason to justify such delay in the case of an unfortunate man depending on such assistance.</P>
    <P>The same thing occurs in regard to unemployment assistance.  Somebody applies for a qualification certificate. The investigation into the qualification certificate may take a considerable number of weeks&mdash;usually, not months in this case&mdash;but when the qualification certificate is eventually issued it applies not from the date of the application but from the date on which the decision was made, which means in some cases a married man with a family is left without any income over a period.  That is not right; possibly there is some regulation which covers that.  If there is, it should be changed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is also the vexed question of the three days' waiting period.  I know that when moving from one benefit to another, say, from benefit to assistance, that no longer exists, but it is a hardship on the man who is unemployed and who has to wait for three days.  That matter may require legislation and I shall not press the point.</P>
    <P>Another type of case is that of the person who is ill and the investigation officer comes as a result of a complaint, possibly from a neighbour, that the person has been working; it may in fact be one of those poisonous cases we find from time to time.  The next thing we find is that that person is deprived of benefit.  It is a grave hardship, for instance, where a single woman in poor circumstances is deprived of such benefit because a neighbour has complained that she has been working.  It is not true, of course, but for a period of perhaps four or five weeks that person's benefit is suspended.  When it is discovered that <Col N="539" /> a mistake has been made all the money is refunded, but I do not think that is good enough.  That is not the way to handle this matter.  When some people are ill, they need assistance much more than those who are in their full health.</P>
    <P>In regard to old people living on their own, it would possibly require legislation to enable their old age pensions to be increased, but surely something should be done about persons living on their own and receiving an old age non-contributory pension of 32/6 a week; if they go to the county home, being no longer able to live on 32/6 a week, the local authority will have to pay at least £3 10s. per week for their keep there.  One cannot say: &ldquo;That is all right; that comes from the local authority, not the State.&rdquo;  It has to be paid out of the national income and that is a matter which eventually will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Department of Social Welfare are the most courteous people I have met in my time in public life.  It does not matter what I have raised with them or how much trouble I have put them to&mdash;and I have put them to considerable trouble over the years&mdash;from top to bottom, they have given me nothing but courtesy.  If they can help, they do so and if they cannot help, they say so, without going backwards and forwards.  I say this particularly because there is an impression around the country that the Department officials in Dublin are there for the purpose of preventing people from getting what they are entitled to.  My experience has been the direct opposite. My experience is that they do everything possible to help those who are depending on them.</P>
    <P>There is an awkward point in this connection, that when local agents are removed, for one reason or another, the people who are drawing disability benefit have then to deal directly with head office.  That, as Deputy Corish said, is a bit of a snag because the people who up to now have got assistance from these agents in filling up their certificates now find they have to do it themselves.  Apart from that, the system seems to be running smoothly. I have never had to approach the <Col N="540" /> Minister except across the floor of the House, so I do not know whether he would receive me courteously or not&mdash;I am sure he would&mdash;but his officials are most courteous people and I am very grateful for the way in which they have dealt with the numerous problems I have brought to them from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we cannot advocate an increase in this Estimate, our field is very limited indeed.  All we can do is to give the Minister the benefit of our experience with regard to the routine clerical work of his Department. We all have experience of how the Department works but I cannot see why a person who makes a claim under the Social Welfare Acts in the city of Limerick must have his case sent to Dublin before a decision is made.  I see no reason why these claims cannot be dealt with locally so as to avoid all the unnecessary delay and all the calls we have from people whose claims for social benefit are delayed from one week to three months.  The local man has the local knowledge.  He knows how these people live and I believe he is the man who should be asked to give a decision in each case.  That is not the position. Everything has to come to Dublin, even the certificates of unfortunate people looking for sickness benefit have to be sent to Dublin.  Why that is so, I cannot understand.  It is about time the Department woke up to the fact that if we want to decentralise, if we want to keep people employed locally, it is the duty of the Department to take the first step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, we have what is more or less a reformation going on within the Department.  Officials are being transferred for economy reasons; offices are being closed; investigation officers who have spent years in particular areas are threatened with transfer and investigation officers who waited on people in their offices, besides doing their own work, are now being sent out and the offices are being closed down.  I do not believe that it is a good step or that it is any advancement. We are there to serve the people <Col N="541" /> and the unfortunate people who come to look for social welfare benefits are the people who must receive our first attention.  These are the people who cannot look after themselves; these are the people who, when they make a claim to the Department, get back an acknowledgement in Irish and do not know whether what is in the acknowledgement is Greek or Latin. They have come to me and asked me: &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; When we are dealing with a certain standard of people, we must come down to their level.  It is hard enough to look for the dole or for other assistances without being put to all this round about trying to get what we are justly entitled to.</P>
    <P>What happens in the meantime, while these claims are being held up?  The people come to us in the local authorities for home assistance and we have to go to the dispensary and pay out that home assistance from the ratepayers' pockets while the delay is going on in Dublin.  Sometimes when the claim is settled, there is some repayment made, but it is not made in all cases.  If these matters were dealt with locally, all that delay would be avoided, a delay which is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I have another problem to put to the Minister.  In Limerick, the general rule applies that you must have a three-day waiting period.  Why that is so, I do not know.  If a man is idle for one day, or two days, or ten days, he should be paid on the day he makes his claim.  If he is idle on Monday, he should be paid on Monday and should not have to wait until Wednesday or Thursday when his three days are up.  The stupidity of that is illustrated by this example.  In Limerick, a man may be working at the docks. He is idle on Monday and goes to the labour exchange and signs on.  He is idle on the Tuesday and also signs on. On Wednesday, a boat comes in. Now what is he to do ?  If he goes to the day's work, he gets his £2 12s.6d. for the day and breaks his claim.  If he does not go to work and signs instead, he gets three days' money.  It is much easier for him to give up his day's work and sign on at the labour exchange.  He will get his three days and his claim will be kept alive, whereas <Col N="542" /> otherwise his claim will be broken. That is a matter of grave importance and I hope I am impressing the Minister with regard to it.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I want to bring to his attention is the question of maternity gratuities.  A certain sum is set aside for maternity gratuities but no provision is made for two, three or four births&mdash;the same amount is payable. Surely anybody with any intelligence, or who is even threatened with intelligence, will understand that the same amount should not apply to one birth as to four births.  There is also the question of appeals which go on and on and are held up for days, weeks and months and the unfortunate person does not know where the next shilling is to come from.  All the time he is with the home assistance officer trying to get a few shillings home assistance.  While an appeal is pending, payment should be made.  If I am up on any charge in law and if I appeal, I am still an innocent person.  Why can we not apply the same rule to the unfortunates living on 30/- and 50/- a week?  These are the people who must have our first consideration.</P>
    <P>As I have said, our field on this Estimate is limited.  We would have many things to say on this Estimate and many complaints to make, but as I have said, I want to give the Minister the benefit of my experience.  I want to see injustices righted and I want to see those unfortunate people who are in need of assistance and help getting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the speech made by my colleague, Deputy Jones from West Limerick, who dealt in a very comprehensive way with the means test.  I thoroughly agree with him that the time has arrived when there should be a complete recasting of the whole situation. He cited instances in regard to holdings with a valuation of £30 which can be made over to members of the family and, by so doing, the old age pension is automatically payable, whether it is the father or mother, singly or jointly.  He went on to make a point that the ceiling of £30 valuation should be raised to bring many more people within the same provisions <Col N="543" /> as are being applied in the case of the £30 ceiling, that is, where holdings of £30 have been conveyed to younger members of a family, and argued that it should not be the policy of the Department to hold that against the claimant as having been done solely for the purpose of claiming the old age pension.  I consider that that is a sort of penal clause unjustly operating against such people.</P>
      <P>I want to convey one point emphatically to the Minister.  It is in connection with the means test as it has been applied here over the years.  This has been handed down to us from the British days when the old age pension was first introduced here.  At present if a claimant has, outside of property, any money in the bank or post office as a result of a strenuous savings campaign over the years, the first £25 is excluded.  The next £375 is calculated at five per cent.  In other words, the £375, plus the £75, is calculated to be an income of £18 15s. The Department then intervene in a most vigorous manner to the detriment of the thriftiness and hard work of people who have laboured over the years to put aside a small amount for the eventide of their lives.  The next £100 above that £400 is calculated by the Department at the rate of ten per cent.  We have the £375, with the £25 excluded, calculated at £18 15s.  If the person has £100 extra, £10 is recorded as means.  The same applies to the next £200 and so on.  Anything above £400 is calculated at a rate of ten per cent.</P>

      <P>I think I have made my point perfectly clear and I hope the Minister will take notice of it.  It is a matter that should receive the urgent attention of his Department. A Deputy quoted figures here showing that in the last financial year, there has been a saving of £200,000 on the Minister's Estimate.  While I appreciate we cannot allow Ministers to be headlong spendthrifts, this Parliament provided a certain sum to meet old age pensions.  If there were a relaxation of the penal enactment I have referred to, there would not be that money to spare.</P>
      <P>I shall not dwell on the points Deputy Corish made about the inadequacy of what this Government provided for social welfare.  I was amazed to hear him say that the Labour attitude on the Budget vote earlier this year, when they voted against an increase of £2 million for social welfare, was that the amount was not sufficient.  I should like to tell Deputy Corish and his colleagues that, when they were in office, their contribution to social welfare was not what the people expected from a Labour Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that is clear from the debate&mdash;indeed, it has been clear to me in any debates on social welfare&mdash;is that everybody in this House, speaking on social welfare <Col N="545" /> matters, is apparently in favour of very greatly increased expenditure on social services.  The main criticism was the inadequacy of the rates of benefit.  I am not an odd man out in that regard.  I also should like to see people who, through no fault of their own, meet with the different misfortunes, provided against to some extent by our social welfare legislation, dealt with as generously as possible.  I am quite sure my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is the same.  But we are in the position that we have to face up to the problem of providing that money.</P>
      <P>While my consistent experience in the 12 months I have been Minister is that Deputies are all in favour of increasing the amounts to any figure you can think of, so long as it is a substantial increase, I have also had the experience that the Deputies opposite, without any exception, will oppose any proposal to raise the money to implement even the smallest increase, even what has been described as the &ldquo;miserable increases&rdquo; given this year.  Of course, they were not miserable increases; they were substantial increases, and they involved the raising of the money to give them. As I pointed out when speaking on the Social Welfare Bill, by the provisions made in the Budget this year and the additional provisions made in the Social Welfare Act, 1962, the Government have arranged for an extra sum of £4.2 million to be made available in a full financial year for the recipients of social welfare.  As I said before, I consider that to be a considerable effort in the re-distribution of national income in favour of people who find themselves dependent on the services administered by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish said his complaint was that there was so much available to the Government to disburse at Budget time and so little was given to recipients of social welfare.  I will admit that when I first became Minister for Social Welfare, I was aware of the fact that the prosperity of the country was increasing.  I looked forward to a budgetary position in which there would be some of this huge amount Deputy Corish referred to <Col N="546" /> available to me to distribute to the deserving people depending on social services.  But by the time the Budget came along, I found that the buoyancy of revenue that followed the change of Government had, in fact, all been swallowed up and that there was no money available to the Minister for Finance to distribute to anybody and that these very considerable increases we gave this year involved the levying of new taxes in order to make the money available.</P>
    <P>The extent to which we came to the aid of recipients of social services this year is much greater than ever before. Deputies have referred only to the 2/6 given to the non-contributory old pensioners here and also during the Budget debate and the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, but in fact we went over the whole field of social services and gave increases in every single one, with the exception of children's allowances.  We dealt with old age pensioners, recipients of unemployment assistance, the widows and orphans, contributory and non-contributory, recipients of unemployment and disability benefit and contributory old age pensioners.  We gave substantial increases over the whole field and that was never done before except by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>While it is good to see everybody here filled with the milk of human kindness, so long as there is no question of raising the money, it is still relevant to point out that when it comes to the critical issue and when it is necessary for the Government to provide money for increases, Deputies opposite sing a different tune.  I was glad that at least one Deputy on the opposite Benches on this occasion overcame the coyness that has afflicted them in all my experience in dealing with this matter in regard to every other social service except non-contributory old age pensions.  Deputy Corish actually showed some concern on this occasion for unemployment assistance recipients also.  That concern was never evident when Deputies opposite were in Government.  In fact, everything that has been done in regard to unemployment assistance was done under Fianna Fáil.  No increases <Col N="547" /> have ever been given when other Governments were in office and not only have we given increases ourselves, but we have made up the leeway in regard to the relationship between unemployment assistance payments and the cost of living that arose due to neglect during the Coalition periods of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You also made up the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When in Government you must face the responsibility of finding money for these things.  I do not want to give the impression that I am by any means complacent about the level of social welfare payments, but I think it is right to point out that we have been gradually improving the position of recipients of all forms of social welfare payments relative to the cost of living in our period of office and Deputies need have no worry about our continuing to do so to the best of our ability, continuing to effect relative improvement in that respect and to see that social welfare recipients do not fall behind in relation to the improvement in the national income that is still taking place. Personally, I think it is a pity that the organised workers, the State servants in this case, had by their claims for increased salaries, largely swallowed up the buoyant revenue on which I had counted to be able to draw for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no complaint in regard to the manner in which this Estimate was debated.  It is good to see Deputies concerned about people depending on these schemes and I have no complaint that the criticisms made were unfair, but it is a pity that Deputies should appear to condone the concealing of means by people applying for these services.  The Oireachtas has not felt able, or possibly not disposed, to make these services available without a means test and the means tests that are there are statutory.  It is the duty of my Department to administer them and the duty of the social welfare officers to ask claimants for the assistance services questions which will establish whether they comply with the requirements <Col N="548" /> laid down by law.  It is the duty of the people asked these questions to reply truthfully and in cases where they have not done so, it is surely the duty of the Department to try to safeguard public moneys and to make it clear that it is advisable to answer these questions truthfully.</P>
    <P>It is a pity Deputies would not use occasions such as this to impress on people that they should make full disclosure of means rather than make it appear that, in the opinion of a great number of Deputies, it is no great misdemeanour to obtain these moneys by concealing the fact that one has means.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones mentioned that the means test was an objectionable thing. I agree, and it is objectionable that it should be necessary to ask these questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I heard complaints that the social welfare officers were apparently a class of people who tried to go beyond that, who concentrated on endeavouring to save money, if you like, with the result that people were being deprived of what they were fully entitled to and what the Oireachtas intended them to get when they passed social welfare legislation.  In case that might be true, one of the first things I did when I became Minister for Social Welfare was to make it quite clear that <Col N="549" /> social welfare officers had a dual responsibility to see that people did not obtain what they were not entitled to and to see that people obtained what they were entitled to receive.  On 12th December, 1961, I had a circular issued to that effect and I was not very long Minister for Social Welfare at that time.  It said:</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to remind officers that they must always endeavour to ensure that the various Acts and regulations administered by the Department should be complied with.  This means not only that those not entitled to benefit should not be able to obtain it but what is equally important that those who are so entitled should be able to obtain what is due to them without difficulty or delay.  The Minister wishes it to be known that it is his particular desire that officers of the Department should give every help to members of the public to obtain whatever social welfare benefits they may be entitled to under the Acts and regulations.  The Minister also wishes to emphasise that in their dealings with the public, whether by way of correspondence, telephone calls or interviews, the officers shall show that sympathy, understanding and courtesy which the public rightly expect from officers of a Department concerned, as our Department is, with social welfare.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the officers act in any other way and I was glad that at least one Deputy, Deputy Tully, put it on record that that was his experience.  Of course, I know Deputy Jones also said that they were very courteous but I think the implication was there that they concentrated on the preventive aspects of their work rather than on the helpful aspects, that is, to ensure that people get what they are entitled to get.  I do not think that is happening.  I believe that the social welfare officers generally are conscientiously administering the law as passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies criticised the means test in itself and advocated, I think, a relaxation of the means test.  I <Col N="550" /> admit that the means test is an objectionable thing but it is essential in order to ensure that the money made available goes to those people for whom the Oireachtas intended it.  I want to make it clear that proposals for relaxation of the means test are proposals for extra expenditure and, as I have said, I, as Minister for Social Welfare, am interested in extra expenditure when it is possible to obtain extra money.  I am anxious to increase benefit rates but I am far from agreeing with a number of Deputies who think the most important thing to do is to relax the means test.</P>
    <P>I have to ask myself the question: if I got the amount of money necessary to abolish or relax the means test, would that be the most equitable way to apply it?  While the means test is objectionable, I do not think that would be the most urgent thing.  A proposal to expend money in relaxing the means test is, in fact, a proposal to give something extra to people who have something already.  Surely it is more equitable to use whatever money becomes available for social welfare in raising the rates of payment of the various assistance services rather than to spend it in a discriminatory way which would result in the extra amount being available only to those who already had some means of their own? By applying it to a raising of the rates and, if necessary, extending the means scale, you ensure that the money is distributed equitably and that those who have no means, apart from the old age pension or other social assistance, get their due share of whatever money is available.</P>
    <P>My views on this matter would be more in line with Deputy Dunne's than those of some of the other speakers. It is not feasible in our circumstances to make the non-contributory old age pension available without a means test. That being so, I think we should concentrate on raising the rates rather than on distributing the money to people who already have some means.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not been unfair to the Deputies who criticised the administration of the means test.  I do not mean to be unfair but I am satisfied <Col N="551" /> that the means test is not being administered unsympathetically.  The social welfare officers can be only as sympathetic as the law allows them to be and there is no use in people asking them to strain a point.  For instance, the suggestion that when the Department finds that there will be a saving on the estimate for non-contributory old age pensions, the saving should be used up in some way, could only be acted upon by distributing the money in contravention of the laws that exist.  No Minister could instruct his officials to ignore the statutory regulations.</P>
    <P>As I have said, some Deputies, including a former Minister, Deputy Corish, spoke very feelingly on this question of the Department demanding repayment from people who have obtained benefits to which their means did not entitle them, and taking every possible step to get the money back. As I have already indicated, I think that was a pity, particularly coming from a former Minister.  It was suggested that it should be possible to deal with cases such as that with an element of compassion.  Of course, I am quite aware that practically every case in which some such defalcation is discovered is a compassionate case and if that discretion were there, the result would be that there would be no effort made to recoup money wrongfully obtained from the Department. There would be chaos and it would be impossible to exercise any control over the money expended on social welfare. I ask Deputies, then, to try to emphasise to people that it is in their own interests to make a full disclosure of their means, in the first instance, and to do nothing that might indirectly encourage people not to disclose those means fully.</P>
    <P>There was criticism of the manner in which savings or capital money is assessed for non-contributory old age pensions.  I must say that I also, when I saw that, felt there was something unrealistic about the way in which it is assessed but on looking into it, I find it is not an unrealistic or unfair way.  If a person who has some money <Col N="552" /> in the bank or in the post office decided to purchase an annuity with that money which would be payable to him for the rest of his life, he would at the age of 70 be able to get a greater return from it than the amount assessed as its annual value by my Department at the moment.  The relevant regulation does not provide for its assessment in a way which would make it feasible for the man to retain the money for passing on to his heirs. It does assess it at a lesser rate than what the man could obtain by purchasing an annuity but then, of course, it means he will not have it available for passing on.</P>

      <P>A question was raised with regard to the handing over of farms.  There seems to be an impression that the transfer of a farm is accepted for social welfare purposes, only if the transfer is to a son or a daughter. That is not necessarily so at all.  A transfer to any relative, or even to a non-relative can be accepted, provided it is clear that the transfer is not just a device in order to obtain a pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crinion asked about the £800 limit in relation to non-manual workers.  This limit was raised from £600 to £800 in 1958.  At that time, the new limit was substantially more than would have been required for strict conformity with the original limit which, up to 1952, was £500. The maintenance of that relationship is constantly under review.  At the moment, we are considering whether <Col N="553" /> or not there is a case for raising the limit further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne raised the case of an Irish seaman serving on a British ship. All such cases are fairly well covered. If we find there is a particular type of case where the person is not covered under either our code or the British code, we will examine the position to find out what is necessary.  The reciprocal agreement may require to be revised in some respect.  I am not aware of that being necessary at the moment.  It may be that Deputy Kyne has come across a case which makes some revision necessary.  The matter will be examined and, if it is desirable, steps will be taken to remedy the position.</P>
    <P>I have explained on a number of occasions to Deputy Tully why the conditions with regard to the average number of stamps for contributory old age pensions had to be imposed and why it is not possible to go back over a very long period to assess the average.  There is a practical difficulty. After all, contributions in respect of contributory old age pensions became payable only from January, 1961. Surely it was as much as could be expected that we should go back and allow stamps put on over the past 10 or 15 years prior to the person reaching the age of 70 ?</P>

Admittedly, he did not know that at some future date there would be a contributory old age pensions scheme. But he had the opportunity.  Some availed of it; others did not.  I do not see that we could reasonably be expected to go any further, particularly when there would be practical difficulties in administering the scheme, were we to go further back.</P>

I know there are a number of Deputies who do not agree with me in that ; they appear to think the most urgent matter is a relaxation of the means test.  I believe the most equitable thing to do with any money available to me for non-contributory old age pensioners is to raise the rates of pension so that the money will be distributed to those who have no means as well as to those who have some means.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1963, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (No. 13 of 1946 and No. 6 of 1956) including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net estimate for Forestry for the year 1962/63, as adjusted by this token Supplementary Estimate, stands at £2,524,810, an increase of £137,410 over the 1961/62 net Estimate figure as shown in the printed volume of Estimates.  It will be recalled, however, that a Supplementary Estimate of £91,700 for 1961/62 was passed by the Dáil towards the end of February, <Col N="555" /> too late for inclusion in the printed figures and the net increase for which allowance is made in the Estimate now before the House is, accordingly, £45,710.</P>
    <P>Deputies will wish to be given detailed information on the subheads relating to land acquisition, forest development and management, appropriations-in-aid and private forestry (Subheads C.1, C.2, G and D) and, before dealing with these items, I propose to refer briefly to the other subheads of the Vote.</P>
    <P>Subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;shows an increase of £81,400 over the original provisions for 1961-62.  An additional sum of £28,000 was provided in this subhead in the Supplementary Estimate so that the increase for 1962-63 over the adjusted provision for 1961-62 is approximately £53,000.  The bulk of this increase is attributable to the revision of Civil Service pay scales; allowance is also being made for normal incremental increases and for some necessary additional inspectorate and forester posts.</P>
    <P>Subhead B&mdash;Travelling and Incidenal Expenses&mdash;shows an increase of £8,900 over the provision for 1961-62. The increase in this subhead is entirely due to increased allowance for travelling and subsistence expenditure.  The steady increase in the State forest area and the concurrent increase in the numbers of field staff employed necessitate a progressive increase in the annual rate of expenditure on travelling expenses.  The amounts inserted for advertising and publicity and other incidental expenses call for no special comment.</P>
    <P>The provision for Sawmilling&mdash;Subhead C.3&mdash;shows an increase of £3,300 over the original provision for 1961-62. The increase over the provision for that year as adjusted in the Supplementary Estimate is, however, only £2,000.  This subhead provides for the operation of the Department's fixed sawmills at Cong and Dundrum.</P>
    <P>For Forestry Education&mdash;Subhead E &mdash;the provision for 1962/63 is lower by £3,500 compared with the original <Col N="556" /> provision for 1961/62, the reduction being due to the exclusion from the subhead for 1962/63 of any provision for expenditure on the restoration of Avondale House as a centre for refresher and specialised courses for our forest technical staff.  When introducing the Estimate for Forestry last year, I mentioned that a sum of £20,000 had been allocated for this work from the American Grant Counterpart Reserve Fund and that the item of £5,000 included in Subhead E for the work expected to be done during the year was balanced by a corresponding figure for recoupment of that amount in the Appropriations-inAid subhead.  In the event, the Office of Public Works did not find it possible to commence the work during the year but it is hoped that the work will start during 1962/63.  Henceforth any expenditure and recoupment in connection with this item will, however, be dealt with in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.</P>
    <P>In the current year, there will be an average of 92 trainee foresters undergoing instructiton at the Departments training establishments at Kinnity Castle and Shelton Abbey.  Allowance has been made for an increase of £1,500 in expenditure on the management of the establishments in the year.</P>
    <P>Subhead F&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services&mdash;is down by £3,540 on the original provision for 1961/62. The amount sought for 1962/63 provides for the re-engagement of a firm of industrial consultants for short periods during the year as may be required in connection with the application and extension of the incentive bonus scheme for forest workers.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the more important parts of the Estimate, it will be seen that the grant-in-aid for land acquisition (Subhead C. 1) is £135,000, £5,000 higher than the figure for 1961/62.  The balance in the Grant-in-Aid Fund on 31st March, 1962, was £55,000, so that with the new grant of £135,000 sought there will be a total of £190,000 available for the purchase of land in 1962/63.  This amount would, in the ordinary course, be adequate to cover the extent of purchase transactions <Col N="557" /> likely to be brought to a conclusion within the year.  Deputies may be aware, however, that my Department has contracted to purchase a large area of 4,000 acres in County Tipperary, which was sold by public auction some time ago.  The purchase of this area is expected to be concluded within the next few months and the Fund will thereby be reduced by approximately £40,000.  It now appears likely that the balance remaining in the Fund after completion of this transaction will be insufficient for the remainder of the year and that it will be necessary to seek an additional grant by way of Supplementary Estimate. In this connection, may I digress for a moment to say to the House that I expect to have the supplementary grant under this heading before the House within the next fortnight?  Perhaps, having indicated the reason for it, it will save discussion on the Supplementary Estimate when it comes before the House.</P>
    <P>Last year, the gross total area acquired for State Forestry purposes was 31,794 acres.  This was the largest area acquired by my Department in any single year so far.  The achievement of this record was facilitated by the acquisition of a number of exceptionally large areas during the year. Four such areas were taken over towards the end of the year&mdash;two in County Mayo, one on the Cork-Kerry border and one in County Wexford. These four cases accounted for a total of 8,500 acres between them.  The balance of 23,300 acres acquired in the year, which yielded a total plantable content of 21,288 acres, was acquired in 476 separate transactions, giving an average productive area of 45 acres per transaction compared with an average productive area per transaction of 51 acres in 1960/61 and an average of 67 acres in 1959/60.  The progressive decline in the average size of acquisition which has become apparent in recent years has inevitably added to the difficulties being encountered by my Department in its efforts to increase the plantable reserve.</P>
    <P>The total plantable content of the area acquired in 1961-62 was approximately <Col N="558" /> 25,500 acres.  The effective plantable reserve at the beginning of the year was 49,300 acres.  The planting programme for the year was 25,200 acres, of which an estimated total of 2,000 acres consisted of land formerly classified as unplantable or woodland areas cleared for replanting. With the addition of the plantable area of 25,500 acres acquired in 1961-62, the effective reserve on 1st April, 1962, was 51,600 acres, an increase of 2,300 acres over the reserve figure for the previous year.</P>
    <P>The overall plantable reserve position, therefore, has improved, but not significantly.  The reserve is still insufficient to enable work programmes at the individual forest centres to be maintained at a steady level.  Indeed, by the end of 1961-62, plantable reserves had been completely exhausted at a number of forests and in the absence of a sufficient volume of general development and maintenance work at some of those forests reductions in staff could not be avoided.  The distribution of the plantable reserve is very uneven and, until a higher and more evenly-spread rate of land acquisition is achieved, the difficulties in programme planning will continue.</P>
    <P>When I was introducing the Forestry Estimate last year, I mentioned that progress had been made in a number of commonage and title difficulty cases under the new procedure made available under the Forestry Code which involves the formal use of the powers of compulsory acquisition conferred by the Forestry Act, 1946.  During last year, proceedings were brought to a successful conclusion in the first of such cases and possession was taken of the two areas incolved&mdash;one of 1,800 acres in County Mayo, and the other an area of almost 600 acres in County Kerry.  So far this year, 1,566 acres have been acquired and further acquisition orders have been made by the Land Commission in respect of a total of 350 acres.  Price agreement has been reached and applications for acquisition orders have either been made or are pending in respect of areas totalling <Col N="559" /> 3,284 acres.  There are quite a large number of other areas&mdash;totalling in all some 70,000 acres&mdash;to which it is proposed to apply the compulsory procedure.  Many of the areas being considered for acquisition in this way comprise extensive commonages which it would have been practically impossible to acquire in the normal course because of title difficulties or disagreement on the part of a minority of shareholders.  The acquisition of some of these areas will lead to large-scale forestry development in many districts where little or no progress would otherwise be possible.</P>
    <P>Before turning from the Land Acquisition Subhead there is one further matter which should be mentioned. In the debate on the Supplementary Estimate for Forestry for 1961/62, a number of Deputies made pleas for the sale by the Forestry Division of various odd portions of better quality land to particular landholders in their constituencies.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear at the outset that the Forestry Division does not set out to buy land of agricultural quality.  The very low scale of land valuation under which it operates makes it a foregone conclusion that no significant area of good quality land will find its way into the Forestry Division's possession.  There is an additional precaution in the sifting precedure under which, before acquisition, a Land Commision inspector examines any parcel which may contain land bordering on the agricultural to ensure that such land is not required for Land Commission purposes. Nonetheless, a very small proportion of better quality land may occasionally be included in the acquisition of a large parcel of the usual sub-marginal quality which comes in for forestry and these are the cases which give rise to representations for the sale of the odd portions.  It should be recognised that the average quality class of land which the Forestry Division is planting and is endeavouring to build up into a viable forest economy is very low and the small area of better quality land which can be acquired and planted is extremely <Col N="560" /> important in improving the average output of timber per acre.  In forestry as in agriculture there is a direct relationship between the quality of the ground and crop yields.  Sitka spruce, for example, planted on first-class forest land, will produce an average annual yield of 260 cubic feet of timber per acre but on low-quality ground may yield only an average of 130 cubic feet.  A good case could be made for more extensive afforestation of better quality land. Because of the predominant importance of agriculture in our economy, our policy is to concentrate on the afforestation of land which is marginal or sub-marginal by agricultural standards but there is a definite economic advantage in the inclusion in the forest area of the small pockets of better land which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is the additional consideration that these areas of better land enable our foresters to introduce a greater variety of species and allow them to get some hardwoods planted.  Deputies will appreciate that the exposed areas of low fertility which comprise the normal forestry acquisition offer very little choice of species but on the better areas there is a wider choice and if conditions are favourable the planting of hardwoods can be entertained.  The Department is already under strong pressure from the furniture trade and other forms of industry and from the hurley manufacturers to secure a wider planting of hardwoods.  These industrialists are thinking ahead to the need for competitive manufacture and trading in the wider sphere of the Common Market and the Department would wish to do all it can to ensure that its plantations will produce the necessary raw materials but, to secure this, it must be permitted to retain intact its acquisitions and not to skim off the small portion of cream at the behest of every neighbouring farmer.</P>
    <P>If the Department had to yield to every application which is made to sell off portions of land the already small pool of better quality forest land would be depleted, our prospects of attaining a viable forest economy would seriously be weakened and the Department would be unable to supply the future <Col N="561" /> hardwood needs of our home manufacturers. A rigid stand towards such applications must, therefore, be maintained and I trust that my Department may have the support of all rural Deputies in maintaining that attitude.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management&mdash;totals £2,430,250 for 1962-63, an increase of £181,850 over the original provision for 1961-62. In the Supplementary Estimate for 1961-62, however, Subhead C.2 was increased by £124,100 so that the increase for 1962-63 over the adjusted provision for the previous year is £57,750.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on labour accounts for the major part of the expenditure under this subhead.  The provision for labour for 1961-62, as adjusted in the Supplementary Estimate consequent on an increase in the basic wage rates of forestry workers with effect from 1st April, 1961, was £1,837,500. The corresponding provision in the 1962-63 Estimate is £1,879,000, an increase of £41,500 over the previous year's adjusted figure.  The balance of the increase of £57,750 in the subhead for 1962-63 is spread over the non-labour heads.</P>
    <P>The adjusted provision for Head 1 &mdash;State Forest Nurseries&mdash;for 1961-62 was £189,000, £23,000 more than the figure shown in the printed Estimates volume.  Provision was continued at about the same level for 1962-63.</P>
    <P>Progress was continued during the past year in implementing the policy of establishing large-scale nurseries to replace as many as possible of the small nursery units of uneconomic size which had hitherto been in operation. Two new areas were taken over for development as large-scale nurseries during the year&mdash;one at Clogheen, County Tipperary, and the other at Killygordon, County Donegal.  Nine large-scale nursery areas have been acquired so far and other areas are being considered for acquisition. When the required number of big nurseries are in production, the Department's task of meeting the very heavy annual demand for plants will be greatly facilitated.</P>
    <P>Head 2&mdash;Establishment of Plantations&mdash;covers <Col N="562" /> all expenditure on fencing, ground preparation, drainage and planting of land, apart from mechanical work proper to Head 6.  The adjusted provision under this Head for 1961/62 was £608,000.  For 1962/63, the provision is £581,000, £27,000 less than the adjusted provision for 1961/62.  This reduction is entirely due to a reduction in the requirement for the purchase of fencing wire.  The provision for labour under this Head for the year is £484,000.</P>
    <P>Planting continued at a very high level in 1961/62.  The total area of new plantations established in the year was 25,200 acres.  In addition, new crops were established on 400 acres of State forest lands from which marketable crops had been removed. From now on there will be a slow but steady increase in the area of plantations being clear-felled and the reforestation of such areas must be regarded as an integral part of the annual planting programme.  In addition 600 acres of plantations destroyed by fire, and so on, were replanted last year.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1961/62, the total planted area held by my Department had increased to 357,000 acres, consisting of 346,000 acres of State plantations and 11,000 acres of acquired woodland areas still held intact.  It is a measure of the remarkable progress that has been achieved in the rate of afforestation in recent years that of the total of 346,000 acres of State plantations now established no less than 119,000 acres, more than one-third of the total consist of plantations established in the past 5 years.</P>
    <P>Planting is being continued at the rate of 25,000 acres this year and despite the difficulties about land acquisition to which I referred earlier I am confident that the Forestry Service will succeed in maintaining this programme in future years.</P>
    <P>The planting programme for the current year is as widely dispersed throughout the country as the level of land reserves held in the various areas allows.  The western counties will continue to occupy a predominant place, with a programme of 11,000 acres, <Col N="563" /> 44 per cent of the entire national programme. The steady expansion in forestry development in the western counties in recent years has been a major factor in the achievement of planting targets.  Indeed, but for the rapid increase in the rate of land acquisition in the western areas, it would have been impossible to achieve the ultimate planting target of 25,000 acres a year.</P>
    <P>Last year, almost half of the total productive area acquired for planting was situated in the West and half the total area at present being considered for acquisition lies in the western counties.  Land is available for large-scale forestry development in greater quantity in the western areas than in any other part of the country and it will continue to be one of the main objectives of my Department to speed up the acquisition and planting of land there.  The social effect of State forestry development in terms of employment is of special significance in the western counties where new sources of productive employment are so badly needed.  Forestry is already making a worthwhile contribution towards providing some easement of the problems of unemployment and under-employment in the West, where there are now about 2,000 men employed regularly on State forestry work, and where the annual wage bill is now in the region of £800,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware of the importance which the inter-departmental Committee on the Problems of Small Western Farms attached to forestry as a source of productive employment in the West.  The Government in accepting the committee's report have been giving consideration to various measures which will permit of still further expansion of afforestation in the Western counties.  The extensive research work which my Department is carrying on with a view to establishing the limits to which we can go in the afforestation of less fertile peat soils in conditions of troublesome drainage and exposure will, of course, make a very valuable contribution in this field and some further expansion <Col N="564" /> might reasonably be expected as the results of this research work become available.  In the meantime the Government believe that the acquisition of suitable areas in the West for forestry purposes could be facilitated if the Land Commission were permitted to transfer to the Forestry Division for forestry development certain lands acquired under the Land Acts.  An amendment to the law would be necessary to enable this to be done and such an amendment is being considered.</P>
    <P>Consideration is also being given to the possibility of more intensive steps to acquire for forestry purposes extensive blocks lying between existing State forest properties.  Forestry development could be advanced if these lands, which in many cases are not capable of supporting a prosperous agricultural community, could be acquired for forestry purposes.  No decision has yet been taken as to how best the tempo of acquisition in cases of this kind can be accelerated but the matter is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I may say that employment in the West on forestry work is certain to increase steadily as the rate of land acquisition is accelerated and, of course, there will be a further substantial increase as the very large areas of young plantations established there in the past decade reach the productive stages of growth.</P>
    <P>The provision for Head 3&mdash;New Roads and Buildings&mdash;for 1962-63 is down by £30,000 compared with the original provision for 1961-62.  The reduced provision, however, is not indicative of any intention to reduce the tempo of forest road construction. The provision in 1962-63 is, in fact, £87,000 higher than the actual level of expenditure under the head in 1961-62. Last year, the road construction programme was to some extent adversely affected by weather conditions and although just over 200 miles of new forest roads were completed in the year, the achievement fell short of expectations.  The provision for 1962-63 is adequate for the completion of over 250 miles of road in the year <Col N="565" /> and it is hoped that this target will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The provision for road construction for 1962-63 includes a sum of £236,000 for direct labour.  For the supply of road materials the provision is £157,000; the bulk of this sum is for the supply of stones and gravel by contractors and it includes, therefore, a substantial sum for indirect employment. The provision for buildings under the Head for 1962-63 is £33,500 compared with £25,000 in 1961-62.</P>
    <P>Turning now to Head 4&mdash;General Forest Management&mdash;it will be seen that the provision for 1962-63 shows an increase of £77,400 over the original provision for 1961-62.  In the Supplementary Estimate for 1961-62, however, the provision for that year was increased by £74,400 so that the increase for 1962-63 is £3,000 above the adjusted provision for last year.</P>
    <P>The provision for general forest management for the current year totals £825,000, over one-third of the total for the entire of Subhead C. 2. This, the biggest head of expenditure in the Vote, bears all the costs of maintenance and protection in the State plantations, including such work as the cleaning of young plantations, the repair of fences, drains and forest roads, pruning, fire-line construction and so on.  With new plantations totalling 25,000 acres being added to the forest area each year, the expenditure under this head must inevitably increase. Proper attention to maintenance and protection needs is, of course, vital if the plantations are eventually to give the best possible return in timber production for the money invested. The bulk of the provision under the Head&mdash;£798,000 out of the total of £825,000, or 97 per cent.&mdash;is in respect of labour.</P>
    <P>In connection with the question of protection of the State forests, which calls for increased provision every year, I must make special reference to the growing peril from forest fires.  The widespread publicity given in the Press and on radio and television to the many serious forest fires that had to be dealt with this year should have brought the seriousness of this problem <Col N="566" /> home to all sections of the community. During the danger period this year, forest staffs, aided by the Garda Síochána, local fire-fighting services and voluntary helpers, have had to deal with 530 fires in or near forest areas. Several of these fires were of very serious dimensions and large areas of forest land were threatened.  As it was, 40 of these fires caused damage to plantations, destroying 300 acres of young timber with a potential value of about £250,000.</P>
    <P>As the area of State forest increases, so will the danger from forest fires, and I earnestly appeal to the public to cooperate with my Department in the work of protecting the forests.  This appeal is directed particularly to those farmers who engage in the burning of rough grazing lands in the spring months.  The legal requirements about the burning of vegetation in the vicinity of forest lands are widely publicised and people who choose to ignore them and cause damage to plantations as a result of burning without giving the notice required will not only be liable to prosecution but they will also be liable to payment of compensation for the damage caused. The danger from forest fires is now so serious that my Department cannot afford to be lenient in such cases and the law will henceforth be rigorously applied.</P>
    <P>The provision for Head 5&mdash;Timber Conversion&mdash;is up by £29,500 compared with the original provision for the previous year but it just about equates the provision for that year as adjusted in the Supplementary Estimate. £118,000 of the provision for 1962/63 is in respect of labour. Direct labour felling by my Department is now largely confined to felling to meet special orders such as transmission poles for the ESB and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and to felling in areas being thinned for the first time or areas where there are unusual felling problems.  The great bulk of forest produce is now sold standing to timber merchants who have it felled and extracted by their own employees.</P>
    <P>Thinning returns for 1961/62 show <Col N="567" /> that the total volume of thinning produce for the year was 3.3 million cubic feet, compared with 2.6 million cubic feet in the previous year.  Other felling such as the clear-felling of mature timber, the clearance of blown material, the felling of poles for special orders and so on yielded a total of 5.8 million cubic feet.</P>
    <P>The yield from other felling was inflated for the year by the partial clearance of areas affected by the exceptionally severe storms of September and October, 1961, which caused extensive damage at a number of forests.</P>
    <P>Head 6&mdash;Mechanical Equipment for Forest Development and Management &mdash;shows an increase of £22,750 compared with last year.  The Head bears all charges relating to the purchase, operation and maintenance of machines and mechanical equipment. The increase for 1962/63 is attributable to the expansion of the Department's fleet of machinery and to increases in machine operators' wages.</P>
    <P>The total sum provided for forestry labour for 1962/63 is £1,896,500, compared with an adjusted provision of £1,854,000 for 1961/62 and an actual outturn of £1,832,000 for that year. The provision for the current year, therefore, allowed for an increase of £64,500 in labour expenditure over last year's actual level.</P>
    <P>The average weekly number of men in the direct employment of my Department during 1961/62 was 4,803, an increase of 150 men above the level for 1960/61.  The degree of expansion in employment last year was made possible by an increase in the volume of work on the preparation of ground for planting, coupled with an increase in general maintenance work in the existing plantations and especially some rather intensive work in the cleaning of young plantations.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for 1962/63 was framed to allow for a similar employment level this year.  Present indications are that the employment average will in fact be slightly lower than last year&mdash;cleaning requirements this Summer having proved lighter than <Col N="568" /> expected&mdash; but a substantial increase in labour costs will follow from a further increase in wage-levels which took effect from 1st April, 1962.  This additional expenditure will have to be covered by Supplementary Estimate but I am not yet in a position to give the House precise figures.</P>
    <P>The continued maintenance of forest employment at the prevailing level is evidence that the steps taken to ensure that the incentive bonus scheme for forestry workers would not lead to staff redundancy have been largely successful.  Any reductions in employment that have had to be faced were due to purely local circumstances, the usual causes being the exhaustion of reserves of land for planting or the clearing up of arrears of general development and maintenance work. Seasonal fluctuations in employment are of course, still a feature of forestry employment for the full year is now being provided with steady employment for the full year is increasing steadily and this number should continue to increase according as more plantations reach the later stages of development.  In the long term, direct forestry employment must increase substantially as a result of the large annual planting programme now being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The incentive bonus scheme continues to operate smoothly.  It is now firmly established as an integral part of forest management.  The workers themselves accept it as a fair and reasonable scheme which affords them the opportunity of adding to their earnings without undue strain.  The scheme has also contributed significantly to better forest management and the standardisation and improvement of working methods is one of the big incidental gains.  More important, however, is the gain to efficient management from the availability of comprehensive and accurate operational data based on work study.  The overall effect of the scheme has been to provide a sound basis for the management of the State forestry undertaking in the most efficient and most economic possible manner so that in time the heavy national investment in forestry will be repaid with interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> Turning now to the income side of the Vote&mdash;Subhead G, Appropriations-in Aid&mdash;Deputies will note that allowance is being made for a forest income of £678,000 in 1962/63, an increase of £136,000 over the original estimate for last year.  Actual receipts for the year 1961/62 came to £574,429, by far the highest figure for forest income for any year to date.  Sales of timber from the forests realised £522,000 in the year.  The balance was made up of £41,000 from the sale of sawn timber from the Department's sawmills, £10,000 from sporting, grazing and other rents and £1,500 from miscellaneous sources.</P>
    <P>The total volume of timber sold from the State Forests last year came to 7¼ million cubic feet, of which 2¼ million cubic feet, or 31 per cent., consisted of timber of 8&rdquo; quarter girth and upwards and therefore in the sawlog or boxwood category.  The volume of material sold in the year was to some extent swollen by the disposal of some of the material blown in the autumn storms of 1961.</P>
    <P>The market for all classes of material continued to be generally very favourable.  Material of pulpwood size commanded a ready market and there was good demand for heavier material suitable for conversion to structural timber.  The production and sale of transmission and telegraph poles increased.</P>
    <P>The current year's estimate was framed in the expectation that the volume of sales would continue at a high level and that the pulpwood market would be improved by the commencement of purchases for the new chipboard factory being established in Waterford.  In general, the market position was such that it was considered that a target of £625,000 from timber sales for 1962/63 should be capable of achievement.  Everything possible is being done to achieve this ambitious target but present indications are that there will be some short fall&mdash;but still with an increase on last year's record revenue level.</P>
    <P>Now a few words about private forestry.  The provision for grants for <Col N="570" /> afforestation purposes&mdash;Subhead D&mdash; remains unchanged at £25,000.  During last year, first instalment grants were sanctioned for newly-established plantations totalling 1,068 acres but the bulk of this planting would have been done in the 1960/61 season. Planting in the 1961/62 season appears to have been at a similar level but it is too soon to make an accurate assessment.  My Department's efforts to promote more private planting were continued during the year, at national and local level.  Special campaigns were conducted in Counties Tipperary, Carlow, Longford and Westmeath and during last winter lectures on the benefits of small-scale planting were given at 45 centres in these counties.</P>
    <P>The level of private planting achieved since the campaign for more private forestry effort commenced in 1958 has represented an improvement of 100 per cent. on the level of previous years.  I am satisfied, however, there is still room for further improvement.  Since the campaign started, about 2,700 landowners have sought advice under my Department's free technical advice scheme on the planting of areas totalling 12,000 acres.  All of these areas were duly inspected by the forestry inspectors, the great bulk of them were found to be suitable for planting and detailed advice on ground preparation, drainage, fencing and suitable species was provided.  Less than a quarter of the landowners concerned, however, have so far gone ahead with the job and I would like to appeal to those people who have put the work on the long finger to go ahead and complete it and take advantage of the generous grant assistance now available from my Department.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I hope that the information I have given will have provided Deputies with some picture of the present very healthy position of the State forestry service.  I am satisfied that the service is now fully geared to maintain our afforestation programme at the present very high level, to develop and manage the State forest holding with the maximum of efficiency and, at the <Col N="571" /> other end of the line, to obtain the best possible return for the produce of the forests.  I confidently recommend the Estimate to the House.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Waterford-Tramore Bus Service.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I put the following question to the Minister for Transport and Power to-day:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Transport and Power what are the latest returns from the CIE Waterford-Tramore service over the last twelve months (1) in passengers carried and (2) in gross revenue taken; and whether the service is showing a profit or a loss.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not in his place and the reply was given to me by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Jack Lynch, who said:</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by me on 28th February, 1962, to questions about the numbers of passengers carried between Waterford and Tramore on the CIE services, to which I have nothing to add.</P>
      <P>On 28th February 1962, I asked the Minister a question with regard to the number of people who travelled on the Waterford-Tramore bus service; I mentioned a figure of 40,000 people and I asked him was that an official estimate.  The reply appears at column 734, volume 193, of the Official Report of 28th February 1962, where the Minister for Transport and Power said:</P>
      <P>The figure of 40,000 referred to by the Deputy is an estimate made by CIE at my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply of 14th February, 1962, the number of bus passengers carried by CIE in the period 1st April-30th October, 1961, showed a small increase on the number of rail passengers carried in the same period in the preceding year.  The balance of the estimated increase of 40,000 represents an estimate of the numbers <Col N="572" /> carried by the private bus service operating between Waterford and Tramore.</P>
    <P>I protested later that what the private bus service carried had nothing to do with the Minister and he should not put the number of their passengers in with these figures.  The discussion went on and the Minister gave me no figure.  At column 735, I said:</P>
    <P>I am asking a question, Sir.  Will the Minister tell us now why he will not give us the figures?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give the figures but he says in this answer to-day that he gave the figures.</P>
    <P>However, there was a sequel to this because on 13th March, nearly a fortnight aferwards, I asked your permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment in relation to Questions Nos. 46 and 47 on the Order Paper of 28th February, 1962.  I brought the Minister in on the Adjournment and it was only then that he gave any figures.  I do not say I am very grateful to the Minister for giving me the figures in such a manner.  We are entitled to ask for the figures and, as you know, Deputies are continually putting down Questions to the Minister and the Minister rises and says he has no function.  Deputies are continually sending questions to the Dáil office for the Minister for Transport and Power and getting back the famous reply.  We all have thousands of them from your office, Sir, such as the following:</P>
    <P>I regret I have had to disallow the question addressed by you to the Minister for Transport and Power regarding the dismantling of the railway line where a branch railway has been closed, on the ground that the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>I take that for what it is worth and I abide by your ruling, but the Minister to-day would not allow either me or anybody else to say a word about the Chairman of CIE because the Minister protested to us that he was responsible. The Minister says he is responsible and even though he might produce the old excuse that he has no responsibility for the day-to-day administration of CIE, I am not asking <Col N="573" /> him about any day-to-day business. I am asking him for the figures over the past 12 months in relation to Tramore.  I am entitled to ask for these figures and I know these figures are available because in the CIE report to which I referred earlier to-night, it is said that operating results during the year showed that the financial betterment from the substitution of road services for the West Cork, West Clare and Waterford-Tramore railway lines was approximately £90,000.  I know West Clare was losing a packet of money.  I have the word of Dr. Andrews himself for it; so was the West Cork line, but the Tramore line was supposed to be losing £3,000.  Here now it is boxed in with all these.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister now to supply me with the figures.  It is obvious that CIE are keeping a record of these figures.  If they are not doing so, what they are publishing in this report is false.  The Minister says he is responsible. If he is the responsible Minister, it is his duty to give these figures to Deputies.  We have to vote the money for the deficits.  Dr. Andrews says in his paper or lecture that the substitution of a road service for a rail service does not mean giving a worse service. I say it is a worse service.  We have the proof of the pudding.  The unfortunate Waterford people have to pay 2/8d. to go to Tramore by bus, while they could go by rail for 1/5d.</P>

      <P>The best thing the Deputy can do is to keep out of this. According to the Minister's figures, there were only 424,000 people travelling on the train in one year.  The line was torn up at 24 hours' notice.  They dragged it up in the rain and paid men extra money to do it.  I am convinced that if that line had been left there, it could have been made to pay but it had to go.  It was a try-out.  Surely no Deputy can justify the butchering of our railway line.</P>

      <P>It will arise.  There are many matters on which I shall <Col N="574" /> bring the Minister into this House before this session is over.  As the Minister is such a stickler for order, I say it does arise.  I am asking the Minister&mdash;and I expect he should answer me&mdash;for these figures.  I want them for my constituents.  The Question I put down must be answered.  I do not want the Minister to say these figures are not readily available.  I know that CIE do not send a couple of their officials or of their staff into a room at the end of the current year and just get the figures.  The returns come in from month to month.  We all know that and we all know that the returns are made available.  We know now that station masters are told that these are top secret and must not be given to anybody who asks for them.  We know that the returns are sent to Kingsbridge and it is no trouble for the Minister to get them.</P>
      <P>I gave the Minister due notice of this question.  It was in the Dáil office since last week.  The Minister would save himself a lot of heartache if he recognised that this is the Parliament of the country and that when Deputies ask a question about any of the, shall I say, enterprises, that he says he is responsible for, they are entitled to be answered, whether it is about CIE, Bord na Móna, the ESB or Aer Lingus.  I have heard him answer questions about Aer Lingus regarding the number of passengers carried and the number of people who passed through Shannon and yet he will not give us this information.  Is it discourtesy or is it through &ldquo;cussedness&rdquo; I asked that question?  I expect the Minister to answer it.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious from hearing Deputy Lynch that he has never bothered to read the observations I made speaking on the Estimate for my Department on the 13th July, 1961, at column 909 to column 916 in the Official Report in which I clearly outlined the work of the Department, my responsibilities in that regard, and in which I made it perfectly clear that the line would have to be drawn somewhere with regard to giving information on fractions of the operation of a particular company <Col N="575" /> and that in the public interest.  The information regarding the Waterford-Tramore line was given in greater detail because at that time there was a controversy over the closing of the railway line.  I was not compelled to give the information then.  According to legislation, which Deputy Lynch supported, there was no need for me to give any explanation at all but in order to satisfy the House that I was undertaking the general surveillance of the 1958 Act, and to make quite sure it operated to the national interest, I gave a great deal of information at the time of the closing of the three lines he has spoken of to indicate the general position.  I made it quite clear that I was taking a great interest in the operation of the Act and would continue to take an interest in it until the time comes for the re-shaping of the transport policy at the end of the five year period.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Estimate speech, I outlined in great detail the work of the Department, making it perfectly clear that I have functions and responsibilities.  I never yet heard a single Deputy constructively, or even destructively, criticise what was a very carefully prepared statement about the duties of the Minister whose Department was mainly concerned with the operation of State companies.</P>

      <P>I am not going to create a precedent regarding the operation of a State company in regard to giving fragmentary information in relation to a particular section of the operations of the company when there is no question of some acute conflict of opinion such as the closing of a line, when the matter has been disposed of, when CIE have reported <Col N="576" /> on the general financial position in relation to the three lines in their annual report and the betterment effected.  There might, indeed, be an exception to that if I were to listen to the Deputy with regard to the character of the Waterford-Tramore bus service in substitution for the railway.  If I was to take his advice alone regarding the alleged dissatisfaction in Waterford City and environs, I would have the duty of making quite sure that when CIE said they were going to provide an adequate substitute service, at least they had done so and it would be proper and right that I should defend CIE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no question of there being any new problem which would justify my intervention and I am not going to create a precedent whereby Deputies from all over the House can ask for the gross revenue and the number of tickets sold on separate segments of a CIE line.  I am not going to create a precedent in a similar way that Deputies can ask for the revenue and expenditure of some particular lines of the ESB in a particular region. The same would apply to other State companies over which I and other Ministers have control and, if ever Deputy Lynch finds himself in charge of a State company, he would realise the chaos&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is time Deputy Lynch did some thinking about the Parliamentary control of State companies and the distinctions that have been made as to what constitutes day-to-day activities.  I agree that there has been a great deal of controversy about this, from the right and from the left in politics all over Europe but I take the pragmatic view on this, that we have State companies which on the whole have been very successful and there have been very few scandals associated with them.  I recommend that if the Deputy is not satisfied with my comments on the duty of a Minister in regard to a State company, he should read the Taoiseach's address to the Institute of Administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
