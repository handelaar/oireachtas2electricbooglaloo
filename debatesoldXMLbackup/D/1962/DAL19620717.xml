      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the fact that the Committee on Industrial Organisation has been set up for the purpose of making a critical appraisal of the measures that may require to be taken to adapt Irish industry to conditions of more intensive competition in home and export markets, to undertake an examination of the difficulties which may be created for particular industries and to formulate positive measures of adjustment and adaptation.</P>
      <P>The Committee's Interim Report on State Aid to be granted to Industry to adapt itself to meet Common Market conditions was published on 10th April, 1962 and, as intimated by the Minister for Finance in the course of his Budget Speech, the Government have accepted the recommendations in the Report.  In addition, as I announced on 7th July, 1962, following a recommendation of the Committee, I have increased, from one-third to one-half of the cost, the maximum amount of technical assistance grants for the improvement of productive efficiency in industry.</P>
      <P>The Committee's Survey Report on the Cotton, Linen and Rayon Industry was published on the 8th June, 1962, and a number of Survey Reports on other industries have now reached an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>I may add that I have lost no opportunity in public speeches or elsewhere of emphasising to manufacturers the urgent need for assessing their prospects in free trade conditions and for taking steps to improve their competitiveness. I am awere that a number of manufacturers have already taken such steps and they were encouraged in so doing by the official announcement made last December that any financial or fiscal inducements that might be introduced to encourage adaptation measures would have retrospective effect to 14th December last.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1926, five charges were preferred against the Garda in question, one of discreditable conduct, two of insubordinate or oppressive conduct and two of disobedience to orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be true to say that the real charge was that he displayed an excess of zeal in the execution of his duty and that because he did so, a vexatious order was given to him which invited insubordination and that the man, who fulfilled his duty properly, was punished as a result?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Justice has no function in a case of this sort, I have not entered into the matter in any way nor do I propose to do so.</P>
      <P>The general direction and control of the Garda Síochána is, in accordance with section 8 (1) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, vested in the Commissioner.  He has informed me that the position in the case is as follows:</P>
      <P>On Saturday, 26th May, the Garda in question paraded for duty at Store Street Station with sixteen other members. He was detailed by his Sergeant for traffic control duty at Nelson Pillar (West Side), and replied &ldquo;I refuse to do it&rdquo;.  The Inspector, who was present at the time, advised the Garda to take up the duty allocated to him, and that if he had any complaint to put it in writing and the matter would be enquired into.  To this, the Garda replied &ldquo;I refuse to do it&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was reported in writing to the District Superintendent on 27th May, and on his direction it was brought to the notice of the Garda on <Col N="2346" /> 28th May that he was at liberty to furnish an explanation in writing at that stage if he so desired.  The Garda declined to make any written statement.</P>
    <P>A report in the matter was made to the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Metropolitan Division, and he directed on 5th June that disciplinary charges be preferred.</P>
    <P>Five disciplinary charges were preferred in writing against the Garda on 8th June, in accordance with the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1926.  He admitted in writing, on 14th June, two charges of disobedience to orders, that is, that on 26th May he disobeyed the lawful orders of two superiors, a sergeant and an inspector. The Garda did not offer any explanation of his conduct.</P>
    <P>By written direction of the Commissioner, dated 2nd July, the Garda was informed that the Commissioner considered that the disciplinary offences which the Garda had admitted warranted his dismissal.  The Garda was also informed that, before ordering his dismissal, the Commissioner was prepared to afford him an opportunity of tendering his resignation, and that if the Garda wished to avoid dismissal he should submit his resignation within three days.  On 5th July the Garda applied for permission to resign.  His application was accepted, and his last day of service was 11th July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any previous charge against this particular Guard before the 26th May?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I have to say &ldquo;Yes, there was&rdquo;, but I want to make it clear that the action of the Commissioner with regard to this member in giving him a chance to resign was taken on compassionate and humanitarian grounds.  I am afraid the effect of that leniency by the Commissioner is being largely negatived by these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the alleged offence charged against Garda Travers is one which frequently occurs in the Force, particularly when a vexatious order is given or when any member is required to do something <Col N="2347" /> beyond the normal turn of duties, that never before in the history of the Force has such an allegation of insubordination been punished by dismissal and that prior to this punishment meted out was that of a fine or a transfer to a less attractive station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a complete misinterpretation of the situation.  The offence in this case&mdash;I have indicated it was not the first offence&mdash;was one of open defiance of an ordinary order. The punishment decided upon by the Commissioner, after full investigation by all intermediate officers and after an opportunity had been given to the Garda to give an explanation, was the normal, usual punishment for a flagrant refusal to carry out an order. There was nothing vexatious about the order.  It was a perfectly normal duty for which this Garda was detailed. The punishment, was, as I say, decided on by the Commissioner in order to be humanitarian about the matter and to give this young member of the Force a chance of starting a new career elsewhere by giving him the option to resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not invariably done?  There is a threat of punishment and an invitation to resign at the same time.  That is why I have asked these questions that the disciplinary code be modified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should at this stage point out that in the term of the last Coalition Government the Garda Representative Body approached the Minister for Justice at that time with a request that the regulations governing these matters be revised and amended. That request was on two occasions refused.  The official responsible for conveying that decision, and probably, I suspect, having a large part in the formulation of it, was the person now known as Deputy Richie Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect to the Minister, if the Minister wishes to use his powers for the purpose of propagating falsehoods, the sooner he resigns from this office the better. When will there be an end to the reign of terror in the Department of Justice, <Col N="2348" /> in the Guards and in the office of the Attorney General?  Do we have to have another Cabinet reshuffle in this country as well?</P>

      <P>All I want to ask is this.  Does the Minister not feel he has a public duty to clarify this situation and make it manifest to the country that there is no relationship between the action of the Guard in the course of his duty and the consequent disciplinary crisis resulting in his dismissal or involuntary resignation? May I ask the Minister is he <Col N="2349" /> not aware that this question is being asked all through the country and that the clarification of it is vitally necessary if serious public damage is not to be done?</P>

      <P>I have cleared up this situation as precisely as I can.  I have given Deputies full clarification of exactly what is involved.  I am reluctant to do so, but now I am forced to say that this was not the first occasion this member of the Force was involved in a disciplinary charge.  Secondly, the charge of which he was convicted on the second occasion was nothing more or less than a complete refusal to obey a lawful order by his sergeant.  Having refused to obey that order when requested to do so by his inspector, an opportunity was given to him to explain his conduct in writing by his superintendent, and that was still met by a refusal.  It was only in the very last resort, when the matter had been considered by every responsible officer up to the Commissioner, that the punishment was decided upon.  To infer or to suggest that the Garda authorities at all levels would be party to the sort of thing suggested by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Ryan is a travesty.</P>

By reason of his short service he does not qualify for pension or gratuity but is entitled to a refund of his pension contributions, which amount to £50 14s. 1d.

      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: No. 10 (Vote 43, and the Supplementary Estimate); Nos. 11, 12, 4, 13, 5, 14, 6 and 15.  If not already reached, it is proposed to interrupt business at six o'clock to take Nos. 11, 12, 4, 13, 5, 14, 6 and 15.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think it would be no harm for the Whips to meet again today.  It is necessary to make arrangements to conclude the financial business this week to permit of the Appropriation Bill being passed <Col N="2359" /> in the Seanad next week.  In connection with these arrangements, I think the programme of business for next week can be arranged also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before turning to the general subject matter of this Estimate, with which I was dealing when the House adjourned on Thursday last, I want to interpolate a comment on an incident arising during Question Time to-day.  Deputy Esmonde raised the question of the terms of the Agreement under which sugar was being exported to the United States of America.  The Minister for Agriculture replied that the terms of that Agreement are available for perusal to anyone who wants to get full details in the Library.  I asked the Minister, by way of supplementary question, <Col N="2361" /> whether it was not so that the Agreement to which he referred as being available in the Library referred to last year and could he give us the particulars of the new Agreement under which it is proposed that the United States of America should purchase 10,000 tons of sugar.  I pointed out to him that the American newspapers were full of a story that a rider had been attached to a Bill as an emergency measure, called the Honey Bee Bill, in the American Congress, one of the results of which was to provide a quota of 10,000 tons for Ireland in the overall import quota of the United States of America for sugar, and I was told the Minister for Agriculture knew nothing about it.  If he does not, it seems to me to be one of the most extraordinary things this House has ever heard because if the Minister for Agriculture of this country is to learn of the availability of a market for Irish beet sugar through discussions in the Congress of the United States and the comments thereon by American newspaper men, Dáil Éireann would appear to be in a very bad way.</P>
      <P>It is certainly a source of embarrassment to me to learn of these developments for the first time from the American newspapers and to discover that our Minister knows nothing about them and seems to care less.  I hope that before this debate concludes, he will be in a position to give us some information of the terms on which we have secured a quota of 10,000 tons of sugar of the American import programme and what, if any, corresponding obligations devolve on us.  Last year, we undertook to import 50,000 tons, I think, of coarse grain in excess of our average importations of the previous three years.  Whether any such obligation obtains in connection with the new arrangement, nobody seems to know and Dáil Éireann ought to be informed by the Minister for Agriculture as soon as may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to a fact which is only too manifest to those of us who live in rural Ireland but of which the Government's spokesman, the Minister for <Col N="2362" /> Agriculture, appears to know nothing, that is the steadily declining standard of living that is being thrust upon the farmers, with special reference to the farmers who run their own holdings, the men with 50 acres and less. Usually, when we talk of the cost of living, we associate it with employed persons and its impact upon them. What a great many Deputies and a great many members of the Government seem to forget is that 90 per cent. of the small farmers are in exactly similar circumstances to employed labourers, except that instead of working for wages, they are working for themselves.  They are self-employed because we deliberately set out to make them so.  There was a time when they were not, when they were all rent paying tenants but we abolished that system and we made them owners of land working for themselves.  This has had certain consequences, as a result of the activities of Fianna Fáil to which I want to direct the attention of the House, in a way which I do not think Deputies advert to at all.</P>
    <P>In Table 10 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> to which I have already referred, the profits from agriculture, forestry and fishing are set out for each year.  In 1957 these profits were £108.6 million. In 1958 they had fallen to £97.4 million. In 1959 they had risen to £106.5 million.  In 1960 they had come back to the figure of 1957, £108 million. This year the Minister boasts that they have increased by a further £8 million but he has quite overlooked the fact that over the period to which these figures refer there has been a drop of 17 per cent. in the value of money. The cost of living has gone up 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>That rise in the cost of living impinges just as directly on every small farmer in Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Clare, Limerick, Kerry, Cork&mdash; and many other counties in Ireland where one does not think of there being small farmers at all, like Meath and Laois-Offaly, where we ordinarily think that all the farmers are big farmers but where there are a great many small farmers too&mdash;as it <Col N="2363" /> does upon a man working for wages or a salary.</P>
    <P>This means that the £ in 1961 is worth the equivalent of about 16/2 in 1957.  That means that the profits of the agricultural industry in 1957 were £108 million.  According to the estimate in Table 10 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget 1962, the profits accruing to the farmers of the country at large are now £116 million but in fact that means the equivalent of £96.3 million as compared with £108 million in 1957.  It is astonishing to me that nobody adverts to that fact.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that in terms of real money the farmers today are receiving approximately £15 million less for their labour than they were getting five years ago.  That is the reason why the Minister for Lands is making plans to take over the derelict farms in Mayo, Monaghan, Cavan and the other counties where the bulk of the land is in the hands of the small property-owning farmers.  It is because the Government have forgotten this category of people, it is because the Government have not realised that the wage earning classes and the salaried classes got the seventh round and the eighth round of wage increases to compensate them for the rising cost of living and that these people got nothing, that a very large percentage of these people are giving up the fight, selling their land and going to England in search of work.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House urgently to the fact that that disastrous development, that effective reduction in the income of the small farmers, will not only leave considerable areas of the land derelict but will react on the towns and villages as well.  The business people in the small towns and villages in Ireland are discovering the growing flood of emigration of their customers is circumscribing and reducing their business with consequential reduction in employment and a further contribution to the tide of emigration to the United Kingdom where the industrial machine <Col N="2364" /> is still prepared to absorb a very considerable number of our people.  But the element of the population which is going is the element of which this country stands in most urgent need, and that element is the boys and girls between the ages of 18 and 25.  They are not only the most dynamic and precious element of the community but, from the purely economic viewpoint, they are the consumers, and anyone who has any experience of business in rural Ireland realises that their disappearance is playing havoc with the small towns and villages of this country, to the great detriment of the whole social structure of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>What horrifies me is the conviction that the Government themselves either do not know or do not care about what is happening to this element of our society.  I think that the most important, valuable and permanent feature not only in the economic but in the social life of this country is facing prospective destruction and that this is a great disaster for Ireland.  I believe we could take effective measures forthwith to reverse this process and I am hopeful that an effective Government could do so.  I am hopeful that we can get this Government out so that another Government can do what requires to be done.</P>
    <P>What does require to be done? What requires to be done is to expand the output of the land of Ireland and to provide our people with the means effectively to market an enormously increased output from the land.  From that point of view, I want to direct attention to an extract from the Report of the Food and Agriculture Organisation on agricultural commodities with projections for the year 1970, in which it says:</P>
    <P>While surpluses may increase, says an FAO report on Agricultural Commodities&mdash;Projections for 1970, malnutrition will remain widespread in many low-income countries during the '60s.  The report says that per caput intake of animal proteins may not exceed 10 grams per day in the Far East in 1970 against present levels of 40 grams in the European Economic <Col N="2365" /> Community and 65 grams in North America.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that it is manifest to everybody that one of the problems existing in Africa is not hunger because, in fact, in most parts of Africa there is an abundance of food, but an acute protein shortage which has resulted in widespread deficiency diseases.  That is of peculiar interest to us because if there is any country in the world fitted for the wholesale production of animal protein it is our own country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have every reason to believe that given effective marketing techniques there is an enormous potential market for animal protein and I do not believe that with the emergence of the European Economic Community and its ultimate association with the United States and other freedom loving nations of the world like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, this new association will stand idly by and let the peoples of Africa and Asia fall into the Communist grasp as a result of unrelieved poverty and distress.  That means that the resources of the EEC plus those of the Americas, will sooner or later be effectively deployed to bring within the reach of these peoples in Africa the animal protein they so need and which, according to the FAO Report, will continue to be needed for many years ahead.</P>
    <P>Our country should face that future with courageous conviction that, given reasonable means to produce, we could make a great contribution to fulfilling that need.  To bring about that contribution what must we do?  The principal source of protein production here should be in the form of meat and meat products.  We are adequately equipped to provide meat products through the immense potentialities of our grass land.  One of the most alarming features of the situation at present obtaining here is that there has been an actual decline in the number of cattle on the land.  There were 112,000 fewer cattle in this country at the last enumeration than at the previous enumeration.  I believe that can be remedied.  This decline in our cattle population may be the <Col N="2366" /> result of the efforts at eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  However, it is necessary to realise&mdash;and it was so stated to be in the original document published over the name of Mr. Whittaker, the Secretary of the Department of Finance&mdash;that in the economic expansion envisaged for this country, nothing is more important than that the cattle population should be expanded.</P>
    <P>That can be done, and it can be done largely on the basis of grass. There was a time when Fianna Fáil took the attitude that grass production was something ignoble.  They have now come round to the conclusion that it is one of the most important features of our economy.  Yet hundreds of thousands&mdash;in fact, perhaps millions&mdash;of our acres of grass are as bad as they can be.  The reason is perfectly clear&mdash;the absence of an adequate agricultural advisory service.  It has been suggested you cannot provide these agricultural advisory services any faster than the people demand them.  I want to suggest that is a completely illusory approach.</P>
    <P>The duty of an effective Minister for Agriculture is to provide such advisory services so that they will be available to the people when the people are prepared to take them. It is an odd thing to find that the very farmers who most urgently stand in need of advice are very often the farmers who are most reluctant to accept them, in the same way as it is true that the industrialists who most need advice to bring themselves into line with their requirements to meet the E.E.C. challenge are very often the very ones who will not do anything about it and whom it is most difficult to persuade to learn in order to face the new competition inherent in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I believe that we should provide without delay the advisory services in agriculture without which effective progress is impossible.  I should like to see it extended to the point where we have a trained agricultural adviser in every rural parish in Ireland, of which there are 800.  That may not be possible at the beginning but it should be our ultimate objective.  Even if we <Col N="2367" /> begin with one trained adviser to every three parishes, we would be making an immense advance towards achieving what is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any use in offering advice to people unless it is financially possible for the people in question to accept it, and act upon it. It is for that reason that we in the Fine Gael Party advocated all over the country during the past general election that, having supplied an effective agricultural advisory service, we believed the Government should make available to the small farmers credit, interest-free, of up to £1,000 for any scheme of increased production on which they were prepared to embark under the direction of, and in consultation with, the national agricultural advisory services.</P>
    <P>I believe that could be done.  If it were done it would confer immense benefits not only on the farmers concerned but on the country as a whole. In view of the fact that the Minister says he never subscribed to the view that the land rehabilitation project was not a valuable national service, I hope he will realise the measure of his own mistake in wiping out the credit facilities which were made available under Part B of that scheme.  When it was suspended, a very large number of farmers who urgently required facilities under the land rehabilitation project were denied them because the credit facilities which used to be available were no longer available.  If he does not restore it, some day we will.</P>
    <P>I believe it is an essential part of developing the agricultural industry, over and above the actual advisory and credit facilities which we have suggested, that we should put an end to the inadequate housing that obtains on so many small holdings.  We have recognised our obligation in that regard in the towns and cities, but there are hundreds, if not thousands, of small holdings where people are living in wholly inadequate housing conditions.  We take the view that steps should be taken forthwith to improve those conditions by making <Col N="2368" /> it possible for the small farmer through the Land Commission to get himself a new house and, having availed of the grants available from the Department of Local Government and the local authority, have the balance of the cost charged on his annuity to be paid off over the surviving period of the land annuity attached to his land.</P>
    <P>That scheme has the advantage of making it possible to ensure that in the building of these houses there would be adequate technical, engineering or architectural advice available to ensure that they are properly built, and, secondly, it has the advantage that the house is there as part of the holding and in the event of any subsequent transfer from the present occupier of such a title there will be no hardship on his successor to continue the payment of the annuity because in addition to the land he buys he will get a new house.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to a suggestion I made already that the milk industry, which can be described as the foundation of the livestock industry, requires to be reorganised on its supply, processing and marketing sides.  I held the view for many years, and I do not deny it, that we should preserve at any cost the small individual co-operative unit in rural Ireland.  It has great sociological advantages that the local creamery should be intimately associated with the local group of suppliers.  I think there is a great sociological advantage in that arrangement but I believe world competition has now become so acute that we cannot afford to surrender the efficient rationalisation of the industry to the sociological advantage of intimate contact between the individual co-operative unit and the actual supplier.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the whole creamery industry calls for review so that we might amalgamate a great many of the small inefficient units into large groups which would have at their disposal the maximum efficiency which maximum capitalisation and modern equipment would make possible.  If we were to do that we would discover, as has been discovered in some of the larger groupings which <Col N="2369" /> have already taken place, that the increased efficiency of the processing would make available up to 2d per gallon in the cost of handling the milk, which might very advantageously be used to pay the producer a premium on top grade milk.</P>
    <P>The plain fact is that the quality of the milk reaching many creameries is such that it is fit only for conversion into butter.  There are many other processes to which it is not susceptible owing to defects in quality.  I do not propose to weary the House with any attempt to describe the technical facets of this whole question of quality. It is sufficient to say that I believe we could get an immense improvement in the quality of milk if a premium were payable for high grade milk, and if the creamery industry had access to a growing volume of top grade milk, it would make available to an efficient creamery industry a larger and wider diversification of its end products than is available to many small creameries at present operating.</P>
    <P>I believe, furthermore, that in addition to the increased efficiency that could be brought about by these groupings of creameries, we could at the same time, without any additional capital expenditure, handle and process a far greater volume of milk than is at present being handled.  That far greater volume of milk could be produced from the same land as is at present producing it if the grass husbandry practised on the land were brought to the standards of husbandry possible in this country if proper methods are used.</P>
    <P>One of the strange and interesting things is that so far as I know our methods of growing cereal and root crops are as good and as up-to-date as those operated in any other country in the world.  It is only in respect of grass husbandry that we have fallen so disastrously behind, and the tragedy is that there is no branch of agricultural husbandry for which this country is better suited than grass production. One of the elements in our society which must bear the responsibility for that is the Fianna Fáil Party which, over the years, sought to establish that grass was the hallmark of bad farming. <Col N="2370" /> They have woken too late to the discovery that good grass is the hallmark of really good farming, but in the meantime considerable psychological damage has been done and it will take some time to correct this illusion of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we got increased the quantities of milk and could process it with no serious increase in our overheads we might produce an added margin of profit which would be a further inducement to our farmers to improve the quality of their milk or to improve the method of marketing at present employed.  I remember on one occasion being told by one of the most experienced creamery managers in this country that in the area served by his creamery an agricultural parish agent, appointed by the Department of Agriculture, was appointed.  The area he served approximated to about one-third of the creamery area in which this manager worked.  He said that in two years he saw an increase in the milk supply from that area where the parish agent was at work which, if it extended to the whole of the creamery area, would have meant an increase of 1,250,000 gallons of milk coming into that creamery and that, had that increase been effective, it would have been possible for him to pay from 1d. to 1¼d. more to the farmers because he would have been able to process that extra milk without any substantial addition to his capital costs.</P>
    <P>It is, then, in increased volume, in increased efficiency and in a diversification of end product, with effective marketing procedures, that there is unlimited scope, in my opinion, for increased milk production in this country and a corresponding increase of the agricultural income of the people.  But I do not want the House to lose sight of the fact that the Food and Agricultural Organisation prophesy that for the next ten years animal protein will be the principal deficiency in the dietary of the undeveloped nations and that one of the most desirable forms of animal protein for transfer to these areas from the temperate climates such as we inhabit is dried milk.</P>
    <P>I believe there is an almost unlimited <Col N="2371" /> market for that product, once efficient marketing procedures to distribute it are established.  Our land and our people have an almost unlimited capacity to fill that requirement.  At the same time, we shall have, as a by-product of the dairying industry or we can regard the dairying industry as a by-product of the cattle industry&mdash;whichever is the by-product and whichever is the main stem, there will result, with an increased output of milk, an increase in our cattle population.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, the prospects of the markets for live cattle and meat and meat products in the EEC&mdash; which will consist, in my confident belief, not of six but of ten after Great Britain and Ireland, Denmark and Norway join&mdash;are bright.  We shall have and continue to enjoy for veterinary reasons associated with our insular situation a preferential status on the British market where British farmers will continue to want our cattle in order to maintain their programmes of beef production.  Over and above that, we shall have access to the whole area of the ten, with the prospect of having the joint resources of the ten employed and opening up demands for animal protein in Africa and the Far East, to all of which our meat products can make a very material contribution.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have no rational reason to apprehend the absence of markets, given our concentration on the expansion of supplies of animal protein in this country.  Animal protein consists of many things &mdash; meat, milk, cattle, sheep, mutton and lamb. Nobody on the Continent of Europe eats mutton or lamb at the present time.  It is quite an unusual dish.  I do not suggest to the House that you can change the eating customs of a population like the French, the Germans or the Dutch overnight or indeed over quite a long period.</P>
    <P>However, nobody in this country has any notion of what it could mean to this country if Europe began eating lamb.  There would be opened for us a vast additional market which it would test the resources of the existing <Col N="2372" /> supplies available to supply.  I believe, in the long term, that is one of the great benefits that will accrue to us under the new Common Market dispensation but it is not one on which I wish to dwell now.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the problem of bacon.  I know that when I was in the Department of Agriculture they adverted to this but I often wonder now whether they advert to these things at all.  It appears to me now that all useful activity in the Department of Agriculture is being shed to boards outside the Department of Agriculture until the point is reached where the Minister for Agriculture feels entitled to come in here, shrug his shoulders and say: &ldquo;I have no responsibility; it is a matter for Bord Bainne, the Pigs and Bacon Commission&rdquo; or some other board which he has set up.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that the Minister for Agriculture ever has the right to come into this House and disclaim responsibility for the development of the agricultural industry of which pigs and bacon constitute so vital a part.  I want to put this point to the House.  Why is it that Danish bacon today is making 40/- a cwt. more on the British market than Irish bacon?  That represents approximately £2 a pig.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the House that the Danish farmer, as a result of superior strains of pigs, is getting, on the average, a conversion rate of 1 lb. of meat to 2.8 lbs. of feeding stuff while we are getting a conversion rate of only 1 lb. of meat to 3.2 lbs. of feeding stuff.  If that reckoning is correct, then the Danish farmer is getting £1 per pig more out of every pig he produces as a result of its superior capacity to convert feeding stuffs into meat than we are.  I should like the Minister to be able to tell me &mdash;he ought to know&mdash;whether or not it is true that the Danish factories are able to get, between bacon and offals and by-products, £1 a pig more out of every pig slaughtered than we are able to get in the factories in Ireland?  If these propositions are true, and I believe they are true, the Dane is getting £4 per pig more than our farmers get.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2373" /> Now, part of that extra amount which the Dane gets he takes in further award and part is devoted to putting him in a more competitive position on the market where he operates. These advantages are accessible to us. He gets 40/- a cwt. more for his bacon on the British market partly as a result of the superior uniformity of his product but mainly as a result of his superiority in marketing his product.</P>
    <P>The Dane considers his extra and foreign market to be his first charge on his industry as a whole.  Therefore, he is able to guarantee a constant supply of uniform product to the British market which he wants to serve. He is able to say to the wholesaler in Great Britain that if he will contract with his central marketing organisation to take 90 per cent. of his supplies from Denmark, they are prepared to give him very special concessions by way of guaranteeing that if the price goes up in any week, he will not have to pay the increase in price, whereas, if the price goes down in any week and if he has bought bacon, they will refund to him any reduction that may be made in the course of that week.</P>
    <P>I believe if we had supplies, we could operate a similar marketing system.  Our trouble is that we cannot do it over the whole of England because we have not adequate supplies, but if we took a restricted area around Liverpool or Birmingham or any other centre of population of our own choosing and really organised marketing in that area effectively so that we could guarantee every week of the year a constant supply and if, in those areas, we were able to offer terms as advantageous as the Central Marketing Organisation of Denmark offers over the whole of England, at least we should get a footing.  I believe, having done that, we could gradually expand to meet Danish competition in marketing all over England.</P>
    <P>I believe that the conversion rate of feeding stuffs into meat is a matter of progeny testing.  I set up a progeny testing station in Cork in 1958 which was opened by the present Minister for Agriculture just after I had left office and we have been talking ever since 1957 about opening a second.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2374" /> Now I am told that the second station is about to be opened at Thorndale here in Dublin.  But that was five years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I suppose if Fianna Fáil had remained in office, it would have taken us another 50 years. <i>Res ipsa loquitur.</i> I opened the first progeny-testing station.  I built it from the foundation up at Cork, as the Deputy knows, and within a week or a fortnight of the present Minister coming into office, he opened it.  He had the civility to invite me to attend the ceremony but I felt that such ceremonies should be unattended by ghosts and I did not go.  I allowed him to open it; but it was there to open.  If I became Minister in the morning&mdash;which I should much sooner do than become Taoiseach&mdash;I do not know whether the present Minister will leave any station for me to open. I hear rumours.  I evacuated Thorndale five years ago and moved out to Abbotstown.  I thought they were going to sell Thorndale and indeed they might well have done so but that is another matter.  I am told now there is to be a pig progeny testing station there in the middle of Drumcondra of all places.  That seems to be an odd place to put a pig progeny testing station but there may be reasons for it.  I think it would be better to build houses there and move out to Celbridge with the testing station.  However, it is better to have it at Drumcondra than nowhere else. We still have not got a second pig progeny testing station.</P>
      <P>The Danes are getting a conversion rate of 2.8 to 1 lb. of meat.  We are getting 3.2&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not getting that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the general average.  We are getting a general average of 1 lb. of meat for 3.2 lbs. of meal if you accept the rate of 2.8 lbs. of meal to 1 lb. of meat in Denmark. It is doubtful if either country is getting those specific figures on average but the relationship is the same.  I think <Col N="2375" /> those figures derive directly from the progeny testing stations in both countries but over the whole lot, the differential remains of about a half-pound of meal to the lb. of meat produced in favour of Denmark, with a consequent advantage of £1 per pig.</P>
      <P>It is open to us to improve marketing efficiency.  We can do it just as well as the Danes and the way to do it is to take the restricted area first until supplies expand so that we can expand to the whole of England.  It is open to us to improve the standard of our pigs by progeny testing but, as has been pointed out, we started 50 years after the Danes began and perhaps we should try to expedite the process more than the Danes did and if that involves bringing in special strains of pigs which we are satisfied are superior to any we have, I think we should do it. When I was Minister, I was extremely reluctant to do it.  I was warned by our technical staff that the dangers in atrophic rhinitis were so menacing that the game was not worth the candle and I was prepared to try to improve the situation through the medium of progeny testing.  I doubt if we can adhere to that strict rule now and I cannot but believe that it is possible under adequate quarantine arrangements to bring in new strains of pigs, if we are satisfied they are available elsewhere, better strains than we have ourselves. I do not yet despair of the possibility of getting, through adequate progeny testing, as good a strain of pigs in Ireland as there is anywhere in the world.  If we cannot get them, we must expedite the process of improving the conversion rate of foodstuffs by getting new and better strains and bringing them in under conditions that will guarantee us so far as is humanly possible against the introduction of porcine diseases.</P>
      <P>Is it true&mdash;as I believe it is&mdash;that the Danes have almost £1 per pig in hand because of their superior efficiency in manufacturing processes?  I observe in the Estimates this year substantial sums provided for the bacon factory owners to bring their factories up to reasonable standards of efficiency.  I do not think we can go on &ldquo;foostering&rdquo; as we have been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2376" /> When I was Minister for Agriculture, I made most strenuous representations to the bacon curers to modernise their premises and bring them up to the highest pitch of efficiency.  I found it extremely difficult in the majority of cases to get any effective response from them.  Some factories did rebuild from the ground up but I remember being informed of one factory where they were still slaughtering pigs on a wooden floor.  I do not know whether that still obtains but it did obtain in one considerable factory a short seven or eight years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has a duty to inform the industry that effective measures must be taken to bring their standards of efficiency at least up to those obtaining in Denmark and that whatever is necessary must be done without delay to eliminate that differential of approximately £1 per pig between our costs and those of the factories operated by our competitors. If we could do that, if we could add to the price of every pig produced in this country £4, I think we have a potential export in Great Britain for more pigs than we could ever produce and without the payment of a subsidy of a penny to anybody.</P>
    <P>The Minister has now been five or six years engaged in this operation.  I fixed the price of pigs at 245/- and 240/- seven or eight years ago and it has remained at that ever since.  On that basis, I believe pigs can be profitably produced if we could improve the conversion rate, if we could improve the marketing process.  I believe the necessity for subsidising would be removed and the thought of surplus would be eliminated from the vocabulary of our farmers.  Unless and until we can say to the creamery farmer, the livestock farmer and the pig farmer that surplus is a thing of the past, and that the more they produce, the more we will be able to sell not only to their advantage but to the advantage of the country as a whole, we will not be able to get real progress in this country.  Everything I ever tried to do as Minister for Agriculture has been designed to eliminate the concept of surplus from our agricultural production.</P>
    <P>There are some specific questions I <Col N="2377" /> want to ask the Minister.  We have invested an immense sum of money in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in this country.  All I want to say about that is that once the British Government adopted that scheme, there was no course open to us but to adopt it and operate it also.  That scheme and its effectiveness depend on everybody who is involved in it obeying the law and the law in regard to that scheme consists of a series of regulations designed to ensure that any certificate given by our Department of Agriculture is beyond question. Anybody who does anything to invalidate the undoubted veracity of a certificate issued by our Department of Agriculture or representations made by that Department is a public enemy.</P>
    <P>I want to be reassured by the Minister that anybody discovered in such a transgression will be prosecuted to the limit of the law.  I hope that before this debate concludes there will be such a reassurance forthcoming from the Minister as a notice to everybody that, having had ample time from 1954, eight years, to accustom themselves to the obligations of this scheme, the necessity for which is imposed upon us whatever our individual thoughts may be with the requirements of the particular export market we have, the time has now come when we must realise that everybody must conform to it.  All of us have had the experience of inconvenience as a result of it.  It is exasperating at times but we have got to accept it and conform to its requirements.  I have had the experience myself; I have been exasperated by it but it can happen to anybody and there is nothing you can do about it except to take advantage of the scheme in anticipation of the day when we will be released from its restrictions, when T.B. has been finally eliminated.</P>
    <P>There is a much heavier obligation on those moving cattle to realise the difficulties of enforcing the regulations unless there is a large measure of co-operation on their part.  There is an exceptional obligation on those associated with the export of cattle to be more vigilant than the Department itself to ensure that the regulations are <Col N="2378" /> obeyed.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that with regard to people charged with the movement of cattle, and especially those charged with the export of cattle, there will be no relaxation or concession made to anyone who withholds the full measure of co-operation that the Department of Agriculture is entitled to expect from them not to think of those who might try to avoid the regulations.</P>
    <P>There is one detailed inquiry I want to make.  We have 14-day tested cattle. We have attested cattle.  The time is coming when the 14-day tested cattle will have no significance in our export trade and when the only cattle accepted for export will be attested cattle.  Can we not provide some obviously coloured and marked ear tag for attested cattle?  When cattle are being put on the boat, there is bound to be a great deal of confusion, hurry and bustle at the docks and surely it would be well if there were some outstanding feature about the ear tag on a beast which would indicate that he is an attested beast rather than make it dependent on an individual scrutiny of the obscure marking on each tag?</P>
    <P>If we could provide a tag attached to a calf, yearling or mature beast which would be of a special identifiable colour, surely it would not be beyond the ingenuity of man to devise such a tag which could not be removed from the beast's ear without making it impossible to put it on the ear of another beast?  If that were done, Dáil Éireann would be able to suggest penalties appropriate to the crime of forgery for anyone who sought to forge such tags or who sought to transfer them from the ear of one animal to another.</P>
    <P>The matter is of such vital concern to the country that efforts should be made to find an ear tag of distinctive colour, an ear tag that could not be removed from the ear of the beast without destroying it, and penalties analogous to those prescribed for the crime of forgery should be prescribed for anyone who attempted to forge or misuse such ear tags.  I do not want to say any more on that matter, but I know the Minister will want to reassure <Col N="2379" /> the House in regard to the issues I have raised so that they need not be adverted to hereafter, once we are certain that the necessary precautions have been taken.</P>
    <P>There is a rumour circulating in the country consequent on some kind of a production report relating to the artificial fertiliser industry that the importation of basic slag will be prohibited. I should like an assurance that no such restriction is contemplated. Basic slag is a source of phosphate which is a very valuable one, because it is a great check on anyone attempting to fix an excessive price for phosphates.  For reasons best known to themselves, the Government have re-imposed the 20 per cent. duty on superphosphate. When we were in office, we took off that duty.  It is true that the Government have provided a subsidy for the superphosphate.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to study the Appropriation Accounts as examined by the last Committee on Public Accounts where it transpired that as a result of a slight book-keeping error, the superphosphate industry was paid £90,000 more than they were entitled to, to compensate them, and which they had to refund.  It shows you how difficult it is to keep track of the price of super, if no such accounts need be kept, as is the case at present as there are no imports as a result of the 20 per cent. tariff Fianna Fáil imposed.  If anyone wants further particulars about that, I refer him to the Report of the Committee on Public Accounts of last year, where he will read the whole story.  I should like this reassurance from the Minister for Agriculture that there is no question of interfering with basic slag imports which are of very great importance and of incalculable value, especially for grassland fertilisation.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of correspondence and commentary in the newspapers about the nitrogenous fertiliser factory the Government propose to have set up.  There are two questions in this regard that I should like to put to the Minister.  I know that when I was Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="2380" /> this whole problem was one in which the voice of the Minister for Agriculture carried some weight.  I want to ask the Minister is it or is it not true that An Foras Talúntais, the Agricultural Institute, maintain as a result of experimental work they have done that it is evident that ammonium nitrate is a very much more suitable nitrogenous fertiliser, especially for grassland, than any other, and if that is so, is it true that the proposed factory will not be able to produce ammonium nitrate and that it does not intend to produce it?</P>
    <P>What is the use of having an Agricultural Institute which recommends ammonium nitrate, if we are to restrict the farmer to some other form of nitrogenous fertiliser which is not ammonium nitrate?  Secondly, can the Minister give the farmers a guarantee that the fertiliser produced will be available to them at as cheap a price as they are getting it at present?  If he cannot, I want Deputies to wake up to the fact that they may assess any extra cost in the nitrogen at what would correspond to one cwt. per acre of the agricultural land of Ireland.  We do not use nearly sufficient nitrogen but if this nitrogen is to cost one shilling a cwt., or two shillings a cwt., more than it would be available from other sources, you may reckon it will cost the country 1,200,000 shillings, or 2,400,000 shillings, according to whether it is one shilling or two shillings, every year for all time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture ought to be able to assure us on these matters before the conclusion of this debate. We have moved to refer back this Vote because we believe the present administration is hopelessly incompetent.  We believe the Government of which the Minister is a member have no appreciation or understanding of the urgency which presses on us in equipping the agricultural industry to meet the conditions of the European Economic Community and the wider international arrangements that I believe will inevitably ensue therefrom.  We propose to vote against this Estimate because we believe the present Minister is incompetent or indifferent, one of which is bad and the other worse.  We <Col N="2381" /> believe the future holds great prospects for the agricultural industry as a whole. We believe the small farmers can make a great contribution to the future of this country if they are given the opportunity of earning a decent living on their own holdings.  We believe a Government who have sat idly by as the income of every other section of the community has been substantially increased while the real income of the farmers has been substantially reduced over the past five years is either mad or bad, and possibly both.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, I believe the only satisfactory solution for the problems confronting the country and the agricultural industry in particular is that the Government should go out of office.  I hope that will happen soon but <i>ad interim</i> I can only hope and pray that certain indispensable and vitally urgent measures may be taken so that we may not have in respect of the requirements of the agricultural industry the 40 years' delay to which Deputy Moher so feelingly referred when commenting on the fact that prior to the introduction of the progeny testing scheme by the inter-Party Government, nothing had been done in this regard by the Fianna Fáil Party who had been 20 years in office prior to our election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The country, the farmers and the farmers' sons have had last week to consider the Minister's contribution when introducing his Estimate.  He introduced it on a cheerful note, not cheerful in relation to the future but rather boastfully talking about what had happened during the year.  I know from my contacts with many of these farmers and their sons and with the people that he just has not got it across.  These people do not accept that for them last year was a good year.  They do not accept the line that the Minister gives that it was a year of success.  They do accept that they had smaller incomes and that it was a year in which they felt they were not getting the leadership which is so necessary if the agricultural industry is to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quote from page 2 of the Minister's <Col N="2382" /> speech, the circulated version, which says:</P>
    <P>Despite some difficulties brought about by unfavourable weather in the latter part of the harvest season last year, and in face of obstacles on external markets, our agricultural industry can look back on a year of striking progress, a year in which new records were achieved in production and exports.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a good choice of words and when he talks about exports, he does not tell us about the reduction in the number of cattle. When he talks about production, his figures are again pretty well selected. I should like to give him one or two statistics in which he may be interested. If you take the cost of living in relation to base 100 for 1953, then in mid-February, 1962, that figure was 123.3, an increase of 23.3 per cent.  If you take agricultural prices over the same period the figures quoted in this book of tables, &ldquo;<i>Economic Statistics,</i> issued prior to the Budget, 1962,&rdquo; then in relation to base 100 for agricultural prices in 1953, the figure was 96.9 last August or a drop of four per cent.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister everything and tell him, as he knows himself, that the latest figure circulated for last month, June, 1962, is 102.  Let us call the average 100.  We find that while the agricultural community who are, indeed, the most important section, have had to pay 23.3 per cent. more for what they bought, they accepted the same money for what they sold. Even in regard to the miserable pittance which the farm labourer in Ireland enjoys today&mdash;of course, &ldquo;enjoys&rdquo; is not the right word for it &mdash;from the 1953 level, the increase up to October, 1961, was 42 per cent. Yet everybody here knows that the farm labourer is expected to bring up his children and maintain his wife on that income.  In fact, it is a mere pittance restricted by the low level of income of his employer and the failure of the income of his employer to increase with the income of the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>This Estimate could have been used by the Minister to inform us as to <Col N="2383" /> what is coming, to propose a policy in relation to what appears to be our inevitable entry into the Common Market and to lead the agricultural community.  Instead of that, it was used to fiddle with figures, to extract figures, to leave out figures and to produce statistics to show, while still untrue, that there were improvements in the agricultural economy last year.</P>
    <P>The Irish farmer is getting a bit fed up with looking in through the window with his nose against the pane. During the past year, he did something about it: he extracted from the Government some £2½ millions by agitation for relief in his rates.  An Irish farmer does not live like a businessman on the basis of his balance sheet from year to year.  His rotation of several years means that his is a longer period of accounting. He is one of the few people still left in the world who, when times are really bad, can live on his own fat.</P>
    <P>My measuring stick for whether or not the farmer is well off is the number of cattle he maintains on his lands.  I do not believe that during the past year, notwithstanding the fact that there were many sales because of reactors in herds, the farmer was tempted by very high prices for all the mature cattle on our lands.  There are now 112,000 fewer, if you take the January figures, than there were in the corresponding month the previous year.  Let us take a computation quoted in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of Saturday, 7th July, which is based on the exports since then.  I take it that their figure is reasonably accurate for the fewer cattle on the land on that date.  The figure is 156,000.  That indicates to me that the farmer is to some extent at least living on his own fat.  Those were not the figures which the Minister emphasised in his contribution to the debate.  The figure he emphasised was the increase in some measure in the number of milch cows and heifers in-calf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not the basic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the basic, yes, but the basic does not prove everything. The basic needs to be moved <Col N="2384" /> up to the level at which the depletion by the sales off the land will be completely arrested and we will be going up and not going down as we are at the moment.  If Deputy Moher wishes to discuss with me the basic, I have no objection at all to discussing it with him.  Before dealing with that, might I refer to a question which I addressed to the Minister on Thursday, 5th July, in relation to the average number of heifers being mated.  In reply to that question, the Minister gives some information which he was not asked for at all.  Let me quote from column 1717 of Volume 196, No. 10 of 5th July:</P>
      <P>Mr. Smith: The number of cows in January, 1962, was actually a post-War record, despite operations under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme.</P>
      <P>That, in fact, is incorrect.  The number of cows in January, 1962, according to the Livestock Enumeration of that date, was 1,242,200.  The number of cows, according to the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for the corresponding month in 1958, was 1,260,400.  That is merely a correction which is no great argument in itself.  It just shows what Ministers will try to get away with when they want to prove things.  From 1961 to 1962, taking the month of January as the comparison, there was an increase in the number of milch cows of 4,800, an increase in the number of heifers in-calf of 6,300 and a normal decrease, which we must expect, in the number of bulls, of 800.  There was a decrease in the numbers of other cattle.  A selling-off, which was far in excess of what the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme could do, resulted in a reduction of 122,300 in the numbers of other cattle on the land.  Therefore, we must take it that there was a serious reduction in the number of cattle on the land.</P>
      <P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, that was a reduction far greater than anything which shows signs of being reproduced by the basic number of heifers in calf&mdash; and the number of milch cows referred <Col N="2385" /> to by Deputy Moher.  The Government in 1958 laid before each House of the Oireachtas their <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> Let me quote from paragraph 26 on Page 15:</P>
      <P>The number of store cattle has increased considerably because of the great improvement in the survival rate of young cattle, but any further substantial increase in cattle numbers can be achieved only by means of an increase in the number of cows.  The objective of policy will be to increase cow numbers progressively to at least 1,500,000 by 1964.</P>
      <P>Let us examine what has happened. Let us not take any awkward dates but let us take the years by which the Government bound themselves. In 1958, there were 1,260,400 milch cows on the land.  Today there are 18,200 fewer.  In 1958, there were 130,200 in-calf heifers.  In 1962&mdash;this is the only bright spot&mdash;there are 197,100, an increase of 66,900.  When we subtract the decrease in the number of cows, that gives us a net figure of 37,800 over four years or 9,675 per year.  In one year up to January, 1962, we have had a decrease in other cattle of 112,000.  Up to the present, if we take the figures in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i>, there has been a total decrease in the number of cattle from 1958 to 1962 of 337,100.</P>
      <P>The Government have failed to follow the path they laid for themselves. It is in cattle numbers we will get the increase in production necessary to carry us through.  I thought the Minister might have availed of this Estimate to announce some new measures.  I thought he might have said: &ldquo;This situation is difficult.  We have the Bovine TB Scheme and the trouble with reactors.  I ask the farmers, as my predecessor did, to keep seven cows instead of five or 14 cows instead of ten.  I ask them to mate their heifers as they come forward.&rdquo;  But, instead, the Minister used this opportunity to say that everything in the garden is lovely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proof that it is not is everywhere. Since the Minister made this speech last week, every farmer and <Col N="2386" /> farmer's son will tell you he is not satisfied that everything is all right, that last year was a record year, but he is convinced that nothing is being done.  There was a suggestion from this side some months ago that a subsidy on calves might possibly be considered.  We have not got all the information here and cannot readily get it, so I am not suggesting that that would be a positive answer, but it is something that might be considered by the Minister.  Another matter he might consider&mdash;it would be very easy to operate this through the Bovine TB Scheme&mdash;is a subsidy on the mating of heifers for the first time. The number of heifers coming forward is about 500,000 a year.  We are retaining for breeding purposes an average of less than two out of every five, even if last year's high figures are maintained.  At the same time, over the past three years there has been a reduction of 337,000 in the number of cattle on the land, due, as I said, to the farmer having to live off his own fat.  The Minister spoke for an hour and did not advert to that fact or did not suggest that something should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one requires further verification of the policy adopted by the Government of increasing cattle stocks, the path they laid out for themselves, one has only to refer to the Grey Book entitled <i>Economic Development,</i> page 211, paragraph 17, where it is stated:</P>
      <P>It is vital to secure a substantial increase in cattle output.  This involves an increase in breeding stocks, particularly in beef areas.</P>
      <P>We have got some little increase in breeding stocks, depleted many times in its potential by the vast decrease in the number of other cattle on the land. We have had no indication from the Minister that he regards this as of any interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By 1965, the expected deficiency of beef in the EEC countries will be 380,000 tons per annum.  Young, fat <Col N="2387" /> cattle will be needed for that market. That will mean an even faster depletion of stocks by killing.  That will require an acceleration of breeding stocks at a rate above and certainly not below that set by the Government in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> in 1958.</P>
    <P>The Government are hoist with their own petard.  They have failed to jump the fence they set themselves.  They have not even indicated what they are going to do about it, but have merely said that last year was a wonderful year.  The Minister has not got it across to the farmers that last year was such.  That is where he will fail.  He has no hope of getting that across to the farmers, either now or in the future, if he does not advert to what is not going so well in our agricultural economy.  Admit it.  Say, if you like, it is not your fault, but indicate what you want the farmers to do about it and what you yourself will do.</P>
    <P>The increase in pigs is satisfactory. I note in the same issue of the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> that the Castlebar Bacon Company are not having a good time financially or otherwise because of the small number of pigs in the West.  I believe that the Minister for Lands who introduced Scéim na Muc, did not sufficiently organise that scheme to make it worth while.  I intend to refer later in this regard to the large fattening centres which are doing such good work in the north of Ireland.  Our sheep trade is satisfactory. There is a reason why the numbers of sheep on the land have increased.  Every farmer knows you can stock an acre with sheep on less money than you can stock it with cattle.  But there is a limit to the numbers of sheep you can feed unless you go in for intensive sheep farming and, if this is not done in a very clinical way, it will not succeed.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that sheep farming is doing well, but it indicates also that there is a lack of capital, because farmers do not like land to get too tired of sheep.  At the moment the increase in sheep numbers is due to the fact that a great many farmers could not <Col N="2388" /> stock their land with cattle.  The trend is not general, but I can give individual instances of even large farmers who have virtually nothing on their lands but sheep, for the very good reason, and this is particularly true in the case of mountain ewes, that one can stock one's land with much less capital if one stocks with sheep.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, there is a great opportunity on the Continental market for both lamb and mutton.  As he also pointed out, it is true to say that at the moment Continentals do not eat mutton and lamb, but, as I listened to him, I was thinking of the quota for lamb we enjoy with France.  The last I heard of it was an increased figure from £600,000 by something like 25 per cent.  I understand that Irish lamb was making as much as 11/- per lb. in the Paris butcher shops.  When we get to the end of the quota, we cannot, of course, send any more.  When the Common Market comes, even though the ordinary Continental does not eat lamb, there is no doubt that there will be a considerable market for both our lamb and our mutton.  That will be all to the good.  I have never had the opportunity of eating lamb anywhere on the Continent except in Italy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ate lamb in Italy last Easter.  I can assure the House it is of very low quality indeed.  I went so far as to visit the butchers to look at it.  By our standards, it is more like goat than lamb.  I believe we have a very big potential here.  As the Leader of the Opposition put it, this is a trade that must develop.  I suppose the opportunities we hope for from the Economic Community will start, in great part, with Britain when she joins and we inevitably join with her.  At the same time, it is good to know that the market is there if we produce more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to advert to the production of cereals.  I have entire faith in the future profitability of cereal production, particularly if we enter the Common Market.  Cereal production has been to a certain extent <Col N="2389" /> a rather vexed question for a number of years.  The first fundamental is that the plough must go round the farm.  If you want to have good grass, at least where you have arable land, the production of cereals tends to increase the output from every acre.  There is no doubt about the fact that good land will produce, from new leas either in ensilage, hay or grass, whatever medium you like, as much food for livestock as double the acreage left unploughed.  That means that, if we want to have good farming on our good land, the acreage of tillage must not decrease but must, if anything, increase slightly.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, too, that there is a vast investment by the Irish farmer for several years in tillage.  The machinery is there; the land is there. The farmer has channelled his production in that way.  To disrupt it would be very mistaken.  I know it can be said that in many cases there has been over-mechanisation.  That is true in the case of farmers with restricted acreages.  Again, one must remember back to the days of the emergency when we were very glad to have our Irish wheat and the Irish wheat farmer was a patriot by nature of his calling. While all that may be historical to-day and have no bearing on the economic issues of the moment, it must not be forgotten.  I regard it as the frame around the picture of cereal production at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out the excellence of Irish wheat, barley and oats in a normal year.  There have been sequences of wet harvests, almost two out of three, over the past seven or eight years and it has been suggested that Irish wheat cannot be grown successfully. It has been suggested that we should import all our oats.  It has been suggested that Irish barley is a bit of a poor relation.  I do not subscribe to that view at all.  Not so long ago, I was speaking to a miller.  He said that Irish wheat, while a soft wheat, and bearing no relation at all to hard Manitoba or the imported hards used in the grist, was probably the best European wheat, with the exception of the wheat produced in a very wet harvesting season.  It is true <Col N="2390" /> that in most seasons we will have as good soft wheat as any of the Continental countries.  When we enter the Common Market, I believe things will not be so bad at all.  Arrangements have been made for the marketing of wheat, barley and oats.  I will quote from the document laid before both Houses on 28th June, 1962, in relation to developments subsequent to the issue of the White Paper.  At page 23, paragraph 41, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The intervention authorities&mdash;that is the bodies responsible for supporting market prices&mdash;are obliged to purchase at the intervention price any domestic grain offered by producers.</P>
    <P>I take it from that that all our grain will be taken up.  At paragraph 42 of the same publication, there are the upper and lower intervention limits at which the intervention authorities will be obliged to intervene.  For the purpose of my computations, I have taken the lowest levels, my idea being to produce, if possible, the worst situation that could result.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with wheat first. I refer to that which is fit for milling. Millable wheat is something we must just face up to in the light of whatever are the quality standards.  If one looks at page 24 of the publication to which I have referred, one finds that, at the wholesale marketing stage, wheat would range per long ton of 2,240 lbs., from £43 3s. to £32 9s.  Let us take a look at the figure of £32 9s.  Seeing that the prices quoted are at the wholesale marketing stage I have taken the normal commissions paid for the services that would produce that wheat at the wholesale marketing stage, dried, to the normal figure here of less than 15 per cent. moisture, and I find these commissions would amount to £2 12s. I have then taken what I think is a very severe kiln-drying loss of ten per cent., which amounts to £2 19s. 9d., leaving the farmer, for wheat delivered to the door of whoever produces it at the wholesale marketing stage, a figure of £26 17s. 3d. or £3 7s. 2d. per barrel.</P>
    <P>The upper limit is £10 per ton or 25/- per barrel more.  Therefore if one takes the price of wheat at around <Col N="2391" /> 67/2d. per barrel with hardly any chance of moving up to the upper limit the situation is not that grim.  In fact, while one would like not to suggest it at this stage, if there were a surplus of Irish wheat here it might well be that it could be exported to another European Economic Community country who would have a deficiency.  I believe the situation will now change to what fundamentally it always should have been, that when these measures come into being it will pay the miller in the European Economic Community to use more European wheat.  There will be a flat price to producers all over the Community affected by surpluses in each individual country but at the same time there is provision for a bulk levy on imports from abroad including hard Manitoba.  Therefore the miller who can produce satisfactory flour with more European wheat will have cheaper flour, and for the first time the incentive will be to use more Irish wheat, more English wheat, more French wheat.  I do not know what the result will be but reducing it to the language of the pitch and toss school, let us prognosticate on &ldquo;the bob as it is set up&rdquo;.  As I see the setting up of the market for cereals, things are not bad at all and anybody who has any idea that wheat growing will vanish had better re-think.</P>
    <P>In relation to barley we can play two tunes.  Irish barley for malting has one quite extraordinary virtue, it always analyses much better than it looks.  In fact the analyses of Irish malting barleys are far better, when you compare them visually with the barleys from England, than you would expect.  Irish malting barleys range in nitrogen content from 1.4 to, in a bad season, 1.6.  That is quite sufficient to meet any standards in Europe.  There are grave difficulties in our way before we shall be in a position to market it at the price that will obtain for malting barley in Europe.  First of all, it is something that has to be judged visually at the intake points as the production of reliable nitrogen figures quickly is only in its infancy.</P>
    <P>In this respect the laboratory is not of great value to us as yet.  Therefore <Col N="2392" /> at intake points whether the buyers are grain merchants, whether they are millers who might buy barley and export it if they can get a better price than by milling it themselves, or whoever they are, there must be trained people standing at these points and doing as buyers and maltsters do, principally related to the firm of Messrs.  Arthur Guinness Son &amp; Company, visually examine and set aside 1,000 or 2,000 tons of it for shipment at less than 1.5 or 1.6 nitrogen content or whatever is the maximum.  That is something the farmer cannot be expected to do.  He can only produce the barley and tender it.  He will have a good idea whether or not he is getting the rough end of the stick but there must be the expert people who can judge it.  Through the South of Ireland buyers for Guinness's Brewery and through such companies as Irish Malt Exports Ltd. that has already been done.</P>
    <P>A matter that was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Economic Community, was an arrangement whereby through a glorious fiddle the West German Government succeeded in paying their own farmers 85/- a barrel for barley and exacting a levy at a colossal figure per ton on imports knowing they had a vast market for beer, being a beer-drinking nation with a huge population which would need barley, and knowing at the same time that if they allowed their brewers to pay a lesser sum for imports and allowed higher prices to their German farmers they were keeping their own voters happy.  I do not know whether that situation has as yet been rectified but it was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Community about twelve months ago. I hope that when we are all in the Community the position will be that even a portion of that vast market of German beer drinkers will be open to us.  I do not say it will be an easy thing but if Irish exporters can send out loads of malt from this country manufactured from Irish barley, pay two or three shillings more than the feeding price while at the same time having to pay huge levies in each of these European countries they will be able to do a lot better, and so will <Col N="2393" /> other people.  I believe the market for barley for malting, while not jumping spectacularly, will grow from a very small figure to a very large one so that, as in the case of the production of mutton and lamb, a great opportunity will be presented to us as soon as we are within the European Economic Community which I hope personally will be as soon as is humanly possible.</P>
    <P>If one were to take on the same basis as that for wheat, the wheat commissions mentioned in the Wheat Order over the years, the minimum price for barleys, taking the same kiln-drying losses I took previously, one could have a figure payable to the farmer of £21 5s. 8d., that is, about 42/-.  However, I have not the slightest doubt but that, when you take the malting barley prospects, home production prospects and the fact that on millet, or sorghum, on barleys and everything else from outside the European Economic Community there will be a bulk levy to help the producers, barleys will never reach that low level.</P>
    <P>I do not say I am sure about wheat, but I am quite certain about barley. At present, barley is not being imported to carry the feeders over until next harvest because it is too dear, but millet instead.  On the world market the situation is changing.  The vast surpluses that were lying in disused ships and storehouses in America are being to some extent depleted and while there is no evidence of their disappearing altogether, at the same time, the market on imports from the other Continent is hardening.  In the case of vegetable proteins, you are getting a rising market which will not be so good for the next ten to 12 months for our pig or poultry production but indicates that serious grain production inside the EEC will be possible and at the same time will increase the production from young leas as distinct from our old leas.  This displays the wisdom of the adage: &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The market for barley here for feeding must be seriously examined. At the moment we are importing to carry us over until the following <Col N="2394" /> harvest, thousands of tons of millet and maize&mdash;in fact I would say tens of thousands of tons.  I believe that when the external levy follows and when pigs and poultry are produced within the EEC countries from grain also produced within, there will be an extra market here for us for at least £5,000,000 worth of feeding barley every year.  Nobody wants to see ships arriving here with cargoes of maize and millet which are not as good feed as our own barley.  While our arrangements here for handling malting barley are adequate, they are not quite so adequate for handling wheat and I think the arrangements for handling feeding barley are not as good as they should be.</P>
    <P>The Grain Storage Loans Act, 1951, is responsible for all the large new grain installations we see all over the country where drying is speeded up during short harvests.  The Leader of the Opposition was responsible for that, but it has been wound up to the extent that no more money is being voted for it.  It could be reopened with profit.  It can never be reopened again at the interest rate of a sinking fund of 35 years, at 4¾ per cent.  These large installations are available in the midlands, at Ardee and elsewhere throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should like now to mention the arrangements, to which the Minister has given his blessing, for the judgment of wheat next harvest.  I welcome any situation in which consultation and talks can settle difficulties, and this is such a situation.  The position is that you have the Hagberg falling-number test and a colour standard test.  The Hagberg falling-number test is the only test you can use quickly in the field.  The practice is to have the test carried out twice so that any difficulties that arise can be rectified.  The colour standard test does indicate the probable colour of the flour you will get.</P>
    <P>I am not happy, however, on some aspects of the scheme.  In my area, for instance, we have a large acreage of winter wheat and if you had the entire spring crop standing safely and got a bit of foggy weather at the end of August and consequently some <Col N="2395" /> sprouting of winter wheat, there would be hardship under the Hagberg test where you might have a rejection of 90 per cent. of the winter crop, while the main crop would still be standing safely.  There does not seem to be any good reason why there should not be a segregation as the 5 per cent. or so of winter wheat which might have a slightly higher maltose as a result of sprouting, could be included without harming the flour.</P>
    <P>If one reads the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> for July 15th last, one will see that I made a case in an interview and Mr. McDonagh of the flour millers made it quite clear, not in reply to me, that rigid standards were imposed and if they were interfered with, it was a case for the Government and the Minister. I, of course, do not hold that there is any necessity for this supreme rigidity because I believe that, by segregation, it is possible to set aside this wheat and use it for flour milling.  I hope the Minister will consider this point and will let us know what his approach to it would be.</P>
    <P>The question of agricultural investment is one which has been exercising our minds.  One must remember that over the years the farmers have always been in the forefront in the battles. Every Irish trouble until 1916 was a land war.  In pointing that out, I do not, of course, try to take away from the merits of 1916 and our previous efforts at independence.  The feeling is there among our farmers that they must have something in the sock or they will go hungry in the future.  Small farmers, particularly, have very little faith in financial institutions.  This lack of faith can be shown up very vividly by comparing the pattern here with that in Britain, particularly in Scotland. Here, if a farmer goes out to buy a farm for his son, he has about two-thirds of the purchase money to put down.  Say the price is £3,000&mdash; he has £2,000 and he goes to the bank and gets a loan for the other £1,000.  On the new farm, the maximum amount is tilled in the first year, not with a view to future proper rotation but for a upment of the outlay.  From <Col N="2396" /> there it takes this young man perhaps half his lifetime to get to the stage where, through proper rotation, he is getting a full return from the land.</P>
    <P>In Scotland, where the land is still leased by the landlord, the landlords have largely become rent collectors and 6d. in the £ is as much as they have.  The method devised to assess whether or not a man should get a farm is: (1) is he personally all right and (2) has he as much money as the farm is worth so that he can invest in the farm properly?  How we will get that situation here is something that will not be solved today or tomorrow.</P>
    <P>My honest opinion is that it is just as difficult to invest in the right way as it is to get the money.  I laud and welcome the Agricultural Credit Bill which expanded the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation but I think there are other things to be done.  There has been a suggestion from this side of the House that, for specified purposes which would be indicated by the agricultural instructor in the area, and approved of by the agency, or the Department, or the Agricultural Credit Corporation, interest free loans of £1,000 should be made available.  That means that the man would have to repay the principal.</P>
    <P>Under the present rate of repayments to the Agricultural Credit Corporation&mdash;which is one that comes to mind&mdash;if you borrow £100 and repay it over 15 years, your repayment is £10 1s. 8d. annually.  In other words, if you have a 15 year borrowing period, your position is that you repay 150 per cent.  If interest free loans were available for specified purposes, or for increased production, there is no doubt that there would be more applications for them and a greater willingness on the part of farmers to take them.  That is an integration of the advisory services and practical application which will get us somewhere.</P>
    <P>It may be said that that is a radical approach, that it is something that could not happen, that it is beyond us.  Let us examine what has happened. About a month ago, Deputy Sweetman in reply to a question was <Col N="2397" /> given a long list of well-to-do hoteliers &mdash;and more luck to them; some of them are friends of my own&mdash;who got loans at half interest rates for 15 years.  They took those loans and built new bedrooms or new hotels.  I do not see why we cannot do the same thing for farmers, perhaps in a small way initially.</P>
    <P>I also have an idea which the Minister might consider.  If farmers wish to substitute by choice the interest rate on the loans for their grants for farm buildings, they should be allowed to do so.  In other words, if a farmer felt that the unit he was getting the grant on and the maximum loan were too small, thereby in relation to the capital he had, fixing the size of the unit he could build, and if he felt it would be better if he could avail of a loan and devote the grant to the repayment of interest and let him pay only the principal, we would be getting somewhere.  I have worked out some computations and I believe this is practicable, and one of the means by which we could increase production.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the west of Ireland.  I suppose we must admit in many areas in the west of Ireland the utter impossibility of living directly from the land.  There must be an industry in the farmyard.  They must have pigs&mdash;although the Castlebar Bacon Factory cannot get enough&mdash; and poultry.  While the units are small, there is the advantage that the families are numerous.  If there were a proper advisory service to co-ordinate the production of these people, you could produce a situation in which all these small units could organise and contribute to production, and have a large amount which could be marketed properly.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to explain but there is one way in which Scéim na Muc could be extended by the Minister for Lands. If anyone goes to the residence of Mr. H. Jordan outside Lurgan, in the north of Ireland, he will find there 10,000 pigs being fattened in high temperature houses, a method with which some people agree and some do not.  Those pigs are bought in.  None of them is born on the farm.  He has a better <Col N="2398" /> price than we have but the Common Market is coming.</P>
    <P>I believe that large-scale experimental fattening houses should be set up in the west of Ireland.  Sows should be given to farmers for specialised production of bonhams, with a minimum price taking into consideration bonham weight and age.  They could take part in the production of perhaps 10,000 pigs.  These people live down long lanes and they have to worry about the way the market moves, about whether or not they get Grade A or Grade B, and they have to get the feed to their places.  A couple of sows do not take the same sort of specialised management in the last weeks of feeding as fat pigs, but they do take specialised attention at the time of farrowing which the man with time on his hands could give.</P>
    <P>If one were to go a little further in the north, to Mr. Brian McGuckian's at Cloughmills, one would find 6,000 or 7,000 pigs which are born on the farm.  Perfect methods of feeding.  In an area where there is a large population, it is possible to have families with three or four sows here and one or two sows there over an area of ten miles.  The Governmental fattening houses could do the rest and put up the capital because the feeding costs money.  They could carry the pigs to a certain stage and then market them.  I cannot see why that cannot be done at least in an experimental way.  Of course, it is only by the parish unit, by integration of the advisory service with the actual application of effort, that you will get any sort of move forward.</P>
    <P>Milk and milk products have been discussed at great length.  Quite frankly, having watched the perambulations of the Minister over the past year or so, I wonder do Fianna Fáil want an increase in milk production.  I subscribe entirely to the view that a cow must give milk and a calf to pay.  If we are to face up to the future, the only way in which we can get increased breeding stocks is by giving the dairy farmer some sort of incentive also.  It is no harm to study the prices of milk in the member States of the European Economic Community and the four <Col N="2399" /> countries which have made application for membership.  I quote from the paper produced by Mr. Crotty for the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association. The prices are ex-farm prices or delivered to dairies.  All these prices include skim milk at whatever the local valuations are.  In Norway, the farmer receives 3/0½; in the United Kingdom 2/10½; in Italy 2/7; in the Netherlands 2/6½; in Germany 2/4; in Denmark 2/3; in Belgium and Luxembourg 2/3; in France 2/1½, and in Ireland the farmer gets 1/9½, including the value of the skim.</P>
    <P>Now we are heading for the EEC. As it stands, the Community will have a surplus of 6 per cent. of milk products. Taking the four countries, including Ireland, that have applied for membership, that surplus is reduced to 4½ per cent.  It is not a very big surplus.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition mentioned, for instance, the market in Africa which is capable of development. I suggest that, just like other markets that are ready to be developed, it will take time: it will not happen overnight.  There is no reason at all why we should not go forward with resolution and with faith in the future on the basis that if we enter the Community which has a population of 230,000,000 and there is a 4½ per cent. surplus of milk products, things will not be so bad that the bottom will fall out of the price of milk.  Any reasonable man who had not the wind up completely would be quite certain that the bottom would not fall out of the price of milk.  I honestly believe that while, so far, no arrangement has been made by the EEC for milk and milk products, such as has been made for cereals, the arrangement that will be made must fall into something the same sort of pattern as I have tried to outline&mdash;for cereals&mdash;and which can be found in the White Paper issued by the Government on 28th June, 1962.</P>
    <P>Therefore what we should be doing is telling the farmers &mdash; as they were told from the opposite benches when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Agriculture &mdash; that they <Col N="2400" /> should keep seven cows where they were keeping five; 14 cows where they were keeping 10&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>One more cow&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, one more cow, one more sow, and one more acre under the plough&mdash;and that, in the belief of the Minister, if the people do that, things will be all right.  There is not any point in being cheerful about last year and not saying anything about the year to come.</P>
      <P>There is the question also of what will happen if Britain joins the EEC and gets some sort of arrangement with the Commonwealth countries. There is one point about this to which I do not think many people have adverted.  It is that Australia and New Zealand, when there came to be a surplus of milk and milk products in Britain, had a fund which they had been building up over the years by means of a levy on their milk.  They decided that Denmark would not take the market and they started to drop prices.  But, like every fund, it was not a bottomless well and eventually they came to the bottom of it.  Prices have not gone up; they stayed where they were.</P>
      <P>It is quite true to say that even if Australia and New Zealand have to pay a levy on their milk and milk products going into the Common Market and into Britain they still may get a better price than they are getting at the moment.  In the Common Market context, there is no doubt that the price of butter will have to be related to the price of milk.  If Britain will continue to pay 2/10½d. or somewhere around that figure&mdash;in this list, the figure appears to be about 2/6d.&mdash; then the price of butter will go up.  If that happens, New Zealand will get more even though she will have to pay a levy unless she comes in on a preferential basis.  She will get more money, anyway.  I believe it will work out at a net increase.  Therefore this problem may not be the major problem some people would have us believe it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that the whole dairying industry needs to be rationalised.  Anybody <Col N="2401" /> going through the creamery districts who looks at things as they are will know that that is true.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe, therefore, that there is a future for milk and milk products when we enter the Common Market.  That should have been the whole context of the Minister's speech &mdash;what will happen in the coming twelve months.  Are we to drift along without a pig progeny testing station for another 40 years?</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition adverted to the fact that the whole dairying industry needs to be rationalised. I think that is true.  In all our businesses and in all our activities, whatever they are, the shadow of the Common Market appears.  Whether it be in doing with less labour, whether it be in introducing machinery, whether it be in closing one unit of production and doing twice as much in another place, whether it be by all these <i>media,</i> that is the way we have to operate.</P>
      <P>I should like to develop what Deputy Dillon said in this way that, in addition, we need not only to diversify output of milk products but also to set targets for the various products.  It is necessary now to make that decision for the future, as we can see it.  We can still see it only through a certain haze.  We must decide as to the quantities it is best to cater for in butter, cheese and other milk products and produce those set quantities or set up the machinery to produce them in the cheapest possible way.  Then, just as Deputy Dillon pointed out, the Danes seem to have £s per pig on us in the economy of their marketing and in the advantage they have in a better breed of pig.  Then we can look here for those extra pence per gallon and now is the time we have to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true to say that we have just appointed An Bord Bainne you cannot shelve everything on to a board.  The man sitting on the opposite side of the House, the Minister for Agriculture, has the ultimate responsibility.  It is his job to see to <Col N="2402" /> it that not only do we rationalise our milk production but also that we diversify it into products most easily saleable and in a way that we can achieve the target we want for each product.</P>

      <P>It is necessary at this stage not only to diversify but to decide on the quantities we can produce, relative to the amount of milk we have, of each product so as to sell them in the best possible way.  In answer to Deputy Burke who suggests, I think, that we have not an unlimited market, there is always a best and a worst.  I suggest that whatever the worst is it will not be so bad.  We should join with the four countries that have already applied.  It is our business to get the extra pence per gallon by seeing now that we get the best&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy is going out to have another saucer of milk. Mention has been made of grass products.  There is no doubt we have the best set up for producing grass in the world, I suppose, outside New Zealand.  I notice something that is developing and in my view will develop further, that is, the production of grassmeal.  We had long arguments a long time ago here about grassmeal production in what somebody described as &ldquo;the most derelicted bog in Co. Mayo.&rdquo;  I am, however, referring to the production of grassmeal on very good grassland.  The figure for usage here was something around 8,000 tons.  While it is possible to produce the same clinical figures so far as analysis of compound foodstuff is concerned from ersatz chemical and pharmaceutical products, if you want to get the results obtainable from carotene and the many other excellent constituents of grassmeal, there is nothing as good as grassmeal.</P>
      <P>We have been largely excluded from the Continental markets in this respect again by tariff walls or quota limitations. Production of grassmeal is something that can be expanded and I am glad to see many firms setting about the production of it in a large way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About the nitrogen factory, I want to say that as far back as five years ago I was informed&mdash;and I have no reason to doubt that information&mdash;that there was a factory in Europe staffed by 17 men per shift which if it worked 24 hours a day for 365 days of the year could produce all the ammonium nitrate that the whole Continent, including Ireland and right up to the Iron Curtain, would require.  To my knowledge there are three large nitrogen factories operating in Europe and we are going to build a fourth.  It was reported in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Press</i> that the manufacturers of nitrogen were meeting in order to fix prices.  I do not know what the outcome of that will be but if we are going to build a nitrogen factory we must look at things in a most hard-headed and <Col N="2404" /> materialistic way because, as instanced by Deputy Dillon, an extra 2/- per cwt. means 24,000,000 shillings or £1,200,000 to the Irish farmers.  Two shillings a cwt. is a lot when you are competing with everybody who is selling, when you may lose your business because of 6d. or 1/-, but when it comes to Government action, 2/- can be very little but it is £1,200,000 to the farmers.  I do not want to throw cold water on any scheme that might advance industry here but I think the Government should give us all the information and proceed in this matter in a more practical way.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that the only way I can see of achieving here an advance to Continental standards is the integration of agricultural advisory services and agricultural education with at the same time the injection of capital into the land coupled with proper marketing facilities. The basis for all that must be something like what the Leader of the Opposition called the parish agent in every three parishes.  You can have that in various ways, related to committees of agriculture or directly related to the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>All that was a very vexed question in the past, but, if you want a properly integrated production and progress you must have, first, agricultural education and the advisory services that such a group of men will give.  Having done that you must do such things as I suggest might be done.  You must look a little further than just making speeches and saying: &ldquo;Go ahead boys and produce&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, that failed in the past.  You must bring yourself into things more closely.  You must do something such as has been done in the production of cereals, for instance, in the east of Ireland.  The farmer knows today that if he grows and markets a crop, it will be taken from him and dried and processed.  A farmer in the west of Ireland may live quite far from any collecting point such as Castlebar Bacon Factory, for instance, or any bacon factory which would give a farmer a factory service. He must bring his pigs to a fair.  The dealers come there and if there are too many pigs the farmer gets £3 less <Col N="2405" /> on that day.  The profit on the pigs is only 30/- or £2 in any case, so where is he going?</P>
    <P>We must try to do things such as Deputy Dillon did when he was Minister, when he set up the five county co-operative for marketing of agricultural produce and which quoted guaranteed minimum prices.  In the case of turkeys, for instance, producers were told: &ldquo;We will give you X-pence per lb.  You market your turkeys and whatever the extra profits are when Christmas is over, we will send you your due share.&rdquo;  We need that integration and advisory service to accomplish this.  There is no indication in the Minister's speech that he intends to address himself to that or that he has addressed himself to the problems confronting us if we enter the Common Market&mdash;as we surely shall.  At that stage we are right, I say, in voting against this Estimate and we shall do that and, as Deputy Dillon said, the sooner the Government get out and give the farmers of this country some hope, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister at the outset of his speech was flapping his wings and inclined to crow because we had a very successful year last year. I think he attributed that largely to the increased export of cattle as indicating that everything is all right.  Then he anticipated adverse criticism of the fact that we disposed of a great deal of cattle last year and says that it must not be thought that we are living on our livestock capital.  In my opinion, we are, and we have been, living on our livestock capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My remarks will be principally devoted to one of the most serious problems facing the country at present, the wholesale flight from small holdings. I have asked the Minister on many occasions to state the Government's policy in regard to the small farmers, particularly along the western seaboard, but, in general, the small farmer all over the country.  Will the Minister tell us now if the Government have decided that the country will be better off without the small farmers and, since they are going with their families to England, the United States, <Col N="2406" /> Canada and Australia, do the Government consider that is the best course for the country and that farming to-day would be best served by a community of large, comfortable farmers?  If that is the Government's policy, it should be so stated.  An exodus such as we have at the moment should not be allowed to continue without some declaration from the Government as to what they intend to do about it.</P>
    <P>The statistics for the western counties, Cavan, Mayo, Donegal, Leitrim, Kerry and many other counties show that while the population of the towns and villages is holding its own, all the flight is from the land.  For a number of years back, we have been giving grants to our rural dwellers to build new houses and improve their outoffices.  In addition, many farmers put whatever little spare capital they had into new houses and better outoffices but, the moment they did that, they found that through the carelessness of the Government, they could not make a livelihood on their holdings and they had to pack up and flee the country.</P>
    <P>I hope we will become a member of the Common Market.  However, I can see, when we do and when the three main features of the Common Market, the free movement of men, money and goods, begin to operate, a host of German and Danish small farmers coming into this country and buying up the holdings from which our own people are being forced by a careless Government to flee.  We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the price of medium agricultural land in Germany is between £400 and £500 a statute acre, around about the same price as in Denmark.  The price of our land has been about £100 to the £1 valuation. A desperate state of affairs will have taken place if we have forced our own people off the land to seek an industrial life in England and then, on our entry into the Common Market, the investment of these people in houses, offices and improved land is to go for the benefit of people who come in here, foreigners who have no part in our aspirations, national or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that we have had a good year and tells us that the <Col N="2407" /> income of the farmers has gone up by £8,000,000.  The hard, cold reality of the situation is that farmers have had to sell 112,000 more of their cattle to pay their bills.  Their cost of living has been going up year by year while their incomes have been deteriorating and nothing has been done about it.  It is beyond their capacity to increase production and, whenever they manage to do so, all they do is knock the bottom out of their own market by over-production. The £8,000,000 additional income has not come to the farmers. They have been forced to sell their cattle to pay their debts.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that there has been an increase in the sheep population of 269,000.  That is a little over two sheep per bullock that has gone. That is no balance at all.  Even on poor land, the average balance per bullock is four sheep so that the increase in the number of sheep to compensate for the loss in cattle would need to be more than double the figure the Minister has given us. Deputy Donegan has rightly mentioned the fact that the number of in-calf cows and heifers is not sufficient to fill the gap caused by the increased exports of last year.  The figures the Minister has given us in the notes on the main activities of his Department bear out that fact.</P>
    <P>It has often been said in this House, and it will bear repetition, that agriculture is the industry that keeps the wheels of this country turning.  The Minister told us clearly in his statement that the exports of agricultural produce make it possible to import 70 per cent of all the things we need in this country.  The Minister has not measured up to his job, particularly in so far as the keeping of the small farmers on the land is concerned.  He set up an inter-Departmental Committee in April, 1961, to inquire into the problems of small western farms.  Why does he designate the small farmer as the western type farmer?  I resent that implication very much.  The small farmer in Dublin, Cork, Donegal, Monaghan, or Cavan, whence the Minister comes, is just as badly hit as the small farmer in the west.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2408" /> The population of County Mayo in 1936 was 161,347 and in 1961, it was 123,180, a fall of 24 per cent. representing a loss of 38,300 people.  The population of Cavan in 1936 was 76,770 and in 1961, it was 56,559, a loss of 26 per cent. or one in every four people gone.  The small farmer is a small farmer in any county and with the consistent increase in the cost of living and his income remaining static, he is being forced off the land.  The small farm is all right now for the bachelor or the old maid.  It is all right for a person with a pension but it is no good otherwise.  We always took a valuation of £10 as being a reasonable holding.  That was 30 or 40 years ago but today it is nothing more than a stand.</P>
    <P>That inter-Departmental Committee found that the decline in population could be attributed to four main causes which they set out:</P>
    <P>(1)  The disinclination of young people to remain at work on holdings which do not provide what they regard as worthwhile cash incomes, coupled with the availability in Britain of jobs paying comparatively high wages.  This movement to higher incomes and higher living standards is prevalent in many countries but it is probably accelerated here by the ease with which people can emigrate.</P>
    <P>(2)  The fact that the general run of farmers in those areas are not in a position to benefit from fixed price crops and commodities such as wheat, barley, beet and milk.</P>
    <P>(3)  The loss, for reasons referred to later, of &ldquo;farmyard&rdquo; income from pigs, poultry and eggs, and increased dependence on stock raising which is extensive in its use of land, uncertain financially as a system of farming and not well suited to smallholders.</P>
    <P>(4)  Lack of industrialisation.</P>
    <P>That sums up tersely what is happening.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister to say in regard to the &ldquo;farmyard&rdquo; income, which in many cases was the main-stay of the small holding, and the loss from pigs, poultry and eggs?  Poultry <Col N="2409" /> are a thing of the past.  The hen has gone; turkeys have gone.  These were the two principal branches of poultry which brought in a steady income to the household.  Many a good, thrifty housewife reared her household on the income from poultry alone.  The Minister has the unique distinction of wiping out that industry.</P>
    <P>As I said, I want to devote my remarks mainly to the small farmer. The large farmer is all right.  He has the land to work and the income to induce his sons to stay at home.  Not long ago I spoke to a man who reared five sons and several daughters and he told me that even though, by our standards in Mayo, he is fairly comfortable, his holding has failed to induce one son to stay on the land. All of them have gone to England. The last one to go told him that he did not want to be a slave like his father, and that if he married he did not want his wife to be a slave like his mother.  The fact that farmers are not organised and do not seem to be able to stick together as trade unionists do, should not be availed of by the Government to exploit them, or to regard them as hewers of wood and drawers of water, or as people who produce taxes to run the country but who are given nothing in return.</P>
    <P>Government speakers both inside and outside the House made great play on the relief of rates.  The relief of rates was only a little help.  How much value was it to the man with the £10 valuation?  It meant something like £3 or £4 to that man in Mayo. Do the Minister or the Government think that £3 a year will induce anybody to stay on that holding?  The Minister has told us on many occasions that it is all very fine to be critical.  I should not like to be merely critical.  I should like to give the Minister the benefit of what I think is the best approach, taking for granted that the Government are serious about retaining the small farmers.  If they are not serious the Minister can disregard what I am about to say.  It must first be realised that a pall of despair and despondency has fallen on the small farmers and I do not blame them for that.  They see their companions <Col N="2410" /> going and they are wondering, particularly the married men with families, when their turn is to come, when they will have to pack up and go.</P>
    <P>Although I dislike saying it, the first thing that will have to be done will be to give some financial help in order to retain them on the land.  Secondly, something in the nature of the parish agent plan will have to be developed to induce or to coax them to engage in intensive production on their small holdings.  Of course there must be a market for what they produce.  I hope any such scheme, if it is attempted, will not be killed at the very outset by the soul destroying effect of having them produce good commodities only to find that there are no markets for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has excellent officials in his Department&mdash;certainly I have the greatest respect for them&mdash;and if they were given a lead and told what to do they would do it.  The reason why the small farmers are leaving is that the income from their holdings is not sufficient to keep them at home. Employment in rural areas is a thing of the past.  There is no employment there any more and the county councils give employment only to a few.  The small farmers need a good deal of part-time employment because their holdings are not sufficient to keep them fully occupied.  There was a ludicrous attempt by the Minister for Lands to set up glass-houses for the growing of tomatoes in Tourmakeady and in Galway but a storm scattered them.  I believe they were of bad design and totally unsuited for the growing of tomatoes.  The growing of tomatoes will not be the salvation of the small farmers and if the Minister wants to retain them on the land something on the lines I have pointed out will be required.  For a start, some monetary help is required.  I hate to use the expression because it carries the same kind of taint as the dole does, or anything that is given free, but, at the same time, it is necessary to do something along those lines.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Government considered putting the Land Commission under the control of the Minister for Agriculture.  I say that not because <Col N="2411" /> I have lost faith in either the officials or the Minister but in view of the enormous number of derelict holdings all over the country.  It is time for the Minister for Agriculture to have a new look at the whole problem of resettlement on the land.  A short time ago the problem of the Land Commission was to find land for the people but the time has come when the difficulty is to find people for the land.  For that reason I think the stage has been reached when the Minister for Agriculture should have the administration of the Land Commission.  As well as the Minister having the Land Reclamation Scheme, which was started by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture, under his control the branch of the Special Employment Schemes Office dealing with the drainage of good arable land should be under his control.  I do not mean bog drainage or general drainage but in any case where people are prevented from carrying out a land reclamation scheme because outfall is not good enough or because the Minister's officials have to wait for some other Department, the Special Employment Schemes Office, say, to do a major job first.  The Minister should take over that office and use it to carry out his land reclamation job.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a high tribute to the men doing that work because many a time I heard it said that were it not for land reclamation, arterial drainage and forestry Ireland would be a very derelict place, at least in so far as the rural areas are concerned.</P>
    <P>I know of several cases where farmers could benefit from drainage. They have got good arable land which is subject to flooding.  The work cannot be done until drainage work is carried out under the arterial drainage scheme or by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  The Minister should ask the Minister for Finance for money for that purpose.  I have made representations to the present Parliamentary Secretary and his predecessor in relation to my own constituency. There are about 28 farmers concerned. The land under water for five months <Col N="2412" /> of the winter comprises about 250 acres.  They are 250 acres of the very best land.  The unfortunate farmers are paying rent and rates, and dear rates, at the present time for that land.  They cannot do a single thing about the matter.  They have been to every Deputy in an endeavour to get something done but no Government to date seem to be able to do anything about the matter.  That is very discouraging to those people.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances you cannot blame people for saying that this is no country to live in and that no Government seem to be interested in their problems.  If the Government are genuinely interested in retaining the few small farmers left, they ought to do something about the matter at once.  The recommendations contained in the Report of the inter-Departmental Committee do not go very far.  They will not go to the root of the trouble.  With the advent of the Common Market, it will be galling for those who have fled the land to see foreigners buying cheaply property upon which our people have spent their capital and labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just wondering what kind of small farmer Deputy Blowick speaks of.  I know quite a considerable number of small farmers. There is a very large area of Cork county where there are small farmers. I know people not very far from where I live who are hillside and foot-hill farmers.  None of these people would preach the gospel of despair which we heard from Deputy Blowick. If Deputy Blowick studied seriously the report of the inter-Departmental Committee he would find the problem set out.  He would find that the small farmers in the West of Ireland are people who follow a pattern of agriculture, if you could call it agriculture. Deputy Blowick continually used the word &ldquo;farming&rdquo;.  Farming in the west of Ireland, as far as I know, can consist of anything.  He did not use the word &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; right through the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have this peculiar kind of set up.  The emphasis is on cattle there. Cattle seem to be the one major type <Col N="2413" /> of production that these smallholders in the west of Ireland follow.  We all know that many years ago a famous Irishman said that grazing and depopulation go side by side.  That is more true today than it was when he repeated that up and down the country.  I was speaking to a horticultural instructor the other night who told me in relation to crops harvested by smallholders that many of these crops would bring in between £300 and £400 a statute acre. Deputy Blowick talks about the miserably few parasite ridden cattle in the west of Ireland from which these people have to make a living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole problem of the people in the west of Ireland is that they have adopted a system of agriculture and agricultural husbandry which is extensive rather than intensive.  They adopt on fifteen acres exactly the same kind of pattern of agriculture as those on 100 or 200 acres follow.  To put it briefly, they ranch on 15 acres.  How can Deputy Blowick or any Government Minister solve a problem when that is the kind of pattern these people follow? Deputy Blowick should be out on the hustings trying to persuade these people to change their pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should talk about his own farmers and not run down mine.  I have talked about the west.  Let Deputy Moher talk about his constituency.  The Deputy is telling the Minister not to pay any heed to the small farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of coming in here and shouting that type of despair, Deputy Blowick should go out among his constituents and tell them their overall problem cannot be solved as long as they continue the pattern of agriculture which they have been pursuing for the past 100 years.</P>

      <P>The problem of the west of Ireland is an historical problem. It is the result of Cromwell's dictum of &ldquo;to hell or to Connaught&rdquo;. <Col N="2414" /> Many of the congested districts in the west have their origin in the policy of Cromwell.  Because their ancestors were displaced persons they suffer from the problems which were created when they were dumped there.  They must emigrate.  There has always been emigration.  Deputy Blowick may never have emigrated but I have and I have seen these people.  In the 1930's they were migrants when they came over in the spring.  They disappeared some time in the late autumn and went back to spend Christmas in Ireland.  Then they reappeared in the agricultural areas of the north of England and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>When the war came and as a result of the devastation which followed, these people found permanent employment. They did not have to be migrants any longer.  They were people with brawn and muscle.  They switched from the &ldquo;tatie&rdquo; fields of the north of England and Scotland to the building sites and many of them, who were formerly migrants, became emigrants. They settled down there.  Then followed the general reaction to their writing home and telling their people how well they were doing.  Deputy Blowick cannot persuade the younger people in the jet age to accept £5 a week when they know that within a flight of an hour or two from them they can earn £15 a week.</P>

      <P>I am trying to give the historical facts.  I am not trying to perpetrate a political fraud.  I am trying to persuade the people in this House that the problem is not a problem begotten by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Of course, it is not.  The problem is a complex problem.  The problem of <Col N="2415" /> these smallholders is much more difficult of solution than those elsewhere. Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick talked about the drop in the pig population. Why cannot the holder of 10, 15 or 20 acres in the West keep a sow?</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Why cannot the smallholder in the west vary his husbandry? Why cannot he have two or three sows and do like the smallholders down in West Cork and produce a farmyard income?  Why must he emigrate?  Why cannot he get down and do the job like the smallholders in Cork?  Any Deputy from West Cork will tell you there are holdings there as poor as anywhere in the West.  Within view of where I live, I can see these smallholders up to 2,000 feet on the Galtee foothills.  They are first with their hay crop, first in everything.  Why cannot these people in the West do the same thing?  It is no use saying this is a political problem. It is no use for the people on the opposite side to say this problem was created by Fianna Fáil and that Fianna Fáil are doing nothing about it.  Deputy Dillon knows that the Congested Districts Board and its successor, the Board of Works, have been pouring out wrapped-up dole in one form or another.  Deputy Blowick objects to the word &ldquo;dole&rdquo;.  But, west of the Shannon, successive Governments have been giving hundreds of thousands in wrapped-up dole.  Bog road development and all that kind of thing is wrapped-up dole to keep these people literally from starving.  They have lost the will to help themselves. The Deputy echoes the despair which seems to have cast its shadow over all that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will find these people working in the industrial areas of Coventry and Birmingham, forgetting about their holdings and earning big money.  I have met them in the public houses.  They are not worried about what they left behind.  They have all the advantages of the welfare state.  They have a certain <Col N="2416" /> social security and plenty of money.  They have the bright lights. They are not very far away from home.  If they want to come back and see the old people, they can be back in a matter of hours.  It is much easier for these people to get out and to get down to it than to try to subsist by remaining on.  I am prepared to admit that, under any pattern of husbandry, many of these holdings would provide for the people who work on them only a subsistence living.</P>
    <P>In 1962 few of our young people will accept that kind of subsistence existence.  The simple life of 40 or 50 years ago is not acceptable to the boys and girls of 18, 19 and 20 to-day.  If they see an opportunity of getting out and bettering themselves, they have not the slightest hesitation in taking it. Many of them have a huge segment of the known world to travel and they have the advantage of speaking the English language.  Thirty or forty years ago the people emigrated to America for a lifetime.  To-day it is not unusual to see people who emigrated back every other year for a month's holiday.  We live in the jet age.  We cannot get away from it. It was never easier to travel long distances.  These people are not going to bury themselves and continue the kind of subsistence living Deputy Blowick and others would condemn them to, no matter what they did.</P>
    <P>That is the complex situation revealed by this very factual report. Whether we are on this side or on the Opposition benches, we all have to make a contribution if this problem is to be solved.  It will take the collective effort and brains of everyone here to find a solution.  That solution will not be found in the lifetime of any one Government or of several Governments.  Instead of trying to misrepresent the position of these people, we should offer suggestions, get together and do the best we can to find some solution for their problem.</P>
    <P>The problem of the smallholder is not an exclusively Irish problem.  In Great Britain, one of the most highly industrialised countries of its size, the same problem exists.  Experiments which have been carried out in a <Col N="2417" /> number of research stations over the past 10 years have revealed a rather significant picture.  The small holdings there are disappearing.  Various types of animals and crop husbandry have been tried out in the research stations on farms varying in size from 20 to 50 acres.  The overall conclusion is that the small holding is disappearing.</P>
    <P>When I asked one of these people what the main reason for this was, he simply said: &ldquo;The younger people who have been brought up on these farms think in terms of a cash return for man-hours worked.  Under the types of husbandry we have been trying out on these small farms, these people cannot obtain for man-hours worked the same return they would get as industrial workers.&rdquo;  That is one of the reasons.  We all know they could not hope to get the same conditions of employment on these small holdings as they would get in industrial employment. We all know that farmers in Continental countries do not think in terms of hours worked.  They work from sunrise to sunset.  If one goes out in the morning at six o'clock, the farmers are out working on the land.  You can travel through the whole of Munster and, outside the dairying areas, you will not see a farmer in the field at eight o'clock or nine o'clock in the morning.  Our farmers will not work the hours the Continental farmers do as their normal day.</P>
    <P>We will have to consider all these factors when we go into the Common Market because these are the farmers with whom we will be in competition. Deputy Dillon, at one stage of his career on this side of the House, used to talk about farming as a way of living. He used to assert that we in Ireland did not have to do the awful things the Danes, the Dutch, and the Scandinavians had to do in order to make farming pay.  We just took things easy.  We went to two or three race meetings in the month during the racing season.  In the middle of the summer, when we should be saving hay and filling the silos, we went down to Killarney under the auspices of Muintir na Tíre for a fireside chat.</P>
    <P>Where will one find the Danish or the Dutch farmer in the month of <Col N="2418" /> June?  Not in Killarney, having a fireside chat, away from his farm for four or five days.  These are aspects we must consider.  The Continental farmer makes a living, and a good living, on a farm of not more than 25 acres.  These farmers are not feather-bedded as our farmers are.  We know the situation that obtains.  Picture the son of an Irish farmer being put in the same position as his Dutch opposite number.  The Irish farmer does not retire with an annuity, leaving the eldest son to work the farm, and sending the others out into the world with an education.  The Dutch farmer sells the farm to his eldest son, the son getting the necessary capital from the Land Bank; some of the money is distributed amongst the others.  Suppose an Irish farmer endeavoured to adopt the same system.  Suppose he told his eldest son he could have the farm for £3,000. Where would the son get the capital? Would he go to the bank and start married life with a debt of £3,000 to the bank?  Would it be possible for him to work it off under our system? It certainly would not.</P>
    <P>The Continental farmers work hard, and they work long hours.  Our farmers are not prepared to do that. If the son of a small farmer here were asked to go into the fields at six o'clock in the morning and work until sundown, the first thing he would do would be to scrape together the single fare, disappear, and leave the land behind him.  These are the comparisons we must make.  They are irrefutable.  These are the comparisons that show our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the small holders in other European countries.  That is why these farmers can make a living and our farmers cannot.  They get a greater output per acre per man per farm unit of production. On the dairying side of our economy, we produce something like 50 lbs. of butter fat per acre.  The Dutch regard 250 lbs. as too low. There is the problem.  All the statistics are available.</P>
    <P>Comparing farming incomes with industrial and other incomes is a fallacious line of reasoning.  If the civil servant puts two days work into one day, he is paid accordingly.  Surely <Col N="2419" /> no one will argue that if you own a piece of land&mdash;be it 20, 30 or 40 acres&mdash;you have within your grasp a potential which does not limit you to what you can produce?  Is that not the real fallacy in making a comparison between the farmer's income and that enjoyed by the civil servant or the industrial worker?</P>
    <P>Why is this House not used to point realities?  Why do we try, for political purposes, to misrepresent the situation? Our farmers are not stupid. They are mature people.  They read day after day about what goes on in this House &mdash; attack and counterattack, misrepresentation and refutation. In the local pub, they call this House &ldquo;the Gas Chamber&rdquo;.  I came in here in 1954.  I know that today we are not getting the kind of objective debate that we should have in this House.  The standard of debate has deteriorated with the years.  When I came in here, I was sitting on the benches on which Deputy Dillon now sits and Deputy Dillon was over here as Minister for Agriculture.  The records are there.  I defy anyone reading the records to prove from anything I said on successive Estimates here that I was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I gave credit when credit was due.  I criticised when criticism was called for.  Why cannot we have that type of debate today?  The time of the House is taken up now with speakers scoring debating points.  Deputies representing the rural areas are so disgusted that they have now ceased to talk here.  I certainly would not waste time discussing some of the matters that have been debated here at length. Now, at the last moment, we are trying to race through one of the most important Estimates of the year.  We are running against time.</P>

They want to get out.  They are fugitives from these areas and from the problems which they refuse to tackle.  Governments can operate schemes.  Governments can give aid but in the final analysis, God helps those who help themselves.  If these people have decided to jettison pigs, to abandon everything except a few cattle and go from one fair to the other flashing &ldquo;bluebacks&rdquo; and giving the impression they are wealthy people, that is not farming.  I am glad Deputy Blowick used the word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo;. &ldquo;Farmer&rdquo; covers a very wide class of people who squat on the land.

That has been one of the main problems of the Land Commission for years, the re-arrangement of these holdings.  However, no matter what structural alterations are made on a small holding, what will count and what will keep the owner on the small farm is the income he can derive from it.  The problem is to teach him, if he has the will to learn, how to increase his income.

      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned the problem of how to teach these people to produce more and better grass, how to get them to expand the grazing periods in the early spring and the late autumn.  If that can be achieved on the small holding, they will be able to increase the number of animals they can carry and if it is a dairy holding, we can certainly help them to increase milk yields and they can get away from the 440-gallon cow. We shall be up against people with cows giving approximately twice that output.  If four or five cows producing 600, 700 or 800 gallons are carried that will definitely improve the position of the dairy farmer and he will not be worried about a penny or a halfpenny increase.  If there is increased production, there will be no row about price, whether an extra penny or halfpenny should be provided, because once that penny or halfpenny is obtained, it is absorbed by some other charge.</P>

      <P>Again, there is the problem of winter feeding.  Over a great area of our country, there are hundreds of farms where cattle are doing well for the summer but when it comes to winter, they are not maintained as they should be.  We must veer away from hay as a main fodder crop because probably only one in every three summers is suitable for saving that fodder.  If we can increase grass production in the spring and <Col N="2422" /> autumn and if in the meantime we can conserve good silage, we will have better conversion units.  Many of the cattle which are housed in good conditions live for most of the winter off the beef on their rumps.  If they are starved during the winter time, it is bound to impair them for the early summer.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will not get me off the track.  A great friend of Deputy Dillon said after leaving Ireland: they have reared cows that eat much and give little.  Can he tell me who was the person who made that statement?  Another foreigner who came to this country said that the fields of Ireland were growing physically as little grass as it was possible for them to grow under an Irish sky.  These are the observers who come in here and make assessments of us which we refuse to make of ourselves.  Another person who was here only three or four months made a much more objective assessment of us as a people and of our position as agriculturists than anyone in this House would ever attempt to make.  Why then do we refuse to see ourselves as these people see us? Why do we not get up and say: &ldquo;This is the problem as enunciated by somebody who was neutral, somebody who <Col N="2423" /> stood on the sideline and made an assessment of the situation&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>No&mdash;blame Fianna Fáil and try to score a petty debating point.  Try to seize on a point to gain political support by resorting to what I can only term as fraud.  One of the things on which we will all agree is that if we are to enter into international competition with our dairy produce, we must improve the standard of our milk production. We must not get away from the fact that the same problem is also there in relation to beef.  If we go into a market or a fair, we will see first-class animals, beautifully finished, side by side with underdeveloped, hide-bound, parasite-ridden yearlings.  That is because, on the one hand, there could be a soil or a farm problem, but on the other, there could be the fact that the owner does not know how to treat his animals.</P>
      <P>We must ask ourselves why, if a man chooses to make his living in that way, he does not try to learn something about the business.  How many farmers, for instance, who make their living from livestock can go out and identify ordinary animal disease?  How many could tell you what ordinary disease an animal is suffering from&mdash;diseases which mean so much in farm losses every year?  I have often heard people talking about their losses from this, that and the other disease&mdash;losses that could have been prevented, if they knew how to identify the disease at the outset and therefore treat it</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an earlier contribution here, I referred to beef production and I should like now to reiterate what I then said, that it is as vital for us to improve our beef production and our store and beef cattle as it is to improve our dairy herds.  I was looking recently at a report in a German scientific magazine on experiments carried out on bull calves.  I was amazed at the results.  They experimented on 41 calves which were eventually slaughtered at 8 cwts.  Each had consumed 23 gallons of full milk, 90 gallons of skim milk, 9 cwts. of concentrates, 5¼ tons of beet and silage and 8 cwts. of hay. They had never seen a field; yet at slaughter they weighed over 8 cwts. <Col N="2424" /> each.  That should give some idea of competitive efficiency when it comes to trying to win a place for our cattle in a common market.</P>
    <P>That brings me to progeny testing and bull testing.  In our stations, I think we have fallen down on this job. During a previous debate here, I discussed conversion rates in respect to beef cattle and related them to experiments carried out in America.  I know that as far as dairy bulls are concerned the breeding potential is known, but we have very few beef bulls in Ireland about whose conversion ratio we know much.  If we are to maintain our place as exporters of first-class cattle, beef or store, we must wake up and examine the position.</P>
    <P>I referred to pig production earlier, when attempting to reply to a point made by Deputy Blowick.  No matter what you do in the field, no matter how efficient you are, you cannot afford to neglect what I might describe as farmyard income economics.  Pig production is very definitely a subsidiary of dairying.  Very often we debate here the problems of producing grain and of having it transferred from the south to the big pig producing areas where grain is not grown to any considerable extent&mdash;the problem of having it transported and made available in these areas at a price which will enable producers to market pigs at a reasonable profit.  I would ask in this connection what has happened to potato production.  The older Deputies among us will recall that the bulk of our pigs were once fattened on potatoes.  They formed a very high proportion of the pig ration in earlier years and we know that the bulk of Danish pigs are not fed on high protein compounds as are ours.</P>
    <P>In Denmark, pigs are fattened on potatoes, skim milk, fodder and beet and the Danes are able to beat us anywhere on grading with that type of feed.  Why then has our potato production in connection with our bacon economy disappeared?  A good acre of potatoes will provide twice as many pig feed units as an acre of barley.  In Cork, where there is considerable grain growing and where farmers can go out and plant one or two acres of <Col N="2425" /> barley and convert it into pig feed, that is all right, but in areas which are not good grain growing districts, but where you can grow first class crops of potatoes, it is quite a different matter.  Why do not our people know how best to gear their physical surroundings so that they can produce the best possible animal at the smallest possible cost?</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the pig fattening units and he associated Northern Ireland with that development. Of course, there is a considerable number of very large pig fattening units attached to the southern creameries. In the town I come from there is a pig fattening unit which probably turns out something like 12,000 pigs a year on the by-product of the cheese which is manufactured there.  They are fed mainly on hay which has a pig feed equivalent in the ratio of about three-quarters of a pound to a gallon of whey.  I cannot understand why this development cannot be extended to every creamery in the area.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Dillon spoke about the diversification and federation of the dairying industry.  Ten years ago the Danes eliminated the uneconomic small branches and stream-lined their whole dairying set-up.  We have been terribly slow about that.  If you go to the dairying areas of the south, and particularly in County Limerick, you will find a small co-operative practically every ten miles of the road where the creamery manager is the Rainier in his own Monaco.  He does not want federation.  He wants to be the be-all and end-all in his creamery.  Again, these are the people who are creating a problem for us.</P>
    <P>No one can say that in a year hence butter will continue to be a sink product.  It may jump.  We are not prepared for that.  We have a certain limited number of creameries with diversified milk products.  We have four, five or at the most, six.  The whole south of Ireland is strewn with small separating stations whose only function is to make butter, and sometimes the butter is of a mediocre quality.  They do not have to worry about its sale because it is sold anonymously <Col N="2426" /> under a code number.  That is not the kind of dairying industry which leads to anything like good development. We should at least think in terms of federating these small creameries into groups, and setting up in the centre some manufacturing unit which would have equipment and personnel. That is the only way we can survive. We must diversify all milk production if we are to make the dairying industry anything like an economic or sound business proposition.</P>
    <P>I was about to refer to the fattening units.  I would not be too keen on huge fattening units because some of the very large units are very vulnerable. They are vulnerable in that an outbreak of swine fever would wipe out the lot.  It is far better to have more moderate sized units which would not be exposed to that risk.  It is a well-known fact that the higher the pig population the higher the incidence of disease.  There are all kinds of freak diseases which may occur in a high pig population.  Some of them cannot be identified.  Freakish things can happen with huge pig concentration.  There is the ever present problem of erysipelas.</P>
    <P>I have never thought of using these fattening units for the purpose of turning out huge numbers of pigs. These fattening units attached to creameries and co-ops should have a very different function, associated with the pig breeding scheme.  Boars should be kept in the units and progeny tested. The good boars should be retained and the ones which fail to meet the required standard should be eliminated. All pig production should be associated with the production of the right kind of store.  If a farmer does not want to feed a store himself he should pass it on to the fattening unit and the unit should keep records of the progeny of the boars which are retained.  We could very easily have a useful pig industry, and improve it in a much simpler way than we are doing with the kind of pig breeding we have now.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are many members of the House listening to me who have been associated with county committees of agriculture.  All the committees of agriculture are alike.  They <Col N="2427" /> have the same agenda and the same monotonous ritual.  The first item on the agenda is always the obituary list of boars who died for the cause.  I have never attended a meeting of a committee of agriculture, in all the time I have been associated with them, at which the first item on the agenda was not the obituary list.  One member gets up and says that he proposes that Jim Murphy's boar be replaced.  He is asked was there a certificate, and he says that it was duly certified as having passed on peacefully.  The motion is carried and the boar is replaced.  That is the kind of &ldquo;shot in the dark&rdquo; breeding we have.</P>
    <P>It is about time we had a bit of commonsense and got down seriously to the job.  I gather that as boars get older their tusks grow longer and they become more aggressive.  The farmer's wife becomes afraid of the animal because sometimes it charges at her and her husband is away.  Anyone who has been associated with a county committee of agriculture must be amazed at the animal obituary list which goes on month after month and year after year, one casualty after another casualty.  No one seems to care what the animal died of: whether it was something congenital or something that he had passed down the line.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with housing. Deputy Dillon spoke about the number of old, obsolete, poor farmhouses there are all over the country.  Probably we have the greatest animal slum problem in the world.  Do Deputies realise the types of shacks in which animals are housed in quite a number of instances and, indeed, in some of the larger holdings?  A colossal amount of money is spent&mdash;I do not know what the cumulative figure is&mdash; on the replacement of farm buildings. Here again we have more or less fallen down on the problem.  Some of the houses which were built were obsolete before they were erected and grants have been paid for them on the basic that they were better than the original buildings.  That should not be.  It is a form of planning in which the professional people are not interested.  Seven per cent. on a cow-house <Col N="2428" /> does not yield a high income but seven per cent. on a £6,000 bungalow yields a lot.  Farmyard planning is one form of planning that has been very much neglected.  It is a very vital factor in our economic development. Planning means a saving of labour.  It means efficiency in the job. It means shorter hours for the person engaged in doing a job.  That can be achieved by having the right type of house placed in the right position.</P>
    <P>Then, again, I often wonder about the way we treat animals.  I regard the farmyard as a kind of social unit. There is a very distinctive pattern about everything in a farmyard.  First of all, there is the question of the right type of house and the happiness of the inmates.  It is very much a human problem, even in the animal world.  One finds that overcrowding leads to the same kinds of problems in the animal world as in the human world.</P>
    <P>In the farmyard, there are the bully and the bullied.  If one goes into a fowlhouse and looks at the perches and the roosts one invariably finds that there is a space on either side of one perch.  There is the bully. There is the one that dominates and bullies all the others.  You have it in the farmhouse.  All underdeveloped animals are not congenitally so.  They are often the victims of the bully.  What we call the runt pig is bound to be like that.  Go into the farmhouse and see what happens.  The bully is there.  He bites the other animal's ear until he flees screaming into a corner.  Go to the feeding trough. There you have the fellow with the horn who is able to get all the others out of his way.  Go among the dairy herd and there you will find the bully again, the old lady in front who stands in the gap and seems to say: &ldquo;Is there anyone who will dare to pass?&rdquo; She goes to the self-feeding silo bed and stays there until she chooses to leave. She goes to the drinking trough and it is the same kind of thing all over again.  These are all what I would call the social problems in the farmyard.</P>

      <P>The whole question involves very intricate study.  Then take the people who do not bother to make a study of the animals from which they make their living.  Take, for instance, the farmer who would go down into his piggery and drag out a one-cwt. pig and slaughter it in the vicinity of the place.  Imagine how that will dismay the happiness and order of the whole place.  Imagine the effect of the screams of an animal in agony, which is being slaughtered, on the other inmates of the farmyard. These are all problems associated with good housing.</P>
      <P>We know very well what the tendencies are in the modern world.  They are to house animals separately, to stall them, to stall sows.  That is solving the problem.  Just think of the old sow who pushes out the door and rampages through the yard and pushes every door before her and who finally gets into a neighbour's place.  She is now controlled.  She is stalled.  All these are factors which good planning and good housing solve.  I do not think I should pursue the matter any further.</P>

      <P>He is dissatisfied, as far as I can gather, with almost every aspect of our agricultural scene.  He brings forward all the evidence that one needs&mdash;outside evidence in some cases&mdash;to prove that our grassland is as bad as it could be under an Irish sky.  He proceeds from there to tell us that he cannot understand why the amount of land under the potato crop has diminished: it has diminished in volume by about 13 per cent. in 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moher cannot understand why our farmers have not been educated into producing better grass and doing a better job in conservation. <Col N="2430" /> These are all the difficulties that have been pointed out over the years.  The reason given is that we have no advisory service.  Although the remainder of Deputy Moher's speech was very entertaining, it would not make much impact on the general position of agriculture in the country.</P>

      <P>To get back again to the Estimate proper, there is not a great deal that is new that can be referred to at this stage because some Deputies on this side of the House have more or less exhausted the subject.  Nevertheless, the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture is such an important one that it deserves the most careful and most critical consideration. Even in its underdeveloped condition agriculture is, and in my view will continue to be, the foundation of our entire economy.</P>

    <P>Is í an teorainn acmhainne bhlian- túla faoi láthair chun cúnamh dífhostaíochta a fháil ná £100, gan baint le líon na clainne.  I gcás fir le mnaoi céile agus ceathrar leanbh go raibh an méid uasta acmhainne aige, is é sin, <Col N="2432" /> 38/5d. i naghaidh na seachtaine, cháil- eódh sé chun íocaíocht 30/6d. i naghaidh na seachtaine nó 40/6d. dá mbeadh seisear leanbh ann, ach dá mbeadh a acmhainn fiú beagán thar an méid seo ní bhfaigheadh sé íocaí- ocht ar bith.  Chun é sin a cheartú táthar chun córas nua teorainneacha a bhunú ag braith ar líon na gcleith- iúnaithe agus athrófar na teorainneacha seo uatha féin do réir na méadaithe ins na rátaí cúnaimh dífhostaíochta. Mar shampla, is í an teorainn nua acmhainne d'fhear go bhfuil bean chéile agus seisear leanbh aige ná £214 10s. i gcomparáid le £100 faoi láthair.

In ionad na teorann uasta seo táthar chun scála teorainneacha malartach a bhunú a bhaineann díreach le líon na leanbh cáilithe sa chlainn.  Beidh an pinsean is lú ar fáil anois do bhaintrigh le seisear leanbh nach mó a hacmhainn ná £234 15s. nó do bhaintrigh le dáréag leanbh nach mó ná £312 15s. a hacmhainn.

Do réir an dlí mar atá sé, ní bhéadh siad-san i dteidiol cúnamh nó sochar dífhostaíochta a fháil le linn dóibh bheith ag glacadh cúrsa traenála agus tugtar ar mhórán <Col N="2433" /> díobh gan tabhairt faoi shaol iomlán oibre arís.  Dá bharr san, táim chun forálacha áirithe de na hAchtanna Um Cúnamh Dífhostaíochta a mhaoladh i leith daoine atá ag glacadh le traenáil faoi eagraíochtaí ceadaithe.  Ní áirmheofar liúntais seachtainiúla a gheofar i gcásanna mar sin.  Déanfar forálacha de'n tsórt céadna i leith sochair dífhostaíochta trí na Riala- cháin a leasú agus ní bheidh gá le h-achtú.</P>

Forálann an Bille seo go bhfágfar pá de'n tsort seo suas go £104 as an áireamh chun críocha cúnaimh dífhostaíochta, comh maith le £52 de bhreis ar an £52 a fhágtar as faoi lathair i leith pinsean neamh-ranníocach sean-aoise, daille agus baintrí.</P>

    <P>B'fhéidir go mba chabhair é costas na moltaí seo do'n Státchiste d'achoim- riú.  Is é costas na bhforálacha cúnaimh shóisialaigh ná £1,377,000 i mbliain iomlán agus £925,000 an bhliain seo.  Is é costas na moltaí Árachais Shóisialaigh ná £941,000 i mbliain iomlán agus £235,000 sa bhliain reatha.  Is é an costas iomlán do'n Státchiste, mar sin, ná £2,318,000 i mbliain iomlán agus £1,160,000 sa bhliain seo againn.  De bhárr na bhforálacha seo go léir, beidh mar thairbhe ag faighteoirí íocaíochtaí leasa shóisialaigh £4,200,000 i mbliain iomlán.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of the Bill is to seek legislative authority for the rate increases as from 1st August next, in non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and in unemployment assistance which were announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Financial Statement on 10th April last, and for proposals for the improvement of the contributory schemes to which a reference was also made in the Budget statement.  Apart from these Budget matters, however, the Government proposes to make a number of further improvements in the Social Welfare codes, mainly on the Social Assistance side, and the opportunity has been taken to include these new proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It will, I think, simplify matters if I deal with the assistance and insurance <Col N="2436" /> schemes separately, since the Bill contains proposals affecting each of these broad divisions of the social welfare services and provides for different commencement dates.  Under each of these two divisions, I shall first speak about the various proposals arising from the Budget and then go on to deal with what I may term the non-Budget proposals.</P>
    <P>Taking the assistance side first then, the Bill, giving effect to the increases announced in the Budget, provides for raising all the existing rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions by two shillings and sixpence per week; the new rates of these pensions will thus be 32/6d., 27/6d., 22/6d., and 17/6d. a week, according to the means category of the pensioner, as set out in Section 2, on which I shall have something further to say shortly.</P>
    <P>Under the Budget increases in rates of unemployment assistance, all recipients will get an increase of 2/6d. a week also in respect of themselves, and they will, in addition, get the same extra amount for an adult dependant. Furthermore, if the recipient has dependent children, the Bill provides for the increases necessary to implement the Budget promise that, as a special measure, the child dependant allowances under the assistance schemes would be raised to the level of those payable in respect of child dependants under the contributory schemes.  In relation to Unemployment Assistance, this means that the weekly allowance for the first child is being increased from 8/- in urban areas and from 7/- in rural areas to 10/- in all areas, that the allowance for the second child is being increased from 7/- in urban areas and 6/- in rural areas to 10/- in all areas, and that the allowance for the third and subsequent children is being increased from 2/6d. to 5/- in all areas.  Accordingly, a man who is on Unemployment Assistance and who has a wife and four dependent children will get an extra 15/- a week as from next month if he lives in an urban area, while a man with a similar family in a rural area will get an increase of 17/-.  A man with a wife <Col N="2437" /> and six children will receive a total increase of 20/- a week if he lives in an urban area or 22/- if he lives in a rural area.  The table of new rates is set out in Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards widows' non-contributory pensions, the personal rate is being increased by 2/6d. and the weekly allowance for the second qualified child is being raised by 1/- to 10/-, in accordance with the Budget proposals.  The allowances in respect of other qualified children of non-contributory widows are already equal to the contributory rate.  A non-contributory widow pensioner with two or more qualified children, therefore, will receive a weekly increase of 3/6d. in her pension.  These provisions are included in Section 4, on which I shall also have more to say later.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increases in present rates which I have outlined, the Bill, as I have already indicated, proposes to make other substantial concessions on the assistance side.  Sections 2, 4 and 5, for example, provide for the extension and alteration in favour of recipients of the means limits for old age, blind and widows' non-contributory pensions and for unemployment assistance to complement the successive increases made in the rates of payment in recent years, including the grant, in 1960, of an allowance for each dependent child of widow pensioners and of recipients of unemployment assistance instead of for the first two such children only.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, two additional rates of pension, that is to say, 12/6d. and 7/6d., are being introduced.  These entail a corresponding extension of the means scale from the existing upper limit of £104 15s. a year &mdash; at which the present minimum pension of 15/- is payable &mdash; to a new limit of £130 15s. a year.  At present, a person with means just under £104 15s. gets a pension of 15/- per week, which is being raised to 17/6d. in this Bill, while a person with means just over £104 15s. gets nothing.  Obviously this can lead to cases of hardship and this Bill provides that in future a person with means between £104 15s. and £117 15s. will get a pension of 12/6d. per week while a person with means <Col N="2438" /> between £117 15s. and £130 15s. will get a pension of 7/6d. per week.  The number of new pensions at 12/6d. and 7/6d. a week which will arise under this provision is expected to be about 3,000.  This important improvement is embodied in Section 2, which also provides for the Budget increase of 2/6d. in existing pension rates.</P>
    <P>As regards unemployment assistance, the present yearly means limit is a fixed sum of £100, that is, 38/5d. a week, irrespective of the size of the family of the applicant.  Owing to the successive increases made in the rates of unemployment assistance in recent years, and the extension since 1960 of the allowance for a dependent child to all dependent children of the recipient instead of the first two only, the fixed means limit gives rise to inequality in the treatment under the scheme of certain family men with means &mdash; particularly in the rural areas. For example, in a rural area, a man with a wife and two child dependants who has the maximum means of 38/5d. a week from a small farm is just inside the scheme, and would qualify from next month for 20/6d. a week unemployment assistance on the basis of the increased rates provided for in Section 3 of this Bill.  The amount payable would become 30/6d. if there were four children and 40/6d. if there were six children, and would rise further by 5/- for each other child after the sixth. If, however, the means in any of these sample cases were even slightly over the limit of 38/5d. a week the person would be outside the scope of the scheme altogether as it now stands and would not be entitled to any payment so that in certain circumstances a very slight increase in means could result in a considerable drop in income by the complete loss of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, and the Government have agreed with me, that this kind of anomaly should now be rectified.  To rectify it, the introduction of a new self-adjusting means limit, which would make special allowance for each child dependant of an applicant and would automatically move upward in line with increases granted from time to time in the rates of unemployment assistance, is provided for in <Col N="2439" /> Section 5. On the basis of the increased rates provided for in Section 3, the effect of Section 5 would be to qualify a number of persons with families, who are at present outside the scope of unemployment assistance by reason of their means, for weekly rates of assistance ranging downward from 40/6d. for a six-child family in a rural area, and downward from 48/6d. for a similar family in an urban area, with an extra 5/- a week in each case for each child after the sixth.  The new yearly means limit for a six-child family in both urban and rural areas would be £214 10s. 0d. &mdash; as against £100 at present &mdash; and the rate of assistance payable would depend on the means of the applicant within that new limit; if the means were, say, 60/- a week, the rate of payment would be 19/6d. in a rural area and 27/6d. in an urban area, as against nil in both areas at present.  The number of new beneficiaries under the proposal would, it is thought, be in the region of 1,000, the great majority of whom would be rural residents.</P>
    <P>An extension of the means limit is also proposed in regard to widows' non-contributory pensions.  The increases announced in the Budget and provided for in this Bill will allow widows with yearly means at the present permissible limit of £130 15s. to qualify for minimum pensions, from 12/- in the case of a widow with two children by additions of 5/- per child up to, say, 62/- in the case of a widow with twelve children.  A widow with means just above the present limit of £130 15s., no matter how many children she may have, does not now qualify for any pension.  To remedy this situation, Section 4, as well as providing for the Budget increases, proposes to modify further the existing table of means and pension rates to provide a table in which the present overriding means limit of £130 15s. would be replaced by a scale of variable means limits related directly to the number of qualified children in the family. The proposed new scale proceeds in £13 steps from £130 15s. upwards. Under it, a new minimum pension of 6/- per week will be payable to a widow with no children, whose yearly <Col N="2440" /> means do not exceed £130 15s.; to a widow with six children whose yearly means do not exceed £234 15s.; and to a widow with twelve children whose yearly means do not exceed £312 15s. The rate of the new pension will, of course, be higher than 6/- where the means of the widow are less than the new means limit appropriate to the size of her family.  For example, a widow with four dependent children and means not in excess of, say, £169 15s. a year, that is 65/6d. a week, will get a pension of at least 21/- a week as against nothing at present.  If she has seven dependent children, she could have means of £143 15s. a year, that is 55/3d. a week, and still get a pension of 46/- a week &mdash; as against nothing now &mdash; thus giving her a total weekly income of just over £5 a week. The number of widows who would become entitled to non-contributory pensions under these important concessions would, it is estimated, be about 400.</P>
    <P>I now come to a group of four amendments affecting the assistance services which I am sure will meet with the approval of Deputies of all shades of opinion in the House.  Two of these, in Section 6 and part of Section 7, are intended to facilitate and encourage the rehabilitation of certain handicapped persons for employment. It has been represented to me that there are recipients of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, who, having, for example, recovered from an illness such as tuberculosis, are not fit to resume their normal occupation and are anxious to find an alternative.  These persons can be rehabilitated and trained for some other occupation suitable to their diminished capacity but the law as it stands would operate to prevent them from continuing to receive unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit during a training course.  They are therefore deterred from the effort we would all be glad to see them make to get back to a full working life and a more comfortable livelihood than can be provided by unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit interspersed, perhaps, with spells of casual employment.  I accordingly propose to remove this deterrent, <Col N="2441" /> in so far as unemployment assistance is concerned, by relaxing certain provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Acts in favour of such persons while they are undergoing training with any organisation approved of by the Minister for Health for the purposes of the provision of such training.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill will enable persons receiving approved rehabilitation training to be regarded as unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work.  These, of course, are prior conditions for anybody seeking payment of unemployment assistance, apart from their means position.  I am satisfied that a very strong case exists for relaxing the qualification tests for unemployment assistance in this manner, and it is my intention to make a similar concession in relation to unemployment benefit; the latter can, however, be achieved by the amendment of existing regulations and legislation will not be required.  An amendment associated with Section 6 is included in Section 7.  Where trainees receive weekly allowances from the training organisation, such allowances would, unless we specifically provide otherwise, be reckonable as means so that the amount of unemployment assistance payable during training could be reduced considerably, or even cease altogether, in such cases with the result that the concession provided in the previous section would be rendered largely ineffective. It is proposed, therefore, that any such training allowances should be excluded altogether in the calculation of means for unemployment assistance purposes and Section 7 includes provision accordingly.</P>
    <P>The effect of these two amendments, taken together, will thus be that persons undergoing approved training courses will be treated as unemployed and available for work and entitled to receive unemployment assistance as if they had not undertaken the courses, the amount of any training allowance which they may receive being disregarded as means.  Apart altogether from the primary humanitarian motive for these concessions, the House will readily see that unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit paid in such circumstances, as well as, in many <Col N="2442" /> cases, being expediture of an immediately productive kind during training, can be an investment likely to result eventually in greater gain to the community, since it will afford to the persons in question the chance of being able to take up regular employment again after training instead of having to depend on unemployment assistance for, possibly, all the balance of their potential working lives.</P>
    <P>Two other amendments of the law are proposed in the Bill with the object of aiding efforts by voluntary bodies to assist certain handicapped persons to restore their morale through useful work.  These amendments provide for disregarding, within limits, certain earnings of such persons in assessing means for unemployment assistance and for non-contributory old age and widow's pension purposes.  The earnings in question are those arising from work done in their own homes by persons affected in one way or another by physical or mental handicap on materials provided by organisations operating schemes which are charitable in character and purpose.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me on behalf of one such organisation &mdash; a Co-operative Guild founded a few years ago in Dublin by a religious Order &mdash; that the application of the means test is discouraging or preventing the kind of person they are interested in from participating in such work because the people are afraid of losing their social assistance payments. The work is in itself useful and rewarding &mdash; consisting as it does of the making of toys, leather work, sewing, knitting and fancy goods &mdash; and those concerned with the scheme have good reason to believe that it has a profound and beneficial psychological effect on the morale of the persons participating.  I am satisfied, and I am confident of the support of Deputies of all Parties in this, that a relaxation of the means tests is justified in the case of persons participating in schemes of this kind and that it is desirable that the praiseworthy social service being undertaken by voluntary charitable organisations providing such work should be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, Section 7 also proposes <Col N="2443" /> the disregard of earnings of this kind of up to £104 a year for unemployment assistance purposes.  Because non-contributory old age and widow pensioners can already have means of approximately £1 a week, apart from any other special disregards applicable, without affecting title to full pension, Section 14, which deals with non-contributory old age and widows' pensions, limits the additional disregard now proposed under those schemes to £52 a year, as against £104 for unemployment assistance.  My information in relation to the Guild I mentioned is that the average earnings of the participants are appreciably less than £2 a week.  The people affected by the proposed amendments will, therefore, in many cases, have their full earnings from such a source disregarded. I may add that it is intended to put persons in receipt of social insurance benefits on the same footing in relation to work of this kind; this can be done by amendment of existing Regulations.  In order to control the application of these concessions it is proposed to limit them to persons participating in schemes which, in the opinion of the Minister for Social Welfare, are charitable in character and purpose and it is, perhaps, well that I should say now that the concessions will be granted only where I am satisfied as to the deserving character and trustworthiness of the voluntary organisation concerned.</P>
    <P>The remaining amendment relating to the assistance services is contained in Section 8, which provides for altering the statutory provision relating to the cessation of the pension of the non-contributory widow where she is under 48 years of age when the last child for whom an allowance in addition to pension is payable ceases to be a qualified child.  At present, if a non-contributory widow has not attained the age of forty-seven years and six months when the allowance in respect of her last qualified child ceases to be payable for any reason, her personal pension ceases six months afterwards.  It is proposed that the age requirement for the purpose of <Col N="2444" /> this provision should be reduced from 48 to 40 years.</P>
    <P>The age requirement of 48 years was fixed by the Social Welfare Act, 1948, and my Department's experience of the operation of this provision since then has shown that hardship was inflicted on the widow who was over 40 years of age but who had not attained 48 years of age when her last qualified child reached 16 years.  I have no doubt that I shall find general agreement that a widow who, up to the age of forty, has to look after young children, should not, thereafter, be deprived of pension.  At that age, her chances of re-entering any sort of remunerative employment in a highly competitive labour market are not good.  If she is able to obtain employment which will leave her in no need of assistance from the State the means scale will come into play to disqualify her or to reduce her pension as may be appropriate to the case.  Section 8 provides, therefore, that where a non-contributory widow, who has been receiving allowances for children, has reached the age of thirty-nine years and six months when her last child ceases to be eligible, her pension will continue, provided she remains otherwise qualified.  It is estimated that about 120 widows will benefit from this amendment.</P>

      <P>Before I go on to deal with the provisions of the Bill affecting the insurance schemes, it might be as well for me to dispose finally of the assistance side by taking a brief look at the financial aspects of the proposals which I have outlined.  The yearly cost of the increases in social assistance payments announced by the Minister for Finance in the Budget and provided for in Sections 2, 3 and 4 is estimated at £1,226,000.  This sum is made up of £783,000 in respect of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, £285,000 in respect of unemployment assistance and £158,000 in respect of non-contributory widows' pensions.  In the current financial year, the cost will be in the region of £825,000, since the increases take <Col N="2445" /> effect from the beginning of next month.</P>
      <P>The provisions for the extension and revision of the means limits in relation to non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions, and unemployment assistance, also contained in Sections 2 and 4, and in Section 5, will cost an additional £138,000 yearly, of which about £81,000 is for old age and blind pensions, £35,000 for unemployment assistance and £22,000 for widows' pensions.</P>
      <P>The provisions in Sections 6 and 7 relating to disabled persons undergoing courses of rehabilitation training will not, it is expected, involve any additional expenditure for the reason that those people would, in any event, probably continue to draw unemployment assistance (or benefit) if they did not undergo those training courses.  The provisions in Sections 7 and 14 for disregarding certain earnings of handicapped persons from work done at home under the aegis of approved charitable organisations will probably cost not more than £3,000 a year in all at present in view of the small numbers estimated to be affected at the present time.  The remaining amendment relating to the assistance side, that contained in Section 8 and affecting the qualifying age provisions for certain non-contributory widows, will, it is estimated, cost about £10,000 yearly.  The total estimated annual cost of the additional, or &ldquo;non-Budget&rdquo;, concessions thus amounts to the appreciable sum of £151,000; as these improvements are also to come into effect as from 1st August, their cost in the current financial year would be around £100,000, or 12½ per cent. over and above the Budget provision of £825,000.  The aggregate cost of all the Social Assistance provisions in the Bill is thus £925,000 in the current year, or £1,377,000 in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions of the Bill relating to the social insurance scheme.  In the course of his Budget statement, the Minister for Finance also announced that the Government had under consideration the improvement of the contributory insurance schemes and that the intention was that the new rates of contribution and <Col N="2446" /> benefit would commence in January, 1963.  Deputies will, no doubt, be aware that the contributory benefits are paid out of the Social Insurance Fund to which the State, employers and insured persons contribute in roughly equal shares.  A provisional allowance of £200,000 was made in the Budget as the State contribution towards the extra cost of the increased benefits in the last quarter of the current financial year.  The improvements which it is proposed to make in the social insurance scheme are contained in Sections 9 and 11 to 13 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for an increase of 5/- weekly in the basic personal rates of disability and unemployment benefit, maternity allowance, widow's (contributory) pension, orphan's (contributory) allowance and old age (contributory) pension.  It also provides that the allowance for an adult dependant, where payable with any of those benefits, shall be increased by 5/-, and that the special weekly rate of disability and unemployment benefit for married women and persons under 18 years shall be increased by 4/-. Allowances for each qualified child, where payable with any of those benefits, go up by 3/-.  The rate of benefit payable to a surviving adult dependant of a deceased old age (contributory) pensioner is also being increased, by 5/-, under Section 11, to keep it in line with the rate of adult dependant's allowance.  The increased rates of disability and unemployment benefit and maternity allowance and of any associated dependants' allowances will come into effect on the first Monday in 1963, that is 7th January, 1963, from which date the new rates of contribution will also operate.  The new rates of widow's (contributory) pension, orphan's (contributory) allowance, old age (contributory) pension and survivor's benefit, and any allowances payable with them, will come into effect on the first Friday in 1963, that is to say, 4th January, 1963, the first normal payday in the New Year.</P>
    <P>These increases in benefits are quite substantial and generally they are about double those provided for non-contributory beneficiaries.  Their effect <Col N="2447" /> can best be shown by some examples. An insured man with a wife and four dependent children will receive £5 4s. 6d. a week when ill or unemployed as compared with £4 2s. 6d. at present, an increase of 22/- or almost 27 per cent; if he has six children, he will receive £6 Os. 6d. as against £4 12s. 6d. now, an increase of 28/-, or 30 per cent.  A widow in receipt of widow's (contributory) pension who has four dependent children will receive £4 2s. a week as compared with £3 5s. at present, an increase of 17/-, or 26 per cent.; if she has six children, her rate of pension will go up from £3 15s. a week to £4 18s., an increase of 23/-, or nearly 31 per cent.  A married man receiving full old age (contributory) pension which includes an allowance for his wife will receive £4 a week as against £3 10s. at present, an increase of 10/-, or over 14 per cent.  A guardian of four orphans will receive an increase of 20/-, bringing his total orphan's allowance to £5 a week, an improvement of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that these increased rates of benefit will increase expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund heavily and an increase in rates of contribution by employers and insured persons is, therefore, unavoidable. New rates of employment contributions are provided for in Section 12.  An increase of 1/6d. per week, or 9d. each for employer and insured person, is the most that will be required.  This increase applies only to those contributions which count for all benefits.  Contributions which give title to limited benefits are being increased by an amount related to the cost of the increases in those benefits only.  A special concession is being made, however, in the case of male agricultural workers who, although covered for all benefits, will only be charged 1/- extra of which 6d. will be payable by the employer.</P>
    <P>The effect of these contribution increases will be seen from a few examples.  The ordinary male worker at present paying 4/6d. per week will pay 5/3d. while his employer will pay a similar amount.  An ordinary <Col N="2448" /> female worker will pay 4/2d. instead of 3/5d. a week and her employer will pay 4/11d. instead of 4/2d., that is, an extra 9d. each.  The male agricultural worker will pay 3/-, as will his employer, as against 2/6d. each at present.  In the case of outworkers, sharefishermen and female agricultural workers whose contributions do not cover unemployment benefit, the total increase will be 1/2d., from 4/3d. to 5/5d., of which the worker will pay 2/4d., that is, an extra 7d.  A female domestic, whose contribution likewise does not cover unemployment benefit, will also pay an additional 7d. a week, as will her employer, bringing the total contribution rate from 5/9d. to 6/11d., of which the worker will pay 3/1d.</P>
    <P>The contributions paid by men in employment compulsorily insurable for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes only, for example, civil servants, teachers, officers of local authorities, etc., will be increased by 4d. from 2/6d. to 2/10d. a week, while the contributions in respect of women so employed will continue to be half the men's rate, that is, the new rate will be 1/5d. instead of 1/3d.  In Section 9, the rates of voluntary contributions are being increased by 4d. in the case of the contribution which reckons for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes only, and by 8d. in the case of the contribution which covers old age (contributory) pension as well.  The new rates of contribution will come into effect on 7th January, 1963, the commencement of the next contribution year for men.</P>
    <P>These increases in contributions by employers and workers will yield an estimated £1,882,000, which is exactly two-thirds of the estimated annual cost of the increases in insurance benefits &mdash; £2,823,000.  This leaves the remaining one-third &mdash; £941,000 &mdash; to be borne by the State in a full year, or about £235,000 in the current year.  The financing of the new benefits therefore follows the arrangement that the State, employers and insured persons contribute in approximately equal shares towards the cost of the scheme.  The overall annual expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund following the increases will be in the region of <Col N="2449" /> £20,542,000, of which £13,360,000 will be met by contributions from employers and insured persons together with income from investments and other miscellaneous sources, so that the total Exchequer contribution to the Fund will be about £7,182,000 a year or 34.96 per cent. of the total income of the Fund.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill was prepared, I invited the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers on the proposals to increase insurance benefits and contributions. The observations made by these organisations were duly considered before the proposed increases were finally determined.  In this connection, I would like to stress that the increased rates of benefit proposed are the most favourable that can be provided on the basis of the proposed increases in contribution rates and within the existing framework of the social insurance scheme which, as I have already pointed out, depends for its finance on roughly equal contributions by the State, employers and insured persons.  As I have shown, the State is doing its share and I would recall to the House the figure of £235,000 which I mentioned a few moments ago as the cost to the Exchequer in the current year of the insurance proposals in the Bill.  This sum is approximately one-sixth more than the allocation of £200,000 provisionally made in the Budget for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The opportunity presented by the Bill is also being taken to make a minor amendment of the law on the insurance side.  The change is of a concessionary nature and is contained in Section 10.  This section extends the existing statutory provision for a refund of the old age (contributory) pension portion of insurance contributions, paid by a person who enters insurance after the age of 60, to cover a person whose only insurance before the age of 60 was for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes.  The existing refund of contributions is made because it is a condition for old age (contributory) pension that a person must have entered insurance before the age of 60 and a person who enters <Col N="2450" /> insurance after that age is debarred from deriving any benefit from the old age pension portion of his contributions although statutorily required to pay them.  Insurance contributions paid for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes only do not count for old age (contributory) pension and a person who has only been insured for widows' and orphans' pensions before age 60 and becomes insured for old age (contributory) pension for the first time after that age, will not normally have a sufficient insurance record to qualify for pension.  He is, therefore, in much the same position as a person who had no insurance at all before the age of 60 and I am satisfied that a refund of the old age (contributory) pension contributions paid by him is equally justified.  The number of cases involving this refund would be very small and the cost would therefore be negligible.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, it may be helpful to summarise the cost to the Exchequer of the various proposals which I have outlined.  In relation to Social Assistance the total costs are £1,377,000 in a full year and £925,000 in the current financial year.  The cost of the social insurance proposals is £941,000 in a full year and £235,000 in the current year.  The overall cost to the Exchequer will therefore be £2,318,000 &mdash; nearly two and one-third million pounds &mdash; in a full year and £1,160,000 in the present year.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending this measure to the House, and I would ask for expeditious and favourable consideration for it in order that the proposed commencement of its social assistance provisions on the first day of next month can be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has awaited the introduction of this Bill for so long that there is no doubt that Deputies will at least welcome its introduction even at this late hour.  In concluding his statement, the Minister asked for expeditious and favourable consideration for the Bill in order that the provisions may operate on the first day of next month.  The House will co-operate with the Minister in the circumstances, but I feel it incumbent <Col N="2451" /> on me to draw the attention of the House to the fact that a great deal of time has elapsed since the Minister for Finance announced on 10th April last that it was the intention of the Government to grant these increases.  The House will recall that, in the interim, other legislation has been passed giving increases in incomes to particular classes.  For instance, in relation to the judges, moneys voted here were made payable retrospective to 1st November last.  Old age pensioners, and others, have been forced to wait since 10th April for the provisions of this Bill. Many old people who read in the papers last week about this increase had forgotten that it had been promised so long ago.  It had escaped their memories and they wondered if this was an additional increase.  It had to be brought to their notice that it was only now the Government were implementing the assurance given to this House on 10th April last.</P>
      <P>We welcome these provisions designed to alleviate the difficulties under which these classes are existing at the moment.  All Deputies are at one in desiring that the State should come to the assistance of those classes who we believe should have the first demand on the State's resources.  One can only comment on the meagreness of the increase, remembering the speeches delivered in certain social circles by prominent members of the Government.  From these statements, one would imagine that the Government could do better for these classes, if the assessment of the country's finances adumbrated in these statements and the assessment of our economic situation were correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Section 2 which provides for an easement in the means test.  I welcome the raising of the ceiling from £104 to £130.  The former figure has operated since 1952.  The increase being given now represents 25 per cent. Since 1952, the cost of living has increased from 115 points to 158 points, representing an increase in the order of 40 per cent.  The Government now proposes to give an increase of 25 per cent. to offset the cost-of-living increase of 40 per cent.  If one takes <Col N="2452" /> into account the depreciation in the value of money, the increase is even less favourable.  Bearing these two factors in mind, the increase is the least that should be provided now.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it has been my experience, as I am sure it is the experience of other Deputies, that in the past few years there appears to have been a more rigid application of the means test.  If that is true, it is to be hoped that those who were denied any assistance during that period, because of the rigidity of the means test, will now obtain the benefits they were denied during that period.</P>
    <P>There are some parts of this Bill which it is rather difficult to understand. Since the Minister is anxious for expeditious consideration of the measure, it is to be assumed the House will not have very much time for closer consideration of the measure on Committee Stage.  Section 10 amends Section 9 of the Act of 1952.  Section 9 of the Act of 1952 deals with the return of sums paid in error by way of contribution, whereas the amending Section 10 deals with the qualification of a person over 60 who first becomes insurable after that age.  Section 9 of the 1952 Act reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Regulations shall provide for the return, subject to any conditions, restrictions and deductions specified in the regulations, of any sums paid in error by way of contribution.</P>
    <P>The only other point is that in Section 12 the phrase &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; is used.  I think that should be amended to read &ldquo;the Act of 1952&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  This Bill designed to alleviate conditions for certain classes will be welcomed by everybody.  It is a matter for regret that other classes have been given precedence over these unfortunate people who have had to wait so long for the benefits announced by the Minister tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be generally gratified, I think, that some improvements are being made in our social welfare legislation, not only for <Col N="2453" /> the socially insured classes but also for those classes which have unfortunately to rely on our social assistance schemes.  While I do not blame the Minister for trying to hitch his introductory speech, in his self-congratulatory way, as high as possible, I think at the same time that we must look at the situation realistically and not be carried away with pre-war notions of how much the £ buys.  When thinking of the £'s which will be payable to these people, one has to remember that the £ today is worth about 7/- in terms of 1939 purchasing power.  When one talks about giving a person £4 a week, one can reckon that as 28/- in terms of 1939 purchasing power.  In fact, relatively speaking, what we are doing now is giving them, where we give them £4 under our present legislation, a 1938 or 1939 purchasing power of four times the present value of the £ or 28/-.</P>
      <P>It is against that background one must consider what the Minister proposes doing here.  As the Minister and his Department know only too well &mdash; we can prove it, if necessary, by Parliamentary Questions next week &mdash; the situation is not exactly as depicted by the Minister.  In the Tables the Minister talks about what a person will get if she is a widow with six children, or what a man, with six children, drawing unemployment assistance will get.  That does not mean that every person with six children will get this rate of benefit.  They must be six qualified children, that is, they have to go through the test or qualification.  You may find a family where the widow has six children but not all of the six will qualify under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Similarly in regard to unemployment assistance, not all of the children will qualify for benefit under this Bill.  My recollection is that the number of families with six children who are likely to be claimants under Social Welfare legislation, taking the number of persons to whom unemployment assistance is paid or to whom widows' and orphans' pensions are paid, is relatively negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, while reading out the <Col N="2454" /> figures of the new rates, admitted that that is the case.  He told us of the proposal to increase the income limit of widows, that is, to allow them to earn a certain amount of money before they were disqualified from receiving a widow's pension.  After painting the picture in quite good colours, the Minister said the total number of widows affected is 400 in the whole country, not a very large number if it is spread over 26 counties.  However, it reads very well, I agree, and I do not blame the Minister for taking any credit he can for that.  Nevertheless we must keep a sense of proportion and remember that the number of people who can qualify to get this benefit is not nearly as great as one would think from a cursory reading of the Minister's statement.</P>
    <P>For instance, the Minister says the 1948 Social Welfare Act fixed the age for a widow without a qualified child at 48 and that below that age the person could not get a widow's non-contributory pension.  That is so but the previous Social Welfare Act fixed 55 years of age and it provided that if the widow was under 55 years of age she could not get a widow's non-contributory pension.  The 1948 Social Welfare Act lowered that qualifying age from 55 to 48.  A number of people were thereby enabled to get a widow's non-contributory pension who would not have got it if the 55 years of age in the previous Social Welfare Act had remained.  The Minister says that over the whole country only 120 widows will benefit by the reduction from 48 to 40.  The reduction appears substantial.  It looks as if it might let in a considerable number of people who are now cut off from benefit but the Minister's statement that the number of people who will benefit by that amelioration in present conditions is only 120 reveals the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has agreed that the training allowances which are paid to handicapped children to help in their rehabilitation will be disregarded for the purpose of ascertaining their entitlement to social welfare benefits.  Many of the organisations which have set themselves the <Col N="2455" /> task of rehabilitating afflicted humanity have found themselves thwarted in many directions by their subjects for rehabilitation being deprived of social welfare benefits because of any training allowances which they were paid in the course of rehabilitation. The Minister has met that situation well and I think everybody will be satisfied that so far as the handicapped section of the community are concerned the State desires they should get every possible facility in order to enable them as speedily as possible to become useful members of society again.</P>
    <P>The Minister perhaps might go a little further in that respect.  Some of the organisations which deal with handicapped persons, with persons perhaps physically or mentally retarded, may not find it economically possible to pay the normal rate of wage for the work the handicapped person is doing.  It may be possible for them to pay only some allowance for the work.  I should imagine the Minister would be rendering very useful assistance to these organisations if he were to take power to allow the handicapped persons, who are receiving pay for work which they do but not the normal rate of pay for the job well done, to receive some portion of unemployment assistance as well, so that while they are learning occupations at which they are temporarily employed, under considerable difficulties, their inadequate pay will be supplemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, however, in another connection that when he contemplates the granting of certain concessions to handicapped persons or to persons working for voluntary organisations on a kind of charitable basis, he wants to ensure by a very strict application of tests that this voluntary work is done by genuine organisations and organisations which are genuinely charitable.  I would ask the Minister not to rule so rigorously in respect of organisations.  There are many people, old widows, old age pensioners, seamstresses and that type of person who can do little jobs in their own homes by which they can manage to earn small sums of money <Col N="2456" /> from week to week and from month to month and for which, of course, it is known they get some income.  In these cases I do not think violence would be done to any sound principle if the Minister were to be generous in fixing a high means test for persons of that kind.  They are not going to work for anybody else.  They are working at home in such circumstances and at such occupations.  It is probably a way of sweetening old age as far as old age can be sweetened.  There is everything to be said for permitting these elderly persons or perhaps physically handicapped persons, not able to walk or not able, for one reason or another, to mix with their fellow citizens, to carry on any avocation they can and for disregarding any relatively small income they get from these avocations when they are seeking benefit under social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>I have said before in this House &mdash; I think it will bear repetition &mdash; that while we are inclined to preen ourselves on our standard of social legislation, the plain unvarnished fact emerges that our standard of social legislation is lower than in Britain, is lower than in the Six Counties and is lower than in any other country in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>If we are to go into the Common Market, which has as one of its targets the harmonising of social welfare policy so as to ensure equitable conditions in the various countries and among the various classes of workers employed in the production and the export of goods, then inevitably and essentially we must lift up our social welfare services.  It does not look as if we are, through this Bill, moving in the direction of overtaking Western Europe in this respect.  Western Europe continues to go on with its social welfare legislation and the gap between West European social welfare services and ours is considerable and very much to our disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In fact, I do not see that we are catching up on that gap.  Parliamentary Questions have enabled us to ascertain that our social welfare expenditure, in recent years in par- <Col N="2457" /> ticular, is showing a drop in relation to tax revenue.  I shall quote a few examples to highlight what I mean. Tax revenue in 1957-58 was £102.7 million and social welfare expenditure was £25.5 million, so that our social welfare expenditure was 24.8 per cent. of our tax revenue in that year.  In 1959-60, our tax revenue was £107.3 million and our social welfare expenditure was £25.5 million or 23.8 per cent. of our tax revenue.  We come to 1960-61 when our tax revenue was £114.9 million and our social welfare expenditure was £26.2 million &mdash; only 22.8 per cent. of our tax revenue.  In 1961-62, the tax revenue at £118.3 million was able to contribute £26.4 million to social welfare services &mdash; 22.3 per cent. of the tax revenue.  That means that we spent 24.8 per cent. of our tax revenue on social welfare services in 1957-58 and had fallen in 1961-62 to 22.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The position since 1958 has been that tax revenue has gone up by £32 million, whereas only £2 million more has been spent on social welfare services.  In 1958, 5/- in the £ of tax revenue was spent on social welfare, whereas this year it is only 4/- in the £.  Even in this year's Budget, the tax revenue has increased by nearly £10 million; yet only one-tenth of that increase has found its way into social welfare services.  It must be borne in mind that even in this Bill, on the insurance side, the ordinary provision is made possible very largely by the substantial increase in contributions payable by the employers, on the one hand, and the employees, on the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the increases in contributions by employers and workers will yield an estimated £1,882,000 which, he says, is exactly two-thirds of the estimated annual cost of the increases in insurance benefits &mdash; £2,800,000.  However, I am one of those who believe that we should, as far as we can, try to put an insurance foundation under our social legislation.  We have found that wherever that is not so, the rates of the benefits have been extremely small, that expenditure of that kind is always the target for cuts in times of recession and that the rates <Col N="2458" /> generally for non-contributory services are always very far short of the needs and circumstances for which they were originally devised.</P>
    <P>I think therefore we ought as far as we can try to put an insurance basis under these contributions, although it must be recognised that acting on behalf of the whole community, the State has a very heavy responsibility to ensure that provisions for contingencies such as illness and widowhood are contingencies which the State could reasonably be expected to endow on more than an ordinary one-third basis and that employers generally having regard to the welfare of their workers, could be expected to take special recognition of what they owe and what industry owes to the community in that respect.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I welcome the Bill as providing increases to many needy classes in the community.  As I say, any expenditure of this kind among the sections concerned will have the support and the goodwill of all Parties in the House.  What we must remember, however, is that while what we are doing is praiseworthy &mdash; every increase in social welfare benefits is praiseworthy for those who have to live on the benefits &mdash; we still have a long way to go before our services in this respect are as good as those of our neighbours or of the friends we hope to meet in the European Economic Community in the world of 1963 and onward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to comment on this legislation because the figures here are so thoroughly mean and pitifully inadequate for the needs of the people that I find it impossible that the Government would have come into the House and offer them to Deputies without an apology for their gross inadequacy.  I suppose it would have been too much to expect that the Government would have arranged to give to the Minister for Justice his proposals to provide some members of the Judiciary with £6,000 a year, and then ask the Minister for Social Welfare to come in a couple of days later in the same week and put forward these absurdly inadequate figures for other members of our community for our consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2459" /> There still seems to me to be a considerable residue in this country of the old aristocratic outlook of &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;they&rdquo;, the old outlook that so long as a minority are well off and well looked after, it does not matter what happens to the vast majority of our people.  I cannot see how anyone knowing the value of money after the precipitous displacement of currency that has taken place in recent years, both from internal causes and from causes outside the control of the Government, could possible conceive that a widow with children to feed, an unemployed married man, a single man, or an old person could live on these sums and not go hungry.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously suggest that it is possible to feed, clothe and house a family adequately on the few shillings he is throwing to these people? Everyone must know from factual experience and from surveys carried out, particularly the nutrition survey and the household budget inquiries, that there is a great discrepancy between the standard of living of the masses of the people and the minority within the group.  We were asked recently by the Minister for Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us these figures at a time when we are all fully aware that this 2/6, this small figure, has little or no real value as currency in the present condition of living costs.  It is interesting to recall that nearly 30 years ago the figure of 2/6 became a political issue in regard to the old age pensioners.  It is conceivable that it was important as a political issue at that time, because it meant something in the Thirties, but it has no real meaning whatsoever as an alleged alleviation of the conditions of the old people, the unemployed or the widows with children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The widow is probably the most pathetic of all.  She is put into her position by a completely fortuitous act of God.  Suddenly from having a reasonable standard of living with a breadwinner, she finds herself deprived <Col N="2460" /> of her husband.  Surely that is hard enough on anyone, but in addition, she is deprived of the breadwinner and her children are deprived of their father.  There are also a lot of psychological by-products and, in turn, we impose serious physical hardships. They are imposed in our allegedly Christian society.  I completely repudiate the suggestion that society as we see it in Ireland where it is applied to the social welfare groups, and to the socially dependent groups, can be called or accepted to be a Christian society.</P>
    <P>There are these unfortunate women; there are not very many of them.  We are asked to look after minorities but this is a minority which the Minister and his colleagues do not care to look after as they should look after them.  I see no reason why anyone should be given £5,000 or £6,000 a year in a society which can only offer a woman and her children, a family, £2 or £3 a week to live on, or even £4 or £5 a week.  There is a basic minimum requirement which can be readily ascertained by reference to the nutrition survey and the household budget inquiries which have been carried out. Anyone who refers to them and has any knowledge of the cost of the simplest and most basic needs of human nature must know that these figures do not add up to a sufficiency for the average mother to buy food for her children, or for the old person or the unemployed person to take care of himself.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the 24/- a week offered to the unemployed man is just money to get out, money to pay for a single ticket to John Bull. John Bull will take him, feed him, clothe him, care for him when he gets sick, and finally when he grows old. Are the Minister and the Government not ashamed of this hiving off of the unwanted amongst our population on to a stranger's front door?  I am ashamed of it.</P>
    <P>It is a function of the properly organised society to so organise itself as to find work for all its citizens. That is included in our Constitution. These people are not unemployed just because they do not want work.  They <Col N="2461" /> will not get the benefits, unless it can be shown that they cannot get work. No longer can we sneer and say they are unemployable or that they would not work in a fit.  No longer is that valid because if they are offered a job, they must take it.  There is not a job for them.  They are unemployed through no fault of their own, but because of our failure to educate them properly, or to provide them with a trade, a profession or a skill by reason of the gross inadequacy of the educational system.</P>
    <P>That is why those unfortunate people are unemployed, and all we do when they fall unemployed is pitch them out on their necks, show them the gangplanks and press 24/- into their hands which will probably pay for a single ticket.  That is the end of it. That is the way we discharge our responsibility.  How can we say that in this way we are caring for our fellow citizens in our society?  How can we pretend that is Christianity? Surely it is blasphemy to talk in those terms when that is the way we look after our dependants.  If you want to see Christianity go to the North of Ireland, Great Britain, the Scandinavian countries, Norway and Denmark. The people there never talk about Christianity but they would teach you by the way they behave, not by the way they preach.  We are specialists in preaching but when it comes to practice, our pockets are empty.  We decide to adopt a particular form of economy&mdash;private enterprise capitalism. This is one of the penalties. Every time I stand up I have to point to another one.  We cannot afford to educate our children properly.  We cannot afford to have proper health services.</P>

This is all we can afford, but it is an admission of failure and they do not seem to see it.  It is an admission of the failure of the fiscal and economic policies in which they believe &mdash; private <Col N="2462" /> enterprise capitalism.  The socialist societies have shown it is possible to plan for full employment.  They have shown it is possible to have a planned economy to provide full employment&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not propose to do so.  Meantime, it is the same in regard to the care of old people.  We say here we can afford to give them, some of them, those who have no income at all, only just a little over 30/- a week.  Nobody can pretend that he could live on that amount.  If I were given 30/- today and were told that for the rest of my life all I would get was 30/- a week I simply would not be able to live on it.  I defy the present Minister, Deputy Boland, to do so.  I would refuse to believe he could live on that amount for the rest of his life.  Would he tell me whether he really believes it would be possible to get by for the rest of his life on the pittance he is here offering to people when they become eligible for the old age pension?</P>
      <P>The Minister is a member of the Cabinet.  He has to accept Cabinet responsibility, I suppose.  He is merely sent in here to put forward these pleas. We cannot blame him exclusively.  At the same time, it is a Cabinet which thinks it is important to give people, another section of society, £6,000 a year because of the various stupid reasons put forward, because of the necessity to have a status symbol, because of the necessity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case which has been put forward by the Minister's colleagues that in our society we look down on the members of the community who have very little income. <Col N="2463" /> Well, now, these are old people.  These people are the men and women who have served society, who have served the nation.  According to the Minister's colleague, these are people on whom we must look down.  Is that right?  Is that correct?  Is that the attitude of the Minister?  Does he believe old people have not the right to honour or dignity or the right to live in dignified retirement merely because they have become dependent on us, the society generally, or the State?</P>
      <P>We criticise the family which does not look after its old people and yet we as a family, we as the community, do not discharge this simplest of responsibilities.  I am surprised that the Minister has not listened to his colleague, the Minister for Justice. Presumably, all these arguments were used when the matter was considered in the Cabinet.  Presumably, all these arguments were used in relation to old age pensioners, the widows, the unemployed and the judiciary.  Why should they apply to one and not to the other?</P>
      <P>We know the position from surveys that have been carried out, the surveys I have mentioned earlier.  We know that our society is divided quite clearly into two groups.  The groups which are mentioned in this Bill are the unemployed, the old age pensioners, the widow and her children, the unemployed and their children.  It has been shown, through physical examination, that the children of the unemployed and the children of the widow are undersized, are underweight and, generally, are found to be of less sound nutrition than the children of, say, people in the professional classes or in the wealthier classes in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is completely amoral that a Government should take a step in relation to completely innocent victims such as the children of an unemployed man or the children of a widow and should penalise them in this way for something over which they have no control whatsoever.  We know quite well that when we offer a widow this handful of coins or an unemployed parent this <Col N="2464" /> handful of coins to feed themselves and their children, to clothe themselves and their children, to house themselves for a week, they cannot do it.  As I say, to the single man a nod is as good as a wink and he gets out. The next thing we do is in relation to the widow and her children and in relation to the unemployed man, the family man, and his children.  We force him to get out.  Again, with typical and consistent hypocrisy, in complete denial of one of the Articles of the Constitution, that the family is the basic unit of our society, we proceed with this kind of fiscal and economic policy to disrupt the family unit.</P>
    <P>No matter how much the widow may be needed at home, she must go out and look for employment and, in that way, the family is disrupted.  It should be our purpose, objective and aim to try to ensure that that woman can stay with her family, can look after them, can nourish them and can bring up her children as the average natural mother wants to bring up her children. Instead of that, we drive them out.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the unemployed man eventually, if he has any &ldquo;go&rdquo; in him at all, refuses to accept this pittance from the State and he, too, takes the emigrant ship.  There is, yet again, another example of disrupting the family as a result of fiscal or Government policy and Ministerial policy which must now be a considered and clearly understood policy because it has gone on for so long.</P>
    <P>We have the children, then.  There is lack of parental control.  There are the other aspects all of which lead to juvenile delinquency with the youngsters ending up in the courts.  Then there is the period of lecturing them on their failure and all the other things which are expressions of our own shallow-mindedness, all the result of the policies of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I tried to find out the facts, in relation to the household burden, in the budget survey.  There are many basic needs in any family.  I just took some of them, not all.  I priced them in an effort to see how somebody could get by on the proposals put forward here by the Minister.  The Minister may be <Col N="2465" /> able to correct my figures marginally but I think that, broadly, they are true. &mdash; Eight pounds of bread per week is the average figure assessed as consumed by the individual; seven pints of milk; just under 1 lb. of butter; just over four eggs; four ounces of tea; just over 1½ lb. of sugar; just under 1 lb. of meat and 8 lb. of potatoes.  At present costs, those come to just under £2 and they are not all the needs of an individual, according to this survey which was carried out just ten years ago.</P>
    <P>In addition, a person &mdash; the widow with her children; the unemployed parent with his children; the old age pensioner &mdash; must face other expenses. This is for one person, incidentally. For each person in the house, just under £2 must be found for food.  Then they must find transport costs.  They must clothe themselves; they must find books for school in some cases; they must try to get the occasional luxury, possibly tobacco, cigarettes or a pint of beer, whatever it may be &mdash; all of these things on the grossly inadequate amount put forward here by the Minister. Of course, I welcome the slightest increase in the inadequate sums which have been made available to these unfortunate groups over the years but the Minister should not feel the slightest degree of satisfaction.  He should accept that so far as he and his Department are concerned he has, as most of his predecessors have done, failed to discharge his responsibility to the dependent classes in our community as they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill which fills a long-felt want.  The Bill does not provide as much as any of us would like, but I am satisfied that it is as much as the nation's economy can afford.  It is a good sign of our economy that we are able to give more to deserving sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard reasoned speeches from Deputy Norton and Deputy O'Sullivan. I am sorry Deputy Dr. Browne's speech was not more reasoned.  Like the Deputy, I could make a very fine speech here brimful of attacks on the <Col N="2466" /> Government and on the Minister with a view, of course, to political kudos at all times.  There is one difference. Perhaps I could put a veneer of sincerity on it and that is more than Deputy Dr. Browne was able to do. One would imagine from the way the Deputy looked down his nose at this measure that it meant only a few pence, shillings or pounds.  Is he aware that this will cost £2¼ million?  That extra amount is being given to the needy sections of the community, and if that is a crime we are guilty of it.</P>
    <P>The income limits for the means test are to be extended.  The ceiling is to be raised.  These are very hopeful signs indicating the day to which we all look forward, when the nation will be able to afford pensions and allowances and other benefits with no means test.  That day, I hope, will come but I am not going to listen to any Deputy telling us that under John Bull our people would certainly be better off. Certainly they would not.  We of the older generation know what the widowers and old people got in those hard days.  We are not likely to forget it.  In the glorious days of John Bull here when the widows went to the home assistance office they got half-a-crown or three shillings.  They could lump it or leave it.  If they grumbled they got nothing at all and there was nobody to bring the authorities to book for it.  The old age pensioners were getting 5/- a week and that only from 1909.  It went on at that rate until 1932.  The unemployed were not getting any social assistance from the Government.  The great measures, one after another, that have been put before the House to benefit needy sections of the community in some way, make us feel especially proud of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am tired of listening to people who are always pessimistic.  Pessimism is certainly bad for everyone when there is no necessity for it.  This measure gives another £2¼ million and we are proud of it.  It is less than a year since Section 19 of the 1961 Act was implemented and that also was an advance in social welfare of which every membe of this House and every right-thinking person outside it can feel <Col N="2467" /> very proud.  It meant that people such as roadworkers, and those in receipt of pensions of one kind or another, when they attain the age of 70, were entitled to the first £165 of those pensions without that amount being assessable for income.  We are proud to congratulate the present Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to examine this year the advisability and the feasibility of accepting British stamps for the purpose of contributory pensions. I should like to see him alter the regulations governing the means test in so far as they relate to widows because we find that a widow on a small farm seeking the widow's pension is not allowed for labour on that holding under the present regulations. We very seldom find a widow with a large holding seeking a widow's pension. I ask the Minister to look into that matter.  I consider that it is unfair and contrary to Irish thinking. When the Minister has fully examined it he will be inclined to agree with me that genuine labour on the holding should be allowed for in the case of a widow seeking a pension.  A concession there would do more good than all the arguing and unnecessary criticism of certain Deputies.  By making the allowance I suggest we shall bring into this class some very deserving people.  I have never been able to understand why they should not get an allowance for labour on their farms.</P>
    <P>We have heard some attacks that could be described as very savage on social welfare officers but in my long experience I can truthfully say that I have never heard of an officer, for political, or any other purpose, trying to penalise any individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  While the Bill offers certain improvements in both social welfare assistance and benefits it does not go as far as any of us hoped it would go.  I do not propose to cover the items already dealt with by Deputy Norton but there are one or two matters to which I should like to refer and to which he did not refer.</P>
      <P>The new sections of the Bill provide for the extension of income limits so that certain people who are not, or were not, eligible for assistance at present will become eligible, but I am rather surprised to find that the extension of the income limits does not bring those people into benefit for the same type of pension as the lowest rate benefit being paid now.  In fact, in the case of widows, what it proposes to do is to give a pension of 6/- a week.  I wonder whether the Minister realises that 6/- a week at the present time is more of an insult than an addition to income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In one particular case, it is only 6/-.  I am dealing with what the Minister has set out in his own statement.  It is a fact that there are certain people who will qualify for an increase of 6/- a week in 1962.  A State body recently gave an increase of 6/- a week to agricultural workers and we thought it was a terrible shame.  Now the Minister expects us to applaud and clap because he proposes to give a benefit of that amount to these people.  I will say no more about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, Departmental officials, when examining for the means test, went as far as to check on the gardens of certain widows to find out if they had been growing a few heads of cabbage or a few drills of potatoes to help themselves out.  As a matter of fact, they actually did assess these vegetables as means.  I should be glad if the Minister would instruct these people that if somebody tries to help <Col N="2469" /> herself by growing a few vegetables, they should not be taken into account. That kind of thing is a shame and it is something that has been passed down from one Government to another.  I am not going to make a political point of it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the increase in the stamps.  In this connection, the Minister has carried on a bad old system, that is, that while certain people are required to pay increased contributions, they are debarred from drawing unemployment benefit.  I refer particularly to the female agricultural labourers of whom there are quite a large number in the country, to domestic servants and to such people who cannot draw unemployment benefit.  There is no reason why these people should be placed in the category of fifth or sixth-class citizens.  Everybody else, with the exception of criminals, are allowed to draw these benefits.  And these people must pay their increased share of the stamp.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the farm worker would only be required to pay 6d. as his share of the contribution. That 6d. increase for the stamp is one-twelfth of the increase which these farm workers recently obtained.  It may seem to the Minister to be a very small amount but to the farm worker it is one-twelfth of the increase he has obtained.  We are now asking them to pay back 6d. out of the 6/- as an increase in the price of the insurance stamp.  I do not think that is reasonable or logical.</P>
    <P>Share fishermen and road workers are also included in this section.  Would the Minister have another look at the section in the near future &mdash; I know he cannot do it now &mdash; to see if something can be done to ensure that these people will be treated as normal human beings, so that when they are out of a job, they can sign at the employment exchange and draw unemployment benefit?  I welcome the increase to be given next January to a certain type of people.  It is a good thing to see that they are getting an increase but the amount appears to me to be less than it should be.  It is all right to say, as Deputy Davern has said, that <Col N="2470" /> the amount provided totals upwards of £2 million but I would remind the Minister that of that £2 million the insured workers are providing a considerable amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>I will take issue with the Minister on that point at a later stage because this document has come to me too late to verify the exact figures. The only other comment I have to make is that if the Minister intends to increase, as he claims here, the amount being allowed under the non-contributory pensions would he consider the qualifications for the contributory pensions?  I believe he has made a regulation which debars a considerable number of old people who were insured all their lives from a contributory old age pension.  That is one of the matters which is causing very great dissatisfaction.</P>

      <P>I have little to say but having spoken on the Budget, I want to make my contribution.  I am satisfied that the Minister has done the best he could and, as has already been stated, he has improved the Budget position by £138,000.  Much play was made about the small amount granted in the Budget to old age pensioners compared with the amount given to judges.  Deputies forgot the fact that the total amount by which judges would benefit would be about £5,000 a year after income tax was deducted whereas the cost of the increase of 2/6 is £1,377,000.  The comparison was therefore dishonest.  It was dishonest to compare what certain people would get, namely, the £5,000, with what a quarter of a million people would get, amounting to £1,377,000. It was said they should have got 5/-or 10/-, but if they were to get 10/- it would have cost £5¼ millions extra. The very people who said that refused to vote for the £1,377,000, but still they said more should be granted.  That is a dishonest approach.  I am sure if the Opposition had voted for the increased taxation it might have encouraged the Minister and he might have done better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those people who complain should do so only if they can prove that they would do better.  There is only one way by which we can demonstrate whether people really would do better and that is by their past record.  I do not think what the Opposition did in the past shows that they would do better in the future.  I am satisfied they would not have done better.  In order to be enlightened on this matter I tabled a question last week regarding the increases granted to old age pensioners for the last 12 years since 1950.  The answer was that in 1951 they got 2/6; in 1952 they got 1/6; in 1953 they got nothing; in 1954 they got nothing; in 1955 they got 2/6; in 1956 they got nothing &mdash; and in 1956, 5d was put on every packet of <Col N="2473" /> cigarettes but still they got nothing&mdash; and in 1957 they got 1/-; in 1958 they got nothing; in 1959 they got 2/6; in 1960 they got 1/-; in 1961 they got 1/6 and in 1962 they got 2/6. Therefore what they got in the past few years compares well with what they got in previous years.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the Minister has improved the position and let us hope that with an improvement in the economy he will be able to do better next year.  Play was also made of the fact that these people will not get the money until 1st August.  I have also checked on the past and I found that when the Opposition were in power <Col N="2474" /> they did the same thing.  They did not grant the money immediately after the Budget.  Therefore there is no point in saying &ldquo;You did not give the money in the same way as you gave it to the judges&rdquo;.  I shall ask the Minister now, if he has any further increases in mind next year, to bring the date forward.  It is too late to do it this year but it will save criticism and there is some point in the criticism that the pensioners have had to wait three or four months. It is not a point that can be made by the Opposition but there is a point that they should not be asked to wait for so long.  If the Minister is giving increases next year, he should give good example by bringing the date forward and granting the money within two months at most after the Budget.</P>

      <P>I am sure they will get their money in retrospect next year, if Deputy Sherwin has anything to do with it.  There is no doubt he had a tremendous influence on the Minister for Finance and the Government over the last six months.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on some of the improvements he has made in the social welfare code, the improvements other than those represented by the increases announced in the Budget proposals.  It is true these other improvements I speak of do not cost an amount of money, but the value is nevertheless great to the few hundred who will benefit.</P>
      <P>I have not much to say on this measure.  Anything my Party had to say about it was said on the Budget. I take exception to Deputy Sherwin posing here, by inference, as the only honest man in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Deputy's word for it.  However, he said, whether it was a wrong choice of phrase or not, that the rest of those <Col N="2475" /> who spoke against the general Budget proposals were dishonest.  If we had the same decision to make tonight on the general Budget proposals, the Labour Party would act in the same way.  I am afraid some Deputies, particularly those who describe themselves as independent, do not understand or appreciate the significance of Parties in the House voting against the general Budget proposals.  It is a bit too simple to pretend that, by voting against the general Budget proposals or various other proposals, we or any members of the Opposition here were against the increases proposed for the old age pensioners, widows, the sick and the unemployed.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many times we have to say this, but we voted against the general Budget taxation proposals because, frankly, we believe that not sufficient of the increased taxation to be raised was devoted to those in the social welfare classes.  I do not think, either, that it is dishonest or unfair to talk about the increases proposed for the judges in conjunction with the increases proposed for those in the social welfare classes.  Again, it is a bit too simple to say that the increases for the judges amount to only about £20,000.  Some Deputies seemed to know what the judges tax allowances are because they could even reduce that amount to £5,000 &mdash; or was it £9,000?  We feel entirely justified&mdash; this is not a matter entirely for the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;in comparing the treatment meted out to the judges with that meted out to the social welfare classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Sherwin said, that during the terms of the inter-Party Government the payments to these people were not retrospective.  They were operative from a date two or three months from the actual Budget announcement.  Deputy Sherwin and others should remember we did not propose retrospective increases for people getting increases ranging from £12 per week down to £6 or £7 per week.  I do not want to flog this issue here but it is flying in the face of the poor people to suggest, on the one hand, that judges should get in one <Col N="2476" /> instance an increase of £650 per annum from 1st November last, while, on the other hand, others, even though there may be 160,000 or 170,000 of them, should have to wait for three and a half months before getting 2/6 a week.</P>
    <P>I assume Deputy Sherwin is a supporter of the Government on this issue.  He asked a question as to the various increases given to old age pensioners for the past 12 years.  He described them as half a crown in 1955, nothing in 1954 and so on. Again, Deputy Sherwin should remember&mdash;he in particular; not necessarily members of the Fianna Fáil Party, because they know it&mdash;that there were a hell of a lot of years when nothing was given during the 22 years of the Fianna Fáil administration.  When Fianna Fáil came into power in 1932, the old age pension was fixed by them at 10/- a week.  There was no increase from 1932 up to 1948, except by way of supplementary food vouchers and the like, for which there was an additional means test.</P>
    <P>It ought to be mentioned that, while this may appear to Deputy Sherwin as a reasonable and just increase, the fact is that a lesser proportion of total tax revenue is being spent on social welfare.  I have heard various Ministers for Social Welfare in the Fianna Fáil Government say, and to some extent rightly so: &ldquo;We cannot pay old age pensioners any more money, unless we have the money, unless we as a Government can collect it.&rdquo;  I charge them now, and I want to tell Deputy Sherwin, that they have collected it in greater amounts in the past three or four years by the imposition of bigger taxes on the people but those in the social welfare group are getting a smaller percentage than they did in 1957 when Fianna Fáil came back to power.</P>
    <P>We believe there should be an increase in the percentage of State moneys devoted to old age pensions rather than a decrease, as there is at present.  I know comparisons are odious, but Deputy Sherwin ought to remember that in 1955 &mdash; that was the last time an inter-Party Government increased the old age pension &mdash; there <Col N="2477" /> was another very important factor to be taken into consideration, namely, the £9,000,000 being provided by the Government to subsidise essential foodstuffs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is particularly important, if not for us, then for many in various income brackets, to have regard to the price of food.  From 1955 up to 5th March, 1957, when a new Fianna Fáil Government took office, butter was 3/9d. per lb.  In their Budget of April, 1957, the Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government increased that to 4/7d.  Deputy Sherwin will appreciate that put a heavy burden on the old age pensioner.  The old age pensioner is not used to roast beef or mutton cutlets but depends on tea, bread, butter, sugar and flour.  In March, 1957, milk was 5d. a pint. Now it is 6d. a pint.  When the inter-Party Government left office, the price of a 2 lb. loaf was 9d.  As a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies, that price was increased to, and stood in February, 1962, at 1/4d.</P>
      <P>All these things should be taken into account when Deputy Sherwin says that from 1954 to 1957, the inter-Party Government did not do what they now want a Fianna Fáil Government to do.  I honestly believe we could do more for these people.  It is not just a matter of keeping them in step and compensating them for increases in the cost of living.  The most important task is to give them a standard of living and to relate their allowances to the various fluctuations in the cost of living index figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure I need not quote &mdash; or should I?  &mdash;in view of what Deputy Sherwin said.  In March, 1957, when the inter-Party Government left office and Fianna Fáil came back, flour was 4/2 per stone; again, as a result of the withdrawal of the food subsidies, it increased to 8/3 per stone; tea in 1957 was 4/11; it is now 6/2½; rashers, another foodstuff on which the old age pensioner and the social assistance classes depend, were at that time 3/10½; in mid-February, 1962, they were 4/2; clothing since then has gone up by eight per cent.; fuel and light <Col N="2478" /> have gone up by 16 per cent.; the rents of houses have gone up by 26 per cent., not to talk about the various increases that have been put on tobacco, stout and so on.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate, therefore, what I said on one occasion recently in this House: in my opinion, having regard to the cost of living, and especially having regard to the cost of essential foodstuffs, I believe the old age pensioner is not in the improved position that many Deputies believe he is.  I would suggest to the Minister &mdash; I know that he must have the interests of these people at heart; I also know that he has around the spring of every year a struggle to get more money for these people &mdash; that he should ensure at least that the percentage of tax revenue devoted to social welfare is not further decreased next year.</P>

      <P>There is little I can add to this debate except to endorse the comments of the last speaker. Deputy Sherwin classifies all those who cannot see their way to accepting this &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; increase as being dishonest. Yet, even those of us who have short memories, and without quoting from the actual Official Report, can remember when Deputy Sherwin said that he would not be satisfied with &ldquo;a bob or two&rdquo;; it would have to be &ldquo;a dollar&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I believe the Minister would be very pleased to be giving &ldquo;a dollar&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister is quite conversant with the position of these people.  I do not believe he is of a different mind from that of Deputy Corish.  He knows that the increase is totally inadequate.  In the Budget debate, I asked the Minister to review the ceiling set by the Government in 1952 as far as old age pensioners and social welfare classes are concerned.  I am sure the House will agree that it is not my practice to <Col N="2479" /> use this floor for anything except constructive and definitive proposals. Remembering Deputy Sherwin's propensity for the study of history, I think here attack is the best from of defence. I said, when the Budget was under discussion here, that apart from the unsatisfactory nature of the pensions and social welfare provision, I thought the Budget was as good as could be expected.</P>
      <P>Examining my conscience, I do not feel I did anything wrong in supporting the increase for the judges.  I have consistently supported every increase brought before this House.  I think increases are necessary, apart altogether from the increase in the cost of living, because of the depreciation in the purchasing value of the £.</P>
      <P>It is too much to have to listen to these repeated charges of dishonesty because one does not see eye to eye with someone else.  Deputy Sherwin says he is independent and sits by himself; so long as he keeps to his present attitude, I am sure he will not be crowded out.</P>

      <P>I think the rate of old age pension was 27/6 in 1957.  It was then increased to 30s.  This increase will raise it to 32s. 6d.  I should like to direct the attention of the House to the fact that &mdash; it is a fact that is frequently lost sight of; Deputy Corish mentioned it without particularising&mdash; the cost of living bears a very close relationship to the old age pension, a much closer relationship than it does to either wages or profits.  I had occasion to refer to the impact of the cost of living today on the income of the farmers, but even with the farmers, there is some margin, however slight, enabling them to adjust themselves to the stringencies of the cost of living. I do not think there is a margin open to the old age pensioner.  None of us claims that the old age pension, which our resources permit us to provide, leaves any margin for the recipient, even when he is receiving <Col N="2480" /> the maximum possible.  I think it is true to say, and I do not think it can be controverted, that there has been an increase in the cost of living of 17 per cent. since 1957.</P>

      <P>It would, I think, be mid-February, 1957.  The cost of living in mid-May, 1952, was 158.  Perhaps the Minister would check that figure. Unless my mathematics are very much worse than I think, that represents an increase of 23 points in the cost of living.  Perhaps the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have now had time to check that figure.  If they will put 23 over 135 and multiply it by 100, I think the resultant sum comes out at something approximating 17 per cent.  I am always open to correction. Am I wrong?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to remember Belmullet and to remember the old performer.  Let us not forget those pristine days of glory.  I say 17 per cent. is the correct figure of the increase in the cost of living.  If we accept that figure, it is true to say that the old age pensioner will receive 32/6d. if he lives till next August &mdash; there will be no retrospective payment to November &mdash; which in terms of the pension payable in 1957 is worth approximately 27/-.  I wonder what is Deputy Sherwin's reaction to that mathematical calculation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the old age pension has not gone up by 1/-or 2/- but has come down by the dollar dear to the Deputy's heart.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the old age pensioners were represented by a trade union, they would remind the Minister of that fact.  It would be wrong if we did not recall to the Minister's mind and to Deputy Sherwin's that whatever is the apparent amount of the old age pension, its purchasing power is shrinking and these people have no margin on which to fall back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all sympathise with this Minister and every other Minister for Social Welfare.  We may well sympathise with ourselves that we have not more to make available better pensions for our people than we are able to afford but it is true to say that even though there is no comparison between the total cost of raising the salaries of judges and raising the pensions of old age pensioners and blind pensioners and other social service beneficiaries, there ought to be some criterion of <Col N="2483" /> propriety in the way we go about those things.  It is not becoming, in a year when you cannot afford to do more than increase the old age pensions by a small amount, with a delay of three to four months, to choose in that year to make a very material adjustment in judicial salaries and pensions and make it retrospective for six months.</P>

      <P>Nine months.  It is not seemly.  It is not seemly if you are raising revenue for purposes of this kind, for the purpose of increasing old age pensions, that the greater part of the burden should be thrown on luxuries such as stout and tobacco, if these things are themselves perhaps the only luxuries that an old age pensioner is likely to enjoy.  We have the interesting record of the fact that since Fianna Fáil came into office they are spending £23 million more per annum from revenue than was spent by the Government in 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are spending £23 million more from revenue and they are withholding £9 million that used to be spent on the subsidies.  That together with the £23 million makes £32 million.  Is it not odd that out of that immense appropriation we can find only 5/- over these years for the old age pensioners?  Does Deputy Sherwin think it unbecoming that we should deplore the fact that if they increased taxation by £32 million in that period &mdash; and remember a great part of the taxation fell on bread, butter and flour &mdash; not more than 5/-can be found for the old age pensioner; he has 2/6 already and will get another 2/6 if he lives until next August?  We all agree that half a loaf is better than no bread but let us remember the true dimensions of the half loaf we are providing.  It is 32/6 in terms of 1962 money and that <Col N="2484" /> approximates to 27/- in terms of 1957 money.</P>
      <P>I want to refer, in conclusion, to the history of this business.  The old age pension was fixed at 10/- a week in 1928.  It remained at that figure until 1948, but during the war there was allowed 2/6 in kind for anyone living in rural Ireland and 5/- in kind for anyone living in Dublin or Cork.  In 1948, the old age pension was increased to 17/6 per week for everybody.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil were then elected, with the aid of four Woolworth diamonds and a diamond harp, but the old age pension remained at that figure.  In 1952, on the occasion of the withdrawal of the first gale of food subsidies, Fianna Fáil undertook, as compensation for the increase in the cost of living thus caused, to raise the old age pension.  Deputy Davern's evergreen memory will recall what that increase was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was at that time but Deputy Davern will recall that the great increase which was to compensate for the withdrawal of the first gale of food subsidies was 1s. 6d. per week.  In 1955, under the inter-Party Government, the old age pension was further increased from 24s. to 26s. 6d. per week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 1s. 6d. in 1952, 1s. in 1957, 2s. 6d. in 1959, 1s. in 1960, 1s. 6d. in 1961 and 2s. 6d. in 1962.  Let us add that up and we find it is 10s.  It is an interesting study, is it not?  I think, though I shall not dogmatise on it, that during the period of the inter-Party Government, when Deputy Norton was Minister for Social Welfare, the means test was very materially relaxed.  I cannot remember these things clearly but I think the means test was altered from £39 to £104.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>From £39 to £52.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that at that time there were very extensive relaxations of the means test which brought a very considerable number of beneficiaries within the old age pension and widows and orphans codes. All that is important is that these facts should be taken on all sides of the House as a demonstration of the common desire to improve, as far as our resources would permit, the circumstances of beneficiaries of our social service code.</P>
      <P>It is also very important that these facts should operate to slaughter for the last time the Fianna Fáil fraud that they are the Party most concerned for social services in this country.  The facts are that, with the exception of the very few dafties among us &mdash; and thank God we have them since they add colour and charm to our proceedings &mdash; everybody wants to help as far as he can the less fortunate sections of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we must remember that there is nobody to whom the cost of living means more and that if we allow the cost of living steadily to rise, <Col N="2486" /> when we intend to increase our pensions, we may discover that we are not allowing the benefits from these increases to have effect since the cost of living will have negatived them before they get them.  We must endeavour to achieve a situation where this will not happen at a time when we give others an increase of from £10 to £12 a week and nine months' retrospection, lest the new rates should prove insufficient to meet their urgent needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution is designed to register the strongest possible protest against the shameful manner in which the Government have dealt with the most needy and deserving sections in the community.  The old age pensioners can properly be described as the weakest section of the community. When they reach the age of 70 years they are granted the old age pension and many of them have no other means of livelihood.  There are many people in the country today who are entirely and completely dependent on the old age pension.  Some of them have it supplemented by 2/6 or 5/-home assistance.  There is a very strict means test for an old age pension.  We should all like to see that means test completely abolished, so that every person who reaches the age of 70 would qualify for an old age pension. There is very little argument for depriving an old age pensioner of his pension when we are paying children's allowances to the very well off and well-to-do people with no means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very clear that the Government have completely and entirely forgotten how difficult it is for anyone to exist on 30/- a week at present, more particularly when the Government have concentrated all their energies on increasing the prices of foodstuffs: bread, flour and butter, which are the essential requirements of any old age pensioner.  More recently the cost of the only enjoyment left to an old age pensioner, a smoke, has been increased.  The cost of living has been allowed to rise recklessly by the Government.  The prices of food, fuel and rents are vastly increased and the best the Government can do <Col N="2487" /> for the old age pensioners &mdash; people who have given their best years in the service of the country; people who should be living in the full terms of Christian decency in their old age and their last days &mdash; is to give them a miserable 2/6 as from next August.</P>
    <P>Like the Leader of the Opposition I fail to see how the Government can possibly reconcile that with giving the well off, well paid, well-to-do judges an increase in some cases of £10 a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">

      <P>They may never have married and now find themselves entirely and completely dependent on 30/- per week.  I should like to know how any member of the House could exist if he were reduced to an income of 30/- a week.  I should like to know the circumstances of any citizen who is forced to live on 30/-a week.  It is very clear and there is ample evidence, that never before in the history of the country was there such a strain on charitable institutions, such a strain on the funds of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, such a strain on the voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That strain is there because there is a large section of people with pride still left in them who would spend one or two days in the week in semi-starvation rather than allow it to become publicly known that they were in poor and difficult circumstances. Those are the people who are being dealt with in this cruel, harsh, unreasonable, unjust manner by the Government.  Do we realise how grand <Col N="2488" /> it is that a number of the older people still have sufficient pride to be prepared to suffer the hardships of the present high living costs without a murmur?</P>
    <P>The Government have turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to the reasonable demands of the old age pensioners.  We were given to understand that they were likely to get an increase of 5/-a week.  I certainly will not go into the circumstances of the increase of 5/- a week, but that 5/- which they were to get has been reduced to 2/6d., and they do not get it until next August.</P>
    <P>Would not one imagine that any Government whose intentions towards the old age pensioners had an atom of sincerity would have taken steps to provide for the poorer section of the people, those in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions?  The Government would have won the admiration and support of the people if they had courageously given the old age pensioners a reasonable pension on which they could exist.  I should like to see the contributory old age pension at £3 a week and the non-contributory old age pension at £2 a week.  I do not see what is stopping the Government from giving that.</P>

Deputies who are in close contact with the old age pensioners in their constituencies know that they are the section of the community that is suffering more today than any other section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel this Government have treated <Col N="2489" /> them wrongly.  They have not treated them in accordance with the full terms of Christian decency. They have thrown the old age pensioners to the wolves and have closed their eyes to the old age pensioners who, in many cases, have to eat dried crusts from Wednesday to Friday morning.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that in any part of rural Ireland, on the stroke of 9 o'clock in the morning, you will see many old age pensioners with their pension books in their hands on Friday morning going to the post office?

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, who has in his constituency extremely wide contacts, must himself know the circumstances under which many old age pensioners, living alone, are compelled to exist at the present time. There is one way in which the Government can really extend their charity in a practical manner, that is to give to the old age pensioners what they are rightly entitled to, namely, a pension that will enable them to purchase the essentials of life from week to week. That is all they are asking.</P>
      <P>This Bill, giving 2/6 next August, is a disgrace.  It is a sham.  Half-a-crown is not enough.  Half-a-crown is an insult to the old age pensioners.  If the Government are in the happy position in which they allege they are, then the very least they can give the old age pensioner is 10/- of an increase and make it retrospective to the very day from which the judges got theirs.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has betrayed the old age pensioners.  He has sold them out for the judges.  That is why I think this 2/6, coming as it will next August, is the greatest possible insult that could be offered to the men and women who gave good service to this country, who have given the best years of their lives in building up this country and who now find themselves thrown on the scrap heap with a paltry 2/6 increase in the old age pension which is expected to make up for the brutal and savage increases the Government have recklessly brought in living costs which have put a severe hardship on those least able to bear it.</P>

      <P>As I have said, until Deputy Dillon and Deputy O.J. Flanagan entered the House, it appeared that I would have little else to do but to thank Deputies for the responsible way in which they had approached this Bill. Apart, of course, from their colleague, Deputy Dr. Browne, there seemed, up to then. to have been a genuine appreciation of the problems involved in dealing with social welfare payments.  That would have made my task seem easier and also it would have allowed me to conclude rather more quickly than I shall be able to do now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy O.J. Flanagan came in and adopted a different attitude.  They adopted an attitude similar to that which they adopted on the Budget debate.  One would think that that kind of insincere and irresponsible argument had adequately been disposed of in the Budget debate.  I think that people generally appreciate that that kind of talk is pure nonsense.</P>
      <P>As I said, the contributions made by other Opposition speakers seemed to indicate to me, at any rate, that at last there was a realisation of the fact that if either of the main Opposition Parties are ever to be considered by the people as fit to form a Government, it is about time they started to try to give the people an image of themselves as a responsible Party who took into consideration every aspect of the different problems that confront a Government.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy O.J. Flanagan, I think, have succeeded very well now in undoing the attempt by other Opposition speakers to create a more responsible impression on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2492" /> Deputy Dillon started off with a rather pathetic and unsuccessful attempt to establish that the increases in the old age pensions have not kept pace with the increases in the cost of living.  Of course, the attempt by him was bound to be a failure because the figures are against him.  But, although that was well-established in the Budget debate, he insisted on trying to bluff his way out of it here again by carefully selecting figures in relation to the cost of living to try to prove his point. Even those carefully selected dates, which were the best which Deputy Dillon could do, disproved his own case.</P>
    <P>Even though on the basis of those figures there is a 17 per cent. increase in the cost of living since mid-February, 1957, the corresponding increase in the old age pension rate has been 35 per cent. which was a little more than double the increase in the cost of living.  Any set of figures you take, if you go to any date and compare the rate of old age pensions with the cost of living and compare the situation then with the situation now, it will be seen that under the Fianna Fáil Government there has been a continuous improvement in the relevant position of the old age pensioner <i>vis-á-vis</i> the cost of living.</P>
    <P>As usual, the Fine Gael Party in particular referred to nothing else but non-contributory old age pensions.  Do they know there is any other social service in existence?  Do they know of any other people who need State assistance apart from that section?  It has been shown time and again that their record even in that regard &mdash; on old age pensions &mdash; cannot bear comparison with Fianna Fáil's.  Deputy Dillon again tonight tried to bluff his way out of this by attempting the same trick as Deputy Sweetman attempted in the Budget debate of comparing maximum rates with minimum rates.  The only true criterion is to compare like with like, maximum with maximum.  That is the only accurate way to compare old age pensions or anything else.  The increase given in 1948, when you compare like with like, was 2/6.</P>

      <P>No, if you are not prepared to accept that rational method of comparison and if you want to go into it in full detail you will find that some people got no increase at all in 1948.</P>
      <P>That was not enough.  Deputy Dillon tried to claim a further increase for one of the two periods when he was a member of the Coalition Government. Even at this stage, it is surprising to find that Deputies opposite have the nerve to drag in the 1951 faked election Budget The increase that was given in 1951 of 2s. 6d. was given in the same way as this has been given, by a Social Welfare Bill introduced by the new Fianna Fáil Government. It is true that it was mentioned in the Budget Statement or, a better description of it would be the Budget election manifesto, of 1951 but whether money was provided or not was another question. That was left to the new Fianna Fáil Government to do.  We decided to honour the commitments that had been made but not provided for by our predecessor and it was the Fianna Fáil Government who had to provide money to pay that increase in 1951. The damage had been done; the deliberately unbalanced Budget had been introduced and it was in 1952 that we had to provide the money for that 2s. 6d. which we gave in a Social Welfare Act of 1951.  We also gave further increases in 1952.</P>
      <P>On the figures I have given, since 1948 there has been an increase of 17/6d. in non-contributory old age pensions.  Of that increase, 5/- was given by the Coalition Government and 12/6d. by the Fianna Fáil Government. That is the only social service that Deputies opposite have the nerve to mention.  They try to pretend that was the only thing that happened with regard to social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2494" /> It is not the only thing that happened even in regard to old age pensions. No doubt Deputy Dillon and Deputy Flanagan would like to forget but I shall not allow them to forget that in addition to their far superior record in regard to non-contributory old age pensions, the Fianna Fáil Government also introduced, for the first time, the contributory scheme which gave an ex-insured person and his wife with no means test, a pension of 70/- a week which is now being raised to 80/- and which provided, although it was to be a contributory scheme, that this amount should be available to ex-insured workers even though they had not, in fact, contributed anything by way of insurance stamps to such a scheme.</P>
    <P>That is the record in regard to the only social service that Deputies opposite have the nerve to mention but in addition to that there are other services. Seeing that their record is so bad in regard to old age pensions it seems at first sight rather peculiar that there is no mention of anything else and that in discussing social welfare, either on the Bill or on the Budget, Deputies opposite concentrate on old age pensions.  Of course the reason for the coyness in regard to other schemes is not far to seek.  It is perfectly obvious when you look at the record because bad as is their record in regard to old age pensioners it is infinitely worse in regard to other people in receipt of Social Welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Is it possible that they can find no place in their hearts for the unemployed person with a wife and family? How is it there is no mention of him? How is it that in two periods of the Coalition Government no increase was given in unemployment assistance? How is it that every assistance that was given was given by Fianna Fáil? Why do they not mention children's allowances?  Because children's allowances were introduced by Fianna Fáil and every increase given since was given by Fianna Fáil.  It is because they have no record whatever in regard to the other social services that they try to concentrate on old age pensions. We have shown greater concern for old <Col N="2495" /> people than our opponents showed when they had the opportunity to do something.  In addition, we have recognised that there are other people to be provided for, others who are unfortunate enough not to be able to provide for themselves and we have taken steps to see that they were not allowed to lag behind in spite of the Coalition neglect.</P>
    <P>It must seem amazing that, in discussing this Bill, Deputy Dillon had the nerve to stand up and completely ignore the fact that for instance a married man with four children on unemployment assistance gets, under this Bill, an increase of 15/- a week if living in an urban area and 17/- a week if in a rural area and that there is a further increase of 2/6 in respect of each qualified child dependent.  I suppose this catchcry they are trying to get the people to accept &mdash;&ldquo;2/6 for the old age pensioner&rdquo;&mdash; sounds rather good and it might be effective if the people were as silly as the Fine Gael Party appear to think they are. Apparently, they will never learn that people are not such fools and will see through this business of objecting to the inadequacy of increases and at the same time trying to prevent the Government from collecting the money that is necessary to give the increases, even on the scale they describe as most inadequate and describe with the other exaggerated adjectives that have been used.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the old age pensioners and shown that in so far as they are concerned Fianna Fáil have a better record and also that they have a far superior record with regard to the other social services.  That is why we were not questioned on them. When I spoke on the Budget, I showed quite clearly that we had seen to it that all social welfare payments more than compensated the recipients for the increase in the cost of living, that we had given evidence of the fact that it was our policy to see that the recipients of social welfare benefits did not fall behind the improvements in the economy of the country.  I do not know if there is any point in repeating the figures I gave in regard to the <Col N="2496" /> increases in the cost of living and the increases in the old age pensions, but if anybody is anyway anxious to see the true position, it is obvious that the relative position with regard to all social welfare benefits as compared with the cost of living has improved under this Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, having gone so far, apart from the bluff he tried, went further and tried to make out that a greater increase had been given by the Coalition Government, that the increases given by this Government since 1957 were only 5/- in regard to non-contributory old age pensions.  It is not too much to expect Deputies to remember what was done in this respect in the term of office of this Government.  In 1957, there was an increase of 1/-; in 1959, of 2/6; in 1960, of 1/-; in 1961, of 1/6; and in 1962, of 2/6.  That amounts to 8/6 and not 5/-, as it is according to Deputy Dillon's peculiar system of mathematics.</P>
    <P>That is not the only thing.  In practically every one of those years, there was an increase in the majority of the other social services.  As I pointed out in the Budget debate, this year we have set a new record in regard to the increases in social welfare.  That follows upon the improvement the change of Government brought in the country's economy.  We have gone across the whole field of social services this year; we have raised the rates by substantial amounts in every one of them.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite would have you believe that this year the only increase given is 2/6 for non-contributory old age pensions but that is not so.  In unemployment assistance, there is an increase of 2/6 in the personal rates, another 2/6 for an adult dependant and a further increase in urban areas for the unemployed man with two children of 5/- and in rural districts, an increase of 7/-.  There is a further increase for the man on unemployment assistance of 2/6 for each dependent child in excess of two.  That, apparently, is of no importance to the Opposition and the record bears that out because they have never given any increase in that particular social service.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there has been an increase <Col N="2497" /> of 2/6 for widows and, there again, the rates for children have been brought up to the level of the contributory rates.  They have not been brought any further because it would be anomalous for the rates in the case of non-contributory pensions to be higher than those of the contributory ones.  Due to previous adjustments made by Fianna Fáil, the rates for child dependants of non-contributory widows are practically the same as those for contributory widows.  Any reference to these was omitted altogether by the Opposition speakers because of their own record and because it would deprive them of grounds for the unrealistic and irresponsible attack they wished to make on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have also given in my introductory statement examples of the increases on the insurance side.  There is an increase of 5/- in the personal rate for unemployment benefit, disability benefit, widows' contributory pensions and contributory old age pensions, plus a 5/- increase to the adult dependants attaching to all those, plus a 3/- increase in respect of each child. I think that, in view of these facts, to describe this Bill as simply one of 2/6d. for old age pensioners is irresponsible and dishonest.  It is easy for Deputies opposite to talk about 2/6d. for old age pensions.  Unfortunately I, as a member of the Government who have to provide the money, have to think of the £783,000 which that aspect of this Bill will cost.  The Government have to make arrangements to collect that money from the people because there is no place else they can get it.  One would imagine that when the Opposition are so critical of the size of the increases given they would not try to prevent the Government from collecting the necessary money to pay these increases.</P>
    <P>The cost of the non-contributory old age pensions is £783,000 and the cost to the Exchequer of the full proposals for social assistance benefit is £1,377,000.  The total cost of the proposals on the social insurance side is £2,823,000 of which one-third is being borne by the Government.  That makes the total cost to the Exchequer in a <Col N="2498" /> financial year £2,318,000.  Because of the arrangements the Government have made in this Bill, the recipients of social welfare benefits will obtain in a full financial year an additional £4,200,000.  No matter what way you look at it, that is a respectable and sizeable effort to make as far as a redistribution of income is concerned in favour of those people who, through one cause or another, are unable to provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised at Deputy Dr. Browne talking in this strain but I had the idea that having learned from their experience of two Coalition Governments the Fine Gael Party might now like to aspire to be regarded as a responsible Party fitted to carry on Government.  But, as I said, in discussing this matter they certainly gave no signs that they will make any effort to represent themselves in that way.</P>

      <P>It is not a poor argument. We have provided the increase in rates and if we had as many people in need of social assistance and social benefit as you had the total amount would be correspondingly larger.  Because of the improvement that followed in the country's economy from the change of Government that number has been substantially reduced. The result is that although we have effected these substantial improvements in the rates the total expenditure on social welfare benefits as a percentage of the total tax revenue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is a considerable proportion and is larger than in those countries that were praised to the skies by Deputies opposite.  For instance, Deputy Norton referred to the Social Insurance Fund and tried to convey the impression that we were not nearly as generous in our contributions to the Social Insurance Fund as any other country in Western Europe.  In this part of Ireland the State's contribution to the Social Insurance Fund is approximately 37 per cent., in Great Britain it is 17 per cent. and in Northern Ireland 12 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not claim and never have claimed, and I do not think anybody here has claimed, that the rates of the social welfare payments are sufficient to ensure that the recipients, people who have met with various kinds of misfortune, will be able to have the same standard of living as people who are in position to provide for themselves. That is not our fault.  As I said, we have been effecting a gradual improvement and this Government have shown that they do their best to alleviate the hardship that misfortune always brings in its wake, in accordance with the capacity of the country's economy to finance the operations in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That capacity has been improving. This year the total Exchequer provision for social welfare, including the cost of the various provisions in this Bill, amounts to £27.6 million, or 20.2 per cent. of the estimated total tax revenue.  The collection of that amount by the Government from the people for redistribution to those who are in need is a considerable effort by the Government in that direction.  Of course when it is remembered that in addition to that, as Deputies have not been slow to point out, a considerable amount is also raised by way of contributions from workers and employers, <Col N="2500" /> there is definitely a very good effort being made by the Government to redistribute the national income so that hardship will be alleviated as far as possible.</P>

      <P>We cannot get money from any other source than the people. Whether we do it by taxation or by contributions from the workers or the employers it all comes from the same source.  As I have said, we at least have shown we have the interests of all these people at heart but I am not complacent about the adequacy of the rates and as I have pointed out and as my predecessor, and the Taoiseach, on a number of occasions have said it is our intention to see that recipients of social welfare payments will share in the country's improved economy. As a member of the Government I have to take cognisance of the fact that it would not be in the interests of the public, particularly people dependent on social welfare payments, to increase the burden of taxation to such a point that it would strangle the development and expansion that is taking place in the country's economy at the moment.  The fact that unlike our predecessors we have made some improvement in every year since 1957 shows that we realise the rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think it is worth my while replying to the criticisms of Deputy Dr. Browne.  He argued that the Government were penalising the children of unemployed parents when in fact it is obvious that what we have been doing is alleviating the hardship that the misfortune of losing employment or losing one's health must inevitably bring in its wake.  Such statements as &ldquo;throwing a few shillings to the old pensioners&rdquo; are complete nonsense when considered in conjunction with the amount of money that has to be raised in order to implement this Bill.</P>
      <P>There were criticisms of the form of our society here.  The fact is that in any society, even in the type of society which Deputy Dr. Browne apparently has in mind and would have established here, there is financial recognition for different levels of activity on the part of the people.  As I said, apart from the speeches of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Flanagan, the contributions were reasonable and, unlike the Budget debate, took cognisance of the difficulties in regard to increasing rates. While there was criticism of the amounts, there was that recognition on the part of all the other speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies did not seem really to appreciate some of the things that were being done.  I think that when Deputy Tully studies the Bill more closely, he will see it is unfair to say, for instance, that the extension of the means limit with regard to widows only means that certain widows will get a pension of 6/-.  That is not a fact.  It does a lot more.  What it does in relation to the 6/- is that a widow who otherwise would be just outside the limit for the present minimum pension, which now will be 11/-, would get nothing but such a widow will now get a pension of 6/-.  It will do the same with regard to old age pensions.  The main thing that is done by the extension of the means limit, as I think Deputy Tully knows now, <Col N="2502" /> is that prior to this, £130-15-0 annual means was the over-riding limit for any widow irrespective of the number of children she had so that a widow, depending upon the number of children she had, who is just under £130-15-0 means, could be getting, possibly, a pension of the order of £1 or even £2.  If she had one shilling over the £130-15-0, she got nothing at all.  Now we have arranged that the means limit will be extended in relation to the number of dependants.</P>
    <P>We have done that for non-contributory widows, non-contributory old age pensioners and also for unemployment assistance recipients and while it is true that the total number of people who will benefit from these extensions is comparatively small, in respect of the majority of those who do benefit it will be a considerable improvement for them.</P>

I think this House has come to expect little else from them except the type of contribution they made.</P>

      <P>The only reason I said what I said is because we assume, in the first place, that you are going to have two Bills &mdash; one for the old age pensioners and unemployment assistance and later on in the year another for the insurance classes.  There are lots of improvements in this that I would like explained in more detail. If there is all that urgency about the Bill, the Minister can have all Stages.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand, I agree.  Table B was adequate to deal with the means limits as they are where the number of dependent children was not taken into account. It is possible, by extending the means limit up to £182, to deal with means up to that limit.  Now we are arranging that there will be a further extension in the means limit of £13 per annum in respect of each additional child of a widow.  That could not be covered by any extension of Table B. It is necessary to put in that additional subsection in order to describe that process of taking into account the extra children.</P>

      <P>The Minister has included a very good proposal to allow widows with no children to qualify for a pension at the age of 40 as against 48.  He said only 120 would benefit.  I was under the impression that a greater number would benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Prior to this, if a widow had dependent children and if, prior to reaching the age of 47 years six months, her last dependent child ceased to be qualified, then the total pension finished.  Even her personal pension finished.  I am reducing the age for that purpose to 40 instead of 48. The position with regard to new entrants remains the same.</P>
