      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach about the programme of legislation?  Apart from No. 1, the Transport Bill, I know that there is a Housing Bill that must be passed in this session.  I do not know what the intention of the Government is with regard to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. We are now arriving at the end of May and the position is unsatisfactory for this time of the session.  I would ask the Taoiseach to arrange that he will be in a position to give a further indication in relation to business for the remainder of the session at a very early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the fact that the means test is being operated in a most unfair fashion.  I want to refer in particular to several cases which came to my notice and about which I made representations to the Minister's Department.  In referring to them again, I do not want to attach any blame to the Minister as such for the manner in which the means test is being operated but at present the regulations are being interpreted in a most arbitrary fashion by the officers down the country who are concerned. If the State decides that those who rendered service in the past are entitled to an allowance or pension and if this House so framed legislation as to enable these people to obtain some modicum of help from the State in their declining years or in years of illhealth, it ill becomes whoever is responsible so to frame the regulations as to deprive them of the pensions.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the case of DP-36109.  This is a case of a man who, having received a special allowance of a moderate amount, now finds the amount reduced by the sum of £39 a year because his son, who is working ten to twelve miles away from home, comes home in the evening.</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>This man's son stayed at home and was contributing £2 a week on a previous occasion.  Because he stayed at home and secured employment, he now contributes £3 a week. By some strange calculation under these regulations, it is made out that the profit to the father on that is 15/-a week.  This is calculated under Section 7 of the Army Pensions Act of 1943, so it means that an Army Act of 1943 is being applied in 1962. Am I to take it that regulations framed so long ago are still applicable or that the standards by which the social welfare officers carry out their work have not changed since that time and that no recognition is given to the rise in cost of living since then?  That person is being penalised to the extent <Col N="1453" /> of having his allowance reduced by £39 a year.  That means that what is left to him is absolutely useless to afford him any measure of even frugal comfort at the end of his days.</P>
      <P>I have heard it calculated that this State will have completed its debt to the people who helped to found it in 1970 and here we are operating a scheme at the present time under which we are depriving these people of whatever measure of help we should give them in their declining years.  It is not possible that there could be a profit of 15/- a week to a father on a sum of £3 a week which a healthy, able-bodied lad contributes to his home.  It is for that reason that I cannot feel that the State is being just, not to say generous, to the people it proposes to serve.  It is time that the House registered its protest against that type of arbitrary implementation of regulations.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter to which I should like to refer. This case also occurred in my constituency and, at the time, I brought to the notice of the Minister's Department that the applicant was in a very precarious state of health and I urged that the case be dealt with speedily.  I pointed out that if something were not done in a hurry, this man would die and die he did, without the State having settled its side of the case.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister has the interests of these people at heart as any Minister for Defence must have, but it is time it was impressed on the people who administer these Acts that two things are necessary.  The first is that there ought to be the greatest expedition in dealing with these cases and no undue delay in assessing whether these people are entitled to a special allowance or not.  The second is that there is a very urgent need for a review of the means test as it is applied to them.  I do not believe the case I have quoted is unique.  On another occasion and at another time I shall have something to say about <Col N="1454" /> the means test applied in the case of old age pensioners.</P>
      <P>I would impress upon the Minister that if the State is to discharge its debt to the people who gave this service in the past it ought to do so in a ready and a speedy fashion and it ought not use any device&mdash;because device I think it is&mdash;to slow down or prevent these people from obtaining what is due to them for whatever service they rendered in the past.</P>
      <P>There is a further matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  It concerns the case of a person who had a special allowance. This special allowance was given to him first because of his service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and also because of the fact that his son was permanently disabled.  The lad was examined in the military hospital, St. Bricin's. The father died leaving this lad unable to care for himself.  The Act, as framed, shows the weakness that the lad is now left to the care of the local authority.  He will have to be looked after by way of home assistance or otherwise.  That certainly is something which must leave the declining years of the recipients of this type of allowance or pension from the State tinged with sorrow and regret. When they die, unwittingly and unwarrantably, a cruel wrong is inflicted on their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to be somewhat more liberal with those who now remain of the men who won freedom for this country. Although many of them may not have medals they gave good and faithful service throughout.  Those of us who had the honour to be officers know their worth and know that they contributed to the freedom of the country in no small way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to be somewhat more liberal.  When the investigation officers are dealing with those soldiers of ours, they are dealing with men of a very high standard, who are not medicants and who do not like to be brought down to that level.  Very often because, perhaps, of pecuniary circumstances, the people on whose behalf I speak find themselves in difficulties.  Therefore, the Minister, in co-operation with the Minister for Social Welfare, should issue instructions to have them treated from the point of view of a very high standard.  On many occasions these people fail to disclose their true circumstances. That is through pride, perhaps, but it is a good thing that there is plenty of pride left in us.  That section of the community look for very little.  They got very little but they deserve a great deal.</P>
      <P>I want to appeal to the Minister to make provision for the funeral expenses of men who die in poor circumstances and whose relatives are unable to meet the expense.  It is a shame &mdash;and I have seen this happen on many occasions&mdash;that we should have to go round with the hat on behalf of men who rendered splendid service.  That position should not obtain in this country.  I hope our memories will not be so short that we will forget the services rendered by the men who obtained freedom for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I say there are old soldiers still left who, perhaps, through no fault of their own, were unable to make a strong case in the beginning for a military service pension.  Many of them <Col N="1456" /> are what could be described as marginal cases.  Jealousies in the case of many of them played no small part in depriving them of their just recognition. Since I came to this House I have urged&mdash;and I will continue to do so&mdash;that men with that good service to the nation should at least be given in the winter of their lives superannuation. They do not ask for a great deal but the just recognition to which they are so fully entitled.  A sum of even £20 for each year of service would be acceptable and would be a very fitting gesture in the winter of their lives. There are not so many left, and were it not for the special allowance, the pensions bill would be very considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>Every day of the week, many of those men are going to their eternal reward and I would make a special plea that in future there should be no necessity for charitable contributions towards the funeral expenses of Old IRA men. We do not want any lavish parades at their funerals.  All we ask is that a small fund be set up by the Government for that purpose and that this degrading practice of trying to find the curial expenses of old soldiers will cease.  The British look after their exsoldiers in this country when the need arises and I would strongly urge the Minister to see that we do the same.</P>
    <P>There are complaints also of long delays in arriving at decisions on applications for special allowances. Perhaps during the interim period between the application and the decision, the applicant may die and the dependants are then not entitled to any allowances.  That is most unfair.  Why can we not have some retrospective payment of allowances in such cases?</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make that appeal very strongly to the Minister. Nowadays also there are difficulties about certification of service and I would suggest that some new method be devised for this purpose.  Under no circumstances am I advocating that medals should be given to <Col N="1457" /> those who are not entitled to them&mdash; indeed, I think that would be unpardonable&mdash;but it is just as unfair to see people who are entitled to medals not receiving them.  There are people flaunting medals on their chests who should be ashamed, while, at the same time, old soldiers who suffered illhealth, loss of positions and other hardships to serve their country have been denied them.</P>
      <P>I do not know what increase in pensions the Minister has in mind but I would say that in any case, old soldiers who suffered total disablement as a result of wounds should be far more generously treated.  There are very few of them left now.  Even in this House we can see the evidence of that&mdash;young men are coming in and the older men are going out.  In this context, I would appeal to the younger men in this House never to forget the debt of gratitude they owe to those soldiers who were responsible for the situation we now have in which these young men can sit in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I would open my remarks by suggesting to the Minister that the means test should be completely abolished in relation to any allowance or pension granted to a person for services rendered.  It has been difficult at times this morning to get a quorum in the House and that reminds me of the fact that we have now so many younger men here.  In fact, they are in the majority in this House.  There are one or two specific cases which I would like to stress but I do not think I need do so to a Minister with the background of the present Minister.  I would, however, point out that it seems wrong to have in many cases younger civil servants adjudicating on who should be paid what under this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, with his association with Galway, will know all about the Fianna, recognised as the principal militant organisation in this country to march in columns of four under the late Countess Markievicz.  Liam Mellows went to Galway on his bicycle; Heuston and Colbert gave their lives for Ireland; and the Fianna became a training camp for cadets to fill the ranks of the Volunteers. <Col N="1458" /> Even though that happened, there are not more than 36 pensions awarded for Fianna service.</P>
    <P>We have to look at this picture in its proper light and hope that the younger men will take cognisance of it.  Members of the Fianna and the Volunteers were split asunder and some of them would not even take a drink with their former comrades for years afterwards.  It was natural therefore that some of them would not like to ask for verification.  I have permission to say what happened to Major General Hugo MacNeill.  He received credit for half a year in respect of his Fianna service when learning signalling, but the man who instructed him, an ex-British Army soldier, got no pension.  Yet Major General MacNeill got his pension on the verification of the man teaching him signalling.</P>
    <P>We know there are difficulties in the definition of active service, but we could learn from the United States Army.  No matter in what branch of the Services a man served in the first World War, his beneficiaries were entitled to 10,000 dollars in the event of his death while in the services. Deputy Barron felt disgusted that the question of providing funds for the burial of an Old IRA man should have to be raised in the House.  Of course, it is pathetic.</P>
    <P>Much money has been spent on the Military History Bureau.  Representatives were sent out to get the story from all sides.  I can safely say that, when the 50 years have elapsed, these documents can be published because there will be nobody alive to contradict them.  I was very much impressed by the action of Deputy MacEoin when, as Minister for Defence, he promised to take up the case of a person in whom I am interested.  I do not know whether that person could be classified as having been on active service or not &mdash;he was a solicitor&mdash;but he was certainly risking his life.  The Minister may feel that I should not bring this matter up again.  That is the attitude generally now.  People do not want to hear any more about the Old IRA and the Fianna now.  Even my wife <Col N="1459" /> is satirical and refers to the old Fenians rather than the Fianna.</P>
    <P>I am given to understand that medals without bars were issued <i>ad lib</i>.  Then we come to the question of the bar.  It is on record that where there was an anticipated ambush at forked roads and the truck went to the left instead of the right as expected, those lying in wait on the right were not considered to be on active service. Well, just how far can we go?  I mentioned the case of another man on three occasions in this House.  He was a member of the RIC, who took off his coat, joined the IRA, had service with them, joined the National Army, had service with them, went into Dublin Fire Brigade and retired some years ago because of arthritis. Just because he had £4 1s. a week pension, he could not get anything. The ceiling for the means test was set in 1952.  Since then, there have been all kinds of increases, the salaries of the judges and of Deputies have been increased, but that ceiling has never been touched.  As a result, there is no equity.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of retired officers of the Army and particularly those who accepted the offer made by the previous Minister to take two years' pay and retire.  I am not prepared to enter into the rights and wrongs of that now.  But within three months one officer found he had cancer.  Hospitalisation has cost him over £250.  If that man had remained on, he would have gone from Lieutenant-Colonel to Colonel and, at the same time, would have had his hospitalisation free.  I am sure no Deputy would question the Minister if he deviated to the right or the left, so long as he was doing so for the betterment of an individual.  As Deputy Davern says, there are very few of these people left.  There would be no opposition to any form of gratuity, even at this late stage, or to our adopting something on the lines followed for the American forces. When I was entitled to a disability pension because of a lung collapse, I did not ask for it.  I was young and I <Col N="1460" /> did not want to ask for verification from a person on the other side.  I said it did not matter.  I am glad I did so because I can now speak without anybody suggesting I am looking for anything for myself.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to the General and the other Fianna boy who got nine months in 1917.  Imprisonment is accepted as active service; yet he never got a penny.  I was lucky to get the Fianna boy a night watchman's job with Dublin Corporation recently.  The Minister will have the complete support of the House for any proposal to give recognition to these people, whether rich or poor.  There was no means test when you tried to recruit them in 1918 and 1919.  It is sad to think that politics can enter into a matter such as this.</P>
    <P>Last year on the occasion of this Estimate, I stated we had a repetition of what happened in the last war when the American private came to England and was receiving more money, apart from the difference in the dollar and the pound, than the English officer.  There are officers in the Congo who are under embarrassment because they are receiving less money than the Swedish privates.  If their services are good enough they should be paid.</P>
    <P>The problem of Old IRA pensions is one of &ldquo;service&rdquo; and it is a good job we are not faced with an emergency because it might only be the old national spirit that would come to the fore.  There is one of the last of the 1916 men dying within 200 yards of where we fought.  These are the matters I hope and feel confident the Minister will examine and not look on as many cases were looked on by his predecessor.</P>

      <P>As one of the junior Deputies in this House, I should like to join with Deputy MacEoin, Deputy Davern and other members of the Old IRA in appealing for more generous pensions for their comrades. In 1962, when we have freedom in this part of the State, a freedom achieved as a result of the glorious fight put up by the few over 40 years ago, it is really a sad thing to see those men <Col N="1461" /> who then fought and who since fought against each other, having to come in here with a united appeal on behalf of their old comrades.  I had a Question down yesterday to the Minister requesting him to give me a list of those in my native county in receipt of military pensions, with the amounts. I am not personally aware of the activities of the recipients of the pensions but I do know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not personally aware of the activities of the Old I.R.A. men in my county but I know they made a very substantial contribution to the fight for the Irish freedom. When I persued the list of names and considered the amount of pension awarded to those veterans, I really felt ashamed.  In one case, an Old IRA veteran has a pension of £9 15s. per annum.  I know dole men who would refuse to accept it as unemployment assistance; they would not accept it per month, never mind per year.  The majority of these annual pensions are small, between £20 and £25 per year&mdash; mere tokens.</P>
      <P>Do we consider it fair to the survivors of the few that we should recompense them in this miserable manner?  They are dying off and let us in their old age give them a reasonable pension.  Some of them, though poor, are still proud.  They do not wish to have their means investigated by junior civil servants.  If we want to find out the economic position of a veteran, let us consult his former colleagues who will know best what his financial position is and let us not have his means pried into by junior civil servants to whom he does not wish to disclose the poverty into which he has fallen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bad thing to find a proud Old IRA veteran being quizzed and questioned about what he did with moneys he may have received some 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  I would appeal to the Minister to find some other way of investigating the means of applicants for these pensions.  I have heard <Col N="1462" /> about Old IRA men from all sides of the House.  I have listened to Deputy Carroll, Deputy Davern and Deputy MacEoin making an appeal for old comrades in arms that generous pensions be given to them.  On behalf of a different generation, I wish to add my voice to that appeal.</P>
    <P>Year after year, the numbers of the Old IRA are growing less.  Therefore, we should not have to add to the Vote.  Instead of reducing the amount we vote for pensions, when Old IRA pensioners die off, let us divide the pension they get among their survivors and leave the global allocation the same at least, if we cannot add generously to it.</P>
    <P>Having appealed for the Old IRA men, I make a further appeal on behalf of the officers and men of the National Army.  I wonder do we treat them in the manner in which they should be treated?  I wonder have we given retired officers a pension on which they can live in comfort?  Have we made an effort to rehabilitate in civilian life the soldiers who have given 10, 15 or 20 years' service to the State?  I do not believe we have and, if we have not made provision to rehabilitate them in life, then let us see that they get a decent pension. The Army have proved that they are capable when danger threatens of emulating today the deeds of their predecessors in the Old IRA.  In the last war, in a state of emergency in this country, when they were called upon, they manned the bearna baoil. Later, when asked to go to far foreign fields, they emulated the feats of the old Irish Brigade.  Let us ensure that they are properly recompensed for the sacrifice and the offering they have made.</P>
    <P>We sometimes hear grouses and grumbles that we do not receive enough remuneration for what we do. We grumble and grouse correctly, but have we any thought for the men who made it possible for us to be here? We should not overlook them.  I understand the Minister is himself one of them.  He should not forget his old comrades.  He should keep badgering and pestering his Government and his <Col N="1463" /> Minister for Finance until he can siphon off from them sufficient moneys to keep these veterans, be they veterans of the Old IRA or of the National Army, in comfort in the latter days of their lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to draw up any balance sheet on the basis of the appeals made on this Estimate, I wonder what the net result would be.  I am more inclined to hearken to those who made a plea for leniency in the matter of assessing means and in the laying down of the rules for verification, etc., rather than to those who have taken the opposite viewpoint and who have stated that people have been given medals and pensions which they did not deserve.</P>
      <P>The balance sheet I am referring to is a comparison between these two points of view.  Each has been put very vigorously.  Cases have been cited to show&mdash;I have no doubt they are within the personal knowledge of the Deputies who mentioned them&mdash;a niggardly approach in the matter of means, a too rigid interpretation of &ldquo;service&rdquo;.  On the basis of these individual cases, in relation to which I am accepting that those who raised them have personal knowledge, these Deputies have proceeded to build a general case.  We all know that exceptions make bad law.  Where it can be said by those who make the case that medals and pensions have been given to people who have not earned them, it is possible that there may be certain individual cases within the personal knowledge of those who make these statements, but it would be quite illusory to build a general case on these individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do our best in the Department to ensure that only those who merit what the State provides will, in fact, get it.  On the other hand, there is equal diligence on the part of the officials to ensure that nobody gets that something which he has not, in fact, merited.  It is not an easy task to perform conscientiously and well.  I can assure the House that no unfavourable decision is given in any case without full examination.  The time for <Col N="1464" /> applying for military service pensions, and disability pensions arising out of that service, passed some years back and we are dealing now only with special allowances.  On all applications for special allowances, verification is a necessary prerequisite.</P>
    <P>Let us consider now the case of an applicant in respect of whom there are divided opinions as to the service rendered.  Verification is necessary. Certain verification may be forthcoming. If the weight of the evidence is in favour of the applicant, the officers adjudicating will give a decision in favour of the applicant.  On inquiry, I have been told that, in all cases of doubt, the benefit of the doubt is given to the applicant.  If we go beyond that practical rule of procedure in this matter, we shall be falling into the error emphasised here by those Deputies who said we have handed out these benefits without due consideration.</P>
    <P>The net result of what I have heard on this Estimate leads me to the conclusion that errors on the one side cancel out those on the other and, in neither case, are they of any considerable proportions.  It would be quite impossible to produce a perfect scheme, and we do not pretend that we have produced perfection in the administration of the military service pensions and special allowances code.</P>
    <P>A number of cases were mentioned. Some of them were identifiable.  Particulars of identification have been noted for further examination.  Deputy MacEoin, in particular, had fairly accurate information at his disposal in a number of cases.  It is not desirable in a debate of this kind to take a series of individual cases and reply to them, but, in so far as they are samples, the remarks which I have already made apply to them.</P>
    <P>Let us take one type of complaint &mdash;it is a case with which I have very great sympathy&mdash;the question of widows' pensions.  It is a fundamental feature of the Army pensions code, and it always has been, that where a disabled pensioner dies, it must be established that his death was due solely, or mainly, to his pensionable disability before an allowance can be paid to his widow and children. <Col N="1465" /> Establishing the cause of death is a function of the Army Pensions Board. The findings of the Board are statutorily binding.  The Minister has no function in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin gave particulars of a case we were able to identify.  I have ascertained that the man in question did not die from the effect of gunshot wounds, as was suggested by Deputy MacEoin, but from a different disability altogether.  I know that, on sentiment, one can appeal to a Minister who was a comrade of these people to ignore the fact that death was not caused by wounds, and to be generous.  That is the way my sentiment would run, but, after all, it would hardly be fair to take such a facile view of the matter.  If a man has survived the activities of 40 years ago for a period of 40 years, it is very difficult to establish that his experiences in service have caused his death.</P>
    <P>With regard to special allowances, cases have been mentioned in which, on an examination of the means, only a very small allowance is payable. Some of these have been mentioned as being as low as £3 a year.  I have to sign most of the letters that go out in this connection.  I get a great deal of correspondence from Deputies.  I do my best to write to each Deputy and to sign the letter myself.  I see all the letters, in any case.  I should be as well pleased to write to a Deputy saying that an allowance had been refused as to say that a sum of £3 a year was granted.</P>
    <P>I do not decide the amount.  Last year, the calculation of means was eased in favour of applicants.  The Minister for Finance indicated in the Budget that there will be a still further improvement in special allowances. I am not yet in a position to say how that improvement will be applied.  I assure the House that it will be applied in the way calculated best to benefit the largest number of applicants for and recipients of special allowances.</P>
    <P>Complaint is often made that the average amount of military service pension is so miserable as to be hardly <Col N="1466" /> worth taking.  That seemed to be the burden of Deputy P. O'Donnell's speech.  Military service pensions were never intended to be a means of livelihood. They are nothing more than a measure of the service rendered by the applicant.  The military service pensions, whether of 1924 or 1934, are a product of the unfortunate Civil War.</P>
    <P>Admitted that the average military service pension is small, if one is to judge the approach to it at this late stage, but that was not the approach when it was granted.  The Government are aware that that is so&mdash;judging the pension from the point of view of purchasing power.  We recognise that to be so because we recognise that, in spite of the granting of these pensions, considerable hardship can still be experienced by Old IRA men.  The scheme of special allowances was introduced. At present, there are 6,700 special allowances on pay, averaging £75.  I think I can claim that the Government have gone a very considerable way towards meeting the fault found in military service pensions.</P>
    <P>As regards the evaluation of means for special allowance purposes, Deputy Jones complained that an allowance of £3 contributed by a son to his household was assessed against the father, an applicant, as equal to 15/- a week.  That is the figure decided upon by all the authorities in the evaluation of means and it has been accepted by the Department of Defence.  Easement in the matter of means took place last year and, again, improvement has been foreshadowed in this year's Budget and will be applied in the near future.</P>
    <P>Complaints were made about verification of applications for medals. When these medals were first introduced, the investigation was not as tight as it became later.  There was no pecuniary advantage attached to them at that time.  As a result of the campaign against the smallness of military service pensions the special allowances were introduced.  The medal scheme was made a basis for them.  That was a fair enough way of approaching the question.</P>
    <P>Because the investigation of the <Col N="1467" /> original medal applications was not as rigid as might reasonably be expected, because it was quite an honorary matter, when medal-holders subsequently applied for special allowances, their entitlement to the medal was re-examined.  The same care in establishing the entitlement was taken as if the applicant were applying for a military service pension.  In a great many of these cases, the entitlement was very seriously questioned and in a great many cases the decisions were reversed.</P>
    <P>If the surviving officers of the battalion and the company to which the applicant claims to have belonged during the critical period can so certify and, at the same time, if all the records available in connection with the Military Service Pensions Acts, that is, military service pension applications, the Referee's records, unit rolls, etc., support the application, there is no hesitation on the part of the Department in granting it.  If it is found on examination of the company roll sent up in 1934 that the man's name is not included, if it is not on the roll prepared by the company officers, and if there is also a roll prepared by the battalion or brigade officers and neither roll contains the applicant's name, it is very difficult 20 or 25 years afterwards to say that the man's name was left off the roll by error.  As I say, it is very difficult to establish that.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that particularly because of the case mentioned by Deputy MacEoin.  He said that officers who resided seven miles away from the place of residence of the applicant had come forward and offered to verify in this case.  The fact is that in that case both the surviving company officers&mdash;there are two of them &mdash;said that the applicant was not a member, and the three surviving battalion officers disclaimed knowledge of him.  That is his own company and his own battalion, and his name is not on the company roll.  The Deputy indicated that certain other members are prepared to certify, but they were not officers of the battalion or the company and under the system of <Col N="1468" /> investigation their evidence is not admissible.  In any event, it would be outweighed by the evidence of the surviving officers.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Davern asked me to indicate what the increases mentioned in the Budget were likely to be.  I am not in a position to give that information.  The Minister for Finance will introduce a Supplementary Estimate to cover the increases, and it will subsequently be necessary for me to introduce legislation to give effect to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin mentioned late applications and the case of an officer who applied for a pension in respect of a wound received in 1922.  The time limit for these applications has long since expired.  Deputy MacEoin suggested that I had power by administrative order to remedy this complaint. That is not so.  Amending legislation is necessary to increase the amount of the pensions, or the method of calculation and to alter any other conditions laid down in the legislation. I am bound by existing legislation until it is amended.  That is my reply to Deputy MacEoin in that case. He enabled me to identify it and that is the answer to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin also inquired about amending the Defence Forces Pensions Scheme to enable an increase of pensions to be given proportionate to the increase in service pay granted on 1st February of last year.  There is no automatic increase in Defence Forces pensions when an increase of service pay is granted.  This matter is somewhat different from the practice in the Civil Service.  When an increase of service pay is granted, it is necessary to amend the scheme to give a corresponding pension increase to those who retired after that increase.  We shall be bringing in that amendment soon, I hope, and the officers and men who retired since 1st February, 1961, will get in their pensions the benefit of that increase in pay.  There was a further increase in Army pay in November last and there will have to be a still further amendment of the Pensions Scheme to give effect to that increase for the benefit of the officers and men who <Col N="1469" /> retired since that second increase was granted.</P>
    <P>I was also asked whether the United Nations accept responsibility for the repayment of the Congo pensions and allowances.  That is the position.  The United Nations accept responsibility for the repayment of pensions, allowances and lump sum compensations awarded by us to the Congo victims and their dependants.  The pensions and allowances are capitalised actuarially and a claim is made on the United Nations for the capital sum.  Already a claim for £53,000 odd has been met by the United Nations and another claim is in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the subject matter of Deputy Tully's complaint in regard to the delays in awarding medals.  I want to emphasise that these delays are not due to any lack of diligence on the part of the officers of the Department.  In practically all cases, they are caused by the inability of the Department to get the necessary verification.  In 900 out of 1,000 cases, it can be taken that that is the cause of the delay.</P>
    <P>There are still 5,000 applications on hands.  It is of interest to those who have been stressing the fact that the amount of military service pensions is reducing each year &mdash; and that is so: the Estimate shows that it is so: it is down by £18,000 &mdash; that as against that there are still 5,000 medal applications on hands and new applications are coming in at the rate of 500 to 1,000 per year.  It is inevitable that there should be a falling off in the total of military service pensions which are a comparatively confined category, but it is obvious that for some time the number of special allowances will continue to increase before you reach the peak and then start on the downward trend, the reason being that, as time passes, an increasing number of recipients of military service pensions become entitled to special allowances and they add to the other categories who can get special allowances when no other type of benefit is open to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin made a plea for an increase in the remuneration of <Col N="1470" /> the civil medical member of the Army Pensions Board.  He is about to get an increase relative to the increase which has been given to the Civil Service in general.</P>
    <P>I am trying, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to deal with the major points that have been made and I am sorry if I am delaying the House in trying to sort out the more important ones. I would say to Deputies that whatever changes will take place in these various matters which have been the subject of this debate, the tendency will always be towards improving the position rather than the reverse. Nobody can justify the claim that has been made by at least two Deputies that there should be no reduction in the global amount &mdash; I think that is the word one of them used &mdash; of military service pensions, that no matter how the number of recipients reduces by death, the total amount should always be paid out to the remaining numbers.  One can see if that were pursued to its logical conclusion, it would be very difficult to justify after a couple of years' operation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherwin talked about a particular type of case.  The Department are not forgetting that particular type of case and I hope we shall be able to deal with it to the satisfaction of the Deputy and of those others who are interested in it.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which has received more attention than anything else.  It was the subject of speeches made both on the Estimate for Defence and on this Estimate for Pensions. Deputy Booth dealt with it on the Estimate for Defence and Deputy de Valera dealt with it on this Estimate. On the question of the source of authority for the action taken by the Department, I want to tell Deputy de Valera that we are quite satisfied that the authority for our action is unimpeachable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I replied pretty fully to it on the Defence Estimate and I do not wish to go back on it now, but I should like to repeat that I have the fulles <Col N="1471" /> sympathy with the officer who has been caught out in the matter.  As I said, I have been hopeful that it would be possible to settle the matter reasonably satisfactorily for all concerned but there is a duty and an obligation on me to ensure that public funds are safeguarded to the best of my ability, without doing any undue injury to anyone. It is obvious that if you have defalcations which have accumulated over a long period and have been carried out by a person of very junior rank, there surely must have been something wrong with the supervision. If the peculation was allowed to go on for the better part of a year, it is hardly true to say that no blame is attaching to the supervision.  I feel that it could not have happened, or could not have persisted for so long, if the supervision had been reasonably good.  It is hardly any answer to say that shortage of staff was the cause.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there are any other points falling to be dealt with. When the case is made that we are niggardly in dealing with those who gave service in the past, the obvious answer to make is to ask the Deputies to look at the total sum which I am now asking the Dáil to provide.  That is the simplest and easiest answer.  The method by which that is distributed, of course, was the burden of most of the speeches made here and we are giving attention to ensure that the distribution is the fairest possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel bound to say from long experience of speeches introducing the Vote for Education that I do not think I have ever heard a bleaker one than the Minister for Education offered us on this occasion.  If anyone hoped to hear him philosophising on the general policy of education, he must have got <Col N="1472" /> a rude shock.  When you compare the contribution the Minister made with those of Deputy P. O'Donnell, Deputy Barron, or Deputy Declan Costello, I cannot help believing that the Minister must have felt constrained to blush.  It is a pity that the Minister, when introducing his Estimate, should not have availed of the occasion to make a more comprehensive review than he felt it his duty to make.  I hope, when he is concluding, he will have somewhat more to say to us about the general prospects of education.</P>
      <P>When his manuscript was circulated, it consisted of 16 pages, nearly two and a half pages of which are devoted to a list of 20 summer courses arranged this year for teachers and which he offered as evidence of the improved level of teaching in the vocational schools.  I cannot imagine that that list is any adequate substitute for the kind of review we would like to hear from him as to the progress made.</P>
      <P>I want to compare that with some of the facts relating to education in the constituency I represent.  The Minister spoke of providing the best possible education for children in the primary schools and said that the big problem was that of classes becoming too big.  Does the Minister realise that in rural areas like Monaghan, where the population is declining, the number of one-teacher schools is growing every year?  There is one parish in the constituency I represent in which there are now four one-teacher schools, where there were all twoteacher schools five or six years ago. In each of these schools, one teacher is trying to teach all the classes, boys and girls, and despite his best efforts, it is impossible to give adequate and reasonable education to children in schools so inadequately staffed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special problem of these counties has been recognised recently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who extended to them the Undeveloped Areas Act but what is more urgently needed is that the Department of Education should suspend the rule relating to the ratio of teacher to pupils.  It is not possible for one teacher to teach all the classes <Col N="1473" /> in a one-teacher school and there ought to be a special dispensation that two teachers should be provided, even though the total of pupils falls below the requisite number.</P>
    <P>If the number falls altogether too low, then the schools should be amalgamated. If an amalgamation is necessary to permit the employment of the minimal number of teachers and if amalgamation is necessary to establish a parochial school, there ought to be an arrangement for a concomitant bus to gather the children from outside areas, bring them to school and bring them home at night.  I know of cases where children are still walking three miles to school.  That seems to me to be completely unreasonable and a situation which urgently requires remedy.</P>
    <P>The larger problem would be solved if in the scattered areas and areas of declining population, there were parochial schools with concomitant transport provided.  That is the practice in other countries and here it would provide a solution to the urgent problem. While steps are being taken to provide a permanent solution, I suggest that it is urgently necessary to amend the regulations so as to provide two teachers in the schools in areas where declining population has reduced a school to the status of a one-teacher school.  It is not reasonable that children in the depressed areas should be deprived of a reasonable standard of education because of old rules which no longer apply in our present circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is very advisable that we should open our eyes to the facts relating to secondary education in this country. There is a lot of obscurantist talk about secondary education but the plain fact is that anyone who has any experience of employing apprentices or training young people has the same story to tell.  Although in many characteristics, a boy who never went beyond the sixth book can be a most excellent apprentice and businessman, the boy with two or three years in a secondary school, when it comes to the point of ultimate promotion, is always the one who gets it.  When you are training the two young people to any job or craft <Col N="1474" /> or trade, the ease with which the people with secondary education can absorb training is quite dramatic.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, exceptions to both rules.  You will find the genius from the national school who will outstep 95 per cent. of the secondary school pupils and you will find the dull boy or girl coming from the secondary school who does not seem to have got any benefit from it.  However, generally speaking, the experience of people concerned with the training of the young after leaving school is that secondary education gives them an advantage which is truly dramatic.</P>
    <P>When you come to statistics with regard to this question, it is hard to find satisfactory statistics but certain such have been made available by the World Survey of Education by UNESCO published in Paris in 1962. Although it relates to a period as far back as 1955 and 1957, I think it is true that, for purposes of comparison, the figures are still relevant.  They take the estimated population between 15 years and 19 years of age inclusive and they then take the average enrolment in secondary schools which is deemed to include secondary education, vocational education and teacher training.</P>
    <P>Of these, we find the rather remarkable figures that the percentage so enrolled of that population of from 15 to 19 years of age is 36 per cent, in Ireland, 88 per cent. in England and Wales, 69 per cent. in Scotland, 75 per cent. in Northern Ireland, 50 per cent. in Norway, 82 per cent. in Denmark, 70 per cent. in Sweden and 87 per cent. in the Netherlands.  It is 79 per cent. in the Federal Republic of Germany; 98 per cent. in Japan; and 73 per cent. in the United States of America.  Those figures have been further broken down by our Department of Education.  The figures I now quote come from the Report of the Department of Education for 1958-59 published by the Stationery Office and the Census of Population, 1951, published also by the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>This covers the enrolment of pupils over 12 and under 18 years of age as full-time pupils in secondary and vocational schools in the Republic of Ireland in the school year 1958-59. <Col N="1475" /> The tragic element in this is that the average enrolment over the 26 Counties is 30.1 per cent.  That goes from, I think, a maximum of 38 per cent. in Clare to a minimum of 18.7 per cent. in Donegal, 21.4 per cent. in Cavan and 22.8 per cent. in Monaghan.  I would ask Deputies to note that the figures I have given cover the school population from 12 to 18 years, whereas the previous figures I gave cover a group of children from 15 to 19 years, inclusive.  The point I want to make here is that there is something radically wrong when you find in three counties of Ireland that the average total numbers in vocational and secondary schools are 18.7 per cent., 21.4 per cent, 22.8 per cent., while the national average is 30.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The facilities for vocational and secondary education in these areas appear to be deplorable and yet I cannot imagine &mdash; I know it is not true &mdash; that children in these areas are less susceptible to education than they are in any other area in Ireland.  Any of us who have any knowledge of the people of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan know that in these areas you have as bright children as come from any part of Ireland.  Yet for all the facilities, they are getting a very much poorer chance of higher education than is available in the rest of the country.  That is something to which, I think, the Minister for Education should turn his attention at the earliest possible time so as to ensure that that obvious anomaly is rectified.</P>
    <P>These certain basic facts are the kinds of things which, I think, should engage the attention of the Minister for Education, and so I propose to offer another statistic which, I think, may surprise some of our colleagues in the House. It refers to the expenditure per head of the population on education and is taken from the World Survey of Education, No. 3, published by UNESCO at Paris, 1962.  The total expenditure per head of the population in Ireland on education is £5.6.  In England and Wales, it is £13; in Scotland, it is £19; in Northern Ireland, it is £12; in Norway, it is £14.7; in Denmark, it is <Col N="1476" /> £12.1; in Sweden, it is £14.6; in Belgium, it is £16.6; in the Netherlands, it is £13.3; in the Federal Republic of Germany, it is £10; in Japan, it is £5; and in the United States of America, it is £32.7.</P>
    <P>That figure has been worked out as a percentage of the national income of these several countries.  When you come to study it from that point of view, our educational expenditure, as a percentage of national income, is 3.4; England and Wales, 3.9; Scotland, 6.5; Northern Ireland, 5.4; Norway, 4.5; Denmark, 3.9; Sweden, 3.1; Belgium 5.2; the Netherlands, 5.1; The Federal Republic of Germany, 3.5; Japan, 3.5 and the United States of America, 4.3. Making due allowance for the fact that this country is a relatively poor country, it is still true to say that we spend less of the national income on education than any other country in the world, with the exception of Sweden, which has, of course, notoriously a very high national income relative to its population.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that one of the most urgent needs of our time is to take effective measures to prevent classes in the primary schools being improperly staffed.  I say it is improper staffing in any school to ask one teacher to teach all the pupils in it.  The minimum ought to be two teachers and, where possible, three.</P>
    <P>We ought to concern ourselves most urgently to expand the opportunities for secondary education for our people, whether it takes the form of general secondary education or vocational education.  When I see all the elaborate buildings going up for vocational education, that may be an admirable thing but you can get very good secondary education without luxurious surroundings.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a very enterprising secondary schoolmaster not so very long ago.  He was telling me of his achievements in the sphere of secondary education.  I asked where on earth did he get the money to provide the building.  He replied that was the least of the expenses he had.  If you get houses and keep them clean and the pupils come and do their daily classes there, they do not expect luxurious <Col N="1477" /> surroundings.  They expect them to be clean and sanitary.  Provided these minima are provided, it is not necessary to spend oceans of money erecting luxurious surroundings to provide secondary education.  Suddenly, it dawned on me that there was a great deal in what he was saying.  If money were invested in the teachers and certain minimal standards were maintained in the premises, we would be getting much better value than we get by spending huge capital sums to provide luxurious surroundings and then not providing adequate staffs to teach the children.</P>
    <P>The figures I have read out to the House demonstrate very dramatically how far behind we have fallen in the provision of secondary education for our children when we realise that 36 per cent. of children between 15 and 19 years of age in this country are having secondary education of some kind as compared with Japan with 98 per cent. and, what is more important to us, countries with whom we will have closer contacts in the immediate future, the Federal Republic of Germany with 79 per cent.; the Netherlands with 87 per cent.; Sweden with 70 per cent.; Denmark with 82 per cent.; Norway with 50 per cent.; Great Britain with 88 per cent.</P>
    <P>Unless we remedy that discrepancy in the very early future, we will get a mighty shock when our people are competing in the new economic world to which I believe we are rapidly moving, and if there emerges, as I believe there will in the lifetime of many Deputies now in the House, an Atlantic community of which we shall form part, unless the present Minister for Education or his immediate successor can make very striking advances in secondary education, then our people will be cast back into the role of hewers of wood and drawers of water which I do not think any of us would contemplate with equanimity. But as certainly as we fail to reach the same level in the provision of secondary education as other members of the Atlantic community have already achieved, so certainly shall our people be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> We have had experience of that before.  We blamed it on maladministration by the British in this country when our people were driven out to America to become there hewers of wood and drawers of water, and to Liverpool, Scotland and elsewhere in the same capacity.  We have seen what has happened in the past ten years &mdash; 250,000 of our people were sent out to look for industrial employment in England and have become in England the hewers of wood and drawers of water.  They are the navvies, the building site workers, the rough workers in England &mdash; because they have not got secondary education and they have not secondary education because it was not available for them in this country or their parents could not afford it.</P>
    <P>Two points of urgency present themselves.  One is that we should make available secondary education, and two, that we should make it available on terms and under conditions in which parents can avail of it for their children.  Otherwise, all our talk of progress is useless because progress really does not consist of pounds, shillings and pence.  If it is of any value, it should consist of men and women and of giving them a better life.  If they are to have a better life consistent with human dignity, then secondary education is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>I often wonder where we are all going.  When I hear a great deal of the talk of progress going on at the present time, I often wonder do those people ever ask themselves what is this progress to which we are all straining to attain.  I recently stood in a big industrial city in Germany where all were congratulating themselves on the dramatic progress that had been made.  They were very well off financially.  It happened that my visit to one of the largest manufacturing units in that industrial city coincided with the leaving of one shift and the coming on of a second.  It was a vast undertaking and there were three shifts.</P>
    <P>I stood at the factory gate and from it I could see the flats buildings which are being built in all the industrial cities and I saw the men coming in <Col N="1479" /> for the second shift with their tin cans in their hands carrying their luncheons. And there passed me at the gate also the fellows going out of the factory from the first shift.  The fellows going in were all pouring out of these big blocks of flats and those going off were all pouring into them.  I stood for a moment contemplating this scene and I asked myself wherever had I seen the likes of that before.  The only place I could think of was an anthill or a beehive.  Then I asked myself what are all these people living for at all?</P>
    <P>There were plenty of television masts on the flats buildings but there did not seem to be very much else.  One must acknowledge that one cannot be familiar with the inner workings of these people's minds and intellects but their activities seemed to be divided between these immense barrack-like blocks of flats &mdash; very modern, very upto-date &mdash; and these factories.  I asked myself is that the kind of life we are all seeking to purchase for our people? If it is, it is hell.  I would sooner be dead than Red but I would sooner be dead also than live under conditions of life analogous to that.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that a great many unthinking people in this country and elsewhere are obsessed and dominated by the idea of the apotheosis of success which would be responsible for the creation of that situation here or anywhere else.  Nobody asks: &ldquo;Suppose we do succeed in creating that position here, where do we go from there?&rdquo; I think one of the functions of the Minister for Education is to try to promote a standard of intellectual equipment in this country which will get our people to ask themselves the question: &ldquo;What do we want?&rdquo; I think the answer should be: to save our souls and to be happy.</P>
    <P>In many industrial countries at the present time, and indeed in America, they can do almost anything for their people, except provide them with those two essentials &mdash; a chance to save their souls and to be happy.  I want to see our people happy and equipped to live in the world, with the prospect of saving their souls.  I want to see them happy, not necessarily rich.  I am not <Col N="1480" /> at all sure that riches will provide them with the key to either of the things which I consider to be the essentials to the survival of the human race. While I do not want our people to be part of the anthill which I saw in that industrial city, I want them to be able to hold their own in the new world into which we are moving, which I foresee as an Atlantic community comprising the whole of free Europe, America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>Two things are urgently necessary. The first is that we should be versed in Continental languages.  One of the most dramatic things I have noticed in the Council of Europe and at other international gatherings where I represented Ireland, was that all Scandinavians speak English.  When I speak of all Scandinavians, I do not mean all delegates from Scandinavia at these conferences but the entire population of Scandinavia &mdash; Swedes, Norwegians and Danes.  They all learn English and can speak it quite freely.  I spoke to a child of 14 or 15 years who spoke English quite well and I asked her when she had been to England.  She said she had never been there, that she had learned the language at school.</P>
    <P>It is the same with the Dutch, though it may not be true to the same extent of the Belgians and the French. It is very widely true now in Federal Germany &mdash; not as strikingly as in Scandinavia, but nevertheless very widely true.  But in Federal Germany, although there may not be a widespread familiarity with English, there is a widespread familiarity with French.  It is nearly true to say that all the Germans have a good working knowledge of some language other than their own.  How far is that true of our own people?  I do not think it is true at all.  If you gathered together all the students of the National University and Trinity College, Dublin, I doubt if you would find that 20 per cent. of the boys would be able to speak a foreign language with any degree of fluency.  You might find 20 per cent. of the girls who would at least have such a knowledge of a foreign language that, if they could spend a year abroad, they could build it up very quickly to a good conversational <Col N="1481" /> user of it.  But that is very poor in comparison with the standards obtaining in the countries to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In this new world into which we are going, it is pathetic to meet civil servants, or people whose business brings them into contact with foreign people for the normal transaction of business, if they are unable to speak French or some Continental language. Of course, it is grotesque to talk about our expanding trade and looking for markets, unless we have Irish people who are fluent in Continental languages. There is no use getting a German agent to try to expand Irish business. He may be doing an excellent job in his own particular sphere of trade in Germany, but he does not know the situation in Ireland as somebody born and bred here does.  He does not know what is possible here and he does not know the difficulties that arise and have to be overcome.</P>
    <P>Unless we equip our young people to speak Continental languages in the new atmosphere of an Atlantic or European community, on the threshold of which we are now standing, we will be in a most unenviable position. Remember, we will be in competition with the Scandinavians.  I concede that in a place like the Council of Europe, you meet pretty expert operators, but you can meet any number of Scandinavians who speak English as well as I can.  I do not suggest for a moment that constitutes the average, but I suggest that the average child educated in Sweden and Denmark can speak English, as can the vast majority of those educated in Norway. Can anybody seriously suggest that we approximate to that level of achievement here?  It is urgently necessary that we should.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that one of the things which would materially contribute to that would be the abolition of the fantastic regulation under which nobody is eligible to be a secondary teacher, unless he is equipped to teach his subjects through the medium of Irish.  With one stroke of the pen, we prohibit the secondary schools of the country from employing <Col N="1482" /> a Frenchman to teach French, a German to teach German, a Spaniard to teach Spanish or an Italian to teach Italian.  You get excellent teachers here to teach those languages, but the plain fact known to most of us is that children taught by a good French professor or an Italian, or a German or a Spaniard, speak the language very much better afterwards than they can ever possibly do when taught by anybody but a very exceptional teacher who learned the language himself or herself.</P>
    <P>In any case, it would invaluably supplement the resources of teaching foreign languages if secondary schools here were allowed to employ university graduates from foreign countries to teach foreign languages here and if such persons were eligible for incremental salaries, provided their scholarship was such as to commend itself to the Department of Education as indicating a sufficient standard of education to make them satisfactory teachers.  It is well known &mdash; it is notorious &mdash; that the whole thing is a fraud.  No teachers in the secondary schools, except a very few, teach through the medium of Irish.  Yet they have all to go through the farce of pretending they do.  It is becoming so ludicrous now that the Department of Education itself recognises it is a fraud.</P>
    <P>The procedure for establishing the capacity of a teacher to teach through the medium of Irish is this.  You walk down the avenue with him and say: &ldquo;Conus atá tú?&rdquo;&ldquo;Tá mé go maith,&rdquo;&ldquo;Lá brea é?&rdquo;&ldquo;Séa, go deimhin.&rdquo; He is then deemed to be qualified to teach through Irish and to conduct his relations with other teachers through Irish.  That kind of cod is revolting, disgusting and fundamentally dishonest. Quite apart from anything else, it constitutes a very serious impediment to the employment of effective staff at a time when such people are urgently necessary.</P>
    <P>Can you imagine a situation in which we, like every other country, find ourselves almost unable to get qualified teachers of science?  In this country, as far as I know, a person has not only to be a qualified teacher <Col N="1483" /> of science but he is supposed to be capable of teaching science through the medium of Irish.  Otherwise, he is not eligible for incremental salaries as a secondary teacher.  That is draft, and yet we go on with it.  I suggest to the Minister that the facilities for teaching science in most of the secondary schools are very poor.  That is partly due, I suppose, to the difficulty of getting staff, because science teachers are snapped up by industry and so forth.  That problem is being grappled with abroad and it will have to be grappled with here, however it is done.  Maybe you will have to pay a premium for science teachers.  If you have to, you had better do it.</P>
    <P>I see there is provision in the Estimate &mdash; I think it is a new provision &mdash; for grants for the provision of laboratories and science teaching equipment.  That is a very sensible proviso, but there is no use having the laboratories if there are no teachers to go into them.  The urgent thing is that you should be able to get science teachers.  Any schools with which I have any contact tell me it is virtually impossible to get them. Mark you, the Department of Agriculture had a spot of bother of that kind also.  The Department of Agriculture set up such a magnificent salary scale &mdash; for which I was myself partly responsible &mdash; in connection with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis that it turned all the vest into quasi-millionaires, you could not get a veterinary inspector in the Department and the whole scheme nearly broke down.</P>
    <P>To-day, the Minister, after some hullabaloo, strife and pandemonium, has to face the fact that both in Great Britain and here, there is an acute shortage of vest.  He had to meet that situation and overcome it.  Some elaborate formula was worked out with the Department of Agriculture that they would not get an increase in salary but would get an increase in honorarium.  In that way, everybody's face was saved and the vest went back to work.  We have now, I believe, a more or less adequate staff.</P>
    <P>We are bound to be faced with that, <Col N="1484" /> too, in the sphere of secondary education and science teachers.  Industry is so ready to employ them and so eager to pay them that I think some recognition of that fact is called for in order to attract a sufficient number of teachers for the teaching of science, in order that we shall not fall hopelessly behind, which at present undoubtedly this country is doing.</P>
    <P>I see people in all sorts of exalted positions speaking of the necessity of giving a rural bias to education in the primary schools.  I do not particularly want to give a bias in any direction in the primary schools provided I can be sure that the children are getting the best education possible.  I direct the attention of the Minister for Education to the facts, and sometimes it is very difficult to sort the facts out from the propaganda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great hullabaloo going on at present about increased exports of industrial goods and that gets merged with the general picture of increased exports.  When you examine the question of these increased exports, you discover that the increase in exports in 1961 as compared with 1960 is 80 per cent. due to agricultural produce and I think about eight per cent. to industrial exports.  I merely mention that fact to remind the House that, economically and financially, this country rests on the foundation of agriculture, both for its exports and the employment of the bulk of our people.  If that is allowed to fritter away, the Japanese sewing machines and these other highly desirable exports will not keep us long in being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see, therefore, the people in whose hands the fundamental source of wealth in this country is going to be put given as good an education as it is possible to get for them, first of all in the primary schools and, secondly, in the secondary schools, which, as I have already emphasised, is necessary if they are to adapt their minds to the technical training which is suitable and applicable to their <Col N="1485" /> employment on the land and ultimately as owners of the land.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that their minds in the formative years should be at least open to the possibilities of agricultural life on the land.  I find that to get things done, you have to keep at them for years.  I know whereof I speak in this regard.  There was in general use in the primary schools of this country 40 years ago an agricultural reader called <i>Baldwin's Agricultural Reader</i>.  That book had a very dramatic history because it was not written by Professor Baldwin.  That book was written by Sir Henry Doran who was the Chief Inspector of the Land Commission. Having written that book, which he composed as a result of years of service as a Land Commission inspector amongst the people, he felt it would not sell if it were not associated with the name of a distinguished agricultural science scholar and he went up to Professor Baldwin who was the Professor of Agricultural Science in Glasnevin and asked him if he would sponsor the book.  He said not only that he would sponsor the book but that it could be called by his name and that is how it came to be called <i>Baldwin's Agricultural Reader.</i></P>
    <P>That book was in use in this country for a generation.  It was dropped some time in the twenties but I knew of my own experience the difference between the farmers who were grown men coming into my business establishment in Ballaghaderreen who had read <i>Baldwin's Agricultural Reader</i> at school as children and the farmers who had not; and I could always tell at the seed and manure time of year the farmer who had read <i>Baldwin's Agricultural Reader</i> and the farmer who had not.  I could always tell, when a man was discussing the feeding of pigs with me or the feeding of calves the farmer who had read that book.  They did not become agricultural experts but their minds had been opened and certain aspects of seeds, rotation of crops, manurial procedures and feeding of livestock had been fixed irremovably in their minds.  Most of them were men who had received no more than a simple primary education but the benefits as ordinary small <Col N="1486" /> farmers that they had derived from that early acquaintanceship with an agricultural reader of that kind were very great.</P>
    <P>So strongly did I feel about this that when I was Minister for Agriculture, I gave a professor of Glasnevin College a fee of 500 guineas to re-write <i>Baldwin's Agricultural Reader</i> and bring it up to date.  That man's manuscript is in the Department of Agriculture.  I knew perfectly well when I got that manuscript brought up to date that the man to whom I had committed the task was not equipped to write it in a style and format that would be acceptable to children of primary schools. What I wanted was the material of <i>Baldwin's Agricultural Reader</i> brought up to date and then to get somebody to edit it in a form that would be acceptable as a school book.</P>
    <P>I want to say this quite deliberately: I did not get the slightest encouragement. The vested interests that control the distribution of school books in this country were not interested.  I proposed that the Department of Agriculture would subsidise the book at half the cost &mdash; I think we reckoned it would cost 5/- to produce it.  I wanted to sell it at 2/6d.  That proposition did not interest anybody at all.  There were many people writing and publishing books for the primary schools and they did not want any new reader to be introduced into the curriculum that might interfere with the sales of the highly profitable volumes they were producing and distributing.</P>
    <P>I think that is wrong.  Both the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education would do very well to take the material of Doran's Agricultural Reader, as revised in that manuscript, edit it, illustrate it and publish it on the basis of a subsidised school reader.  I cannot believe that there is not in existence in this country any individual as well able to do that in this age and generation as Sir Henry Doran was able to do it 60 odd years ago.  Further, I advise the Minister for Agriculture that the material on which to do it is at present in his Department and it is up to him to get it edited and made available. <Col N="1487" /> I do not want necessarily to foist it on anybody; all I want to ensure is that it is made available to those teachers who want to use it in their schools and who believe the children going to their schools could derive advantage from it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to conclude without saying a word about the teaching of Irish.  Is there any answer to two propositions?  We have been 40 years at the present methods of teaching Irish.  Can anyone suggest that they have succeeded?  That is the first proposition.  The second proposition is: if we are to succeed in reviving Irish as a spoken language in this country, is there any hope of doing that if we do not get the support of the majority of the people?  I do not think there is.  I think, in order to make Irish a spoken language in this country, we will have to get the majority of the people to want it.</P>
    <P>Now, does anybody deny that 40 years ago there was a strong, ardent movement for the revival of the language? Is it not a fact that at that time the language movement was one which overrode sectarian and political differences, and gathered into its ranks all sorts of people, who differed about everything else, but who had a common loyalty and desire to see the language survive?  Does anybody suggest that a similar state of affairs obtains to-day?  I suggest that the methods we have been using over the past 40 years have changed the whole atmosphere of enthusiasm for and love of the language into one of considerable resistance to and dislike of the language.  I regard that as a tragedy.  I believe that arises very largely from a sense of injustice and from a growing association in the public mind of the language movement with manifest injustices which cry out for redress.</P>
    <P>It was not necessary to march seven times round the Walls of Jericho to bring them crashing down about the teaching of infants through the medium of Irish.  I am informed by teachers now that nobody is expected to teach the infants through the medium of Irish any longer.  It is a dead letter and, in fact, they teach <Col N="1488" /> whatever they think wise and prudent to children in the infant classes.  What disgusts me is that, although now that is universally known to be the fact, nobody must say so.  The theory is the children in the infant classes are still to be taught through the medium of Irish, but there are a whole lot of circulars, and qualifications, and so forth.  The fact is the stupid fraud is dead and the teachers are now able to teach the children in the infant classes as they think best.  If they can put in a word of Irish occasionally, then they can put it in, but they ordinarily use the vernacular of the children's homes; where desirable, they use a phrase, or two, in Irish, and so on.</P>
    <P>That is a sensible approach.  No one can complain about it.  So long as the teacher is perfectly free to teach the children through the vernacular of the home, I am quite prepared to leave it in the discretion of the average teacher in this country, dealing with infant children, not to overtax, bewilder, or harass them in the ordinary course of treating them as infants in the infant school.  But all that cod to which I have referred was carried on and I have known teachers to be driven almost into mental hospitals by the belief that they had a strict obligation on them to use nothing but the Irish language for the first two years of an infant's training in the infant school. It was daft.  It was wholly wrong.  It permitted great evil.  I hope, and I believe, that I am right in understanding that the whole silly fraud has been put an end to and that our teachers are now free to use the vernacular of the home in the infant school, wherever they consider that necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to renew my protest against a system whereunder a child in this country who gets honours or pass in every subject, but fails in Irish, is refused his leaving certificate.  I say that system is unjustifiable.  It is wrong; it is unjust.  It should be put an end to.  There had to be substituted for the present absurd situation a proviso whereby any person who wished to get a statement from the Department of Education of the subjects in which he had passed in his leaving certificate <Col N="1489" /> could pay half-a-crown and get it.  But unless one pays the halfcrown, one will not get it.  But nobody knows about it.  The theory is that anybody can get the statement.  The fact is that you can get it if you pay half-a-crown.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, we have built up throughout our social pattern of employment an established principle that you cannot get a job in the ESB, enter hospital for training as a nurse, or enter a whole range of employment in this country, if you have not got your leaving certificate.  You will not get your leaving certificate, no matter how clever you are, if you have not passed in Irish.  I have had occassion to say in the public streets of this city that I know President Truman, and I have met President Adenaeur and President de Gaulle, all of whom are monolingual, and none of whom would be eligible for employment in the ESB, if he lived in Ireland.  Is that not daft? There are brilliant men who have not a gift for languages, but, in Ireland, if you have not got the gift, you can go to Birmingham to look for a job; you can be President of the United States of America but you cannot get a job in the ESB.  It is all a cod.</P>
    <P>It is wholly wrong again that children cannot get higher education in our universities here, unless they take Irish in their matriculation.  It is a monstrous thing to have afflicted women bustling up to Drumcondra and implorting the Archbishop to allow them to send their children to Trinity because the children cannot pass in Irish, or else to a redbrick university in England.  The further considerable obstacle arises that some children are thereby excluded from university education altogether.  I do not know how long we will carry on with that pestilent fraud, but, the longer we carry on, the stronger will become the opposition to the revival of the language, and that is something I deplore.</P>
    <P>I should like to see harnessed to the revival movement all the enthusiasm, and ardour, and hope that surrounded it 40 years ago, when, I think, we were really going places.  In my young lifetime, the Irish language <Col N="1490" /> emerged from the shades and became again an important national asset.  In the past 40 years, I have seen the Gaeltacht, which I knew intimately as a youngster, fading away.  Anyone who knows it knows that 40 years ago you would not hear a world of English in the streets of Falcarragh.  Deputy O'Donnell will bear me out in that, Now, you do not hear a world of Irish. Forty years ago, in Tourmakeady, you would not hear a world of English Now you will not hear a word of Irish.  You could go out the road to Ballingeary 40 years ago and Irish was universally spoken east of Inchigeela. Now, I doubt if there is very much Irish in Ballingeary itself.  These are the reservoirs of the language. They have dwindled away to not much more than a quarter of what they were 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, I have seen a growing antipathy to the language spread amongst the young people.  I believe the very call for the survival of the language is itself endangered. I believe it is in danger for the reasons I have outlined.  Oddly enough, in certain respects, I think we should go further than we are going at present.  I do not think it is possible to get established in this city, if a group of parents want it, a school in which the subjects will be taught exclusively through the medium of Irish, a school in which Irish is the ordinary vernacular of teaching.  Such a school should be made available where it is possible and where a sufficient group of parents in an urban area such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and so on, where there is an aggregation of people, come to the Department of Education and say, for example: &ldquo;There are 40 parents here. We have 50 children available for teaching now and the prospect of a growing group of children down the years.  We want a school which will teach our children through the medium of the Irish language, the vernacular which they hear at home.&rdquo; At present, I do not think it is possible to get it. Can they?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is desirable. It ought to be possible for people who can get a sufficient number of children to send them to a school where the vernacular of their home will be the vernacular of the school.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the continued association of a deep sense of grievance with the language policy is doing the language itself an infinity of harm. It is also true that deep resentment is felt by many people because Irish is made a pre-condition of promotion in the public service in strictly technical areas, which is a manifest injustice and which has resulted in many excellent men being driven out of our public service or else spending their lives under a deep sense of justified grievance. It has created the impression in the minds of many &mdash; which I do not believe is wholly unsubstantiated &mdash; that Irish has on more than one occasion been used as a fraudulent lever to secure the appointment of an inferior candidate over the head of a superior candidate.  All these abuses should be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be able to get together again and enrol the services of voluntary organisations such as Gael Linn, the Gaelic League, and others, and give them all the help we can to build up the old enthusiasm that existed for the revival of the language. I should like to see Irish taught and I think it is correct that Irish should be taught in every secondary school in Ireland.  But let me be perfectly clear: I do not want any ambiguity about what I believe in.  I want it taught as a subject.  However, a child who gets a pass or honours in five subjects of the approved matriculation <Col N="1492" /> subjects should be entitled to receive the leaving certificate, with all that it implies.  Over and above that, children going for the leaving certificate should be entitled to get a document, whatever you like to call it, a certificate such as the leaving certificate, for a group of subjects representing what would be called a liberal education&mdash;call it a diploma or a statement, if you like&mdash;setting out each individual subject in which the candidate passed, if he or she has not succeeded in passing all of the five subjects.</P>
    <P>However you manage, if a child with a mathematical bent finds a difficulty which he is unable to overcome in passing an examination in Irish, that should not prevent him from having the right to employment or preferment in his own country.  It certainly should not prevent him from having access to the university in his own country to which he would normally go, the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to give us some reassurance in regard to the following matters.  First, I hope he will be able to reassure us that a more rational approach to this whole Irish question will be adopted.  In the second place, I hope he will be able to reassure us that the scandal of the one-teacher school will be ended, with special reference to the areas I have described where the tendency for the school population to dwindle rapidly is becoming more marked.  In the third place, I hope he will be able to tell us that he is conscious of the need to expand the opportunity for secondary school education for our children, not only in respect of premises but of teaching personnel in both science and foreign languages.</P>
    <P>I do not want to minimise the problem.  This is a relatively poor country and, if we are to continue to be a free and independent Republic, then relatively poor we shall continue to be.  People ought to face that fact: it is the price of independence.  We can change it any day we like on the same terms as Newfoundland made the change, namely, by incorporating ourselves in some larger unit where greater <Col N="1493" /> wealth is universally available.  I do not think that is a price we ought to pay.  However, we have got to recognise that our resolution not to pay that price in some measure limits the resources available to us for the things we would like to do.  It makes it all the more urgently incumbent upon us to make a right choice between the various things we can do.  I suggest the Minister should assert with emphasis in the Government that the highest priority be given to education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always surprised when I hear intelligent and experienced people such as Deputy Dillon and his counterparts on the other side of the House talk about the country being poor and the apparent inevitability of being a poor country because we want to live in a particular way and then to hear them say the alternative to being poor is to join a great <i>bloc</i> and in that way increase our wealth while losing certain values which would be inevitable because of our membership of such a <i>bloc</i>.  To me, that argument is unacceptable.  I do not think one has to become a part of any great <i>bloc</i> to achieve a position of prosperity in society.  It was possible certainly in the past 40 years &mdash; it is more difficult now than ever before, but even now it is possible&mdash;to create a viable economy and to provide the Minister for Education and the Minister for Health with the money necessary to establish social justice and a proper system of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As proof of that, we need only look at countries such as Switzerland, which is a tiny country, and Denmark, which is still independent, even though it is in the Scandinavian <i>bloc</i>.  Those countries with their limited resources, particularly in the case of Denmark, are very like ours, and they have been able to create an economy and a standard of living for their people including a system of education, health services, care for old people, which has never been bettered by any of the great powers &mdash; the American <i>bloc,</i> the Russian <i>bloc</i> or the Central European <i>bloc</i>.  Those small countries have shown that if their politicians are prepared to pursue their ambitions they <Col N="1494" /> can create a just society and the logical conclusion is that we equally can be the possessors of an educational system second to none in Europe or the world.</P>
    <P>We have, I suppose, one of the most inefficient educational systems in Europe.  It seems, to me that can only be the result of design; I cannot agree it happened unconsciously.  It must have been the design of successive Governments.  They must have decided that we should set up an educational system under which the privileged class of society established by the British would be perpetuated.  It is about time we gave up blaming the British for whatever system they established in Ireland.  Their conservatives have long ago abandoned a sort of apartheid type of society, with segregation of the poor or less wealthy in regard to secondary schools and universities. We must accept full responsibility, and successive Governments must accept full responsibility, for the fact that we have a system of education like the system of apartheid which operates against the unfortunate Africans in Secondary schools and universities.</P>
    <P>The fact that they have not got money keeps the bulk of our children from attending secondary schools.  The Department of Education has been the instrument used by successive Governments to create this kind of society in which the old levels are perpetuated and the doctor's son becomes a doctor, a lawyer's son becomes a lawyer, a carpenter's son becomes a carpenter, and so on.  Only in exceptional circumstances is it possible for a child to rise above the parental level.  That is grossly unjust and it is a very sad commentary on the system of education we have created by our own hand. We can blame no one but ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is fascinating to listen to leading speakers from both sides of the House saying they want to have education accessible to every child who is intellectually capable of using it, but they will not go on to the next step and say: &ldquo;We must give up the old conservative approach.  We have not achieved our aim and we must change the whole basic system.&rdquo;  If they were sincere, <Col N="1495" /> if they were not hypocritical, they would see to it that each child got the equal opportunity promised in the Proclamation that we would cherish equally all the children of the nation.  As everyone knows we cherish them equally but some rather more equally than others.  That is certainly true of our society.</P>
    <P>I wish some of our leading politicians would have the courage to face up to what the former leader of the Fianna Fáil Party said at one time &mdash; I am not criticising him; he is not present &mdash;&ldquo;If this system does not work, let us go outside it.&rdquo;  I wish someone on one side or the other would go outside the system which we have tried in a dedicated way for 40 years.  People sincerely believed that it could work but it has not worked and we are left in the position that both sides of the House admit that we have not got money for more scholarships, more secondary or university education, to pay the teachers better, to provide better equipment in the schools, or any of the other prerequisites of an efficient system of education.</P>
    <P>We have not got the money.  That is not an accident.  It is a direct result of the failure of our economic policies. Other countries have shown that it can be done.  We are not ploughing any new furrow or suggesting radical changes.  Other countries have shown the way.  It is unfortunate that we should now be tailing behind so many of the Afro-Asian countries which have accepted that some form of public ownership or social system is the only way by which money can be made available.  Whether we like it or not that is the only way.  Industry and agriculture should be organised in order to create the optimum wealth through the operation of an interrelationship of the State, labour and capital.  With the Minister for Education in educational matters, the Minister for Health in health matters, the Minister for Social Welfare in social welfare matters, and all the Ministers and Departments, we could create the ideal society.</P>
    <P>Someone once said that many of <Col N="1496" /> our politicians became politicians by accident, but that cannot be accepted as an excuse for what they have not done.  I suppose we must be grateful for what they have done, but there is a new generation now.  The Minister is the successor of Deputy Moylan, Deputy Derrig, Deputy Mulcahy and even Deputy de Valera in his time.  All those people of the older generation have been succeeded by Deputy Hillery.  Whatever was done in their time to make any serious attempt to create an egalitarian type of educational system, the Minister has made none at all.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me when Deputy Lynch was Minister for Education it would be difficult to get a worse, more complacent, more futile, more inert Minister, but to my amazement Deputy Hillery has succeeded.  I think I was one of the first members of this House to stand up and congratulate and praise Deputy Hillery on his accession to the position of Minister. I think both sides of the House were glad to see him in that position.  He is a decent person, we all like him, and he is a young man with tremendous opportunities and possibilities before him and with the background of his own education behind him, an education which was denied to many of the older generation, through no fault of their own, because they were busy doing something very much more important at the time.  They cannot be blamed for that.  Perhaps they can be exculpated for what they have not done but that excuse was not there for Deputy Lynch and it is not there for Deputy Hillery.</P>
    <P>It now appears that he accepts the status of his predecessor, Deputy Lynch, as a sort of political news-reel for the civil servants of the Department. I dislike talking about civil servants in that way.  I do not wish to appear to criticise them.  If they have taken powers and if they have aggregated powers to which they have no right constitutionally it is because of the decision of the Minister.  Everyone who has been Minister of a Department knows that a Minister gets everything in draft form, whether it be a speech or the answer to a Question, <Col N="1497" /> but it is ultimately the Minister who is responsible and it is he only who decides or has the power to decide, with the consent of his Government, what the policy of the Department should be.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous the way Deputy Hillery as Minister for Education has spent his time shivering behind his Departmental sheet of paper, refusing to make any comment or creative suggestions or to make any advance from the state of inertia which has prevailed in the Department for 40 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no Department more important than the Department of Education in the matter of shaping the attitudes, the minds, the standards and the values of our society.  It is particularly sad to see a young persons with the great power he has, deciding that he will not choose to use it.  I do not think there is any section in the Department which has not suffered as a result of the continuity of conservative, obscurantist <i>laissez faire</i> inertia of the Department of Education over 40 years, whether it is in regard to the building of schools or the policy on the language. It is quite furtile for anyone to say that we are going to revive the language as the spoken language of this country. They have seen to it that it will be quite impossible to revive it as the spoken language.  It is dead: it is a corpse.  It is now as dead as dust in a tomb and there is no question of reviving it.  You might as well face up to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the same thing in relation to small matters, the attitude to corporal punishment, and to the very big one, the question of giving equal opportunity to children to access to higher education in our society, the question of scholarships.  In none of these things has the Minister made any serious attempt to create an egalitarian type of society in Ireland, or to deal with the serious problems of the Irish language, the school building programme, the overcrowding of <Col N="1498" /> classes and so on.  I do not understand how a Minister who at the same time is a doctor, could, with the complacency he showed, tell us recently that the last figure he has for the number of schools which have to be built is approximately 736.  He is building them, as Deputy O'Donnell said, for a decreasing population.  The figure changes very little.  I think it was 1,000 when the late Deputy Moylan was here years ago.  The figure is 736 at the average building rate of 78 per year.</P>
    <P>The astonishing thing to me is that the Minister for Education should have seemed to have felt a certain self-satisfaction in this wonderful achievement. Leaving aside the question of continued dereliction, and old buildings &mdash; I think the figure is 40 a year; it is a difficult figure to get &mdash; it will take him approximately 10 years &mdash; the whole of a child's life in any of these schools &mdash; to get around to building the schools.  Why is he so self-satisfied?  Why is he so complacent about it?  Why does he do nothing?</P>
    <P>There was, I suppose, some reasonable objection at the end of the war when we had a shortage of building materials and a tremendous demand for slum clearance, above all.  Those came under priority needs but that is all gone now.  At the moment, you find the lounge bars being re-decorated, shops receiving new fronts.  Luxury hotels having storeys added to them. Building is going on in that type of thing at a tremendous rate but that is primarily designed for the outsider, for the tourists and for the foreigner.</P>
    <P>Why should we accept that our own people should play second fiddle in this question of priority?  It permeates the whole of the Government's side, this attitude to our own people.  It is particularly noticeable in the Department of Justice, the attitude that everything must be designed for the tourist. But why does the Minister, with his background of health, tolerate a situation where over 700 schools are so bad, so derelict that they have been condemned by the doctors concerned? Everyone knows that these schools are not condemned unless they are so bad <Col N="1499" /> that it is no longer possible to conceal the fact from anyone.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister sits there and tells us that at the end of 10 years, assuming that no schools are going to fall into this particular type of decay, we will have got rid of this backlog.  But the technicians, the craftsmen, and the materials are there.  Every newspaper, every television and radio broadcast, all the economic forecasts and the Civil Service bulletins tell us we never had it so good, that society was never so prosperous and the national income never better; the money is there to give away to various industrialist, to pay into gold mines or copper mines and other sorts of curious, doubtful projects, but yet we do not appear to have the money to build schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not appear to have created any sense of urgency in the minds of his colleagues that something should be done for these unfortunate children who are being educated in these derelict schools.  Is he right? Is he satisfied?  Why should he be satisfied?  Is there any one of us who would like to see our children educated in these schools?  Why should we be satisfied to let the children of other people be educated in them, if we would not like our own children to be educated there?  Have not they equal rights in our community?  Is that not more of the hypocrisy that we have gone on with for 40 years?</P>
    <P>Is it not time that one Minister for Education decided that this is a problem which can be rapidly dealt with? It is merely a physical problem, a question of labour, capital and material, and all these are available, Why is it that the Minister has not made any attempt to deal with this problem?  It is quite scandalous that this is the type and standard of building which we tolerate for the working class children because it is for the children of the working classes that we tolerate them.</P>
    <P>Clongowes, Belvedere, Blackrock, High School and all the other colleages have their football grounds, swimming pools and recreation facilities.  I do <Col N="1500" /> not grudge them to them, but I do not see why they should get these things and why the mass of the population should be denied them and should find themselves in overcrowded schools with unfortunate teachers who are so much frustrated that they abuse the idea of corporal punishment.  It is a very bad system.  It is a very serious comment on the Minister's failure to understand his moral responsibilities to the people that he should not take serious steps to deal with this problem at a time when we protest that we are dealing with all the really important problems of our society.</P>
    <P>The universities are practically completely closed to the poorer child simply because his father happens to be an agricultural worker, a labourer, or a person who will not work or is unemployed.  Why should the talented child of these people he penalised? How can you justify, how can you rationalise this discrimination against the intelligent and talented children of poor parents who could become scientists, or lawyers, doctors or architects in which professions they could fulfil whatever God-given talents they may have?  Surely that is a betrayal of our responsibility to these children?</P>
    <P>If a man happens to be born into a particular level of society in which he cannot earn any more than £7, £8 or £9 per week and he is encouraged, as people are in this country, to have large families, how can these children get to a secondary school or a university?  A mere handful of scholarships is handed out.  The Minister replied to a question of mine recently that there was a 300 per cent, increase in secondary school scholarships and a 200 per cent, increase in university scholarships.  That reminded me of a statement made by Hore Belisha at the beginning of the last war, when people were frightened in England, when he said with great complacency and self-satisfaction: &ldquo;You will be glad to hear that we have increased the output of Spitfires by 500 per cent, and of Hurricanes by 300 per cent.&rdquo;  That meant that instead of producing two Spitfires a month, they were producing ten and instead of producing five <Col N="1501" /> Hurricanes a month, they were producing 15.</P>
    <P>That was completely dishonest, as dishonest as the intellectual wriggling of the Minister which has denoted his whole attitude throughout his tenure of office.  The vast majority of our children are completely excluded from higher education in our society after the Minister's miserable contribution to remedy the effects of years of failure on the part of successive Governments. The vast bulk of our children are as badly off as ever before because the scholarships are completely inadequate in number and in the amount of money.</P>
    <P>For a man with a salary of £10 or £15 a week to send his child to a secondary school or university is a great sacrifice.  Without a scholarship, it is impossible.  The sin of the father is that he was not born into a society that could give him a secondary education and that sin is visited by us on the children.  Without a big income, the father cannot send his child to a secondary school or university.  The scholarships given here are so inadequate that many fathers cannot afford to take advantage of them on behalf of their children.  I see around my own constituency every day lovely young boys and girls who are obviously of a high order of intelligence and at 14 years of age; they are sent off to pedal messenger bicycles or to sell newspapers. That is a complete scandal.  We would not have it for our own children or for ourselves.  Why do we then tolerate it for any of our fellow citizens?</P>
    <P>The idea recently expressed by the Minister for Justice that an increase of salary is a status symbol is something that permeates everything in our society.  If you have money you have no fears for your old age, no need to worry about becoming ill, no need to worry about education in secondary school or university and ultimately a seat on a board of directors.  You start at the top and need never leave the top.  That is the kind of society envisaged by the Department of Education at the instance of succeeding Governments, in spite of the undertaking given by the members of some <Col N="1502" /> of these Governments to their comrades 40 years ago that the Government of the Republic would cherish the children of all its citizens.</P>
    <P>The older men did something; they attempted something.  They did something at some time to create a new Ireland but is it not time that the Minister for Education and the Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to add something to that instead of sitting on it and smiling like Cheshire cats, with nothing behind the smiles but blank minds?  I am not going into the figures of the amounts which are given to send a child to a secondary school or university.  When a person sends a child to a secondary school or university, that person denies himself of a possible source of income.  A child of 14 years of age goes out to work.  I do not know what the shopkeeper or newspaper owner who employs him to sell his paper squeezes out of him, but he gets about 30/- or £2 a week.  The unfortunate parent sometimes must have that money and that is one of the sacrifices which he makes by sending his child to a secondary school.  That parent denies himself that couple of pounds.  He has to clothe and feed the child, pay transport costs and provide for the child through all those years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no effort to find out to what extent the money he pays out in scholarships is a sufficient cover for these costs.  Presumably, he merely thought of a number and possibly divided it by two and then settled on that as the grant to be paid.  Anybody who sees the money available would know and accept that the figures are completely inaccurate even when the increase is taken into consideration. The number was increased by 300 per cent., or whatever it is.  That merely increase the ratio from 5 per cent. to 15 per cent. and from 4 per cent. to 8 per cent.  Scholarships administered by local authorities vary between £100 and £200 a year.  Having regard to the increasing cost of living, transport costs, the cost of books and materials, it is quite clear that there should be a very radical increase not only in the number of the scholarships but also in the amount of money made <Col N="1503" /> available in order to provide for the total living costs of the person while he or she is attending the secondary school or the university.</P>
    <P>Most of the time the child is faced with the frustrating experience of being sufficiently clever to merit the scholarship and then being financially unable to avail of it.  There should be only one test.  When a child is ready to finish in the national school at 14 years of age he or she should be given a chance to go to a vocational or secondary school and from that to the university if intellectually equipped. This has nothing to do with the parent's ability to pay.  If the parent can pay, well and good.  Access to the secondary school or the university should be based on the intellectual capacity of the child and not on the economic or financial standing of the child's parents.  Until we get to such a state of society it is rubbish to talk about a system in which everybody is treated alike.</P>
    <P>Very briefly, I should like to talk about punishment in the schools.  I know I am considered a crank in this matter as in other matters.  This is a thing to which I should like to refer regularly.  The constant drop wears the stone and eventually, perhaps, something will be achieved.  I wonder whether the Minister on this relatively simple subject has any views at all other than the Departmental views?  I believe it is completely wrong to touch a child under any circumstances whether in the home or at school.  I am considered in the minority in this respect.  I believe this for the reason that either you have a rational individual as a child or as an adult, or you cannot.  You can either explain something to a child or you cannot.  It is quite futile to beat a child who does not know why you are doing it.  That seems to me to be completely unthinkable. It is fantastic to see in the street mothers beating infants who do not know what it is all about.  It is completely wrong.  It should not be done in the schools at all.  I do not know whether it is done at that age.</P>
    <P>When the child gets to a state of reason you can explain certain things <Col N="1504" /> to him.  For example, you can point to a fire and tell him that is a fire and that he will burn himself if he falls into it.  He can be told that if he throws a stone at a windows he will break the glass.  It is possible to make the child understand that good behaviour is in the common interest.  The child will be prepared to accept your case if you reason, just as I hope Deputies will accept my reasoning when I speak here.  I do not mind if they do not but I do not beat the Deputies on the head because they do not go my way.  It is astonishing to think that a teacher or an adult beats a child.  After talking to the child for a while explaining what it should not do, the child does the very thing that is wrong and it is beaten.  It would be absurd to bring that type of reasoning into adult life.  It is completely illogical.</P>
    <P>Beating a child breaks the most desirable nexus between the parent and the child&mdash;love of the parent for the child and the respect and regard which the child has for its parents. That is destroyed immediately the parent does what to the child must be an unreasonable act, beating him for something he does not understand.  To my mind, that is the great case against using violence towards the child.  I do not believe in using violence towards anybody at any time.  It is most unthinkable for grown-ups to use their superior strength to terrify a child into submission.  That is what it is, call it what you like.</P>
    <P>Bishop Lucey is a man for whom I have considerable regard because I like the way he comes out into the open to state his point of view.  He does not stay behind closed doors.  If you disagree with his views he does not mind.  He has a right to express his views.  That is the perfect relationship. He was justifying corporal punishment on foot, I think, of original sin.  I do not understand that rationalisation at all.  I always believed that the purpose of Baptism was to get rid of original sin but if Baptism does not do it beating will not do it either.  I do not think there is any justification whatever for the beating of children.</P>
    <P>I am not putting forward any <Col N="1505" /> original views or ideas here.  This attitude to children is accepted in many countries.  It is now old hat in many countries.  There are literally hundreds of schools in which nobody would dare touch a child even it ideologically they believed they should touch the child.  They would be guilty of criminal assault.  That is the position in many schools in America, Canada and the Scandinavian countries. This is not an original thesis of mine at all.  All it means is that, as usual, we are 40 years behind the times. We shall catch up but we should hurry up a little.  The best way to educate a child is to reason with him.</P>
    <P>We talk about democracy, the democratic idea and the right of free speech but we are controverting that, denying that and refuting that.  The children are frightened of us and we are surprised that when we turn our backs, they do the stupid thing.  It is because they are frightened, not of the thing they are told not to do, but of the punishment for doing it that as soon as our backs are turned, they do it.  That creates a particularly perverted type of personality, of individual.</P>
    <P>A difficulty most teachers have is the crowded classroom and the only way, apperently, in which they can keep order is to put the fear of God into the children.  That again is visiting on the children the crimes of their parents.  There should be no overcrowded classes.  All classes should be retained at a reasonable size.  Of course the wrong person to blame for all this is the child.</P>
    <P>There have been numerous cases in which teachers have abused their powers.  I think they are fewer now than they were in my time when there was an awful lot of brutality by the teachers.  We read in the papers of those cases which come to the newspapers through the courts.  It is possible there are not many of them, but it is also possible that because the child is too frightened of the teacher he or she is afraid to tell.  Any child I have spoken to has told me he is beaten, not outrageously, but beaten all the same, and not as a disciplinary measure <Col N="1506" /> alone but for not knowing lessons, which is contrary to the regulations.  I understand that abuse of the precise letter of the regulations is widespread and until the teachers come to see that beating is the wrong approach to the creation and the moulding of a child's mind &mdash; as I believe they will in time &mdash; there is excessive beating.  The Minister should come down with complete ruthlessness on the teacher in the first place to protect the children.</P>
    <P>But, the Minister, through his behaviour, does not care to protect the children in his anxiety to defend his Departmental officials against the public, to defend the teachers against the parents.  He will defend anybody except the people paying his salary &mdash; the public and their children.  The parents have a right, where a child is badly beaten, to expect some action from the Minister.  No matter what happens in the courts the public have a right to know what penalty is imposed by the Department on the teacher concerned, what action was taken to discipline that teacher.  Time and again here in the House when we seek information we are denied it on the excuse that it is not the practice to give it, that there is no precedent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has complete power to break with practice. He does not have to follow precedent. He can change Departmental policy in any way he wants.  That is the wonderful power he has arising out of his office as Minister and he should take steps to carry out the old axiom &mdash; to see that not only should justice be done but that it should be seen to be done by those who send their children to school and who up to now have had no remedy except the very expensive and costly one of bringing their grievance to the courts.  They should not have to resort to this remedy.  Then, of course, they do not know, even if they do win in court, whether the child will have to go back to this perverted individual, who delights in beating him, because the Minister will take no remedial action to deal with the defect.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on the language.  No subject has been <Col N="1507" /> more tangled up in our tortured history as the question of the Irish language.  It is very sad indeed that the attempt to review Irish as the spoken language should have resulted in the appalling situation we have at the moment where I do not think there is the slightest hope of its ever becoming the spoken language of the people.  I think the blame for this lies directly with the educationists of the last 40 years basing their approach to the education of our people on the assumption that you can bring the horse to the water and make it drink &mdash; basing it on compulsion, on the old exploded souperism idea of 1889 and 1890.</P>
    <P>That is essentially the underlying principle of compulsion in the Irish language &mdash; change your religion and you will get a bowl of soup &mdash; all leading to the most appalling duplicity, bigotry, hypocrisy, disillusionment and disenchantment.  I imagine there would be no more united front among parents and young people than on this question of the necessity for forcibly being taught Irish in the schools.  I believe you would get virtual unanimity on the question of the abolition of compulsion in the teaching of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>That is a sad commentary in many ways.  After all, a language is merely a method of communication, essentially functional.  In our history it has certain highly emotional overtones in so far as it was, 40 years ago, a badge of nationality, of revolution, of resentment of the authorities, and it has carried that symbol through my generation into this one.  It will no longer wash.  It is no longer any use talking about this badge of nationality. Our young people now, even those who are not very well educated, have the ability to look around them and see the New Zealanders, the Canadians, the Americans, all speaking one language &mdash; the English language &mdash; all being different peoples with different backgrounds, different outlooks.  Tell an American there is no differences between him and an Englishman and see what he says, see what he does.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> This fake attempt at rationalisation, this imposition of a language because we want to retain our nationality, has been exposed as loose hypocritical humbug and that line of policy has created this sad situation of disillusionment among young people and their parents and they no longer accept it.  Let us, first of all, face the reality of the 1,000,000, who have had to get out. Again, this is related to the fact that we cannot give them work here at home.  Give them work here and then possibly you could justify forcing a particular language on them because they could then get their living here and would not have to go to England.</P>
    <P>As I think I have mentioned here already, there is the case of a young lad from the Gaeltacht who had to go to work on the underground railway in London.  He had a secondary school education but still had to learn enough English to get a job as a conductor because he had nothing but Irish.  Leaving aside that extreme case, how can you get a child to accept the proposition that he should spend so much time in school learning what is essentially a dead language?  How many Deputies here speak the language? Deputy P. O'Donnell, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Education and Deputy Ó Briain are the only Deputies I have heard speak the Irish language here. The vast majority of Deputies neither speak it nor understand it.</P>
    <P>Look in the buses and in the cinemas.  Look at television.  Look at our Irish industrialists, practically all of them Irish-Irelanders, products of the great Gaelic revival.  How many of them put their advertisements across in Irish Television in Irish?  Many of them put their names over the doors in Irish, but how many of them send out their literature in Irish?  How many politicians send out their literature in Irish?  These are hard realities. How many newspapers are printed in Irish?  One of the most powerful anglicising influences in the Gaeltacht &mdash; I hope Deputy de Valera will forgive me &mdash; is the <i>Irish Press</i> because it is printed in English.  I realise it is not possible to run a commercial enterprise in any other way- <Col N="1509" /> It is part of the rewards of power. There is the continual anglicising influence of the cinema, of the churches, of the newspapers, now of the telivision and, above all, of the Common Market, the merger with Europe.  It is all so irrational.  It tends to perpetuate the idea that the language revivalists were either fools or knaves or hypocrites.</P>
    <P>Many of us have loved and do love the Irish language.  It is a very beautiful thing.  I am afraid it is now becoming rather of historic importance.  I am very sad because I love it. Deputy O'Donnell was the only person who spoke in any way constructively and with any reality on this question.  The language should come from the Gaeltacht into the rest of Ireland instead of our attempting, as we did, to impose Parnell Square Irish on the unfortunate people in the Gaeltacht in one way or another. In my view, this is now a <i>post mortem</i> and there is very little else to say except <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>.  That is about all one can say about Irish. A commission was set up, a typical diversionary tactic.  The Minister clearly has no views on it either.  I hope the commission will have enough sense and courage to recommend that the compulsion, wherever it be, will be removed.  Even though many people tell us there is no compulsion, either there is, or an awful lot of people think there is.  You have got to reorientate your policy so that it is made quite clear that the language is no longer part of &ldquo;souperism&rdquo; as it has been in order to get a job with a State or semiState body or secure an appointment with a local authority.  We must remove from people's minds the damage done over 40 years.  I often think that the best thing to do with the Irish language now would be to say nothing about it in the hope that another generation may happen upon it and recognise it as the beautiful thing it is and the great treasure it is.  In that way we might come to love it and learn it because of itself.</P>
    <P>One of the things I cannot tolerate &mdash; perhaps it is the reason I am a socialist &mdash; is the idea of anything <Col N="1510" /> being imposed on anybody, whether religious or political beliefs, a language or anything else.  It is completely alien to my whole make-up and I expect that is true of most people.  It is not confined to our people either.  Most people are the same.  We have the independent right to make up our own minds and we do not like anybody to do it for us. Unfortunately, that is the stupid, shortsighted policy of the Department of Education.  They have created a situation in which those who love the language have in fact destroyed it.  As wilde said: Love doth destroy what love hath created.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the dishonest and equivocal answers of the Minister for Education&mdash;he excelled himself&mdash;in regard to the report of the Swedish experts who came over here to examine design in this country. It is very interesting to watch the reaction to this thing, that is, the official reaction.  I must say the reaction of the ordinary people was perfectly understandable.  They took it in good humour.  Their attitude was &ldquo;Fair enough, that is criticism.  We are well able to take it.&rdquo;  They were sufficiently adult to be able to accept it as fair criticism.  Nobody believes we are perfect, except the Department of Education and whatever puppet they have at that time putting out the views of the day.</P>
    <P>This group of distinguished experts were brought over to examine the whole question of design in Ireland and they published a report.  I asked the Minister what he was going to do about that report.  The relevant phrase is on page 45 of the report, where it is stated:</P>
    <P>At the National College of Art in Dublin, we found facilities and space which at first sight appeared to be sufficient and offer possibilities for development.  However, the final impression which we took away from this school was that the methods of education were completely out of date and it is our opinion that the National College of Art as presently constituted cannot be the starting point for the education of people in the different <Col N="1511" /> crafts of indeed for the education of painters, sculptors or designers.</P>
    <P>In the face of this very clear-cut, categorical condemnation of the education and teaching methods in the National College of Art, the Minister said : &ldquo;I am not aware that the report contains any complaint about the standard of teaching in the National College of Art.&rdquo;  Had these simple English words any meaning for the Minister for Education?  Of all people, surely he should understand the simple Anglo-Saxon words used in this report:</P>
    <P>The final impression we took away from this school was that the methods of education were completely out of date and it is our opinion that the National College of Art as presently constituted cannot be the starting point....</P>
    <P>How could the Minister for Education come into this House and say that the teaching methods are not criticised in that report?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who made these charges are responsible people.  If they are not true, the Minister has a moral responsibility to the teachers of the College of Art to have an objective examination made into the educational methods of the college.  If these people are disproved, let us publish that report.  Let us refute the charges of these Swedish experts.  Let us tell them they were talking through their hats, that they had no right to come to these conclusions.  Let us tell them this is a gross misrepresentation of the <Col N="1513" /> position, that it is a gross misuse of the privilege they were given of being allowed to go to our College of Art. The Minister has this responsibility to the professors and to the teachers in the College of Art.  If he does not propose to do that this smear sticks, and it is the Minister and his Departmental officials who are allowing these serious charges to be made against the teaching methods in the College of Art and doing nothing about it as the Minister does nothing about anything else because he is completely incompetent and incapable of doing anything about anything.</P>

      <P>I am trying to impress that on him.  He says on the one hand that the teaching methods were not criticised and yet we are told here that the teaching methods were completely out of date.  Is the Minister prepared in the letter heading for the National College of Art to tell anybody who wants any information on the National College of Art that according to these Swedish experts on design the National College of Art as at present constituted cannot be the starting point for the education of people in the different crafts or indeed for the education of painters, sculptors or designers?

      <P>I got an answer to a question yesterday in which the Minister told me he has complete control over and responsibility for this college. It is clear that if the position in relation to the teaching methods of the college is so bad, to continue to maintain that position is a further dereliction of the Minister's responsibility.  I charge the Minister that if the teaching methods are completely out of date the College of Art authorities are taking money under false pretences from parents who wish their children to be educated in the College of Art.  This is just one other example of the Minister's gross failure to understand the tremendous power and authority he has in his position as Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>The whole Department of Education is an interesting commentary on the complete aseptic sterility of the Minister's behaviour during his period in office as a sort of political castrate in charge of this tremendously important Department.  That is emphasised in the fact that of all the sub-departments under his control the only one which I can honestly and sincerely praise with any justification is the Museum, which is worth visiting.</P>

    <P>I have spoken on the question of the Irish language on practically every occassion on which I have spoken on the Education Estimate. I do not think it is necessary for me to say very much on it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never sought to make the point that the language is the prerogative of my Party, or of any other Party in this House. The statements I have made on previous occassions in that regard will bear that out.  I believe that, unless there is a united effort made to preserve the language, it will not be possible to do so.  That belief, however, does not preclude me from saying what I think about the programme put forward by the Fine Gael Party in the last election.  With regard to that particular programme, I believe it would spell the deathknell of the Irish language.  Again, I <Col N="1518" /> am not dealing with it from a political point of view.  I am dealing with it simply from the point of view of having examined into it, reached certain conclusions about it, and saying exactly what I think about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned two points in the course of his speech, two points which were the main features of the programme.  One of them was that a scholar, failing in the Irish in leaving certificate, should not fail in the examination as a whole.  The other was that we should endeavour to progress by assisting the voluntary associations.  With regard to the leaving certificate, I think to a very large extent the position is being overestimated.  I do not say that this is being done deliberately.  It is a fact that some children fail the leaving certificate because of Irish, but judging by the figures issued by the Minister in 1960&mdash;I have not got those for 1961&mdash;the number is exceptionally low, and there was just nothing to show that the particular children who failed the leaving certificate because of Irish would have passed the examination in any case.  I think it would be worthwhile for the Minister to give the percentages again of the students who failed in the leaving certificate because of Irish alone.  The inference generally is, where parents are concerned, in relation to this particular proposal that, if the Irish language were not a failing subject in the examination, their children would do exceptionally well.  I do not think there is really any need for me to go into that particular aspect.  In my view the ultimate result of this proposal would be that some schools would remove the Irish language from the curriculum altogether and thus deprive certain Irish children of the right to learn their own language.</P>
      <P>With regard to the voluntary organisations working for the language, I would agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the people in Comhaltas Uladh have worked very enthusiastically and very energetically to promote the language.</P>

      <P>I am afraid, however, I cannot go very much further <Col N="1519" /> with him than that because the results of this work, to say the least of it, are rather meagre.  In the Six Counties at the present time there are very, very few primary schools teaching the Irish language.  In the Catholic secondary schools, or in a considerable number of them, the Irish language is taught. I think a considerable part of the advance made with regard to the Irish languages in the Six Counties is due to the fact that any scholar who does the senior examination, taking Irish as a subject, has to do an oral examination as well.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the fact that the Down footballers were able to speak Irish.  I think they were largely because of the system I have mentioned.  In the majority of the Catholic secondary schools in the Six Counties the pupils take Irish as a language for the senior examination, and they must pass an oral examination in the particular language they take.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that this programme of the Fine Gael Party was an election gimmick.  I do not go that far, but I am not a bit happy with the proposals made by them.  I do not claim that the system in operation at present is perfect, but I maintain that considerable progress has been made.  Much greater progress could be made, however, and we could, I think, if we were genuine and sincerely anxious to promote the language, pool our resources and try to evolve the best possible system for furthering the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the coming of the Common Market many people say that our entry to the Common Market will help the development of the language. Others say it will be the end of the language.  I think we should look at it from this point of view: with the coming of the Common Market, all economic boundaries will disappear, not overnight but over a period of years. Likewise all political boundaries will disappear.  We will then be in the position in which countries will be identified only by their language, their culture, and their traditions.  Whether we like it or not, I think that if we lose our language entirely and become <Col N="1520" /> full members of the Common Market with Britain, we will be identified in the minds of the other members of the Common Market as British.  We will lose our own individual identity.  It is very easy to say that we can continue to keep our culture and our traditions without endeavouring to foster our own language.  Deputy Dr. Browne said that countries like New Zealand, American and Canada have kept their identity, but we must remember always that we are a very small nation in comparison with them.  We are very close to a very powerful nation, Britain.  We are between two very powerful English speaking nations and it would be very much more difficult for us to preserve our culture and our traditions than it is for those other countries which have not got the same powerful influences bearing on them.</P>

      <P>I do not ask that my opinion be taken on this.  I will quote for the House a statement made by Professor Walter Hallstein, President of EEC, in an address on &ldquo;The EEC and the Community of the Free World&rdquo; to the Swiss in Zurich on 24th November, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Our Committees, too, represent an endeavour so to link peoples with differing traditions and different languages that they can fully preserve their character, and their personality. It has never been the purpose of European integration to streamline Europe.  We are deeply <Col N="1521" /> conscious that in the last resort Europe's wealth and strength are founded on her diversity, and to preserve this is one of the aims which we have set ourselves in the integration of Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, Mons.  Petitpierre, a former member of the Swiss Government, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we consider the situation as a whole and from a long term aspect, we find that every strengthening of Europe strengthens the outlook for our independence that any weakening will damage it.  This is, however, subject to a form being found for European unity which will respect at least the fundamental differences without which Europe would no longer be what it is today.  Such respect for differences ... is no cause of weakness, quite the reverse.</P>
    <P>To these men, one of whom has been a guiding light in EEC, the preservation of language and culture is of paramount importance.  One could hardly describe them as woolly-headed idealists.  They are, in fact, hard-headed politicians and businessmen and we would be well advised to heed their advice and plan our future and the future of our language on the basis of what they have said and what they believe.</P>
    <P>There are just a few short points I should like to make in connection with secondary education.  In the future at least one more language will be a necessity.  It is recognised now that it is very important that anybody who wishes to do business with another country should be able to speak the language of that country. Some time ago a research institute in America rapped American business men over the knuckles because they persisted in using English in their dealings with non-English speaking European countries to the detriment of trade with those countries.  Latin to-day is essential for matriculation, but so far as I am aware, it is of little value after entering the university except perhaps for an Arts degree.  In the case of students who wish to enter a university, and who do not intend taking an Arts degree, <Col N="1522" /> Latin should be dropped.  There is no need for them to learn it, and it could be replaced by another language.</P>
    <P>On the question of the teaching of European languages, complaints have been made to me that it is extremely difficult, especially in boy's schools, to get languages teachers.  For example, I am told it is almost impossible to get teachers of French. To overcome that difficulty, I would suggest that intensive languages summer courses should be held for secondary teachers and a certificate awarded after three or four courses. The teacher should then be permitted to teach the language chosen by him at the course, beginning with the first year in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know the percentage of girls in secondary schools who take a pass arithmetic paper in the intermediate certificate.  The standard of that paper is very low.  In fact, I have often wondered why it is set at all.  I know that in days gone by, it was taken for granted that girls had no aptitude for maths.  That bubble was burst a considerable time ago and, in justice to the girls, the standard of that paper should be raised because of the effect it has on their choice of a career afterwards.  Where a low standard of maths is permitted, so far as I know it is not possible for a girl to pursue any science course except botany.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that, where possible, there should be refresher courses for secondary teachers.  The secondary teachers themselves are anxious to have such courses provided for them.  I should like to say a word of praise of the courses which are at present being carried out, under the auspices of the Department, for national teachers, and the courses run by other organisations, such as those operated by the INTO, with the sanction of the Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to the papers for secondary school examinations, I feel that the Irish poetry questions in the intermediate certificate are too difficult. There is one other point I should like to make in regard to Irish poetry in the intermediate and leaving certificates. <Col N="1523" /> It is practically all confined to the 18th and 19th centuries and gives the impression that there are no present day poets writing in the Irish language. I know there was a change last year and that some modern poems in the Irish language were on the paper, but I should like to see that further extended.</P>

      <P>Looking over the Minister's Estimate, one could find, if one were so inclined, some matters to enthuse about, but I believe we should expect in 1962 something more than what is contained in it.  In my belief, it is nothing more than an example of the stagnation which has set in the Department.  They are not prepared to take any definite step in any direction, and the steps they do take are very small.  They appear to me to be rather afraid of something, and they take the attitude: &ldquo;If we do not do anything, we cannot be blamed for anything.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am somewhat at a loss speaking on this Estimate, because I feel there is no use in my suggesting anything or in any other Deputy making any suggestion. Since I came into the House, I have put down a number of Questions suggesting what we feel would be improvements in the system of education but I got nothing from the Minister but very evasive replies to the effect that everything is quite all right as it is, that they are quite prepared for any eventuality in the future, and that in fact many changes have been made in our educational system over the past number of years.  On one occassion the Minister mentioned a figure of at least 50 changes that have been made. That may be so, but I and a great many others who are more in contact with our educational system fail to see any significant changes over the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down a Question dealing with the recent report on the secondary school curriculum by the Council of Education because I wanted to know if the Minister would implement a few of the recommendations set out in that report.  I hasten to add that it <Col N="1524" /> was hard for me to find any very encouraging suggestions in the report, but after a bit of looking, I came across a few.  I put these by way of Question to the Minister and to my amazement he told me that all those suggestions were going back again to certain educational bodies where they would be discussed and sent back to him after another lapse of time, with a submission of their views.</P>
    <P>On certain points, that might be all right but all the points about which I asked the Minister were fairly evident to everyone.  One point was the enlarging of the intermediate certificate scholarships which was not done since 1929.  Even that suggestion has to go back to these educational authorities for their views on whether or not it is a good idea to enlarge the intermediate certificate scholarships.  Things like that make me feel that I am hitting my head against a stone wall when I speak on this Estimate.  As I say, this Estimate is an attempt to keep us in a complacent mood in regard to this problem.</P>

The Annual Reports of the Commission, which are published and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, give particulars of the more noteworthy of such cases, and of the outcome of the Commission's investigations <Col N="1530" /> into the complaints.  In most cases the matters complained of are rectified voluntarily.  In two cases, however, it was necessary to take proceedings and in each of these the court found the charges proved and imposed fines.</P>

In six instances, action has been taken by way of Statutory Orders prohibiting specified restrictive practices in relation to the supply and distribution of the goods concerned. Five of these Orders were subsequently confirmed by Acts of the Oireachtas. In the case of the sixth, the necessary confirming Bill was recently introduced in Dáil Éireann.

Where three or more children are carried, however, the permitted passenger accommodation is increased by one for every three of such children.

      <P>Social Welfare benefit or assistance, including any increases in respect of a wife and dependent children, is normally payable to the claimant, but I have power, where a claimant or beneficiary is unable for the time being to act, to appoint some other person to exercise on behalf of such claimant or beneficiary any right or power which such claimant or beneficiary may be entitled to exercise. In addition the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations, 1953 to 1961, made under Section 32 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, provide in the case of disability benefit that where the claimant is an inmate of any sanatorium, mental hospital, or similar institution supported by public funds <Col N="1535" /> or by a charity or voluntary subscriptions the benefit may, at my discretion, and after consultation, whenever possible, with the claimant be paid wholly or in part to the wife or applied wholly or in part for the advantage of the wife and children.</P>
      <P>It is the practice whenever possible in any case where the benefit is to be paid wholly or in part to a person other than the claimant to obtain his written consent to the proposed payment. In the case of persons who are mentally ill, however, it is not always possible to obtain their consent to pay the benefit to or for the advantage of their dependants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The enforcement of the Large Public Service Vehicle Regulations, 1935, is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  Under these regulations, the normal limit on the number of passengers that may be taken in a bus is determined by the seating <Col N="1543" /> capacity, but, where the passengers are children, an increase of 50 per cent is permitted.  Furthermore, the regulations allow up to five additional passengers at peak periods or where undue hardship would be caused by leaving passengers behind.</P>
      <P>This means that, where the only passengers are children, the legal limit on the number of passengers that may be taken at a peak period by a 74-seater bus (which, I understand, is used on this service) is 116.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have no reason to think that there is any foundation for the suggestion that it is the practice of CIE to ignore the limit and, in fact, I am informed that the number of buses assigned to the route is adequate, with a margin to spare, to carry all the children who normally want to travel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision in relation to education for the rising generation <Col N="1544" /> is the most important function that any Government can exercise. We feel that the Department of Education should never be regarded as a junior Ministry or an unimportant Department because it is the basis upon which success in other walks of life depends.  As such, the Department should get the honoured place it deserves.</P>
      <P>While some of us were aware that we were somewhat behind in the matter of education, it came as a bit of a shock to us to see in a recent survey how far behind we were in comparison with other countries.  It is no use comparing this year with 1930 in our own country.  We must compare our position with that in neighbouring countries.  In the field of primary education we saw that we spend only one-third of the amount spent in England and Wales.</P>
      <P>Primary education is the most important facet of our educational system because&mdash;and this is an unfortunate fact&mdash;almost 75 per cent.  of our people can avail themselves only of primary education.  In those circumstances, we must emphasise the importance of primary education.  At present, there is no job, not even a labouring job, which does not require a good standard of education.  There is a lot of detail associated with building and cleansing work so that all jobs now require a good standard of education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The curriculum has not been changed since 1926 and in view of what has been said here, I think it needs a general overhaul. Secondary education in this country can be availed of only by the children of people who can afford it.  Whether they have ability to absorb the instruction is completely irrelevant.  If they have the money, they can go to secondary schools.  We in the Labour Party consider that entirely wrong.  We feel there is a moral obligation on the Government to give to every child an equal opportunity to develop his talents and brains to the greatest advantage and to put himself on an equally competitive <Col N="1545" /> level with others of his own age and ability.</P>
      <P>In spite of that we find, according to the recent survey quoted here, that per head of the population, we spend only about a quarter of the amount our neighbours across the water spend on secondary education&mdash;that only one in seven of our primary school leavers goes to secondary schools.  That is a very low percentage by comparison with continental countries where the percentage is something like 75 to 90.  In Japan, 98 per cent of children between 15 and 19 years of age attend secondary schools.  They are now training some of our people at Shannon.</P>
      <P>Before I pass from the point that we spend far too little on education&mdash; roughly one-third of what our neighbouring countries spend on a population basis&mdash;I should like to quote from the document <i>Investment in Education</i> published by the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools:</P>
      <P>If we were told that an intricate machine such as an electronic computer could be built in Ireland at one third of the cost required elsewhere, we would unquestionably be amazed.  The training of a talented young Irish mind is not only a much more delicate, intricate and involved process than the building of a machine, but it must extend over a much longer period.  Even the most intricate machine can be built in a period of 1-2 years, while the adequate training of a young mind may extend over 15-20 years.  The claim that a young man or woman can be adequately educated in Ireland at one-third the cost taken in a neighbouring country certainly seems to us equal cause for amazement and scepticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That paragraph sums up the whole problem which confronts us.  Coupled with that, we are in the unfortunate position of having practically no vocational guidance when our students reach the threshold of careers.  I believe there is an attempt being made in Dublin by the vocational education committee in this regard but I would remind the Minister that there are many more places than Dublin in this country and it is the duty of the <Col N="1546" /> Government to appoint inspectors to give career guidance.</P>
    <P>There is far too much wastage at the moment of young people being well educated and taking the wrong careers ultimately.  After two or three years, they change and start all over again. In our universities, 45 per cent of first year students fail.  I believe this to be mainly due to the absence of vocational guidance.  Due to late marriages, Irish parents lose touch with career problems; it is so long since they themselves were confronted with those problems and things have changed so much in the intervening years that parents are completely at a loss when it comes to guiding their children into the right careers.  Therefore, I feel it is the duty of the Minister to appoint these career guidance officers and to have them visit secondary schools throughout the country each year from January to June.  I am aware that some secondary schools have adopted their own means of giving such guidance, but some financial assistance at least should be forthcoming from the Department towards the furtherance of this work.</P>
    <P>I was glad the previous speaker mentioned the fact that it was almost impossible to get teachers of modern languages in the Twenty-Six Counties. Had I been the only one to raise the matter, I throught the Minister might not take any notice of it.  It is a fact that there is a great shortage of modern language teachers here and in view of the fact that so many Deputies have emphasised the importance of modern language instruction in our secondary schools, I have one suggestion to make to the Minister which might alleviate this shortage.  I suggest that he should recognise the honours graduates from the Northern Ireland university for incremental service in the Twenty-Six Counties.  We make a lot of bones about the removal of the Border, but if it were removed, we would find that under our present regulations all these graduates would be completely unqualified for incremental posts under the Department of Education.  I would appeal, therefore, to the Minister to recognise teachers of modern languages who graduate from <Col N="1547" /> the Northern Ireland university for incremental posts in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>While vocational education has undoubtedly improved and expanded over the last 10 or 15 years, much remains to be done.  There should be no delay however about doing it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the erection of primary school buildings throughout the country.  At present, there is a tendency when replacing an old fourroom school to build a three-room school.  Possibly the reason is that in the old school the extra room was a spare room or something of that kind. With the development of the schools medical service hardly a day passes without a doctor, a dentist or a nurse visiting a school.  We are all in favour of this and hope it will be further expanded.  But because of this the Minister should urge the school architects to provide an extra room for this work.  Much of the success of the schools medical service depends on the co-operation extended to the doctors by the teachers and the Department. Teachers, know that when a school medical examination takes place the mothers and pre-school age children come in to avail of the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>When this occurs there is general chaos in the school. The Department should therefore co-operate by providing a special room where the parents of a child could privately discuss with the doctor or dentist the result of the examination. At present, that is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, I asked the Minister a question concerning physical training in the schools.  I was not aware until recently that there is a very significant difference between physical training and physical education, and that there are a few very good schools in Dublin turning out each year about 30 physical education teachers.  Unfortunately, most of these have to go overseas to secure an appointment.  I would urage the Minister to make incremental posts <Col N="1548" /> available to these people, particularly in view of the fact that the recent report on the curricula of secondary schools referred to the necessity and desirability of providing physical education in our schools.</P>
    <P>I have one point to make in regard to the Irish language.  I feel that the programme laid down in the secondary schools, particularly that for the leaving certificate, tends to prevent a pupil from enlarging his knowledge of Irish.  A pupil who puts down on his paper the bare necessities will do much better than one who writes pages and pages of Irish when answering a question. The former pupil need not be too good at Irish grammar.  I feel too much stress is laid on grammar.  When a student makes a grammatical mistake in Irish compositions, he incurs heavy penalties.  As a result, he is afraid to express himself fully in Irish for fear of making grammatical mistakes. We all speak English, but very few of us speak it perfectly.  We all make mistakes in grammar in English and nobody minds.  That should be our attitude towards Irish in examinations also: that the more general knowledge of Irish a pupil has, the more marks he should get.  He should not be penalised for petty grammatical mistakes.  I welcomed the decision of the Minister some years ago to introduce an oral test in Irish.  It was a step in the right direction in helping to remove some of the hatred felt, particularly by students going for the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>I would again impress on the Minister the importance of making effective changes in our educational system. As it stands, secondary education is only for those who can afford to pay for it, and that is not right in a Christian country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> We have had two Estimates under discussion here today, one for Defence and the present one for Education.  I agree with the Minister's statement on page 1 of his address to the effect that we must regard education as an investment. It is an investment in the brains of Ireland and this is a Vote on which I would personally be inclined <Col N="1549" /> to be more generous than on most others.</P>
      <P>I agree with him also as regards the treatment of backward children. While we must admit that the institutional facilities for the mentally handicapped are inadequate, at the same time, he is right in saying that in the borderline cases, we should try to have as many children as possible dealt with in the local schools, in their own home environment, rather than take them away and place a stigma of mental deficiency upon them by so doing.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the great increase in the number of secondary schools.  He gave the figure for 1933-34 as 377 and for 1962-63 as 542. The enrolment in these schools has increased from 40,000 pupils in 1933/ 34 to 80,000 pupils in 1962/63, and he hopes to have 100,000 pupils by 1970.  That is a desirable development, particularly in so far as it is bringing education more and more within the grasp of people in the more isolated parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Looking over the report of the Council of Education I find on page 252, paragraph 429, that in 1924-25 there were 278 recognised secondary schools, with an enrolment of 22,897. In 1956-57 the number of schools had advanced to 480 and the enrolment was 62,429 pupils.  However, it rather surprises me to find that, in spite of that advance, only 2,322 pupils, or four per cent., were in our secondary schools as a result of scholarships from public funds.  That is too small a percentage in view of such an advance in pupil attendance.  It would seem that we have been too penurious in the allocation of secondary scholarships in the past or that the standard of pupils in our primary schools has been too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with the conclusion reached in this report and would advocate the provision of increased grants and scholarships consistent with the principle of some parental contribution, where possible.  That is socially desirable.  I would never think it should be our aim to provide everybody with something for nothing. Where people are able to pay or to <Col N="1550" /> make some contribution in all walks of life, it is desirable they should do so.</P>
    <P>Many remarks have been made about the small amount of money being spent on education in this country.  If our educational standard were proportionate to the amount of money which has been spent on it, I believe that, <i>en masse,</i> we would be considerably more uneducated than we are.  However, at this juncture, I wish to pay tribute to one body of men who by their efforts have succeeded in raising and keeping at a moderate level the standard of education in this country, namely, the Irish Christian Brothers.  More than any other body of men they have contributed to the progress made in education.  This is all the more praiseworthy when we consider that the average cost per child per year in these schools up to 1961 has been the small figure of £10 per year.</P>
    <P>We are inclined, by virtue of our insular position, to think that educationally we are equal to, if not better than, most countries.  I heard that proposition promulgated in the diningroom of this House about an hour ago. It is a fact that education has been brought more and more to the people not alone in Europe, in Britain and in America, but also in Russia.  A few years ago, I happened to be at the World Fair in Brussels and like most people who went there, I thought I should like to see the Russian Pavilion. It displayed power and propaganda. One annexe was entirely devoted to education and various facets of education were photographically displayed. Attached to each photograph was a legend giving the percentage of people in Russia of school-going age in proportion to the entire population who were engaged in these various educational pursuits; underneath was the percentage similarly engaged in the United States.  The purpose was to show the power of Russia and the inevitability of Communist triumph, that they were devoting so much of their resources to the ideological advancement and education of their people that the ultimate conquest by Communism was inevitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> That has been a factor in broadening the approach to education in Great Britain.  I should be very doubtful if it was for purely humanitarian purposes the old school tie was to a certain extent discarded on the other side of the water.  Britain has come to realise, as America has come to realise, that if she is to survive as a nation, it is essential she should try to mobilise her entire talent, and not concentrate merely on educating a privileged section of the community.  We are, I think, in an analogous position.  If we are to survive, our survival will not lie with the Army, for which we voted moneys here this week, but largely with education, and the degree and quality of the education we can give our people.  In considering that education, we must regard every member of our community, no matter from what walk of life he may come, as a potential asset to be used for national development purposes.</P>
    <P>We are a small country and we cannot allow any good brain to lie fallow. If we do so, we deprive our community as a whole of some element of progress. In considering that, we must recognise that to-day the planning ahead in Europe, as in Britain, is directed towards ensuring that an ever-increasing number of people will secure both secondary and university education in the next decade.  It is a fact that the enrolment here in our secondary schools is proportionately much lower than it is in European countries. Deputy Dillon gave the figures.</P>
    <P>One speaker referred to the discrepancy in relation to secondary school facilities in the different counties.  He instanced Donegal and he gave the figure for Donegal as 18.7 per cent. in the 12 to 18 age group.  He picked the lowest enrolment rate in Ireland.  If we take another county not very much different from Donegal, the Minister's county, we find the enrolment rate there is the highest in Ireland.  I do not know whether that is due to the influence of the Minister, or to something else.  There the figure is 38.1 per cent.  It is difficult to understand <Col N="1552" /> why secondary education is so much appreciated in Clare and why there is such a lack of appreciation in Donegal.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister, I wonder, satisfied that we are receiving value for money in relation to vocational education? From all sides of the House, at county council level, opinions have been expressed time and again that, in proportion to the money spent, we are not getting an adequate return.  In the Department of Education Report for 1958-1959, the cost of secondary education is given as 8d. per hour. The cost of vocational education is given as 1/10 per hour.  The difference is rather extreme and a little difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>In my county, one of the most successful schools there is a private enterprise venture.  The principal is co-author in the little pamphlet issued here yesterday by the Federation of Secondary Teachers.  Here we have an example of a small capital outlay on a private house.  That school, at a fraction of the cost, is far more successful to-day than anything put up with public money.  That seems to establish the principle of private enterprise and voluntary effort as against the stultifying effect of State enterprise.</P>
    <P>When we compare this country with Great Britain &mdash; such a comparison is desirable because we have such close contact with Britain and because so many of our people emigrate there&mdash; the position is not unreasonable from the point of view of national education and the point of view of our economic resources.  The Irish people are keeping pretty close to Great Britain £ for £ with regard to their payments for national school education. The position is different in relation to secondary education.  The disparity is even greater when we come to university education.  The emphasis is entirely in favour of Great Britain from the point of view of expenditure on these two types of education.</P>
    <P>If we take the average income of the Irishman as being half that of the Englishman &mdash; that is roughly the position &mdash; and if we accept that about <Col N="1553" /> double the number of people here in proportion to our population go to university as compared with the position in England &mdash; again, that is roughly the position &mdash; we should be expected on that basis to provide just about a quarter of the amount of money from public funds for university education.  The point is that we do not.  The amount provided in England from public funds per pupil per annum is £576; the figure here is £89.2.  If we were to provide a sum similar to that provided in England, allowing for the higher percentage availing of university education here and for our proportionately lower income, we would be expected to subscribe £144 per pupil per annum. There would appear to be a considerable leeway to be made up here, if we are to maintain a standard and keep ourselves on a competitive basis with other countries, particularly Great Britain.  The Minister may reply that we are spending a higher percentage here through our university grants and through grants to Trinity College in relation to students who are not citizens of this country.  I am aware of that, and I think the grants are fairly balanced in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to our educational end-product, particularly from our secondary schools and pre-university, I am informed that in Britain and in Northern Ireland, a much higher level is secured in the fields of mathematics, physics and modern languages.  I believe that to be true.  I know from my own experience in days gone by that I always found fellow students from these schools much better than I was at mathematics.  These are important points.  These are the subjects on which we must place increasing emphasis in the future.  Even since I left school, applied mathematics and physics have become much more important subjects.  We are now in the age of atomic physics.  The importance of electronics and analogous subjects and how they have become important in the last decade does not need to be emphasised.</P>
    <P>I did not know until recently, and indeed it arose in response to a Question by Deputy Patrick Byrne, that <Col N="1554" /> teachers who had been employed in England and who return here are disallowed the incremental additions to their salary which I always thought they were allowed.  It seems extraordinary that a teacher who has spent six, seven or eight years, perhaps, in a first class English public school, and who would be an acquisition to this country as a teacher, based on his experience abroad, is in that respect almost debarred from returning to teach in his own country.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Education who is a medical doctor is well aware that to secure an appointment here it is almost necessary to have postgraduate experience outside this country &mdash; in Great Britain or elsewhere&mdash; and that experience gained there is a considerable asset, almost, as I say, a prerequisite in securing a post here. That redounds to the benefit of the Irish people, to the benefit of patients up and down the country.  Is it not extraordinary that an analogous form of thinking does not prevail in the Department of Education?</P>
    <P>The difficulty of securing science teachers has been mentioned already, and never were science teachers more necessary.  Yet, these people receive no encouragement to come back to this country.  The Minister may provide some extra money for laboratory services but these services cannot give of their true worth if first-class teachers are not available.</P>
    <P>In a general way, too much emphasis has, in the past, in this country, been placed upon what I might call dead languages.  Too few of our secondary schools are capable of giving pupils a worthwhile science course.  The difficulty, of course, has largely been financial.  It requires considerable outlay to equip and to maintain even a modest laboratory.  I am glad to see the Minister at least making some small contribution to that end.  I hope he will not think my criticism too carping but I cannot help saying that it seems like too late and too little. The importance of science in secondary education should have been appreciated many years ago.  I should like the Minister to consider whether or not, particularly for the demonstration of <Col N="1555" /> certain laboratory work, the help of Telefís Éireann should be availed of.</P>
    <P>Agricultural science as a subject was introduced here in 1943 and, as a subject, it has made very little progress. The enrolment, peculiarly enough in an agricultural country, has been disappointingly small.  I do not exactly know the reason.  One reason suggested is that land is necessary in order to give a proper course.  Another reason suggested is that a degree in Agricultural Science, as laid down by the Department of Education, is necessary and that it is difficult to secure teachers for just that one small subject.</P>
    <P>It may be, indeed, that in our secondary schools we are still afflicted with some kind of childish outlook like this: &ldquo;Ah, the auld farmer; what about agriculture; that is not a decent job to be taught at all.&rdquo;  Agriculture is the basic economy of our country.  I would exhort the Minister to bring strong pressure to bear on our secondary schools in this connection and if there are any difficulties or regulations in the way to try to have them removed.  Perhaps he could arrange for an occasional visit for instruction by local agricultural instructors. At least he could introduce rural science in all our national schools and, as Deputy Dillion suggested, he could introduce, for reading purposes, a farm manual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I must confess to some disappointment when I read this report of the Council of Education.  I felt there were several aspects of education with which I should like them to have dealt.  They will probably claim that they were limited by their terms of reference.  I should like to have had their views on our system of education.  I should like to have had their views on the economics and financing of education, and whether the present system of financing one part of education from the Central Fund and the other, the vocational part, partly from local funds is the best <Col N="1556" /> system.  I should like to have had their views on the relationship between vocational education and secondary and other branches of education.  I should like to have had their views on the vexed subject of the teaching of Irish history.</P>
      <P>I have often felt that in the teaching of Irish history an undue emphasis has been placed upon all the wrongs which we as a people have suffered in the past.  I think it has given us a wrong slant and that, as a people, we are inclined to keep looking backwards rather than forwards.  We live on an island and our nearest neighbours live on another island, and come what may we have to live with them.  It does not really help the average young emigrant leaving this country to be imbued with notions and ideas &mdash; and perhaps exaggerated notions &mdash; of all the wrongs that his great-grandfather suffered in the past.</P>
      <P>It is all right to read history in an objective fashion and have it presented in an objective fashion, but we are doing an injustice to ourselves as a people by portraying our history in the fashion we have been wont to do in the past.  I do not think it makes it any easier for our exiles to adapt themselves to surroundings in which, through economic circumstances, they may find themselves.  A more objective and less emotional approach is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made some alterations in regard to the teaching of languages.  Apparently it is now possible for teachers to get recognition in certain circumstances if they have been teaching some specified language on the Continent.  The Minister has told us that is to prepare us for entry to the Common Market and to give an impetus to the teaching of modern languages.  Desirable as that is, the Minister should have gone a little further.  If we take the figures and if we take one dead language, Latin, we find that in 1925, 12 per cent.  of the girls doing the intermediate certificate, took Latin.  In 1957, 37 per cent. of the girls doing the intermediate certificate took Latin, and 38 per cent.  took Latin in the leaving certificate.  I wonder <Col N="1557" /> what use was that Latin to the majority of those girls?</P>
    <P>If we take boys we find that in 1912, 69 per cent. in the Middle Grade, as it then was, took Latin.  In 1957, 91 per cent. took Latin in the intermediate certificate and 91 per cent. took Latin in the leaving certificate; 16 per cent. took Greek in the intermediate certificate and 16 per cent. took Greek in the leaving certificate.  Those figures show quite a substantial trend amongst the boys and girls towards Latin and Greek, two dead languages, and no matter what incremental arrangements the Minister makes about French or German he will have difficulty in upsetting that general educational trend &mdash;unless he takes more concrete steps than would appear to be in his mind judging from his speech opening this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to start a campaign to try to urge upon secondary schools the importance of reorienting their ideas on these subjects. He will have to point out to them that it is necessary in this day and age to appreciate that we are entering a community where those dead languages are not known and that it is more important for our people to have a knowledge of French or German rather than Latin or Greek.  There is a limit to what you can print in any syllabus or curriculum and it is clear that if you push Greek and Latin you have to do so at the expense of some other subject.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already been bombarded pretty heavily on the subject of teaching through the medium of Irish. I should like to ask him one or two questions and should like him to reply &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The first question is: does he believe that Irish will ever be revived as the vernacular of the country under the present educational system, having regard to the results obtained in the past 40 years?</P>
    <P>The next question I would ask him is: does he ever think it will be revived as the vernacular under any system, barring extreme compulsion, and we will rule that out?  I would ask each member of the House to put these two questions to himself.  It is certain that the present system has had completely negative results.  In spite <Col N="1558" /> of these results, we find in the report of the Council of Education on page 130, paragraph 228, the following:</P>
    <P>We believe that teaching through Irish in the secondary schools is a logical postulate of the movement to restore the language as a vernacular. If the language is to have status it is imperative that other subjects be taught through its medium.  This is dependent, of course, on the fulfilling of three conditions &mdash; that the students are sufficiently advanced in their knowledge of Irish to follow courses in other subjects through Irish; that the teachers are fully qualified to give instruction through Irish in the subjects allotted to them; and that suitable textbooks are available. Where these conditions are fulfilled secondary education can be given efficiently and successfully through Irish.</P>
    <P>There were 35 members on this Commission and that is the opinion of 32 of them.</P>
    <P>Now we pass to page 284 of the same report to reservation No. 1, by Reverend Canon W. Nesbitt Harvey, Dr. Henry Kennedy and Dr. Patrick Moran.  This reads:</P>
    <P>In Minority Report No. 1 on the Primary School presented by us in June, 1954, we expressed the view that the Majority Report was dominated by extra-educational considerations, namely, the attempt to establish the Irish language as a vernacular. We stated &ldquo;The main object of educational policy over the last 30 years, namely, the restoration of the Irish language as a vernacular, was based on theories which have proved groundless.  The result has been failure, and there is no indication that if that policy is pursued in the future, a different result will ensue&rdquo; (par. 10) and again &ldquo;We believe that the introduction of the Irish language in the infant schools and in at least the early stages of the primary standards, and still more its use as a medium of instruction is a serious limiting factor in the width and quality of our primary education&rdquo; (par. 11).  It seems to us that <Col N="1559" /> the same extra-educational considerations govern the present Report. We do not agree that Irish should be a compulsory subject in the curriculum, nor do we agree with the use of Irish as a medium of instruction. The teaching medium should be the vernacular.  An attempt to change the vernacular should not be an objective of an educational system.  The status of Irish as a compulsory subject of necessity narrows the field of education.</P>
    <P>The lamentable position of teaching of languages to boys is shown in the following table setting out the number of boys taking continental languages in the Leaving Certificate.</P>
    <P>In 1955, out of 3,153 boys examined, 299 took French, eight German, seven Italian and two Spanish.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> In 1956, of 3,366 boys examined, 330 took French, 13, German, 11, Italian and six, Spanish.  In 1957, of 3,492 examinees, 397 took French, nine German, five Italian and five, Spanish. The report continues:</P>
      <P>These figures must surely be unique in Western Europe showing that of boys leaving secondary school only about 10 per cent. have a knowledge of any continental language. In the educational system, modern languages are not merely to be regarded for their educational and cultural value.  They are becoming more and more a necessity because of the growing trade and commerce between peoples.  It is not necessary to emphasise their importance for students entering University courses in science and engineering in this modern age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are convinced that the major factor in the limitation of modern language teaching is the amount of time devoted to Irish in the limited weekly teaching period of 27-hours. The same cause is effective in the limited teaching of science and while we are in agreement with the objective <Col N="1560" /> of a liberal education set out in the Report as opposed to undue specialisation, we feel that an extension of the study of science subjects is essential in modern conditions.</P>
    <P>It is signed by W. Nesbitt Harvey, Henry Kennedy and P. Moran and dated 30th September, 1960.  I wonder which of these two opposing views the Minister will succumb to, or will he be influenced by extra-educational considerations?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has already covered pretty adequately the various problems which the compulsory teaching of Irish occasions.  I should like to emphasise one &mdash; the cruelty to many children.  As legislators in this Assembly, we are quite prepared to legislate and coerce the infant mind, to try to push a language and push teaching through the medium of a language which is not the language of the child.  Would we be prepared to submit ourselves to a like discipline?  How many of us here have done so?  I have no feelings against the Irish language.  It was my favourite subject at school.  It was a subject I found easiest to acquire but I am quite aware that many other children who went to school with me had the greatest difficulty, children who in other respects were as intelligent, if not more intelligent.  We are taking a lot upon ourselves in visiting a form of treatment upon these children which we might not like visited upon ourselves.</P>
    <P>In such matters as this, has there ever really been a mandate from the Irish people for the compulsory teaching of Irish?  In trying to establish it by these methods as a living language, we are doing a disservice to the language itself.  A feeling has been growing up that it is being used as a cover for political patronage.  That feeling is growing, not alone among the young people who have been forced to learn through the medium of the language and have so come to dislike it, but amongst people who, in later life, believe that they have been victimised by the reason that Irish is necessary to obtain a particular job. Does that not seem ridiculous?  When a doctor is being appointed in the middle of Tipperary, where a word of <Col N="1561" /> Irish has not been spoken for a hundred years, he must pass a qualifying examination in Irish.  To make hypocrisy more complete, in many cases, the examinations are only a front.</P>
    <P>You have the case of prospective rate collectors going before the county council to be appointed.  Quite frequently, the county manager asks in Irish: &ldquo;Have you a knowledge of Irish?&rdquo; They can answer &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; or &ldquo;Níl&rdquo; and if they say &ldquo;tá&rdquo;, they are qualified.  That is a test that I have witnessed not once but probably a dozen times.  We have got so accustomed to this kind of phoney existence here that it has now become second nature to us.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by appealing to the Minister, particularly on this issue, not as one opposed to the Irish language &mdash; as I said already it was always my favourite subject &mdash; but as one who believes that we are exposing ourselves as a people to public ridicule by our attitude to this, our own language.</P>

      <P>It is ironical that we must admit that this country is one of the few countries of Europe in which education beyond the primary level is not as yet regarded as a human right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> Education in this country is still reserved as an essential prerogative of the rich, the powerful and the wealthy of this State.  The poor man's child has not, as yet, a chance to ascend to the zenith of fame in any subject, in the social, economic or political life of this country.  We are trying to educate our children on the cheap and hoping to get the very best results. Very few people seem to notice this fact.  It is usual to come in here on this Estimate and congratulate ourselves on the high standard of education in this country and then proceed to make a ferocious attack against the element of compulsion in the revival of the language.</P>
    <P>I should like to leave the question of the revival of the language aside for a while so that we may ask ourselves what is being done in Ireland to bring our education up to the standard required. Deputy Pattison has said that the Department of Education should not be regarded as a junior Department, as a Department of complacency and conservatism, where little change can be expected.  I want to make bold to put the claims of my Party to free education in this country, free secondary, vocational and university education.</P>
    <P>It seems to us a terrible waste of human talent and ability that education is still the prerogative of the wealthy people.  It seems to us that too many of our universities and our secondary schools are cluttered up with rich men's children who do not possess the same latent talents or ability as the poor man's child, if he were given a chance.  Money is the criterion of education, not ability and that is what we protest about.</P>
    <P>We look with admiration upon countries such as America where every man has a chance of seeing his son become President and where Irish workers, given a fair chance and reasonable opportunity, decent conditions and good wages, can become the best in the entire field.  Irishmen, all over the world, have reached the greatest heights open to them in the church and in the economic, social and cultural spheres of Britain, America and the Commonwealth <Col N="1563" /> because they got the opportunity.  It is a great tragedy that so many thouands in this country are denied the opportunity of developing the talents with which God endowed them. It is a great waste of human endeavour and a criminal neglect on the part of the Government to allow that to continue.</P>
    <P>It would take a long yardstick to measure the tremendous loss to the nation of those human skills and ability.  An average of 50,000 to 60,000 people per year emigrate from this country as statistics have shown in recent years.  Let us try to conjure up the cost involved of educating that number of people and then exporting them for the benefit of other nations. That situations exists because we still hold on to the ultra-conservative straitjacketed education of 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Minister is not realistic and if our sense of social justice does not prompt us to change our educational system, we will be forced to change it, whether we like it or not.  The economic facts which we must face as a result of our entry into the Common Market, if we are allowed in, will force the Minister for Education, whoever he may be, to realise that he wants intelligent, competent, adaptable workers capable of standing up to their counterparts in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is quite understandable that our workers are not trained in the techniques and devices of modern industry. It is a well-known fact that the industrial worker in Germany is engaged for upwards of four years in training before he is permitted into industry.  I am not aware of any such provisions whatsoever being made here and the result is that many of our workers are led into blind-alley jobs and too many more are forced to emigrate. The Minister will require these capable, competent and intelligent workers in the future and I would ask him to set about establishing the various training centres in order that this may be made possible.</P>
    <P>If we do not take these steps now, it is obvious that we are going to be unable to tackle the colossal task before <Col N="1564" /> us &mdash; competition in a free trade area. This is going to be the most excruciating experience which the Irish people were ever asked to contend with.  The Minister will be relying, in the first instance, on education to fit the needs of our time, to keep abreast of the happenings in this atomic age, to be able to implement the tools of industry and to keep abreast of all the modern techniques and devices of this modern age. If the curricula of the schools are not changed to bring about that happy situation, I believe that, industrially, this country will go down.</P>
    <P>Certain facts were revealed here in relation to the backward state of Irish education.  I think it is true to say that out of approximately £12 million being spent this year, 19.2 per cent. will be spent per pupil annually as against 48.16 per cent. on pupils in England and Wales.  For most of the children in this country, primary education is the only education they can ever hope to get.  It is vitally important that it should be as thorough as possible to fit them for after-life.</P>
    <P>On secondary education, we are spending, I believe, approximately £33.4 per pupil per year in this country as against £146.8 per pupil in England and Wales &mdash; four times as much per pupil here.  Secondary education, in my opinion, is the doorway to greater educational pursuit and to a university career.  Unless the Minister ensures that there is free secondary education, he must realise that he is depriving the vast majority of our boys and girls of the opportunity of ever seeing the inside of a university, irrespective of how talented they may be.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister to make available free education in our secondary schools and if he assesses the cost of that, he will find that it will not prove too great an impost on the taxpayers. I believe the public would be willing to pay for this tremendous investment in human endeavour.  While the portals of the secondary schools are closed to such a large number of people, no one can suggest that we have free education in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably tell me that there has been a great increase in <Col N="1565" /> enrolments to the secondary schools; that they have risen in recent years, from 1951 to 1959, from 50,000 to 70,000, but we must have regard to the fact that there is a possible 282,000 pupils who could avail of secondary education who cannot be provided for. We have, therefore, 212,000 pupils to provide for who could get and possibly should have got a secondary education in this land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> On the university side, the story is even worse.  We spend approximately £89.2 per year per pupil on university education.</P>
