      <P>The total number of persons on the live register on the 1 December, 1962, was 48,697. The percentage unemployed is calculated by relating the number of currently insured persons on the live register, excluding those in agriculture, fishing and private domestic service, to the estimated corresponding currently insured population.  This percentage at 17 November, 1962, the latest date available, was 5.6.</P>

      <P>Information about regulations dealing with the meat content of sausages in member countries of the EEC is not available in my Department but I can inform the Deputy that the meat content of sausages is not prescribed by regulations in Britain.</P>
      <P>The powers which are available to me as Minister for Health in regard to the fixing of food standards are set out in Section 56 of the Health Act, 1947. The Section in question empowers the Minister for Health to make regulations prescribing a standard for the composition of food &ldquo;where&rdquo;, and only where&mdash;I quote&mdash;&ldquo;the Minister is of opinion that the composition of any food (whether consumed by itself or as an ingredient of other food) is of special importance to the public health&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that the use of these powers to establish a standard minimal meat content for sausages would not be justified.</P>

      <P>Particulars furnished to my Department by health authorities indicate that of the 800 approximately medical practitioners at present employed in local authority hospitals, 46, all temporary and all in the registrar and house officer grades, are non-nationals.  In addition, nine non-nationals are employed as interns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that the Dublin Health Authority submitted Labour Court Recommendation No. 1561 to his Department for sanction in September concerning revised scales for city and county health inspectors; and that this recommendation was accepted by the Authority; if so, when sanction to these proposals will be forthcoming; and if an effort will be made to have arrears paid before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, arising out of the Labour Court Recommendation referred to, the <Col N="968" /> Dublin Health Authority submitted to my Department last September a proposal to adopt revised salary scales for health inspectors employed by the Authority.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the interest of that Authority is a relatively narrow one, related to its own service only.  The Oireachtas has laid down that proposals of health authorities regarding the remuneration of their staffs are subject to the sanction of the Minister for Health.  Inherent in the exercise of that statutory function is a duty to examine all such proposals from a wider point of view than that of the particular health authority primarily involved.  In the present instance, an important issue is involved which requires careful consideration by reason of its serious implications in relation to other health authorities and other grades of staff.  These implications do not appear to have been adequately presented to the Labour Court and I have, therefore, caused a communication to be sent to that body. Pending receipt of a reply to that communication and fuller examination of the position in the light of that reply, I am unable to convey a decision to the Dublin Health Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it there is a dispute now between the Minister for Health and the Labour Court, in relation to the recommendations which it has made in connection with this case? Is the Minister now disputing with the Labour Court the results and consequences of its function as a body to consider the claims of persons who feel aggrieved and is this a departure from the usual principle of accepting the recommendations of the Labour Court? I understand the recommendations of the Labour Court are usually accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When the recommendations of the Labour Court are found by any party to the Labour Court's proceedings to be acceptable, they are accepted.  In this case, I do not find them acceptable, but I am not raising any dispute with the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it we have now reached the stage where a <Col N="969" /> Government Department will challenge a recommendation made by an independent body such as the Labour Court?  The Department is not a party to the original dispute; it is only exercising its function to sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department is very much a party to the dispute, since it foots half the bill but, apart from that, the Department is not exercising any greater discretion than that which is exercised by a trade union and in that sense, it can make further representations to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not suggest that the Department of Health, which was not present at the Labour Court hearing, and therefore is not a party to the dispute, has the same right as a trade union or a direct employer, such as the health authority, to refuse to accept a recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will study my reply, he will see that I have stated that in my view certain aspects of this matter were not adequately presented to the Labour Court.  Perhaps they will be presented on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not the person to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it to be taken now that the Minister is creating a precedent so that if Labour Court recommendations go to other Departments of State they will be in the same position to dispute the recommendations of the Labour Court?  Take, for instance, the Civil Service or some of the larger bodies.  Will we have the situation now that the decisions and the recommendations of the Labour Court, will not alone be disregarded but will be contested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not know how the Deputy has arrived at the conclusion that the recommendations &mdash;and, mind you, they are only recommendations; they are not findings; they are recommendations of the Labour Court&mdash;will be contested.  However, the Minister for any Department, in the exercise of his responsibility to the taxpayers at large, is entitled to exercise his judgment as to whether <Col N="970" /> he thinks it is or is not in the public interest to accept a recommendation of the Labour Court without demur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health what progress, if any, has been made towards the provision of hearing aids, free of charge, to necessitous persons, including old-age pensioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy has in mind the hearing aid service being organised by the National Organisation for Rehabilitation to which I referred during the debate on the Vote for Health on the 10th April 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> The Organisation have been in close contact with my Department in the matter.  Arrangements are well advanced for the recruitment of staff for the hearing aid centre which it is proposed to open at the Organisation's headquarters at Clyde Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin.  The ground floor of these premises is being adapted and equipped and it is hoped to inaugurate the service early next year.</P>
    <P>It has been necessary to restrict the supply of hearing aids by health authorities to eligible persons but when this new service gets into its stride these restrictions will be eased and it should be possible to meet demands from health authorities for hearing aids for eligible persons, including persons eligible for aural services, free of charge, under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.  The majority of persons in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions under the Social Welfare Acts would be in this category.</P>

      <P>Where the import value of parcels imported by post does not exceed £20 each, the duty is assessed by Officers of Customs and Excise, collected by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and remitted by that Department to the Revenue Commissioners. The approximate amount of duty collected on such parcels in the months of November and December, 1961, is as follows:&mdash;</P>

Such receipts are accounted for in the ordinary way with all other receipts under the appropriate tariff headings.

      <P>If the Deputy reads the recommendations, he will find that, contrary to what he thinks, the purpose of establishing this council was to deal with matters of general policy and watching the general development of transport which is the duty of my Department.

      <P>I am not clear as to which 28 &ldquo;A&rdquo; class diesel locomotives the Deputies' Questions refer.  I am informed by CIE that 60 &ldquo;A&rdquo; class diesels were purchased in May, 1954 at a cost of £3,878,000 approximately; and that their life expectancy is estimated at 20 years for the engine and 40 years for the frame and electrical work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that following the closing of the Kilfree branch railway line from 4th February, 1963 they will substitute efficient and satisfactory road services as required.  In these circumstances the closure should have no adverse effects on the area.  I have no evidence that the closure of the line will deter any industrialists from coming to the area. CIE took into account the possibility of the factory referred to by the Deputy being established in Ballaghaderreen but even on the most optimistic basis the traffic from this factory would not suffice to make the branch line economic.  CIE have no information that the factory, if established, would use the railway line at all; on the other hand, the character of the production envisaged obviously lends itself to carriage by road.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in view of the urgent demand for housing accommodation by persons unable to provide houses for themselves, he will consider initiating discussions with representatives of the building industry and of the trade unions with a view to adopting new building techniques or other measures designed to speed up the erection of houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome any developments in building techniques and methods which would assist to satisfy housing needs more efficiently, economically and quickly.  I have indicated this in recent public statements. Section 7 of the Housing (Loans and Grants) Act, 1962, empowers me to pay a grant of 50 per cent. of the cost of erecting prototype or experimental houses to standards and specifications and by methods not previously in use. I hope that this provision will encourage the industry to take the initiative in experiments in new techniques.  Any proposals of this kind submitted to my <Col N="998" /> Department will receive careful and sympathetic consideration.  In the meantime, my Department is keeping in touch with the development of new techniques such as &ldquo;system building&rdquo; and various systems of prefabrication.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that the purchase tax of 25 per cent. on the purchase <Col N="1006" /> of land is sufficient to deter non-nationals from purchasing land here which should be held for the relief of congestion?  Is the Minister aware that the value of land in Germany is three times that of similar land here, that land which would cost £100 per acre here would cost £300 per acre in Germany?  In those circumstances, does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that the 25 per cent. tax is sufficient to keep the existing pool of land here in order to create the 45-acre holdings the Minister has so often referred to?</P>

    <P>As regards (c) it is not possible at present to indicate when each of the properties listed&mdash;many of which were taken over within the past year&mdash;will be disposed of but there will be no <Col N="1007" /> avoidable delay.  Already this year, some 840 acres have been allotted in Co. Meath and, while the land settlement programme for the remainder of the current financial year is necessarily still tentative, it is hoped that the aggregate allotment in the county for the year as a whole will be in the region of 2,000 acres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> As regards (d), delay in the disposal of the relatively small number of estates involved is attributable to such factors as the selection of suitable allottees&mdash;mainly in the migrant category&mdash;and associated difficulties arising in connection with the execution of requisite improvements works.</P>

    <P>Already this year, lands aggregating 1,731 acres in County Galway and 142 acres in Co. Tipperary (S.R.) have been allotted by the Land Commission. The land settlement programme for the remainder of the financial year is necessarily still tentative and it is not possible at this stage to indicate precisely the particular lands which will be disposed of by next April. Perhaps in the circumstances, it would meet the Deputies requirements to know that for the year as a whole it may be possible to achieve allotments <Col N="1010" /> in the region of 7,000 acres in the County Galway and 1,500 acres in County Tipperary (S.R.).</P>
    <P>If the Deputies are interested in any particular estates, I would suggest that they communicate direct with the Land Commission in the matter.</P>

    <P>I made it clear in these statements that I was merely indicating the lines on which my thoughts had been running.  In relation to the matter of selection for academic secondary education there is available in my Department information <Col N="1015" /> as to the position in various countries.</P>
    <P>It is not to be inferred from that fact, however, that when conclusions have been arrived at, they will be modelled on the position in any particular country.</P>
    <P>I fail to see, therefore, what cause there can be for considerable concern except, perhaps, in the minds of people who are thinking in terms of an 11 plus examination which is something that I am not contemplating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall from my Financial Statement to Dáil Éireann on 10th April last, that I made a provision of £½m. in the Capital Budget 1962-63 for the food processing project of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  I mentioned at the time the expectation that the company's plans for food processing would soon reach the stage at which the Government would be asked to provide additional share capital. The main purpose of this Bill is to enable that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta, was established in 1933, under the Sugar Manufacture Act of that year. Among the newly established company's tasks were the acquisition, erection and operation of sugar factories in the State.  As beet growing and <Col N="1017" /> farmers' relations with the company developed, Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann extended its activities by degrees into other spheres which were associated with the beet sugar industry.  Thus, in addition to manufacturing various types of sugar, the company has for years past engaged in the production of ground limestone, of grassmeal and agricultural machinery, in the compounding of fertilisers and pioneer work in the experimental development of reclaimed bogland for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> published in November, 1958, it was stated that the Government would encourage State-sponsored concerns to extend their activities into projects related to their main spheres of operation and to test the profitability of new lines and new markets.  The response of the directors of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann was quick and wholehearted when in 1959 they embarked on their food-processing enterprise.  Up to the present, the company's investment in processed food production, including research and development, exceeds £2.3 million.  The company has introduced to this country the new method of accelerated freeze drying and has also sponsored a new technique for producing &ldquo;instant potatoes&rdquo;. Outside its headquarters, the company's food processing and allied activities are located as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mallow&mdash;Accelerated freeze drying plant&mdash;the first and still the largest in the world.  Air drying plant.</P>
    <P>Carlow&mdash;Research and development. New processing factory.  Air drying and canning plant.</P>
    <P>Tuam&mdash;Instant potato flake producing plant of most advanced design and equipment.</P>
    <P>Thurles&mdash;Mushroom farm and central packing station.</P>
    <P>The area under potatoes, vegetables and fruit for 1962/63 was some 4,500 acres.  At present over 750 persons&mdash; including some trainees&mdash;are employed at the various plants, apart from some 120 employees of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann who are supplying services to the food division and some 250 workers <Col N="1018" /> engaged in building and construction work.</P>

      <P>Are we not to get in the ordinary way copies of the speech the Minister is reading?  I thought my polite quip on Thursday, in the other case, would have brought it to mind and that the Minister's private secretary would have made it available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall try to get them. I overlooked that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should not have to attend personally to such details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not many figures in it.</P>
      <P>The products are destined mainly for export and sales to date have been effected in England, Germany, Holland, Iceland, Switzerland, Channel Islands and Africa.</P>
      <P>Only a small proportion of total output is being retained for the home market.  Two of the company's new products, however&mdash;instant potatoes, of which the company is the sole producer here, and processed peas&mdash; are already on sale on the consumer home market and are, I understand, doing well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the standard of living improves in the more advanced countries, public taste tends to seek a greater variety in food.  When this can be offered in a form that can be prepared for the table quickly and with a minimum of labour it carries an added sales attraction.  Public demand is thus shifting to processed foodstuffs and the amount of farm produce which is being marketed in processed form is increasing.  There is every indication that this trend will continue.  Our soil and climate and our labour force already constitute valuable initial advantages in food production so that great possibilities are open to this country of establishing itself in an expanding external market for processed foods.  The Government believes that this opportunity should be seized as quickly as possible.  Private firms are already engaged in this field but in order that it should be exploited as fully as possible the Government have <Col N="1019" /> welcomed and encouraged the plans of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    <P>The dangers for an agricultural country such as ours of not keeping up with other countries in this method of marketing agricultural produce will be obvious.  The benefits of success in this field are no less clear.  Not alone will new industrial employment be provided in the processing plants but farmers&mdash;particularly the small farmers&mdash;in the area concerned, would be offered stimulating prospects of a steady and expanding market for the raw materials needed by the processing plants.</P>
    <P>What is involved in the plan of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann is, in effect, organisation on a scale not previously attempted of an outlet for horticultural produce at economic guaranteed prices.  The company hope, and I share their hope, that to the extent that their plants are located in, or draw upon the produce of, the less developed areas, they will foster a spirit of self-confidence and new initiative there, thus enabling those areas to make an effective contribution to rural development.</P>
    <P>The AFD process holds possibilities, too, for our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>These various possibilities strike one immediately but there are other advantages, too, to be had from the successful implementation of the company's plans that may not strike one at first glance.  For instance, the industry would open up an outlet for high-grade technical and professional skills and should serve as a valuable training ground for educating our young people in modern industrial techniques.</P>
    <P>Then there is the fact that developing the food processing industry encourages other native industries such as those engaged in manufacture of packing materials of various kinds &mdash; boxes, cases, cartons, jute and paper sack and polythene laminates.  Finally, any move towards competitive export of our own products in processed form, rather than in their natural state, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> It is now clear, however, that if Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann's initiative in starting this industry is to be fully supported and sustained, further substantial capital investment will be necessary.  Competition in this field is particularly keen so that, if we are to capture an adequate part of the market, it is of great importance that we establish our position as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>As most of you will be aware, the company has financed its manifold activities up to now without any addition to the share or debenture capital raised in its earlier days.  Apart from the few shares issued to subcribers to the memorandum and articles of association or as qualifying shares to directors, the capital raised consisted of the 500,000 ordinary shares of £1 each issued to the Minister for Finance, on which the company has been paying a 5 per cent. dividend for many years past, and the public issue of 500,000 6 per cent. cumulative preference shares of £1 each.  A further £1m. was raised from the public by way of State guaranteed debentures.</P>
    <P>I should add here that a bonus issue of shares was made in 1961 to bring the nominal value of the ordinary shares rather nearer their real value. This bonus issue brought the issued ordinary share capital to £1.5m. and the total issued share capital, preference and ordinary, up to the limit of £2m. permitted by the Sugar Manufacture Act, 1933.  The bonus issue did not, of course, increase the money actually invested in the company.</P>
    <P>The stage has now arrived where the company has found that further desirable expansion of food processing is likely to be beyond its available resources.  Furthermore, Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann's ordinary sugar manufacturing business itself now stands in need of certain developments involving capital outlay.  This development might be hampered if the temporarily free resources which the company had applied to developing the food processing business were to remain as a continuing investment in it.</P>
    <P>The company has therefore approached the Government with an outline of the developments it considers <Col N="1021" /> necessary to exploit adequately the potential of the food processing enterprise.  The directors of the company are confident that, despite the keen competition which already exists in this field, the enterprise will pay its way apart altogether from the benefits it will bring to the nation's whole economy.  Having carefully studied the company's proposals, the Government have concluded that Exchequer assistance should be made available for the further development of this important project.  The Government feel, too, that the time has come for setting up a separate company which, while very closely associated with the sugar company, should concentrate on food processing.  Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann is already studying the question of establishing a subsidiary company for this purpose.</P>
    <P>So much for the background.  As to the Bill itself, its main provisions may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P> (1)  it provides for the increase of the authorised capital of Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann from £2m. to £5m.;</P>
    <P>(2)  it empowers the Minister for Finance to acquire, by subscription or by purchase, shares to the total amount of £3.5m. in Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teo., and/or in an &ldquo;approved subsidiary company&rdquo;, that is, the proposed new food processing company.  The 1933 Act. limited to £500,000, nominal value, the amount of shares the Minister might acquire by subscription in Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo. This limit did not, of course, attach to the subsequent bonus shares which he obtained without subscription;</P>
    <P>(3)  it empowers the Minister for Finance to make repayable advances to the parent company or to an approved subsidiary company;</P>
    <P>(4)  it enables him also to guarantee borrowings by either body, provided the aggregate of the principal guaranteed and of the advances made does not at any time exceed £5m.</P>
    <P>(5)  it will relax the provision of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, in favour of an <Col N="1022" /> approved subsidiary company so as to facilitate association with co-operative societies engaged in food production or food processing where this might be economically justifiable and in the national interest. </P>
    <P>There are also some consequential provisions and modifications of existing law.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that the additional resources which the Exchequer may furnish under the Bill can be made available either directly to the new food company or channelled to it through Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, or through a combination of these methods.  This provision will provide flexibility.  The exact method of financing has not yet been determined. The method may, in fact, vary from time to time.  The Bill has been so drawn that Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann can be put in funds to finance expansion and improvement of the sugar factories, should further examination show this to be necessary.</P>
    <P>At the present stage, it would be very difficult to frame precise estimates of ultimate financial requirements either as to amounts or the times they would likely fall due or to give a firm and detailed outline of the Company's eventual programme.  As of now, the company envisages expanding the processing plants already named and the AFD installation.  Mushroom production is to be increased and the packing station will need enlargement.  Other important projects outside these centres are under consideration.</P>
    <P>Even the plans I have just outlined should not, however, be regarded as rigid.  The lessons learned as the company probes and breaks into external markets; the way in which farmers in particular areas grasp the opportunities of supplying the requisite volume, variety and quality of produce; changes in consumer tastes; Common Market developments &mdash; all these factors, and many more besides, may affect objectives.  Some lines of development may be given greater emphasis than is now contemplated. As Minister for Finance, it would be my responsibility to be reasonably satisfied of the general economic soundness <Col N="1023" /> of the various projects as and when Exchequer assistance is sought.</P>
    <P>By and large, I would expect that share capital would be used to cover the acquisition of fixed assets and that repayable advances and guaranteed borrowings would be used to meet working capital requirements.  These latter requirements are particularly difficult to gauge in advance of adequate experience.  Regarding the guaranteeing of borrowings, I would expect that this provision would facilitate the company in obtaining funds from the banks and other financial institutions so that the Exchequer should not have to supply all the finance required.</P>
    <P>If present forecasts are fulfilled, the food company's capital requirements, whether in respect of share or loan capital, will prove eventually to be significantly more than is provided for in this Bill.  It has become established practice in this type of legislation to make such provision as might cover needs for two or three years ahead so as to afford the Oireachtas a further opportunity of reviewing the matter when the new project has taken shape. At the present stage of development of this project, I should not feel justified in asking the Dáil to authorise commitments greater than those I am now proposing to the House.  I would expect the present Bill, however, to cover requirements for some years ahead.  As soon as the provision of further funds from the Exchequer is necessary the case would, of course, again be brought before the Oireachtas. I can promise on behalf of the Government and myself, and I would venture to say also on behalf of the Dáil, that the company can make its plans for expansion in the full confidence that a further request for finance will be sympathetically received and welcomed.</P>
    <P>While the outlook for the processed food industry is promising, I must emphasise that the new food company to be formed will face no easy task in establishing and holding a footing in the world's highly competitive export markets.  However, the qualities which Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann has displayed <Col N="1024" /> in bringing the project to its present stage of development inspire confidence in the ultimate success of the venture, even in the face of severe competition from well established concerns. And here I should like to add my tribute to the foresight, enthusiasm, drive and skill which the board of the company and its managerial, administrative and technical staffs have applied to their task.  The Government fully appreciate all this and the important national project which the food processing enterprise constitutes has the Government's full support.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy will wish the company and its new subsidiary the merited success in the enterprises which we trust will be of great significance in the economic life of this country.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate the Minister, first of all, on the manner in which the baby white elephant of his colleague, Deputy MacEntee, has grown to such a lusty child.  Of course, everybody who appreciated Deputy MacEntee, as he was then, knew that he was saying it for the purpose of hitting the headlines, not being able to hit them in any other way at the time.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with the extension of the funds to be available for the sugar company and I think it is perhaps somewhat unfortunate that the Minister decided, as apparently he has decided from the speech we have just heard, to provide the funds directly from the Exchequer.  The reference he has made to guarantees does not change my view in that respect.  It is clear from the manner in which Section 2 has been drafted&mdash;to increase the capital&mdash;and then Section 3&mdash;to provide that the Minister may take up the shares&mdash;that he has considered this entirely from the point of view of his action alone in providing such capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is a mistake.  One of the things from which we suffer&mdash;and I may make some reference to this later on the Estimate for the Office of the Minister of Finance&mdash;is that there is nothing like a sufficiency of Irish <Col N="1025" /> industrial shares to be purchased on the Irish stock exchanges.  People sometimes complain bitterly of the manner in which Irish residents here invest their funds abroad, but the fact of the matter is that, if one goes to buy any substantial parcel of Irish industrial securities at the present time, they are virtually unobtainable.  It has become a pattern of which we are all too well aware.  People who buy Irish industrial securities buy them to hold, and that is a good thing, but they do not buy them to turn and accordingly the market in every type of Irish industrial security is all too restricted. It would very greatly assist the transfer of funds from sterling equity holdings back to Ireland if there were an adequacy of industrial holdings here.</P>
    <P>The sugar company are a case in point where that could have been met to some degree and it is unfortunate, therefore, that this whole Bill has been framed by the Minister with the idea in his mind that, whatever funds the company require&mdash;and of course they do require funds, and should be given funds&mdash;would be made available from the Exchequer rather than that the market should be assisted in that way and the dual function put through. The Minister referred to the very vast amount at present invested by the company in food processing&mdash;a sum of £2,300,000.  The accelerated freeze drying plant at Mallow must have gone fairly far on by now from its original teething stage and I should have liked the Minister to have given us some more information than he gave in that respect.</P>
    <P>I said at the time when that was first announced in this House that I thought it was a pity it was not announced more as an effort that was then being made not to provide something that was well established and successful but to explore possibilities. Those possibilities should have been explored by now, and I think have been explored, and by and large, we can say that the results have been entirely satisfactory.  With our particular problem of small farms in Ireland, the intensive use of the area and the acreage that small farmers have is essential, if we are to halt in any way <Col N="1026" /> the drift from the land.  Food processing is one of the ways in which that intensive use can be facilitated and, to that extent, the sugar company deserve to be congratulated as fulfilling in this aspect a most useful function.</P>
    <P>I am not very clear about the various forms of freezing and I do not know whether the Minister knows any more about it than I do.  Is the AFD process the same as the quick freezing process or is it a different means altogether?  Quick freezing, I understand, can be either by plate freezing or by blast freezing, and I think it would help the general public appreciation of what is being done if the Minister could indicate whether there is a difference in that respect or not.  The ordinary deep freeze is, in fact, only a cold storeroom and to get the best results out of a cold storeroom, be it a household deep freeze or a hotel deep freeze, or the bigger ones in the specialised companies, I understand it is desirable that there should be some form of quick freezing first of all, either by blast or by plate freezing according as the type is concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation particularly to fish, which the Minister has mentioned, blast freezing is, I think, accepted by the experts as being the most effective means of production.  The plate quick freezing tends to split the fish, particularly salmon, and on that account is not satisfactory.  Does the Minister propose that this company should come in on that aspect to any degree? I should have thought the normal course would be that Bord Iascaigh Mhara would deal with that aspect but I should like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand the Minister's reference to the desirability of changing the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, by subsection (3) of Section 10 of this Bill.  Does the Minister propose that some of the existing creamery societies will take up shares in the new subsidiary company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That the subsidiary company would help to finance some of these societies and do it by way of share capital rather than by loan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not gather that from the Minister and I am glad to have it explained and to see that that is what is in his mind in that respect.  However, it does accentuate even more the point I was about to make in relation to approved subsidiary companies.  I do not like the system by which a State company is set up and is given power to go off and have a whole lot of children, so to speak.  The subsidiary company may be desirable in certain specific instances but it is another method in some cases of avoiding the control of this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has perhaps read in a morning newspaper to-day the most damning indictment of him as Minister for Finance that could have been written by anyone&mdash;an indictment showing that he had completely neglected to utilise his appropriate controls as Minister for Finance because of a subsidiary company arrangement. This method here is a method of completely avoiding the giving of any information to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I think it essential, not merely in this case but in any case in which a State company sets up a subsidiary company, that exactly the same information about the subsidiary company should be made available to this House as is available in respect of the parent company, by question or otherwise. Without that, the institution of the subsidiary company device can mean setting up a whole chain of people dependent on the whim of certain individuals who are in the State companies concerned.  As a principle, it is quite undesirable.  In my view, it is quite essential that, if a subsidiary company has to be used as it may perhaps be used in this case, all the facts and information should be laid before the House in the same way as they are laid in relation to the parent company itself.</P>

      <Col N="1028" /> The defination in Section 1 of an approved subsidiary company does not specify whether that company is to be private or public.  If it is a public company, at least one has recourse to the companies office to inspect accounts and so on.  If it is a private company, such recourse is not available.  I should like the Minister to make quite clear what he has in mind in that respect, so that we might consider whether it is desirable to leave it as it is or to restrict the section on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand, either, why section 4 is included in this Bill and why the matter was not dealt with in the more normal course of the scheduling to the State Guarantees Bill which Bill was brought in for the express purpose of enabling the Minister for Finance to give guarantees in respect of State companies.  It seems to me that Section 4 is doing exactly the same job as was done in that Act.  We on this side of the House feel that the developments in modern times require more processing than previously.  It is commonplace that, the more modern life makes for rush and bustle, people will have less and less time to prepare food for the table, and so on, and that, therefore, the trend is all towards getting something that is ready instantly.  The choice of the name &ldquo;Instant Potato&rdquo; was for that reason a very happy one.</P>
    <P>By and large, in the years ahead we shall move to the same position as they have already reached in America where the whole stress and trend is towards having food pre-prepared in factories and delivered to the householder, so that the householder has to carry out the minimum amount of work on that food before it is ready for eating.  This Bill will assist that to some degree and it will also assist in ensuring that as much intensive work as possible is done on the small farms of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party certainly welcome this proposal by the Government and the new development by Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  We applaud the extension of the activities of State-sponsored bodies.  We applauded the statement by the <Col N="1029" /> Taoiseach some time last year that it was intended that the State-sponsored bodies would be encouraged to extend their activities.  We believe that one of the best prospects for the employment of our people lies in the activities of the State-sponsored concerns.  This is evident as far as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is concerned.  For that reason, we support the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not want to strike a discordant note but I trust that neither in this debate nor in future debates, will we hear any suggestion as was made by the Minister for Finance last year that some of these public companies should be put on the market, so to speak, and that private enterprise should be given an opportunity to take up the bulk of shares in them.</P>
      <P>We applaud this measure as Deputy Sweetman has said, because it is also a much-needed new line for the farming community.  They have been pretty well restricted of late in the crops that could be regarded by them as really profitable.  They have been engaged to some extent, in the horticultural industry but not on the scale that every one of us would hope they would engage in horticulture.  For that reason alone, I think this measure deserves the support of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the climate and the soil of this country are admirable.  From the point of view of engaging in the horticultural industry, that is so.  We think Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann will give an opportunity to the big proportion of our farmers to engage in the sowing and in the good harvesting of the horticultural crops, so that the accelerated freeze drying plant will be kept going, not merely for a portion of the year but for the whole 12 months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that, outside Carlow, the company has factories&mdash;different types of factories of course&mdash;in Mallow, Tuam and Thurles.  I trust that when this industry expands&mdash;if it is economically possible, of course&mdash;there will be factories in various parts of the country. When we think of factories in this day and age, naturally we think of our own counties.  The Minister is a colleague <Col N="1030" /> in my constituency.  I am sure he would like to see an extension of the activities of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann into, say, County Wexford and into different parts of the country where employment is needed.  However, that is a matter for the manager and directors of the Board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note that they have extended to Mallow, Tuam and other places in particular business.  We trust it will not be the end of the extension.  The Minister says the products are mainly destined for export. He should expand on that.  It is very desirable that we should concentrate on exports but if possible I think these products should also be available in the home market.  I have no idea what prices will be like in this line of goods.</P>
    <P>There are other undertakings in the country engaged in the canning of horticultural products.  I am inclined to think that maybe a little element of competition by a State-sponsored company might not be at all bad.  We are told that there will be fierce competition when we become&mdash;should I say, if we become?&mdash;members of the Common Market.  These people will just have to face up to competition some time or another and this might be an opportune time to start.  Perhaps the Minister would give us the reasons for the suggestion that there will be a limited amount available for the home market.  There was a suggestion some time ago by the manager of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann that he was being stymied in his efforts to extend the business to which we are now referring.  I have no evidence that what he said was true but I do remember reading something to that effect in some of the newspapers about 12 months ago in regard to efforts to expand and extend the food canning and food processing industry, so possibly this is a compromise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also spoken about the prospects for development and I do not think he could be too enthusiastic about our prospects, if we do the job properly.  Deputy Sweetman has referred to the age in which we live. <Col N="1031" /> It is indeed an age of cannel food, an age in which, whether we approve of it or not, a big proportion of women in Europe and in the world generally are working.  In many cases because they are working, they are not in a position to prepare food in the traditional manner and for that reason have greater recourse to canned food which is easier and quicker to prepare.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has said that the export potentialities lie in certain countries in Europe, we must remember that Europeans are choosey about their food.  I think it could be said they are a little more choosey than we are and therefore this will have to be a very successful effort and not just a question of throwing frozen or dried foodstuffs into cans and sending them across Europe.  There could be mentioned many efforts in the past to export to the Continent canned foodstuffs which after a while were rejected because they were not up to the mark. For myself, I have sufficient confidence in the manager and board of directors of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to believe they would not attempt to send out badly processed foodstuffs but, on the other hand, would send only foodstuffs which would be acceptable to the countries in Europe which we hope will buy these products.</P>
    <P>I do not know what plans Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have for consultation and cooperation with the farming community. Farmers are relatively slow to change their methods and the development of the horticultural industry may require the farming community to change their methods of growing or harvesting.  The general manager of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann should set up some sort of advisory or consultative board with the farmers because there is no point in his or his fellow directors' issuing directives or orders to the farming community that they must do this or they must do that.  In my experience, the Irish farmer does not react to that sort of talk.  I do not suggest it has been done in the past but Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and the farmers would profit, if there were some sort of consultation and co-operations as to the ways and means <Col N="1032" /> of getting the best product to the factory from the fields.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the fishing industry in one line.  I do not criticise him for that but it would have been interesting to have a little more comment on the prospects for the fishing industry.  This industry has well been described as the Cinderella of our natural industries.  We have had justifiable complaints from time to time of the gluts of fish on the Irish market. There have been stories of the dumping into the sea of great quantities of fish. It would be a boon to this country and certainly to the fishermen around our coasts, if there were a profitable and secure market for the fish they catch throughout the year.  There are fish-canning industries in this country but they do not seem to have made any impression on the big catches that are made.  If the Minister could spur Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann on to process fish with a view to its export, it would be a great boon to the country and especially to the fishermen.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note that as a result of establishing this accelerated drying, there may be established an associate industry.  I do not know what the real prospects are there in that regard, but all of us hope they are good.  The Minister has mentioned there will be needed in this industry boxes, cases, cartons, jute and paper sack and polythene laminates.  Whether it is possible to make all these things in the country, I do not know, I am sure it is possible but while Ministers from time to time tell us they cannot direct private enterprise to establish industries in any particular case, because this is a State-sponsored company, the Minister should ask his nominated directors, in any case, to ensure that these industries are placed, if they are to be established, in areas where there is unemployment.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this has anything to do with this measure or not but the Minister in the course of his speech to Deputies said that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is now in need of further moneys for certain other developments. I assume that is purely in the processing of sugar but perhaps the <Col N="1033" /> Minister in his concluding speech will say what these developments might be. The Minister, in the concluding part of his speech, said he could promise on behalf of the Government, and, he would venture to say, on behalf of the Dáil, that the company could make its plans for expansion in the full confidence that a further request for finance would be sympathetically received and welcomed.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, he is not too presumptious because we certainly applaud his sentiments in that respect. We will support any proposals the Minister brings in here to expand any of the State-sponsored companies, where we know and are assured that the expansion will mean better trade for the country, better export trade and above all, extra employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>My enthusiasm for this measure is tempered with sadness because it has come so late.  I sincerely hope that it is not too late.  If there is any hope at this stage of getting into food processing in the way in which that should have been done over the past 15 years, the sugar company is the only body in this country able and fit to achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>In his speech, of which I have not a copy but of which I took a note, the Minister said that any move to export commodities in processed form rather than in the natural state is welcomed. That is the understatement of the year by the Minister.  We have had the position over the past 40 years that the farming community in Ireland have been indoctrinated with the idea that the intensive type of farming is the most suitable for the small farmer. It will be very difficult at this stage to break him off the habit and belief that has been inculcated in him over the years.  We know from the population figure and from the protests made all over Ireland that, consequent upon that intensive type of farming that has been operating here for years, rural Ireland is being depopulated to a degree never envisaged 25 to 30 years ago.  The decline has continued and the tempo has been stepped up.  Therefore, it will be a tremendously difficult task to halt or reverse the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> The subsidiary company attached to the sugar company that will be established when this measure becomes law will have a major task on its hands.  Over the past 20 years, we have looked on while Holland, Denmark and Britain developed food processing. We have seen how food processing has expanded in these highly industrialised countries.  Figures are available which show that in Britain alone consumption of processed foods, such as vegetables, is in the region of £800,000,000 per year.  That market is being met by British horticulturists and small farmers and by imports from European countries that have realised the extraordinary value of processing agricultural products on a big scale.  We have sat silent while that market in Britain was being filled by other countries. Now, at this late stage, when other countries are geared up and have the marketing arrangements almost completely under their control in the larger places like Britain, we try to break into that very tough market, almost completely unorganised &mdash; infants, in fact, in this warfare.</P>
    <P>Even though it may sound at this stage as being in bad taste on a measure such as this, I want to say that it should not be forgotten that Governments over the years stand condemned for their neglect of this very important industry which should be the major arm of agriculture.  I cannot understand the reason for the neglect.</P>
    <P>Somebody may intervene in this debate and say the AFD process which will now be considered under this measure is a new process.  I agree that it is a new process but, for the last 30 years, the processing of foodstuffs has not been new as far as other countries were concerned.  We made no attempt to engage in any type of food processing in a big way.  We have a chance&mdash;it is a slight one&mdash;in that the sugar company were the first to understand the value of the experiments carried out in Scotland and were the first in the field with this process.  There is a hope that we will be able to maintain our lead but the hope is slight.  At this stage, every Deputy should express support for the <Col N="1035" /> action taken by the sugar company over the years, in view of the opposition that was shown towards them and the attempt made by the private food processing group in this country to sabotage&mdash;and I deliberately use that word&mdash;their efforts in the food processing campaign.</P>
    <P>We have had the statement, extracted from the Minister in the course of replies to Parliamentary Questions, that the sugar company is to be prohibited from selling its own products on the home market except to the extent of 10 per cent.  Is there any justification for such prohibition on one of the most successful State concerns in this country?  Is it right that, in respect of products from the soil of Ireland and processed by Irish people in Irish factories, the Irish public should be told that they will get only 10 per cent. of the products, that the rest must be exported?  The public should be told why that prohibition was placed on the sugar company. Many of us know why it was imposed, that it was at the deliberate request of, the pressure exercised by, a number of food-processing companies in this country.</P>
    <P>Some of those companies are subsidiary companies, with headquarters outside the State.  Over the years, those companies, which engaged in the processing of certain horticultural lines and vegetables, posed as Irish companies. Admittedly, they gave employment to a number of Irish persons in their factories but what has been forgotten by many people and is not known to many others is that in many instances these companies imported over 70 per cent. of their raw material. There was the extraordinary spectacle of horticultural produce grown in Holland, Denmark and elsewhere being imported to Ireland, processed or put into tin cans in Ireland, and resold abroad.  These subsidiary companies would not think it worth their while or in the national interest to point out to the Irish farmer that the growing of food for processing would be an ideal proposition for him.  They failed utterly to demonstrate to the Irish farmer the advantages there were for him and they failed to get his support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> I have evidence of where they tried to exploit a number of small farmers in this country.  When they found the farmer was able to increase production from the limited half-acre contract given to him, they cut the price the following year.  That has been the attitude displayed by the private group who have had control of food-processing in this country.  If any Deputy doubts that that group opposed the entry by the sugar company into the food-processing business, all he has to do is to read the annual reports of a number of these companies over the past three years in which they have attacked the sugar company for moving into what they maintained was the exclusive field of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>We know well what happened in Wexford and in a number of other counties, as far as these private firms were concerned.  We know that when it came to the giving of contracts for the growing of blackcurrants and other fruits, they left the fruit on the farmers' hands when there was a big supply, due to the right type of weather.  When the return from the crop was larger than these companies anticipated, they refused to take the fruit at the price guaranteed and offered merely a dumped price.  It is a well known fact that in fruit growing areas the farmers left the fruit on the land.  That was brought about by the activities of these private groups to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will ensure that the efforts of the sugar company to help the Irish farmer will not be thwarted and that these companies will receive no attention from the Minister.  I hope he will accept the lesson the Government have been taught that they cannot depend on these private enterprise firms to bring about that revolutionary change in Irish agriculture.  To my mind, the sugar company is the ideal type of State company to secure the confidence of a farmer and to get his support.  Over the years, Deputies have condemned the idea of State enterprise and State interference.  As far as I can judge, the two major Parties have spent their time worshipping at the shrine of private enterprise.  They have seen the results in this field of agriculture <Col N="1037" /> where the question of intensive cultivation of the land has been neglected, due to this belief in private enterprise.  They have watched the situation develop in which the markets were taken over by other countries while Ireland concentrated on store cattle reared on small holdings.  They have watched that type of agricultural husbandry over the years and they would not interfere because of the sacred rights of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the conversion and that both sides have to admit that, in this vital field, State enterprise is absolutely essential and that this is absolute socialism in the best sense of the word.  It is a great encouragement to people who have preached that doctrine for years to find this conversion to-day on the question of fruit processing and that the State is in a position to salvage the situation that has resulted from the sabotaging efforts of private enterprise over the years.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have expressed concern that the sugar company may not have liaison with the farming community, that they might need to set up some group to explain all this to the farmer.  My experience has been that the sugar company is one of the best companies for keeping in touch with the farmer and getting his confidence and development on these lines is ideal. On the one hand, the grower, the small farmer will get technical advice, educational facilities, loans and all possible types of help from the sugar company and its subsidiary, and on the other, a guaranteed price for his product.  He will know what he is to get and budget for his expenses over the year.</P>
    <P>In other words, for the first time the small farmers who are likely to go in for growing vegetables, fruit and so forth, will have a guaranteed market and a stability which was lacking.  The only group who had that privilege hitherto are the wheat growers.  We know that the majority of those were not in the small farmer category in the poorer and heavily populated centres.  For the first time, the small farmer will have an opportunity of a guaranteed market for a cash crop. I have the feeling that the proper way for the sugar company and its subsidiary <Col N="1038" /> to go about this is to organise this business on lines similar to those in the beet industry, where the growers can from their own association and negotiate and fight their terms with the processing group itself.  There we have the proper type of cooperation, the farmers in a form of a co-op. and the State acting as a processor, the processing agent, and cutting out the exploitation by what I can describe as the bandit middleman who has preyed on the producer and the consumer over the years.</P>
    <P>It is well known that by reasons of the tremendous work that lies ahead in this field, only a company with the knowledge and experience of the sugar company is certain to get into the foreign market and will be fit to fight its corner.  In that company, there are some of our best brains, technicians and dedicated Irishmen who are prepared to work hard and cooperate with the farming community.  I hope they will go from success to success in the development of this project.</P>
    <P>I hope that apart from the markets which are close at hand, every effort will be made and every support given to the new company to explore the markets which I believe are available in the newly-emerging African States. Quite a number of these products should be suitable for consumption in countries like Ghana, Nigeria and so forth.  The question of bulk or weight is no great problem and it is advantageous that in the type of packaging and the treatment given to the fruit itself it will last indefinitely in the climate of these countries.  The terms of friendship which exist between Ireland and these countries should be explored on the basis that we are prepared to do our best with them and to help them in other ways so far as lies in our power.  If we do that, there is a possibility of developing these markets.  I also feel, despite the fact that it is rather late in the day, that there is a possibility of getting into the huge market which lies beside us.  It would be better for us to concentrate on places such as Britain than to cast our eyes on Germany, France or Europe, for the sale of products which we hope will result from this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> In conclusion, I should like to say to the Minister that I wish the new company every success.  As I have said I am glad that the number of converts to the idea of State enterprise seems to be increasing every day in this House.  I hope that when Deputies who up to the present have been afraid to express their views openly, see the Government and the major Opposition Party welcoming the efforts being made by the sugar company&mdash;a State company&mdash;to get cracking, they will be encouraged to say that this should be done in many other spheres of activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The speaker who has just concluded made some excessive statements with which I want to record disagreement.  I think until the political climate of this country accepts socialism, then a balance of some kind must be maintained between what the State does and what private enterprise does.  We had a history of certain State activities here and, after we obtained freedom to run our own country, our industry was not of an imposing nature. Our capitalists were not of the kind that the last speaker would probably visualise capitalists in other countries as being.</P>
      <P>In the philosophy of the development that has taken place here, we are coming now, I think, to the stage where we must examine that whole philosophy.  I have no doubt that there was, for instance, very determined opposition by manufacturers and food packers to the proposal of the sugar company that they should market these new products on the home market and I am glad that the Government said: &ldquo;No.  There is a limit to what you can do in that regard&rdquo; and they confined the market to 10 per cent.  The problem is there and the Government had to deal with it in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one comes then to the crossroads of State and private enterprise, a problem such as we have now before us inevitably arises.  Those in private enterprise who have been engaged in the processing and packaging of food here can make a case to which we can all listen and, to a great extent, accept that it is not fair that a State created and State supported organisation, like <Col N="1040" /> the sugar company, enjoying complete protection in the marketing of its main product here, with the support of the taxpayers, should not be allowed to compete against private enterprise concerns. These private enterprise industries engaged in food packing are engaged in it on a modest scale, as compared with that envisaged by the sugar company.  These private enterprise industries are small but they are very valuable, particularly from the point of view of labour content.  Again, they do&mdash;the two or three of them that I know certainly&mdash;under the capitalist system, that which we want them to do, and they do it extremely well.</P>
    <P>I would certainly agree that they should not be asked to endure what can only be described as steamroller competition, particularly steamroller competition from a great concern erected by them as taxpayers.  We should, I think, try to ensure that we get the best out of both systems.  It is the somewhat peculiar task, at this stage of our history that we should have to work in that way because, as I said earlier, the growth of great industry here through the medium of private enterprise was not possible because of the evolution of the history of this country.  That goes back to Dean Swift.  We have been trying to make up leeway.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, no fabulous fortunes have been made by those engaged in private enterprise industry here.  They are now facing a future which will be a very testing one for them.  If those private enterprise industries were situate in the constituencies of Deputies who have already spoken, and particularly the last Deputy I should imagine they would be very vocal, if activity by a monolith organisation like the sugar company threatened the continuance of these industries.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the political and social aspects involved in any discussion on private <i>versus</i> State enterprise, private enterprise has made a contribution.  Private enterprise has employed our people.  Private enterprise has done things reasonably well. Some industries have actually been competitive and have exported.  I do <Col N="1041" /> not want to see them broken up by a vast organisation like the sugar company at the very time when they need all the financial strength, confidence and encouragement to meet the challenge of the years that lie ahead if we enter the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Above all, I object very strenuously to any attempt to oust private enterprise here by backdoor methods.  I also object to putting into the mouths of members of my Party words they did not use.  We are supporters of private enterprise and private industry.  We hope to remain so.  We understand the necessity for the kind of public industry we have and we hope to go on supporting that.  If I have anything else to say, it is to express regret that the sugar company did not, by arrangement with the Minister, seek to get any further capital it requires from the citizens direct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the House will, I think, subscribe to the fact that the capital of the sugar company will expand.  Certain remarks have been made by a Deputy on my right, with regard to private enterprise and public enterprise.  His remarks have, in large measure, been refuted by my colleague, Deputy A. Barry.  It is only reasonable to assume that private enterprise and public enterprise can work in harmony.  The suggestion that everything should be owned by the State and that private enterprise should not be allowed to exist is puerile nonsense, and nothing else.</P>
      <P>In this case, we are dealing with a State-sponsored company set up originally by the Act of 1933, an Act it is proposed to amend here to-day.  The capital is being increased from £2,000,000 to £5,000,000.  Everybody will accept that as desirable.  There are, however, one or two things in this Bill with which I do not agree.  Deputy Sweetman has referred to one of them already.  Of the £2,000,000 in 1933, the Minister for Finance held £5,000,000 worth of shares.  Under this Bill, with £5,000,000, the Minister can hold £3,500,000 worth of shares.  Proportionately that is a great deal more than he held before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a State-sponsored company. <Col N="1042" /> It is a company that is doing well.  It is paying a dividend on both its ordinary and preference shares.  The more State money put into companies such as this, the less there is left for other development.  The sugar company is a company which could go to the public market on a public flotation and get every penny it wants.  From that point of view, the introduction of this Bill in its present form is unnecessary. I should like the Minister to tell us why he did not permit the company &mdash;some of the higher executives in the firm were anxious to do so&mdash;to go to the country on a private flotation and get the money required rather than drawing on State capital funds.  A company as good as the sugar company would have had no difficulty.</P>
    <P>Apart from the production of beet and the manufacture of sugar, the company have now gone into a very fertile field of production, the processing of vegetables and all kinds of commodities, for which there is a tremendous future.  Let us consider for a moment the market for processed foods in the United Kingdom a few years ago.  It was £10,000,000.  To-day it is over £25,000,000 and it is growing every year.  There is an almost illimitable demand for these products in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The manager of the company told me that they are exporting to Europe already everything they process in the line of vegetables and so on, and if they had far more, they could export it also.  He also informed me that they are buying up the products the small companies that started up in the poorer parts of the country are unable to sell. To suggest that State companies set up like that should frighten off the smaller companies is not right.  They should be complementary to each other.  That is an avenue in which there is opportunity for enormous expansion.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the sugar company on what they have done.  I do not see any reason why they should be forced to remain as a public enterprise or why the State should keep complete control of the company, provided they can stand on their own feet.  I know of a German <Col N="1043" /> company that was set up by public enterprise and turned over to private enterprise.  Recently, they were able to float a loan and buy out all the State capital that had been invested.  We should not have too much of a one-track mind in this House.  Where they find that private enterprise can do the job as successfully as anyone else, it is the duty of a Government, no matter what their political opinions, whether they are to the right or to the left, to let private enterprise function and take over.  That would mean that there would be more State capital available for developing other industries in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us if he was asked by any of the executives, any of the directors, or anyone concerned with the company, to issue this as a private flotation, and if he was, why he has not done so.  I should like to ask him, whether or not he was asked, to tell the House whether he believes that if it were floated as a private loan, the money would be available.  It is only fair to say that when they are paying a full dividend on all the paid-up capital invested in the company, they are a sound marketing proposition.  Many people would like to invest money in industrial holdings but they seldom get a chance of doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take another look at this Bill and, instead of guaranteeing the loan, he should let the company go ahead and do their own job, and he could then utilise the capital for some other purpose for which it may be more necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I believe that our farmers are capable of competing with the farmers of any other country in Europe or, indeed, in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any expansion by the sugar company is very welcome.  While the executives and the employees of the sugar company have been operating in the fields, their opponents have been operating over Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann.  So far as I know, that is where some or indeed most of the opponents of the sugar company have <Col N="1044" /> been operating.  The people who want us to believe that the operations of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann should be curtailed must have very short memories. The companies they are upholding, or trying to uphold, are very minor branches of British or foreign concerns which were sent here to make all the profits they could, as rapidly as they could, and to exploit our farmers to the greatest possible extent. That is not being done by the sugar company.</P>
    <P>The only criticism I should be inclined to make about the expansion of the sugar company is that I wonder if they are expanding along the proper lines.  They are too much inclined to expand their activities among the better-off sections of the community, and to ignore the requirements of the less well-off sections.  The executives of the company should remember&mdash; and the Minister in so far as he may have any control over them should remember&mdash;that in the west, and in many other of the poorer areas, there are large expanses of bog which are almost entirely free from disease.  As the sugar company are now deciding to launch out into new lines of production and development, they should try to exploit fully the bog resources of the west and the poorer areas.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the commercial point of view, there is a very important sociological point of view. There is, of course, the question of the huge populations in those areas.  If the sugar company were prepared to expand their activities into those areas, it would mean that there would be increased employment and consequently much less emigration.</P>
    <P>The question of the raising of funds has been dealt with in the proper way by the Minister.  I admit that private enterprise has played a certain part, but a rather poor part.  The part it has played has been practically entirely for the sole benefit of private enterprise, and the operators of private enterprise, and not for the benefit of the ordinary people.  That is one of the reasons I am very anxious to see that the attitude of the Minister is accepted.  The sugar company have set out to bring the greatest good to the <Col N="1045" /> greatest number while the operators of private enterprise have set out for the past 40 years to bring the greatest benefit to the smallest number.  Let no one have any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal of talk about the Common Market and the effects of our entry&mdash;if we ever do enter it&mdash; on private enterprise and on the activities of State-sponsored companies. I think we are far too inclined to cast aspersions on our own people and our own workers&mdash;and in doing so, let me say, on ourselves.  Our people are excellent workers.  Our farmers are as good as the farmers anywhere in the world, and what is still more important, our products are of absolutely excellent quality.  If we are not in a position to market them, and to market them profitably, something is wrong with ourselves, and something is wrong with the people in high places and not with our products or their producers.</P>
    <P>Our goods to be readily marketable and profitably saleable should be of a distinctive quality.  We should not be ashamed of their distinctive quality. We should not be always aping foreigners not only in their ways and manners but also by imitating their products instead of trying to put our own distinctive products on the markets of the world.  There is no reason, good, bad or indifferent, why the products of this country should not be readily saleable in the markets of the world.</P>
    <P>There is also no reason why a progressive company like the sugar company should not enter into other fields of production.  One field, in which we have fallen down particularly, is in regard to the marketing of fish and fish products, which are so readily marketable.  In view of the undoubted success of the sugar company in all the lines in which they have engaged, they should be asked to explore the possibility of developing our fishing industry to some extent.</P>
    <P>Any developments undertaken by the company should be based not only on what we think the Americans and the people of other countries require but on what we know the people of this country require.  Instead of pursuing <Col N="1046" /> the policy of the bacon factories, who will not give a taste of bacon to the Irish people, the sugar company should give a taste of their products to the Irish people and let them know what they are like.  If they did that, they would be going a long way towards getting the Irish people to help them out afterwards in any efforts they may make towards capturing markets throughout the world.  I have not the slightest doubt but that they will capture those markets, but in doing so they should not sacrifice the goodwill of the Irish people.  Where their products are of high quality, they should be as readily available to the Irish people as they are to the people of Holland, Belgium and the African countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the developments as a result of the extension of the activities of the Irish sugar company into other fields.  It is very welcome to see a new market for Irish agricultural produce, and that is the end of this piece of legislation.  The accelerated freeze-drying plant, as the Minister indicated, is the largest in the world and the first commercial plant in the world.  It is yet very much an experimental effort.  Public taste is an extraordinary thing.  Goods, which at first seem most attractive to a great number of customers, may not in the long run be the success it was thought they would be.  It appears that the products of the accelerated freeze-drying plant have been well received, but that is as far as we can go at this stage. We must express the hope that this happy state of affairs will continue and that we will get the sort of results for the Irish farmer that the Minister hopes for and that we, on this side of the House, hope for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain gaps in the information given to us by the Minister in his speech.  I should like to know from him what volume of vegetables and fruit the present plant will be able to handle, if we were in a position to sell the full production of that plant. Just how much money would the Irish farmer get for that produce, not only the total amount but the amount per unit per lb. of fruit, per stone of vegetables or per ton of potatoes?  That is <Col N="1047" /> very important.  It is true&mdash;and I say this in a spirit of constructive criticism &mdash; that farmers have been disappointed with the prices they got for some of the vegetables and fruit they have sold so far to the sugar company.  I would mention black currants in particular. There has been some disappointment. In view of our anxiety to see that the farmer gets the most out of this as possible, it would be wise for the Minister to indicate, if possible, what he thinks the farmer will get next year for the various produce the sugar company will buy from him and, if this plant can sell all its produce, just what volume it is capable of handling.</P>
    <P>We are speaking of a very high capital expenditure, and surely then we should have more details?  I understand that the instant potato-flake plant at Tuam has produced flake potatoes which, at the experimental stage at least, have been very well received.  It seems extraordinary in a country like this, where so many good ordinary potatoes are on offer, that the housewife would use this sort of product but I understand that in certain shops, where these flakes were experimentally on offer, they were well received and the housewife liked them.  If the taste is good, I am sure they will do well. Again, I would like to know what sort of price the farmers will get and what will be the volume if this plant at Tuam can sell all it can produce in one year.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;Furthermore Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann's ordinary sugar manufacturing business itself now stands in need of certain developments involving a capital outlay.&rdquo; Therefore, I think it is in order for me to discuss the ordinary activities of the company.  I want to discuss the price paid for beet.  I should like to see a higher price paid.  While I am not going to be entirely specific on this, there is some evidence that the variety of beet issued as seed to the grower, for resale back to the company, has not a high relative yield but has a very high sugar content.  If the difference on a sugar content of 16 per cent. is four per cent., it appears that 25 per cent. less beet has to be processed to produce an equal amount of sugar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> I understand that the type of beet which the Dutch farmers are allowed use gives a higher yield with a lower sugar content.  I have not exact figures, but beet is no longer a high profit crop.  The degree of labour there is in the handling of beet means it is not as attractive to the farmer as it was. But it is still attractive enough to mean that the sugar company get all the beet they want for processing.  At the same time, however, that matter should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have succeeded in paying their dividends and they have succeeded, I suppose, as an economic unit.  But we must also watch this question of what the farmer gets for his beet, not on the basis of what he will grow the beet for&mdash; because he will have roots in his rotation anyway&mdash;but on the basis of proper costings and on the prices paid for beet in Continental countries such as Holland.  When we make this comparison, it is not valid to make it on the comparison of cwt. for cwt. or ton for ton, but on sugar content for sugar content and yield for yield. That may be very detailed and it may be something that, in an assembly such as this, may be subject to certain window dressing of one sort or another.  If we are to make the sugar company more efficient by the injection of public capital, we should see to it that the primary producer is paid sufficiently.  If there are any statements the Minister would like to make on this aspect of the matter, I should be glad to hear them.</P>
    <P>Great play was made in some of the contributions to this debate with the question of public <i>versus</i> private enterprise.  Comparisons are probably always odious and the comparison of the sort made by Deputy Leneghan and Deputy McQuillan, is particularly odious.  Private enterprise has its place in the economy and similarly State enterprise has its place.  We must face this in an adult way.  It is no use to abuse private enterprise and private fruit-processing firms.  They have bought their fruit here, those of them that established themselves in this country, and have paid pretty well for it.  Most of the complaints I have <Col N="1049" /> heard have been on the basis that they will not buy sufficient fruit, that they have not the volume of sale that allows them to do so.  Most of such firms based here are supply industries for the provision of jams and bottled fruit and they supply the home market which is a very small one.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the debate has been befuddled in discussing whether public or private enterprise is the better.  I think it is obvious in this field that, if accelerated freeze drying is to be a success, we have backed a very successful horse in being first in the world.  Considering the amount of capital required, I do not think the venture would have been undertaken by private enterprise.  If the decision to go on with this project was made on sage and very detailed examination of the facts, then the investment was sound and solid but, in any case, it is one that would not have been made by private enterprise.  Therefore, I think those comparisons do not arise.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can indicate what sort of price the farmer is going to get for his vegetables, what sort of volume he will be allowed to sell, with similar details about quantities and prices of fruit based on the total throughout of the plant for one year, leaving out the question of sales and marketing, and if the Minister can indicate that there is any hope that we will get more money for our beet if we are going to put more capital in it, I would be very much obliged if he would refer to these matters when replying.</P>

      <P>It is very satisfactory to hear the echoes of the great, historic world debate between private enterprise and capitalism in Leinster House.  It is useless for the Deputy to talk about the undesirability of comparing private and public enterprise in Ireland.  It is no good trying to suggest it is odious to do so.  It is inevitable; it must be done because the whole future prosperity of the community depends on the decision we arrive at about the desirability of one and the undesirability of the other.  Deputy Barry was right when he said that when we started, in this State, we did <Col N="1050" /> not have a capitalist who was particularly interested in the funding of industries in any kind of large scale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to put words into the Deputy's mouth.  I thought that is what he said.  If he did not say it, he could have said it because it was true.  A considerable number of people did not want to invest money here in Ireland and the best proof of that fact is that some £600 or £700 million is invested outside. It is, therefore, a reasonable statement to make.</P>
      <P>The sad thing is that we did not accept that fact and have confidence in ourselves and in our own resources, in the capacity of our own people to provide raw materials.  In the first place, we had agricultural produce. Nothing would have been easier and there was nothing in which we were more expert or better able to do. Secondly, we could provide technicians and technocrats and we could provide capital.  In a tiny sector of our society, in the subsequent 30 or 40 years, we did that, but in relation to the public utility types of industry which were started because, of course, society needed power and fuel and forests and so on, which private enterprise was not interested in because, clearly, no quick profit could be got from it.  Also it has since been shown and proved that these industries were competently run with excellent efficiency on the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We criticise them here.  That is one of the great advantages of public concerns, that we, in relation to a number of them, are allowed to criticise them to a great extent which is more than can be said about the average private company or the ordinary company outside which does not depend on voted moneys for its capital.  So, while I disagree with the fact that Comhlucht Siúicre is a publicly <Col N="1051" /> funded company and that we do not have the amount of control over it which I think is desirable in a proper publicly-owned enterprise&mdash;I should much sooner see these companies both owned and controlled by the public or their nominees&mdash;I welcome the Bill and the advances which are to be made by Comhlucht Siúicre in this new field.</P>
    <P>One of the odd things about the debate which has continued in the world for the past 30 or 40 years and has continued here, to a lesser extent, is the jeering tone which used to be adopted towards this idea of the socialist organisation of a society in which you create these State companies. That was used in the pejorative sense and when, because they got bogged down in red tape and bureaucracy and were unable to make decisions, because of their inflexibility and lack of real direction, they became inefficient.  They were incompetent. Consequently, one did not get the best value for one's money.  It seems to me that that sort of criticism of the old idea of State companies or publicly-owned companies has taken a back seat.  We no longer hear it.  We no longer hear that Aer Lingus, for instance, is a badly run company; that it is beridden by red tape, stifled by bureaucracy and unable to make any decisions.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  Everybody is loud in his praises of this company. It is one of the few companies, other than the public utility type of company, which make a surplus.  It has had the courage not only to get into the home market&mdash;the irony is that it has difficulty in regard to getting into the home market&mdash;but also into the export market.  It is one of our few industries which has been able to do that.</P>
    <P>And so we hear less and less about the incompetent and inefficient State company.  We are now told that private enterprise is frightened of these companies and frightened of free competition. We used to be told that free competition was the dynamic of private enterprise.  The more we had of it the merrier.  The whole illogicality of this <Col N="1052" /> was borne out with the development of monopoly which decided the price of a commodity and the amount of profit that would be made.  The consumer was forgotten.  The consumer was the least thought of person in the whole operation.</P>
    <P>Now, as I say, we hear no more about this incompetency.  Instead, we hear about a poor little private enterprise firm which is so tiny that it should not be over-run by this State steamroller.  It all depends on what you think the purpose of Government and the purpose of politics is.  Over the years, we have repeatedly asked the various Minister in the Government about the possibilities of getting services for our people, whether in the sphere of education, health or the care of the old people.  We are always told that there is not enough money in the kitty and that we cannot afford it. That seems to me to be the important difference between the new type of concept of the organisation of a State and organisation for personal prosperity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said that no great fortunes were made.  I do not know what he calls a great fortune but a lot of money has been made by a few people in the past few years.  There is that personal objective of Government policy.  Then there is the other objective which we socialists believe in&mdash;the welfare of the community as a whole, national prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a defence of private enterprise.  I am merely trying to answer that.  I do not want to take any liberties with the House.  I <Col N="1053" /> think that was the basic debate over the years.  Private enterprise was organised in such a way that it could not give one million jobs in the past 30 years.  Private enterprise could not give better educational facilities to our people.  To that extent, it could be said to have failed the community.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, State companies of various kinds, some of which are better organised and established than others, have been particularly successful. I suppose the most successful have been Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Aer Lingus and probably Irish Steel Holdings.  They have succeeded more than any one else in dispelling the idea that the public could not organise industry as well as the old type aristocracy, the family groups which ran the old family firms in the old days.  In the same way, we, public representatives in Parliament, have shown that we can organise and run our affairs as well as and better than most of the old minority of aristocratic families which ran society here 50 or 100 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry suggested that if Deputy McQuillan was faced with a situation in his own constituency, where a State company would steamroll a tiny company, he would be particularly vociferous.  The sad thing is that in relation to the particular industry we are talking about&mdash;the food processing industry &mdash; every Deputy living in a rural constituency should have a part in it because the produce of the small farmer and the big farmer in each rural area should filter to such a food processing industry.  Because of the failure of private enterprise to develop efficient industries, they have not been able to absorb the potential of Irish agriculture.  The result is that they are only nibbling at a tiny part of it.  That is a result of the fact that they concern themselves nearly exclusively with supplying the protected home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the elimination of this dynamic of competition.  They have not <Col N="1054" /> gone to get competition in Europe, or even in Great Britain, to any appreciable extent.  They have not allowed any competition at home by means of the operation of restrictive cartels.  In consequence, they are grossly inefficient industries.  The whole idea of automation and mechanisation might never have taken place, as far as private enterprise is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is right that this State company should take over the role of investing in rural Ireland because, eventually, the money will go back to the farmers in rural Ireland.  Operatives will be employed in the different industries and the result is that everybody will benefit.  There is no question of steam-rolling a small company with nothing to replace it.  Our suggestion is that this company, operating extremely efficiently, will not concentrate on the home market will concern itself with creating great national wealth for the people as a whole by going into the export market.  By virtue of the fact that they can spend money on these new scientific advances in food processing methods, they can afford to allow us to go into the export markets with competitive prices.  As a result, they will make the maximum amount of wealth for our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of this debate on Wednesday last, I pointed out that we were opposed to this Bill because we believed the existing machinery was the most effective that we could find for the specific purpose for which it functions.  It is important to note that the function of the Agricultural Wages Board is not to fix agricultural wages in the same sense as a trade board fixes wages in an industry, because a trade board fixes the rate of wages to be paid.  The Agricultural Wages Board, on the other hand, fix the minimum rate of <Col N="1055" /> wages payable to an agricultural worker, with the proviso that anybody who pays an agricultural worker less than that minimum rate, commits a statutory offence.  In fact, I believe it to be true that the vast majority of agricultural workers receive a rate substantially higher than the minimum rates fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
      <P>The alternative proposed, as I understand it, by the promoters of this Bill is that the functions of the Agricultural Wages Board should be transferred to the Labour Court.  It is to be borne in mind that if this were done, wages agreements between employers and workers, when registered by the Labour Court, would become legally binding on all workers and employers of the same class, whether they were parties thereto or not.  In any particular area certain farmers might well be able and willing to enter into a registerable agreement which would be binding on everybody in that area, but many others in that area could very well find themselves wholly unable to pay the rates prescribed in the registered order.</P>
      <P>You could easily have, in the one area, very large farmers whose operations were substantially mechanised and whose workers would be paid on the basis that they were operating complicated and expensive machinery, whereas the small man who is employing perhaps one or two agricultural workers and is not financially circumstanced to instal the elaborate types of machinery his larger neighbour employs, would be simply excluded from the possibility of employing anybody at all.  The holding on which he depended might, as a result, become wholly uneconomic and unworkable as being too big for the man to work by himself and his family, and yet not big enough to permit of a rate of wages appropriate to the employment of the man who works elaborate machinery the capital cost of which he has not got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No system which has been devised by human beings could ever be presumed to be perfect and I am quite <Col N="1056" /> prepared to examine any proposals to improve the existing system if somebody had constructive proposals to offer.  However, I am bound to say that when I was Minister for Agriculture for two periods lasting for six years, I examined this question repeatedly with a view to improving the machinery, if that were possible, but could not devise any more effective machinery than at present exists for the purpose for which it is in existence &mdash;that is, the fixing of minimum wages. Everybody in this country wants, most especially the Party which I lead at the present time and of which I was a member when I was Minister for Agriculture, to see the standard of wages earned by agricultural workers brought up to the same level as that enjoyed by workers in industry.</P>
    <P>I do not conceal from the House, and I have never concealed from the country, my deep sense of dissatisfaction that agricultural workers should be working six and seven days a week for wages which, in many cases, are little more than half that paid for a five-day week in industry.  However, the plain fact remains that that is not the only comparison which gives rise to dismay on the part of all those who are concerned with the agricultural industry in this country.</P>
    <P>A more glaring comparison exists between the rates of wages prescribed as minimum wages in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the corresponding rates prescribed in this country.  I think there are minimum rates prescribed in England at the present time in excess of £8 per week for a shorter working week than that prescribed for workers in Irish agriculture. The only way I know of, in which we can attain the ideal of equating the rates of agricultural wages paid here with those paid in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is to get for the agricultural industry the same prices for our agricultural produce as the farmers in England and Northern Ireland can get for theirs.</P>
    <P>Until we get these prices, we cannot get out of agriculture, either for the farmers who own the land or for the men who work beside them for wages, <Col N="1057" /> the same standards as are enjoyed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is for that reason this Party has consistently declared itself as being in favour of entering the European Economic Community, because one of the fundamental purposes of the Treaty of Rome is to secure for farmers and farm workers a standard of living comparable with that enjoyed by those engaged in industry.  I believe that if Great Britain, Denmark, Norway and Ireland, adhere to the Treaty of Rome and become part of the European Economic Community, then we can look forward with reasonable confidence to the agricultural workers of this country, and the farmers who employ them, enjoying a standard of living equal to the farmers of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, France, and Germany as well.</P>
    <P>I hope we may live to see the day when farmers and farm workers in all parts of the world will have their labour recognised for its true worth and that those producing indispensable food will become entitled to a reward at least equal to those producing lipsticks and motor cars; but the plain fact is that so long as people are prepared to pay more for lipsticks and motor cars than they are for bread and butter, those who produce lipsticks and motor cars are likely to have a higher standard of living than those who produce the essentials of life.  That is not peculiar to those sections of the community which are engaged in production.</P>
    <P>It may seem incongruous that Elvis the Pelvis enjoys an income ten times as great as the Prime Minister of England and five times as great as the President of the United States.  The fact is that the public are prepared to pay more for the gyrations of Elvis the Pelvis, whether on the radio, the television screen or the gramophone disc, than they are prepared to pay for the wisdom, experience and fortitude of President Kennedy, Prime Minister Macmillan, Prime Minister Diefenbaker, Prime Minister Menzies, Chancellor Adenauer or even General de Gaulle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> If people are to live in a free society, within certain minimum limitations, they are entitled to make their choice.  Those of us who are prepared to surrender liberty, in the illusory pursuit of absolute equality, may contemplate legislation to eliminate the incongruities to which I referred. Those who take a longer view, and I think a wiser view, will recognise that the supreme good is that men should be allowed to live free.  So long as we reserve that right, we have to accept what seems to us incongruities in the reward available to those who produce the necessities of life as compared with the rewards available to those who manufacture and purvey the luxuries that an affluent society demands.</P>
    <P>Our aim on this side of the House is to work actively to procure for the farmers and for the farm workers of this country a standard of living no less than that enjoyed by the farmers and farm workers in any other country in Europe.  The proposer of this Bill has spoken with nostalgia of the wage levels obtaining in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>There is no good in longing for abstracts.  I believe this is a question to which a pragmatic approach must be made.  I do not believe in sitting down and crying for the moon.  We cannot pay our farmers the profits or our workers the wages, if our produce does not command the same markets as those in which these profits and wages are available for Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Our purpose is to put our farmers in a position to earn profits and our workers in a position to demand the wages appropriate to the common price level for agricultural produce which, I hope, will obtain throughout Europe when the EEC comes into being.  The arrival of that event will not relieve all our problems overnight. Given access to the opportunities which the Common Market will provide, <Col N="1059" /> there remains the necessity for our society to provide an adequate advisory service for the farmer in order that the maximum output of the land can be realised&mdash;and bear in mind that giving advice to people who cannot afford to take it is a very barren occupation.</P>
      <P>Therefore, our second duty must be, having provided the technical advice, to bring within the reach of the farmers, the credit to enable them to avail of that advice and credit on terms they can afford to pay.  For that reason, this Party urge, and will continue to urge, that where a farmer of this country is prepared to co-operate with the advisory service, and to use his land to the best advantage, he will have available to him up to £1,000 free of interest while he is carrying out the programme of expansion that is necessary to get the maximum return from the land for which he is responsible.</P>
      <P>Given the realisation of these two objectives, little of use is achieved unless we have markets in which to dispose of the consequential output. We believe that the EEC will make those markets available at prices which will yield the farmer a reasonable margin of profit on his work. That done, there remains the moral obligation on every man to pay the labourer the hire to which he is entitled by the work he does.  I concede freely that, though that moral obligation should and will prove coercive in the case of many employers, there may be those who forget their moral obligations in that regard and for that reason the trade union movement exists free and untrammelled in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a happy fact that, as of to-day, whatever may have been true of the past, all Parties in Oireachtas Éireann believe in the existence of a free and independent trade union movement. It is legitimate for social good that trade unions should exist to organise agricultural workers, where that is necessary, to ensure that fair rates of wages will be paid for the labour that they do.  Whatever trade unions exist, they cannot get equitable rates of <Col N="1060" /> wages for their members, unless and until those who pay them have the wherewithal to provide equitable rates of wages.  We want to see that done.</P>
    <P>We want to see a proper scale of minimum agricultural wages prescribed, on the clear understanding that that scale of wages is a scale below which it is a statutory offence to pay any man.  We want to see every farmer given a reasonable income for his labour, paying his workers not the minimum wage but the wage of which the worker is worth.  We want to see preserved in our society absolute freedom for the trade union movement to intervene between worker and employer in any case where employers seek to exploit their workers or, indeed, if it should transpire that workers sought to exploit their employers.  Bearing that dual burden of responsibility, the trade unions are a valuable feature of a free society.</P>
    <P>Keeping these principles in mind, we are not prepared to support the proposal put forward in this Private Member's Bill.  We shall be always ready to consider a charge in the existing machinery or any alternative machinery which would seem to us an improvement on the existing machinery.  Having studied the question I do not know of any practical alternative to the machinery we have, and unless and until that alternative is brought before us, I see no reason for changing the existing law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be little doubt in the mind of any responsible person who is motivated only by consideration of the facts and a genuine desire to do justice that there are groups of working men and working women in Ireland today who, due to their weak bargaining position, are not receiving a just wage or are not enjoying favourable conditions of employment.  Because of their weak bargaining position, this House has a duty towards these workers.  In a just society, priority must be given to those who are most in need and to those who are in a weak position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I suppose it could be argued that this measure is not the perfect and complete answer to the problem, <Col N="1061" /> at least it will have to be admitted that it is a great improvement on the present set-up.  Since I came into public life, I have listened at length to speeches about the flight from the land, the emigration of farm workers and the desire on everyone's part to do something for them, but they seem to be very easily forgotten when it comes to doing something concrete.  In the past 12 months or so, there have been various measures before the House to improve and to protect the farmers, measures which all Parties, including the Labour Party, have supported.  The only criticism which any Party offered of those measures was that they did not go far enough to help the farmers. Now this measure is brought in by members of the Labour Party to help the farm workers, and the lack of interest in it shown by both the two major Parties is very noticeable It is one section of workers about whom we hear very little in this House and apart from Questions this is the first occasion on which I have heard them mentioned here.</P>
    <P>What the agricultural industry needs is an army of well-educated, well-trained young men and women, dedicated to the welfare of the agricultural community and with the enthusiasm and determination to make it prosper, but under the present conditions this cannot be achieved.  We cannot attract to agriculture or keep in agriculture workers who wish to get on in life and to make a decent livelihood.</P>
    <P>One of the main objections to the Agricultural Wages Board is that it has power only to fix minimum rates and these rates are fixed having regard to the small farmer's ability to pay. What we seem to forget is that the minimum wage is hardly ever a just wage and were it not for the diligence and conscientious work of the inspectors under the Agricultural Wages Board, even those minimum rates would not be paid.  I should like to take this opportunity of paying a special tribute to those people, who have a very trying job to do and who do it very well.  It would be interesting to hear of the number of complaints these people receive but I know that they are kept very busy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> The Minister objected to the Bill on several grounds, one of which was that it would transfer to the Department of Industry and Commerce what is primarily his function There has been in existence for a number of years the creameries joint labour committee. The creamery industry relates solely to agriculture and solely depends on agricultural prices and all the rest of it. We fail to see why the Minister should object to agricultural labourers receiving the same facilities as their neighbours have in the creameries.  The wages of the man who milks the cows are governed by a body which has no power to set his conditions, while the man who goes to collect the milk and the man who takes it from him at the creamery can have their wages and conditions and hours of employment governed by a joint labour committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned that he had given this question a good deal of consideration when he was Minister over a period of six years.  While at that time it may have appeared to be the best way to deal with agricultural workers, we submit that, in 1962, having regard to the success of the joint labour committee in respect of other groups of workers, such a committee should benefit the agricultural labourer.  The same speaker also said he firmly believed less than ten per cent. of the employing farmers were paying these minimum rates, that over 90 per cent. were paying much higher rates.  I do not accept that for a moment.  There are a very few paying more than the rate but I repeat they are very few and far between.  He has also submitted that farmers must pay above those rates because otherwise men will not stay with them.</P>
    <P>In rural life as we know it, it is not very easy for an agricultural labourer to move from place to place seeking the highest price for his labour.  Probably, he has a cottage and, whether he likes it or not, he must take the job that is nearest and most convenient to his home.  He cannot move house from one county to another where a farmer might pay him more.  If offered a minimum rate of wages, he must accept it if there is nothing better available in the neighbourhood.  There is rarely a farmer who will pay more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> Even if we were to assume that a farmer would pay more, it would bring us back to making wage rates on the principle of supply and demand, which would be completely unchristian and unjust.  A wage should have nothing to do with supply and demand for labour.  A wage should be sufficient to give a worker a reasonable degree of comfort, to enable him to save for marriage, to rear and to educate his family.  It should be sufficient to allow him to enjoy his leisure hours.  That is the connotation of a just wage.</P>
    <P>There is the further aspect of agricultural employment that it is broken employment to a large extent.  A high percentage of farm workers are unemployed for some months of the year. In the building industry, that aspect of employment is taken into consideration when wage rates are being agreed.  For that industry, broken time is counted in determining the wage rates but, in regard to agriculture, that aspect of employment is ignored, despite the fact that a great number of agricultural workers are unemployed for a great part of the year.</P>
    <P>It was rather amusing to contrast Deputy Dillon's optimism in regard to agriculture in the context of the Common Market with the Minister's lack of confidence in the future for agriculture.  The Minister objected to this measure for the reason, in short, that the agricultural industry in this country would not be able to stand up to this measure, that agriculture has so many hazards to meet in the matter of weather, livestock diseases and so on, that it just would not be able to bear the obligations envisaged in this Bill.  That is a nice concept when we are about to enter the EEC.  It contrasts sharply with Deputy Dillon's optimism for the farm worker in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that a recommendation of the Labour Court would impose an unbearable burden on some farmers.  Admittedly, there are farmers who could not pay a labour court award.  There are farmers who could not pay even the Agricultural Wages Board rate.  These farmers are not <Col N="1064" /> employing and never have employed labour.</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy who can point to any recommendation of the Labour Court, or of a Joint Labour Committee, in which they have been guilty of making an award which was not just to the employer's side, of making an award which the employer would not be able to pay?  These Joint Labour Committees take into consideration every aspect of the industry under review and have never yet been guilty of making an award which the industry would not be able to meet.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident that the agricultural worker in this country needs an improvement in the way in which his wage rates are negotiated.  The necessity for a body such as a Joint Labour Committee to regulate the conditions of these workers is also clear.  Until we have contentment among agricultural workers and are able to attract well-educated and well-trained workers to agriculture we cannot prosper or make agriculture the success that we all desire it to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to have any practical knowledge either as a farmer or as a farm labourer but, as a member of the Labour Party, it is my duty to speak in support of this attempt by the Labour Party to give to agricultural workers the same rights as have been wrested by the trade union movement from the employers of this country.  It is an extraordinary thing to see the two big Parties combine in their wish and intention to deprive agricultural workers of that standard to which they are definitely entitled.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that within a few years we will enter into the EEC.  Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the main Opposition Party in this House, has said that when that time comes he hopes the agricultural industry will be able to give to its workers the wages to which he believes they are now entitled.  When that day comes neither Deputy Dillon nor anybody else will have any choice in the matter.  It will be a condition of joining the EEC that the wages and conditions will be available so that this country will not be a &ldquo;scab firm&rdquo; in the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> It will be no gratuitous thing that we are being offered by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>What this Bill intends to do is to prepare the way for our entry into the EEC conditions, to have the machinery, before we go in.  Just as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is gradually reducing tariffs, we hope that through this Bill, when it becomes an Act, we would succeed in raising wages and improving conditions so that when we would enter the EEC we would be entering on a level and at a point where the impact would not be too great for the farming community.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not merely an effort on the part of a group of Labour Deputies to declare to the public that they and they alone are interested in agricultural workers.  This Bill has been intelligently thought out because we realise that in a very short time if events work out as this country anticipates, we will be in conditions where we will be forced to meet competition at a certain level.  You will be compelled to have in the industry men capable of meeting that competition. The produce of each ordinary industry can well be said to depend completely on the ability of management and workers to combine to get the best out of the firm.  Why then in our principal industry, agriculture, do we relegate the working unit to the category of the lowest paid manual labourers?  I suggest it is ridiculous. It is absolutely essential that agricultural work should be uplifted from the rut in which it is, in which only the lame, the blind, the inefficient and the stupid are compelled to work on farms.</P>
    <P>Why is it that every day we hear the plea that no help is available?  It is because even county council work, which, goodness knows, is not attractive, is much more attractive to a worker in a rural area than work on a farm.  Work on a farm can be dignified and skilful; it is absolutely necessary work, a work in which any man could be proud to take part. Unfortunately the standard of employment, both from the point of view <Col N="1066" /> of wages and conditions, is so low that it attracts none but the worst.  I am no agricultural expert but in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Press,</i> General Costello, who is presumed to be an expert on agricultural matters, stated that the time is coming, and coming rapidly, when wages and conditions of agricultural workers must rise from their present very low level.  If General Costello, who is hailed as being an expert on agricultural subjects, can see that, how is it that the Minister and the Government and the Leader of the Opposition and Deputies behind him, can see fit to say that this effort should not be gone ahead with?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said that it was for a simple reason, that you cannot take more out of a pint mug than you put into it, that if the farmers have not got the money, they cannot pay it.  We all know that that is so.  What does the Bill say about the farmer having to pay more than he has got?  He spoke about registered agreements under the Industrial Relations Act, but I wonder does Deputy Dillon know how many industrial agreements have been written into the Labour Court register?  It is quite common in industry to find in one street in an urban area or in a city, two or three different firms working at different rates because of the fact that the Labour Court, in its wisdom, fixed on certain rates, or because the trade union movement, in its wisdom, agreed that special considerations had to be given to special conditions in industry. Is it not right to presume that if agricultural workers come under the Industrial Relations Act, the very same considerations and forethought, as Deputy Pattison said, will be given to the farmer who cannot afford to pay? Deputy Pattison forestalled me when he pointed out that this does not relate to the small farmer who is unable to pay high wages.</P>
    <P>Usually you find that the small farmer struggles along with the help of his wife or some members of the family, whether they are sons or daughters or relatives.  This Bill will have no effect upon them, other than, if anything, to improve their lot by <Col N="1067" /> making them more competitive in relation to the bigger farmer next door to them.  It is only the man who has hired help who will be affected by this Bill.  Usually where you find hired help, you can be sure that there is enough or more than enough, to pay the hired help taken in each year, from the sale of the farm's produce.  Should the widow of a big farmer who, because she has no male relatives, be forced to employ a worker, what is wrong with saying that the man who takes full responsibility for working that farm and producing the means to keep her in existence should get a minimum standard of living?  I see nothing wrong with such a demand and there is no reason why she should not be compelled by law to give that worker a standard rate of wages and a standard of conditions comparable with the best in industry.</P>
    <P>All this Bill seeks to do&mdash;and I know that Deputy Tully has gone over it in detail&mdash;is to ask for the right to bring farm workers under the protection of the Industrial Relations Act in the same way as industrial workers are brought under it, to give them the right to appear before the Labour Court, to make their case in public and to secure an award, if such is justified, and to set up joint labour committees, which have been in operation for years and which are the follow-up to similar committees in existence since 1909.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Pattison, asked, has there ever been a case where a joint labour committee has so fixed a minimum rate as to make it impossible for any person in industry to continue?  If there has been such a case, I am not aware of it, but I am aware that, if anything, joint labour committees have leaned over backwards to protect the most inefficient unit in industry.  We on the creamery committee have gradually been able to improve the conditions of people in the creamery industry and to bring them up until they are within sight of being level with those in ordinary industry. When we started, the position was impossible.  There was a 54-hour week which we brought down to 52 <Col N="1068" /> hours.  Then it became 48, and now it is becoming 45.  All that happened through pressure brought to bear under the Act under which we are now asking that agricultural labourers should be brought.</P>
    <P>As I say, I have no knowledge of the practical work, but I have knowledge of the fact that the farming community, no matter what wailing and moaning goes on, are hardworking, honest people, and a people who get a fairly good reward for their labour. I am asking that those who help them to get that reward should share in some part of it and, accordingly, I support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with some points raised on this Bill last week.  Deputy Treacy, speaking as reported at Column 750 of Volume 198 of the Official Report, said:</P>
      <P>... I visited many farmers in recent times and I was pleased to see the growth of modernisation, the rearing of hundreds of pigs, the rearing of cattle, all domiciled in most modern buildings with central heating, light and air conditioning. They are fed from granaries on a conveyor system and the refuse is removed by mechanical means. Nothing was spared to provide for the utmost comfort and health of the animals.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that, I have seen a farm worker, his wife and large family, living in a dilapidated house, sometimes in the middle of a farmyard among the animals and the manure, with no sanitation, no light, no heat and no ventilation. </P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Treacy is correct in what he states.  Agricultural workers are the first people entitled to cottages and I am surprised that a member of South Tipperary County Council has not seen his way to having these cottages provided for agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience as a farmer is that the farmer treats his workers very well and with the utmost kindness. The agricultural industry is the only industry in which employer and worker actually sit down together at <Col N="1069" /> the same table for meals.  I agree wages are not as good as they might be, but I deplore the remarks I have quoted because I do not think that situation obtains in any part of the country.  It certainly does not obtain in North Tipperary and I am sure it does not obtain in South Tipperary, either.  Forty years ago, the practice was to have a land steward working the land for the big fellow; he did not treat the workers as they should have been treated.  But the workers are treated well now.</P>
    <P>The ESB, Bord na Móna and CIE can increase their prices and their fares, if they increase their workers' wages.  If the farmer puts up the price of his crops, he is immediately cried down in the urban areas and elsewhre.  Deputy Kyne said the farmers are getting good prices.  I can tell Deputy Kyne that if a farmer buys young cattle at a very dear price, the chance of his having to sell them at a lower price is always there before him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>About what size farm is the Deputy talking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the 100 acre farm.  I work alongside my workers and I have always done so.  I will go home from this Dáil and go out to work side by side with the men I employ.  These workers do not have a wet-time card; they do not put in time until a certain hour of the day.  My only wish is that we could increase the agricultural labourer's wage to £10 or £12.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon says that if we go into the Common Market, we will be able to give the agricultural worker a better wage.  I hope that is true.  I deplore this allegation that the farmer treats his animals better than his workers.  That statement should not have been made here.  I think Deputy Tully will agree with me in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County council and other workers have superannuation schemes.  The farm labourer has nothing to look forward to except the old age pension and the county home.  I wonder would it be possible to have some sort of superannuation scheme for agricultural labourers?  This poor man sees others <Col N="1070" /> getting £4 10 per week superannuation and a couple of pounds in old age pension.  He has nothing to look forward to.</P>
    <P>If there are farm labourers working in the conditions described by Deputy Treacy, surrounded by animals and farmyard manure, it is the duty of Deputy Treacy to ensure that these are properly housed and I am sure South Tipperary County Council will be only too glad to provide accommodation for them.  The agricultural labourer has first claim on housing, and rightly so.  I hope we will see the day when these men will receive £9 or £10 per week.  They produce from the land.  Some are very skilled workers.  If we increase prices now to increase their wages, we will be cried down by the urban dwellers and by Labour Deputies representing the urban dwellers.  I hope Deputy Dillon's contention with regard to the Common Market will be proved right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem from the remarks that have been passed that the Labour Party are the only Party who want to see a change in the system of fixing, or attempting to fix, the wages of the agricultural workers. It is pretty clear, as far as the Government and the Fine Gael Party are concerned, that they are quite satisfied with the operation of the Agricultural Wages Board.  There may have been an impression created last week that the Labour Party, when members of the inter-Party Government, were satisfied with the system of fixing wages by the Agricultural Wages Board, but, at least twice during those particular periods of inter-Party Government, we showed our displeasure with the operations of the Agricultural Wages Board and the general treatment of agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I well remember on one occasion, when the Labour Party introduced a Private Member's Bill, designed, I think, to give a half-day to agricultural workers, whilst we were colleagues of Deputy Dillon in that Government, we had no hesitation in going into different Lobbies when the final decision was taken.  We had no apologies to make for that.  Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="1071" /> had no apologies for the point of view he expressed in his speech and in his vote.  I think he lauded the fact that our Government was such that we could agree to disagree on certain aspects of government and, in that particular instance, on our attitude towards agricultural workers, so no one need be under any illusion about the Labour Party attitude to the wages, conditions of employment and hours of work of the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Board has been established for quite some time. The Minister said it has been tried and has stood the test of time.  That may be his opinion.  He may believe it, and I am sure he does. That may be the point of view of members of other Parties, but it is not the point of view of the Labour Party, and it is for that reason that we want to see it changed. It seems obvious from the speeches of the Minister and Deputy Dillon that they are satisfied with the system and do not want to see it changed.  I think it inconceivable that a board which has operated in a certain manner for something like 26 years could be found to be so perfect in 1962.</P>
    <P>While everyone will be concerned about what has been described as the plight of the farmers; while everyone appreciates the hazards that have been enumerated by the Minister&mdash;bad weather, the uncertainty of markets, bad harvests&mdash;while we appreciate that the farmers are open to those hazards, spring after spring, and autumn after autumn; and while the agricultural worker is concerned for the general economic wellbeing of the country, he is and must be primarily concerned about himself.  A lot of lip service was paid to the agricultural worker during the time of the emergency. He was described as the person who had saved the country, the person who had provided our food, but we have done precious little for him since.  The Agricultural Wages Board has not been particularly helpful in that respect.</P>
    <P>We must come down to facts.  Let us have regard to the ability of the farmer to pay.  Let us be concerned about what Deputy Fanning mentioned <Col N="1072" /> a few minutes ago, the outcry there would be if the price of this and that commodity increased.  What the agricultural worker is concerned about is how much he will take home to his wife and family, and that is precious little in this year 1962.</P>
    <P>The minimum wage of an agricultural worker in group C is set down by the Agricultural Wages Board at £6 per week.  I do not think I need to recite a litany of items that have to be paid for in the normal household for anyone to understand how small a distance £6 per week will go.  From that, we must subtract the amount of money that is deducted for board by the farmer who is entitled to deduct money, if the agricultural worker gets his food at the farm.  In many cases, it means that an agricultural worker in group C is charged 6/6 per day. Assuming that he works a six day week, 39/- is taken from his 120/- per week, and he brings home on Friday or Saturday night £4 1s. per week.</P>
    <P>With all the excuses in the world, there is no reason why that system should not be changed.  With all the excuses as to the inability of the employer to pay, the plain fact remains that in a big portion of the country&mdash; and certainly not the poorest&mdash;the agricultural worker, perhaps a married man with four or five children, brings home £4 1s. per week, less insurance stamps amounting to a few shillings as well, so that in fact he brings home less than £4 per week.</P>
    <P>Many people have said: &ldquo;Well, there is nothing we can do about it at the present time.&rdquo;  We do not accept that.  There has been a lot of talk about the flight from the land and there has, in fact, been a flight from the land.  I would say that we will still have a flight from the land in years to come because the wages are not adequate, apart from the inability of workers to get employment.  We are in the second half of the 20th century and the agricultural worker wants to be dressed and fed as well&mdash;and have more or less the same amenities and amusements &mdash; as his counterpart workers in the villages and towns and cities.</P>
    <P>If we do not do something soon to <Col N="1073" /> bring up the income of the agricultural worker, we will find that there will be a grave scarcity of labour in the rural areas.  That would be a very serious situation for a country which expects that our admission to the European Economic Community will bring about a profitable time for the farmers and for agriculture.  If we have a scarcity of labour, and if our labourers have to work for the wages which have been laid down as the minimum by the Agricultural Wages Board, I do not think the rural areas and the agricultural areas will have the capacity to produce what it is expected we will be able to sell in Europe.  How could anyone be attracted to that work if the take-home wage packet of an agricultural worker is less than £4 per week?</P>
    <P>There is another factor.  The Taoiseach has said that many more industries will be established in the immediate future.  If that is so, and if the employees are absorbed in industries in the towns in which they are established, is it not logical that the man who is now receiving less than £4 per week as a take-home wage packet will be attracted into the towns where trade union wages are expressed at £7 10., £8, £8 10., or £9 per week? Therefore I believe that if the agricultural industry is to gear itself properly for entry into the Common Market, we will have to ensure that we have contented workers, or indeed, should I say we will have to be certain that we will, in fact, have workers.</P>
    <P>In his speech last week, the Minister thought it peculiar that the functions of the Agricultural Wages Board should be transferred to the Labour Court, or, in fact, as he said, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when the agricultural industry is his responsibility.  Of course the agricultural industry is his responsibility, but the transport workers go to the Labour Court and they are the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power.  The ESB workers go to the Labour Court.  The workers in the building trade go to the Labour-Court and it can be said that they are the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.  Some <Col N="1074" /> county council workers who would be the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and the local authority can also go to the Labour Court, and it seems that the Labour Court are quite competent to deal with their claims, whether they are in respect of wages, hours of employment, or conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it would not be possible to have the case of the agricultural workers heard by the Labour Court because they are different from the workers engaged in ordinary industry where there is uniformity in methods, materials and standards.  He said that agriculture was different, that conditions varied from county to county and from area to area.  Surely provision could be made for that? Surely there could be agreement on wages which would be peculiar to certain districts?</P>
    <P>The Minister also said there was a special relationship between farm workers and their employers.  We recognise that, but again they are not peculiar in that respect.  There is a special relationship between the shopkeeper and the one employee he may have &mdash; many shopkeepers have one employee &mdash; or the two or three employees he may have.  In many cases, they are regarded as being part and parcel of the family, but that does not prevent them, as members of a trade union, from going to the Labour Court and having their wages and general conditions fixed for them. That is not peculiar to shopkeepers. It happens in many spheres.  I will not say it is widespread in industry but there are many workers who are the sole worker for an employer and have rights, and avail of their rights, to go to the Labour Court and have their case heard.</P>
    <P>In a discussion such as this, great play is always made as to what the actual function of the Agricultural Wages Board is.  We are told that its function is to fix minimum wages.  I do not know where many Deputies who spoke in this House got their information or where they got this idea about the minimum wage.  I do not know a great number of farmers paying more than the minimum wage.  They <Col N="1075" /> honestly believe their only obligation is to pay what they call the standard wage&mdash;they never describe it as the minimum wage.  In their innocence or ignorance, they believe they fulfil all their obligations when they pay what is laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board, and is described as the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>I know there are some farmers who pay more than the minimum wage.  I know farmers who do not charge, as many others do, for the board and meals they give.  These charges for board and meals bear no relation to the actual wage the agricultural workers get.  There seems to be quite a contradiction.  According to the Agricultural Wages Board, a farmer is entitled to take 6/6d. a day merely to feed a man.  That amounts to 39/- a week.  If they are entitled to deduct 6/6d. a day to feed a man, is it unreasonable to suggest that if a man has a wife and five grown children he should be entitled to the same consideration and that the Agricultural Wages Board should be prepared to accord to him 6/6d. per day to feed the members of his family?</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that proposals made by joint labour committees had statutory effect, when registered.  He thinks that would be wrong in respect of the agricultural worker.  But under the Minimum Wages Order, it is legal and binding on farmers to pay at least that wage. I do not see what point is being made about the proposals in this Bill, therefore, in regard to the registration of an Order and its having statutory effect.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made with the ability of the farmer to pay.  The agricultural worker is, and must be, concerned about his own life, about his wife and family.  He has a moral responsibility to look after them.  The farmer has a moral responsibility to look after himself and his family.  If he is unable to pay, surely he has another method of trying to ensure he can pay?  The case should not rest entirely on the ability of the farmer to pay.  The cost of living for a man and his wife and four or five children <Col N="1076" /> should be the most important factor. If it is proved conclusively that the farmer is unable to pay, it is the duty of the community to put him into such a position that he will be able to pay, whether by increased prices or subsidisation, although I am not advocating that there is a case for subsidisation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court is not an institution that allows increases of wages up to the moon.  They always have regard to the ability of the employer to pay.  The Labour Court can be described as a representative body. You have there the representatives of the employers and the representatives of the workers and trade unions along with a neutral chairman. Regard must be had to the ability of the farmer to pay.  That can be done, not nationally, but by the various counties and districts.  At all events, I am sure the Minister will appreciate, as the members of the House will appreciate, that this is an effort by the Labour Party in a Private Member's Bill to change the system so as to ensure that the agricultural worker will get a little more in return for his labour than he has been getting.  It seems as if we have run up against a blank wall.  The Minister rejects the Bill out of hand and Deputy Dillon appears to do the same thing.  We have made a suggestion. It may not be a perfect suggestion, but after a period of 26 years the time has come to have a look at the machinery again, to try to devise some ways and means whereby one of the most important members of the community, the agricultural worker, will get a fair crack of the whip.</P>

      <P>For a while when Deputy Dillon was speaking here, I felt the ushers should issue a supply of wellingtons to the members of the House because it looked as if the crocodile tears pouring forth would swamp everybody here.  When starting to speak the other night, he asked me if I was surprised to find Fianna Fáil and himself, speaking as the chief spokesman of the Fine Gael Party, so close together on this matter.  My reply was that I was not at all surprised, <Col N="1077" /> that I could see it coming for years.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that Deputy Dillon's views on this matter have been even a little ahead of those of the present Government Party because, when he was Minister for Agriculture some years ago, he left us in no doubt at all as to what his views were on how agricultural workers should be treated. From January, 1949, a change was made: for the first time in many years, agricultural workers, by order of the Agricultural Wages Board, got a reduction of four hours per week&mdash; from 54 to 50 hours.  Deputy Dillon, the then Minister, was horrified.  To show that the Agricultural Wages Board could be interfered with, the necessary Orders were made to ensure that a 54-hour week would be reintroduced. The 54-hour week was reintroduced. It never worked, of course, because the farm workers were not that stupid; but it was reintroduced.</P>
      <P>According to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 19th January, 1949, Deputy Dillon, the then Minister for Agriculture, speaking at a meeting of Offaly County Committee of Agriculture, at Tullamore, had this gem about the Agricultural Wages Board and the change in the system.  He said:</P>
      <P>The recent Agricultural Wages Order, which abolishes the weekly contract in favour of employment exclusively on the basis of so much per hour, operated to turn every agricultural worker in Ireland, outside the North, into a casual labourer.  It was a thoroughly rotten system.  It meant that a farm worker could be laid off at the end of every hour, and would result in many men who were now in regular employment finding themselves working only broken time in future. He hoped that the Agricultural Wages Board would reconsider this most deplorable decision soon, and restore the weekly wage rate which gave the agricultural worker the security and dignity which were denied to the casual employee. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing about it was that even Deputy Dillon himself did not believe that.  He could not believe it because <Col N="1078" /> at that time the Agricultural Wages Board Order laid down a 54-hour week.  If a farm worker worked a lesser number of hours, he was to be paid one-fifty-fourth of his weekly wage for every hour he worked.  At that time a farmer could, just as he could subsequent to this change, tell a farm worker he did not want him at the end of any hour.  It is despicable that people should come in here and try to cash in on situations, such as we have arising under this Bill, in order to frustrate any hope the agricultural worker may have of improving his conditions.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant things here is the fact that from the two main Parties, the Minister spoke on the one side and Deputy Dillon from the Opposition.  In the case of Deputy Fanning, while I may disagree with him, I congratulate him on having the moral courage to stand up and have his say.  In my opinion, the reason that nobody else took part in the debate&mdash;except from the Labour Party benches&mdash;is that they might not agree with the views expressed by the leading spokesmen.  Possibly people who live and work with agricultural workers might have a different point of view from that put by the Minister for Agriculture or by Deputy Dillon of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>I can understand Deputy Dillon's viewpoint because I am quite sure he never did what I did.  He would not have the same point of view if he had worked as I did, as a hired farm labourer.  I know what it was to have to depend on a farm labourer's weekly wages.  I know what it was to have to depend on the conditions given to you by farmers when you are working for them.  I am quite sure Deputy Dillon never had that enlightening experience.</P>

      <P>He did not try this one. It would be too tough.  The question <Col N="1079" /> of the farmer's ability to employ and pay farm labour was argued, I thought, convincingly from these benches and the point was made, clearly, I believe, that we are not asking the small farmers to pay higher wages because the small farmers do not pay any wages to anybody.  Most of the really small farmers are working for hire themselves.  Those who are able to work their own farms and make a living out of it&mdash;good luck to them, if they can do it&mdash;have a tough time.</P>
      <P>Here are the facts laid down in the National Farm Survey of 1957-58. Nobody will quarrel with these figures and say they are not correct.  In this survey, the number of farms taken into consideration is 59,066 and of those, 7,152 are in the over-200 acre category. It is stated in the survey, and it must be true, that the average number of people employed on those farms is 2.25 units or in other words 117 weeks' work for a farm labourer in each twelve months.  When everything is paid for&mdash;to use the survey's own wording: &ldquo;Farm income is what remains after all farm expenses including wages and half the cost of the family car, etc., have been paid for&rdquo;&mdash;the average amount which each of these farms earned was £38 12s. per week and in Leinster, £42 13s.  Those are the official figures and yet we are told these people are not able to pay more than £6 7s. per week for hired labour for 50 hours.</P>
      <P>Let us go a little lower.  Deputy Fanning said he was in the 100 acre farm class and we find that there are 21,930 farms of between 100 and 200 acres in the country.  They employ .97 units, equivalent to 50 weeks' work for one man.  This may be something many people do not realise.  The average income per farm is £26 15s. per week, clear of all expenses, including the wages of that man, all the outgoings and half the cost of the family car.  In Leinster the average is £27 7s. per week.  Again we are told these people cannot afford to pay wages any higher than £6 7s. in Leinster or £6 in the remainder of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> In the 50 to 100 acre class, there are 52,270 farms.  They have only .41 units of hired labour or 21 weeks' work for a man and the income average over the whole country was £16 14. 0.&mdash; for some peculiar reason the Leinster average was exactly the same.  The 30-50 acre farms have eight weeks' work for a hired man and the average net income is £10 17. 0. per week and in Leinster £11 6. 0.  In the 15-30 acre class, there are three weeks' work for a hired man and the average income is £7 5. 0. per week and £8 0. 0. a week in Leinster.</P>
    <P>This brings out what we have been arguing all through this debate, that the small farmer cannot afford to pay wages and does not employ anybody. The big farmer who does employ men is well able to pay if he wants to and the only thing stopping him is the natural desire of everybody to hold on to as much money as possible and to get labour done as cheaply as he can.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a few remarks which were not quite accurate.  The Federation of Rural Workers, of which I have the honour to be secretary, he said had only a few hundred permanent members.  I do not know what he meant by that.  It is a fact that farm workers in the main are not organised the reason being&mdash;and the figures I have given here make that clear&mdash; that the men are scattered all over the country in ones and twos on farms. It is not easy to organise.  Despite this the Federation of Rural Workers have a wide, healthy farm workers' organisation. Where the organisation is active, they have succeeded in forcing farm workers' wages very much higher than the minimum rate but there are very many areas where they are not organised and those workers, in my opinion and in the opinion of the Labour Party, are definitely being taken advantage of by the employers.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said, almost in the same breath, that there were 50,000 hired farm workers.  It is hard to estimate what the number of hired farm workers is but one very good way to do it is this.  We all know what the agricultural grants are, the grants for which people apply for a <Col N="1081" /> rebate of their rates if they have somebody employed for 12 months of the year.  On 30th October last, the Minister, in reply to one of the questions which he objected to answering today, or said that he did not like replying to it, gave some information which I pass back to him now.  According to those figures, the permanent farm workers, as far as the information given to me shows, numbered 31,929, less than 32,000 in the Republic of Ireland on the most recent date for which figures are available.  There seems to be a discrepancy of some 18,000 between the figures which the Minister had and the figures which he gave me as recently as a couple of weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that the joint labour committees would not suit the agricultural community, that they were only for well-organised industries.  I want to point out that the Trades Board Act of 1909, which established the forerunner of the joint labour committees, was established for the sole purpose of having fair wages paid in industries where there was little or no organisation. The joint labour committees have followed on from that.  Very many industries which are organised, and which are dealt with by the joint labour committees, have very little organisation, even very much less than what the agricultural industry has here. Apart from anything else I think that knocks for six the Minister's argument about the right of the agricultural community to have their case heard by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to something which I think is a very strong argument. Local authority employees, Bord na Móna employees, hospital, dairy and creamery employees and many others have the right to go to the Labour Court, air their grievances and have rates of pay and working conditions fixed by the Labour Court and the joint labour committees.  That being so, I do not know what argument is left to the Minister against the agricultural community or the farm workers having the same right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was commenting on the extraordinary manner in which this whole question is being discussed and the suggestion by a number of members of the Opposition that in some way or another, the proposal by the Minister would seem to suggest that where the State puts behind the enterprise its financial resources, it was in some way acting unfairly and that a publicly-owned organisation, when it competed against private enterprise, was taking advantage of the size of the private enterprise and in that way was doing something not quite creditworthy.</P>
      <P>What the Deputies do not seem to understand is that in this issue very serious repercussions are involved.  In the case we are talking about, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, for instance, the very fact that the Government came to the rescue of private enterprise food-processing here in Ireland may have saved the private fortunes of the handful of people involved in the industry because it does not concern the worker.  The worker gets as much, and possibly more, working for a State concern.  He is not affected.  The only people affected are a tiny minority who might be run into the ground as a result of the competition of the State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a handful of people are put out of business because the enterprise is a tiny and inefficient one which has failed to use automation or mechanisation or failed to develop its markets, that is only the concern of a minority. Restricting the right of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to operate in the home market has had repercussions on a very much wider scale where the public are concerned.  The end result of this restriction has been that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have been prevented from going into the market. The result is that the public are denied access to presumably a better product&mdash; otherwise, private enterprise would not be frightened of it&mdash;a cheaper product <Col N="1083" /> and a good quality product and, broadly speaking, a more competitive product than that of the private company. If it were not more competitive, this howl would not go up from the people that they would not be able to stand up to competition from the State-owned company.</P>
    <P>This is very much more serious than Deputy Barry's suggestion that a few people might lose their industries and might consequently go out of business. It is quite wrong to suggest that the minority might lose on this.  An operative in the industry could not lose.  The industry has to go on.  As a consumer, he also gains.  It is a particularly retrograde fact that a publicly-owned company such as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann were called upon by their own Government to restrict sale to the public of a better or more competitive product in order to save the private incomes of a minority of individuals.  It is, of course, a criticism of the fact that the public has not been truly represented by successive Governments which have operated in our society over the years.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that it is not fair for this State company to compete against the private company is treating the whole matter in a completely frivolous way, as if the whole business were a kind of game in which we did not play fair because we produced a more experienced team in some sort of football match, boxing match or some other kind of match.  It is not that.  It is a very serious thing, indeed. The difference between these two points of view represents the difference between a national income of four per cent. going up to nine, ten or 11 per cent.  The difference in that as far as the public are concerned is the greatly improved standard of living which would result if we were to extend the scope of the public company on the lines of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is not our fault if the private enterprise company has not expanded and if it has not mechanised itself and provided the money with which to <Col N="1084" /> buy the equipment to make itself competitive, not only on the home market but also on the foreign market.  The failure in this industry is particularly regrettable because the food-processing industry, above all others, was a natural from the point of view of development by our Governments since the State was formed.  It is a natural for the reason that it was based on rural Ireland and on the agricultural produce of rural Ireland. If these industries had been based 20, 30 or 40 years ago on the general principle of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, we would now have a magnificent industrial potential instead of the appallingly inept type of industrial infra-structure of which we have heard repeated indictments.</P>
    <P>The obvious advantage of having the raw materials of one's own industries should surely be self-evident. Instead of that, we have these other absurd industries which, as we have been told recently, in many cases will have to cut down the number of persons employed by as much as one-third or, in some cases, completely close down altogether.  The really regrettable fact is that this whole development did not take place 20 or 30 years ago.  Political leaders, through the television, radio and newspapers, tell us that we are ready to get up and at them as far as competing with allcomers in Europe is concerned.</P>
    <P>Most of us believe that to be a completely absurd proposition but it is made by the Government, Government spokesmen generally and their various economists.  We are told that we can stand up to open competition from the Germans, the French, the Italians, the Dutch, the Danes and the British.  At the same time, our own State-owned company, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, are not allowed to interfere with the home market, to compete in the home market because it might put the home market out of business.  Deputy Barry, who apparently has some expert knowledge, supported that point of view.  He said the State company would steamroll our tiny food-processing industries into the ground.  He is probably correct in that, but then where is the truth?  If we are rearing <Col N="1085" /> to go, as the Taoiseach keeps telling us, if we are ready to go into Europe to compete against all these various countries with their <i>expertise</i> and their technological know-how, equal to the best in the world, how is it that we are not equal to poor little Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, our own State company?  Why is it we cannot stand up to that company if we are ready to meet the giants of Europe?</P>
    <P>There is a transparent contradiction in all this.  I believe there is a transparent dishonesty in it all.  It, of course, is based not on any acceptance by the Government that a State company is superior in its operations, or more efficient in its administration or in its tendency, to go and look for business and to try to get the optimum measure of efficiency in the enterprise, but to the Government's fear of those whom they are anxious to protect in the food processing industry here.  Naturally the consumer suffers in the fact that he is clearly getting a less competitive commodity.  The small farmers suffer in so far as they have been too damned lazy to get into the high level of efficient production over the years when they have had protection in order to maximise production.</P>
    <P>The result of that is that we have really quite a limited amount of production going into these limited factories because they have restricted their output to the relatively tiny home market.  In our consideration of markets, we must remember that at the moment two out of three people in the world go to bed hungry each night, and think of that unlimited market.  In face of that, let us remember that private enterprise here over the past 30 years has made no serious attempt to get even the one-hundredth part of the market of a small part of a province of India, Ghana, the Middle East or Nigeria, so desperately in need of consumer goods.</P>
    <P>Instead of that, we have operated behind our tariff walls.  Behind them we have insisted on restrictive trade practices which have fixed the prices for the consumer against which he has no protection whatsoever.  I do not know what the political leaders think their functions are in society, whether <Col N="1086" /> it is to protect a wealthy minority, their industries and profits.  That must now come to an end when we enter the Common Market because we will meet competition which we never had before, but at the same time it has meant here that there has been, first of all, exploitation of the consumer and, secondly, a failure to develop export markets which would have doubled, trebled and even quadrupled our national income over the years.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it is the superiority of the public company in relation to agriculture, demonstrated in the magnificent marketing systems, the magnificent organisation of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in the supply of seeds, of fertilisers at attractive prices, the zoning of its growth, the certainly of the price, the guarantee of market and outlet, that provides the best example of how markets should be exploited. Nobody can reasonably object to that approach to the question.  Anybody who knows anything about the turkey producer or the person growing vegetables, or the egg or pig producer, anybody who knows anything about our own Dublin city market, could not help knowing the absurd, chaotic marketing conditions for the sale of potatoes, cabbages, cauliflower, and the uncertainty of the producers' market.</P>
    <P>If there is a glut, the bottom falls out of the market; if there is a shortage the consumer cannot get food, and this idiotic marketing system has been allowed to meander on, year after year, because people like Deputy Barry have a sentimental attachment to the out-of-date economic point of view of private enterprise.  This continued adhesion to something which has been completely discredited, even in our own country, is much too costly.  A number of people have been able to make it operate successfully but it has failed in 99 cases out of 100.</P>
    <P>The only tiny sector which was allowed to go into this part of agricultural production, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann&mdash;CIE and other such State bodies are merely public utilities&mdash; are clearly outstandingly successful in practically every sphere of their <Col N="1087" /> activity, and the more one examines their marketing processes, their buying and selling processes generally, the co-ordination between them, the public and the farmers, and the end product, the more one finds how outstandingly superior they are to anything in private enterprise.</P>
    <P>There is another factor in connection with public enterprise as distinct from private enterprise and that is that all the money goes back into the enterprise.  It ideally should go back to continue to finance it, to continue to finance its expansion and re-equipment or to reduce prices.  It is clearly very superior to the idea in private enterprise, where the surplus is distributed among a number of people who do not have to work for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde and the Minister did mention away back the suggestions that public companies, once they were going concerns, should put their shares on the market and then that most of them should be bought out by wealthy members of the public and that the money thus liberated could be used for other purposes &mdash; that public money advanced by the Minister for loans could be liberated for other enterprises.  That sounds very attractive and plausible but it leaves aside the argument that one would spend all the public money as very high risk capital in adventures of one kind or another.  I do not see why public money should be spent in that way.</P>
    <P>If we have put our money into various companies and enterprises, into Aer Lingus or Irish Steel Holdings or Bord na Móna or Forestry, we have done it because we were allowed to do it by private enterprise who saw it was not a profit-making enterprise in the first place, who saw it was a very tough nut to make anything out of, because it was a very difficult administrative or technical job to do. If we put our money into these enterprises and if we make a success of them, we should see that they are retained, so that their benefits may continue to flow to the public in the times of their prosperity, so that as soon as the cream appears on the <Col N="1088" /> milk we do not allow it to be skimmed off for stock exchange speculation. The ideal arrangement is that we take these risks with State companies so that when they produce a surplus that surplus will be realised by the public in the form of lower prices and improved social services of one type or another.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde also made the point that we had not the money in private enterprise for this type of accelerated deep freeze type machinery that would be required to carry out the process.  That is probably typical of what has gone on in the private enterprise food processing industry in Ireland over the years because too much of the money has had to go in dividends.  Anybody who reads the annual reports of Crosse and Blackwell, Batchelors and the other firms, who issue their reports every year, will see the colossal amount of money which has to be handed out in the form of profits of one kind or another. The shareholders expect dividends.</P>
    <P>Public money is put back into a public concern.  Therefore, it is possible for a public company to keep up to date with reorganisation, re-equipment and modernisation of its industry without looking all the time towards the annual general meeting and fearing criticism from shareholders.  They are able to reinvest their capital all the time.</P>
    <P>I suppose that that probably explains why, over the years, Irish food manufacturing industries, have not made the progress they should have made.  CIO reports make it clear that in all the branches of industry they have investigated up to the present there has not been reinvestment in industry.  The result is that we are grossly underequipped. In many cases we are equipped with grossly inefficient, out of date equipment of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>We have not invested sufficiently in industry in order to create work for people, jobs for people.  The result is that we have a whole lot of derelict farms throughout the country which are not producing goods, vegetables, agricultural produce of one kind or another.  If the food processing <Col N="1089" /> industry were operating at its optimum, these farms would contribute towards creating a demand which probably could not be met, even if every acre were producing to its total capacity.</P>
    <P>That is why it is no good to suggest, as Deputy Barry or Deputy Donegan suggest, that these private enterprise firms should be kept as sorts of pets that we should pay for them.  They are too costly pets.  We cannot afford them.</P>
    <P>We are entering a very highly competitive society in which a man shall be judged not on the fact that he is a friend of somebody, that he lives in my constituency, that I knew his father or that his firm is a good old family firm.  He will be judged on the quality, price, availability of the product and the certainty with which he can fulfil orders.  These are the completely acid tests of success and represent the difference between prosperity and general debts.</P>
    <P>In some ways I am opposed, as everybody knows, to the general idea of the Common Market.  However, I suppose that in some ways it will be a benefit, in so far as it will bring this moment of truth home to Irish industry. The fact that they have operated in a sheltered atmosphere for the best part of 30 years will make them now most unlikely to be able to face serious competition from outside.  To the extent that it will expose that position for the first time, I suppose it is a very desirable thing that it should happen.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Minister can continue, as he appears to be Continuing, to restrict Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in the way he does, in the light of his statements on the readiness of our society to enter into the EEC.  It is good to know that, even in one tiny sector of our economy, there is prosperity and that we may be able to create at least one competitive industry.  It is even more heartening to know that that particular industry happens to be the only industry&mdash;outside forestry of fisheries or whatever it might be&mdash;based on the natural produce of the countryside and the seas around the land, and that it is the most intelligent industry we <Col N="1090" /> could develop in a field, which, regretfully, over the past 40 years we have so much neglected by leaving it to private enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this Bill.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have been giving a wonderful lead to Irish industry over the years as a State-sponsored body.  Let us cast our minds back to the war years and to the period just after the war when we had to encourage people to grow sugar by offering half a cwt. of sugar to each person who grew it.  The sugar factory in Tuam was just barely able to keep going on the amount of beet it was getting.  We have now reached the stage when it is getting more beet than it requires.  In such a situation most industries rest on their oars but Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have never been such a firm.  They always have ideas about expanding and going ahead and trying to help the farmer in any way they can.</P>
      <P>When they had a surplus of sugar a few years ago Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann realised they required a market for it.  At that time, fruit growing was beginning to develop and we had a surplus of it.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann decided to go into the fruit processing business.  It was a help to the farmers.  It provided an extra market for their produce.  In addition, it helped Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  For each ton of fruit that is preserved, 1¼ tons of sugar are required.</P>
      <P>It was that idea of helping themselves and helping the farmers that has made Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann what they are today.  Their workers are always happy.  You very rarely hear of a trade dispute for the simple reason that the company explain everything to their workers.  They show them how they are getting on. They discuss their problems with them. They have the same approach so far as the farmers are concerned.  There is the Beet Growers' Association and, as the produce comes in representatives of the farmers are there to see to it that fair play is given to the farmers.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy think it fair under these circumstances <Col N="1091" /> to prevent Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann from having access to the home market to the limited extent of 10 per cent., in the light of all he has said?</P>

      <P>They have been helping the farmers in every way possible. The beet industry has proved a great industry and a great help to them. When Comhlucht Siúire Éireann were looking for fresh markets this year, they made a new agreement with England in relation to getting more sugar in there.  I grant that England has seen the red light, so to speak. England saw that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann were buying unprocessed sugar on the continent of Europe at world prices which I might call dump prices and England thought it would be a good idea to get agreement for the purchase of her Dominion sugar on a long-term basis.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann are always looking to the future.  At the present time, the company is thinking of expanding its machinery in the factory where there is one slight bottleneck that would hold up an increased output of sugar.  It hopes to have this in process next year, so that the same amount of time will be devoted to the beet campaign.  If more sugar is produced and if there are increased acreages in respect of next year's beet contracts, does that mean the beet campaign will be prolonged? No farmer likes pulling beet in the months of December and January and that would be the outcome of it.</P>
      <P>It is a number of years since the company introduced the Armour lifter. It has been developed to such an extent that a company has been set up in England to handle the exports and there is not a beet-lifting competition in England that it is not able to win at the present time.  It is able to beat all the foreign beet harvesters and it is this determination to produce the best that has made the sugar company what it is.  It is grand to see it is looking for more money to expand because it has certainly shown its worth in what it has done up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the company to go into freeze-drying was a very big step. <Col N="1092" /> Although we are only starting to see the results of that, it gave the company world-wide publicity.  There was not an industrial magazine that did not carry it; even periodicals like <i>Reader's Digest</i> had articles about the freeze-drying outfit that had been installed in Mallow.  The company realised it was a good project and has no fears about selling this produce as it comes on the markets of the world. Bringing this extra money into the country is a great benefit.  This freeze-drying means that the produce can be put on the pantry shelf and left there for a couple of months and when somebody comes in unexpectedly it can be taken down and consumed after water has been put on it.</P>
    <P>It is hard to outline everything this company has been doing over the years.  It is looking for perfection.  It realises, as all industries here must come to realise, that we must export the best because we are competing in world markets.  I saw recently at the company's factory that it was canning vegetables.  This is a line which has been showing good results.  It has meant increased contracts for the farmers and when their produce is exported it will bring money into the country.  Seeing how much good work this company has done over the years, I recommend that it should get the support of the House.  If we had many more concerns like this Ireland would be a very wealthy place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Sweetman started with an anachronism. Whatever the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, may have said in 1932 about white elephants, this company was started in 1933.  The first point raised by Deputy Sweetman was that of allowing private investors to put money into this new company. The Bill does not prohibit or exclude that.  In fact, in the talks with the board of the sugar company, we both agreed&mdash;I think I can say the company agreed&mdash;that growers should be encouraged to invest in the new company. It may of course go further than that and if the company advocates that it should get subscriptions from others as well as growers, I cannot see any great objection to it.  If it <Col N="1093" /> does not suggest it, perhaps we shall have a talk about it and see if something can be done in that way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman also asked what the ADF process is.  I do not understand the science of it but I am told there is a difference between it and deep freeze.  In deep freeze the article is frozen and kept under frozen conditions. In this case it is first frozen, dried in vacuum and then stored in a dry state; it need not be kept under frozen conditions.  It has this great advantage, as I can say having had an opportunity of testing some of the products, that the product preserves its original flavour when it is reconstituted; it goes back to what the fresh fruit or fresh vegetables were like before going through the process.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also said he did not like the idea of a subsidiary that would not be under the control of this House.  The Deputy is slightly in error there because this subsidiary will be controlled in the same way as the sugar company itself.  All finance will have to be provided by law.  Whether it collects some of that finance from private sources or from State sources, it has to be authorised by this House; and, secondly, the company will be approved by the Minister for Finance. Therefore, we have practically the same control as we have in the case of the sugar company.  The accounts will be submitted to this House.</P>

      <P>Section 4 deals with loans and Section 5 with guarantees. There was some confusion about them. Deputy McQuillan raised the question of the company being prohibited from competing on the home market.  This has been a matter of controversy for <Col N="1094" /> some time back, although only a few have taken part in the controversy. When the company started out on this food processing it agreed after discussion with the Department of Industry and Commerce, and with my Department to some extent, to confine its home sales to ten per cent.  Of the ordinary lines where it is in competition with companies already there.  It must be admitted that the State would not put money into a company such as this, if it were merely to compete on the home market where the home market was already fully supplied.  It was only on the plea that it was going to build up business for export that the State agreed to put money into it. The new company is, therefore, principally interested in export business and it is only interested in putting its wares on the home market in order to test the market and to give them an opportunity of, perhaps, improving their process in the early stages.</P>
      <P>In the case of products that are not manufactured here, of course, they are quite free to put as much as they like on the home market, for instance, their instant potatoes.  There is no restriction as far as they are concerned, because no other firm here is producing this commodity.</P>
      <P>It is true that the companies they are competing against were small companies, some of them Irish and some of them subsidiaries of foreign companies, but all, as far as the law is concerned, Irish companies and all, as far as I know, formed under the Control of Manufactures Act and I am quite convinced that it is a good thing that we did that, because it at least gives an assurance to any foreigner who may be coming along here now to start company, that if he starts a company here, we will not at some furture time wipe him out with State money.</P>
      <P>Of course, if we enter the Common Market, all this thing goes because the foreign produce will be allowed in here and our produce, of course, will be allowed into the Common Market countries and there will be equal conditions for both the sugar company and its subsidiary and for the small companies already in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Dr. Browne gave us their views on State enterprise versus private enterprise. I am quite sure they are in favour of State enterprise in principle, not in this case alone, so I will expect in future that we will have their sympathy when we are being attacked for CIE or any of these State-sponsored companies whose affairs come before this Dáil.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Corish what exactly we expected from this new company with regard to the fishing industry.  They are not very long in the processing of fish and they have been engaged principally in the processing of shellfish.  They have had good success and I am told they are now in the position of putting their product on the market and marketing it in the ordinary commercial way.</P>

      <P>It is too soon, however, to give any great forecast about what might happen with regard to fish because they are getting fish only in small quantities, only trying it out. They believe they are successful and are now trying it on the commercial market and we will have to wait and see how things go.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish also asked for what purpose would the sugar company itself want more finance.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, like other companies, and other producers in this country, are looking forward to what might be regarded as Common Market conditions. They know they will have to compete on an equal footing with sugar producers in the other countries of Europe and, for that reason, they will need to renew a good deal of their equipment over the next few years and to make extensions and they will need money for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> They are also, as Deputies are aware, producing more sugar now than they did in the past because they have got some small amount of foreign markets for their product and that means more working capital is necessary than they had to provide before.  So that there is a necessity for more money for Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  When these Common Market conditions come, there will be a price for beet.  Every country will have to pay the same price for beet and then our sugar company here, paying that price for beet to the farmer, will have to compete with the other countries of Europe who are paying the same price for beet in their countries.  It will mean, of course, they will have to be efficient and competitive but I have no doubt they will be able to compete in every way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan, for instance, said he would like to see a better price for beet.  I suppose we all would, but we will have to fall in with whatever price is the fixed price or the agreed price for the countries of the Common Market generally, and will have to be satisfied with that price, whatever it may be.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde asked about the amount of capital we are putting in.  As I mentioned when moving the Second Reading, we are taking power&mdash;this is an enabling Bill &mdash;to put in £3 million more as capital, in either the sugar company or the new vegetable company, whatever it may be called.  We are taking power to put in £5 million by way of loan as working capital, or by way of guarantee. That is as far as we go at the moment but, as I said this evening at the beginning of the debate, if our hopes for this company materialise, I do not think that provision will last very long&mdash;perhaps a couple of years &mdash;and then it will come before the Dáil again for attention.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leneghan said that we have excellent workers in this country, that our farmers are as good as can be got elsewhere and that our produce is first-class.  I agree with all of that, and I agree with him also in his conclusions, that we should have no fear that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, having these conditions at their disposal, will not be able to compete against all comers.  I am sure they will.</P>
      <P>Deputy Donegan asked what volume will be covered by this new company, what will the farmers' total income be, and a few questions of that kind.  I am afraid I cannot answer his questions in full.  After all, it must be remembered that that part of the sugar company which is dealing with processing has not been long in operation and is growing fairly rapidly.  For that reason, it is difficult to give any sort of forecast as to what the volume of production will be next year or the year afterwards.  The present output of fruit and vegetables is about 175 tons a day, which is a fairly substantial quantity after such a short time of operation.  Total sales to date exceed £300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have not, as far as I know, pushed their sales very much because they thought it wiser to have stocks in hand before they pushed sales in any particular market.  I mentioned <Col N="1098" /> already that there were about 4,500 acres under fruit and vegetables last year for supplying the factory. Another figure which I have is that in the Tuam potato factory, they paid £10 a ton to the farmers but it must be remembered that that £10 a ton was for the whole crop.  There was no sorting of potatoes, the whole lot was brought in and all were paid for at that rate.  There is no doubt a very big capacity, as I say, for the processing of fruit and vegetables and farmers will be encouraged to grow more and more.  They have not got nearly enough potatoes in Tuam&mdash;I was down there only about a fortnight ago &mdash;and in other processes they have not got enough either so that there is great room for expansion as far as the farmer is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It might changes the trend of potato growing, which has been downwards for years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I heard that they were going to get potatoes in the Tuam factory, I thought they could not have hit on a more suitable crop for Connacht because at least they know how to grow potatoes there.  I am sure they would be prepared to grow more.  They can take quite a lot in that factory and they will be able to confer benefits on quite a number of farmers in reach of the factory.</P>

      <P>Section 2 deals with free postal facilities arising out of Parliamentary duties and when I stated on the Second Stage that it was largely the country member who would benefit, the Minister said that Dublin members, will also get these facilities. Compared with country members, they will get &ldquo;buttons&rdquo; because many city Deputies meet their constituents and do very little letter writing.  I meet 300 people a week but I do not write 20 letters.  The reverse might be the case for Deputy Burke in County Dublin.  We represent the city areas in which all parts of our constituencies are within a threepenny or sixpenny bus ride.  People come to us in great numbers&mdash;they do not have to write to us&mdash;or they may telephone us.  In the country, because of the extent of the constituencies, people cannot afford to travel back and forwards to Deputies and perhaps find them out when they arrive.  Therefore they write to them.</P>
      <P>I just want to correct the Minister on this.  As far as the majority of Dublin Deputies are concerned, they will not get peanuts from this except that some members may use it for business purposes but if they do, it will defeat the whole purpose of this amenity.  I want to emphasise again that Dublin members will get little or nothing out of either sections of the Bill; otherwise, I have no objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide statutory authority for the increases in pensions and allowances under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1962, outlined by the Minister for Finance in this Budget Statement earlier this year.  The increases are already being paid on foot of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions approved by this House on 18th July, 1962.  They are effective as from the 1st August, 1962, except in the case of pensions and allowances granted under the Army Pensions Act, 1962, where the effective date is the 4th August, 1962, the date on which that Act became law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is in the same form as a number of previous Army Pensions (Increase) Bills.  I realise that Deputies may find it hard to identify readily all the types of cases to which the various sections refer.  It may, however, help the House if I say that the Bill covers every category of pensioner and allowance holder for which the Army Pensions Acts provide.  At the Committee Stage, I can go into more detail in respect of any individual <Col N="1103" /> sections about which Deputies may care to ask.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the increases approved by the Minister for Finance for State pensioners generally, officers who retired before the 2nd November, 1955, and whose pensions are related to their Army pay on retirement have had their pensions brought up to the rates hitherto appropriate to officers of similar rank and service who retired on the 2nd November, 1955, and the pensions thus arrived at have then been increased by a further 6 per cent.  The pensions of officers who retired on or after the 2nd November, 1955, and before the 16th December, 1959, have been increased by 6 per cent.  Pensions not related to pay&mdash;and they make up the bulk of disability pensions&mdash; married pensions, further pensions and allowances to widows, children and other dependants have been increased by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Special allowances have been dealt with by way of a flat £13 increase in each of the &ldquo;appropriate annual sums&rdquo;.  As well, all the social welfare benefit increases granted as from 1st August last or to become payable next January, except one-half of the increases in disability benefit, are being ignored as means.  These include the very substantial increases in contributory old age pensions and additional allowances for wives or dependants. Increases in military service pensions, disability pensions and Connaught Rangers pensions are likewise being ignored as means.</P>
    <P>On current expenditure the estimated cost for a full year of the increases for which the Bill provides is £127,000&mdash; £50,000 in respect of disability pensions and allowances other than special allowances, and a net £77,000 in respect of special allowances.  I might, indeed, mention at this point that, on current expenditure, the total estimated annual cost of the Budgetary increases in the various pensions and allowances payable by my Department is of the order of £328,000, and I think it is true to say that these increases, which are substantial, have been very well received.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> This Bill is solely to provide for the Budgetary increases.  It may be well that I should say that I have been examining certain suggestions made in recent times for the amendment of the Army Pensions Acts in other respects &mdash;for instance, with regard to the difficulties that arise in some cases as a result of the requirement that a pensioner should have died as a result of his pensionable disability as a condition for the payment of allowances to his widow and children, and also with regard to marriage dates and the dates of birth of children.  I take a sympathetic view of the representations that have been made about such matters but, as will be appreciated, the provisions complained of have been in existence for a long time, and in considering them, there are points both for and against.  I can only say that I am looking into these matters very carefully as well as sympathetically, and I would ask Deputies to be patient while I endeavour to bring the examination of them to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>If Deputies require any further information about the provisions of the Bill, I shall do my best to supply it when closing.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount now asked for under this Bill is already being paid and we have to be thankful for what we can get.  I am glad the Minister is examining the question of death from disability as a condition for the payment of allowances to widows and children.  I have a motion down dealing with this, and allied matters.  In the circumstances, I think the best thing I can do is to leave over the remarks I should like to make on this matter until we come to debate the motion which, I hope, will come on at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is grave dissatisfaction because of the non-payment of pensions to widows of officers and men who had disability pensions and who, in a great number of cases, died as a result of injuries received.  It was to those injuries that the disability pensions were related.  As I said on a previous occasion, it would appear now that we have reached the stage that, if a certificate issues that death is due to <Col N="1105" /> heart failure, or some cause other than the actual disability, that is taken as evidence that the person did not die from the disability.  In that set of circumstances, what we would really need is a post mortem examination and I am convinced that that is a situation this House never intended. It does not apply in the case of widows of Ministers, or such people. Why it should apply in this particular case is something that puzzles me.  I think it was intended at all stages that the widow of a person who had a disability pension should have that pension paid to her.  However, the Minister says he is looking into the matter and, as I have said, we will have an opportunity of discussing it in more detail at a later stage.  I can only say now that we accept this measure as a part payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill because we believe it is only doing justice to old soldiers and their dependants.  However, there is one comment I should like to make. The Minister and his officials should realise that as the years go by, the number of those people is getting smaller and the result is that the number of people who are able to certify is getting fewer.  Quite a number of people are being held up because of lack of certification.  I should like the Minister to have a look at that because it is a grave hardship on the people concerned.  It is no use telling them that it will be quite all right and that eventually everything will be straightened out.  Eventually, many of them will die.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have another look at the question of certification. Twenty, 30 or 40 years is a long time and memories can be a bit shaky after a period of 40 years.  I think the Minister will agree that if he gets certification, it should be sufficient without putting these old people to the trouble of trying to dig up practically everyone who was associated with them to establish their right to a pension. Perhaps that is not directly related to the Bill but it is something to which the Minister might usefully bend his efforts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy MacEoin, I feel that the Minister also appreciates the fact that the question of the extent to which the cause of death could be attributed to the injury which entitled a person to a disability pension is becoming an administrative monster.  I am quite certain it was never the intention of anyone that it should become in any way a bar against a well-merited continuation of the pension for the immediate relative. I would suggest that the Minister knows, as indeed I think all of us know, that on the question of certification of death, particularly in modern times, unless the pension was specifically related to it, there was little possibility that the certificate would show anything relating to wounds received some very considerable time before.</P>
      <P>It is a generally accepted principle in Acts of this nature, particularly in the Workmen's Compensation Act, that it is sufficient to establish that the disability was a contributory factor to, or an accelerating factor in, the death.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should simplify the investigation by a simple amendment that would say that once the paying official was satisfied that the disability for which the pension was payable was a contributory factor to, or accelerated the death, that was sufficient.  An amendment of that nature would put the position right.  To the Minister's knowledge, to Deputy MacEoin's knowledge, and to the knowledge of anyone interested, this is one of the sore thumbs remaining in the whole structure of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Tully, I think it is good to see some measure of justice now being given to these people.  My complaint is a simple one.  I do not think it is enough.  Of course there are so many commitments on the national purse that it may be that this was as much as the Minister was able to get in the present situation.  At least, I will pay the Minister the compliment of saying that I think he is as enthusiastic as his predecessor and any of us who have the interests of these people at heart, and that he will keep knocking at the door, and perhaps, as time goes on, he <Col N="1107" /> will get a little more for this section of diminishing returns.  I should like to see a pool of money available, and conserved, so that when people fall out, a little more is available to increase the benefits for those who survive. Whether or not we are prepared to admit it on all sides of the House, those are the people to whom we owe the freedom of the country and our right to participate in this Parliament. Surely there is no one to whom we should be more generous than to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>In company with other members of the House, I welcome the additions to these pensions, but I am not satisfied that justice has been done to everyone.  I have expressed my opinions here every time I have had the opportunity, and my mind always goes back to those people who never received a button, the people who served throughout the Tan war and who were alleged not to have given service.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that pensions can be granted only to people who served, and it goes on to say that service means &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  I wonder what the State would call the other service, in other words, the service of those who actually took part in combat but were not considered to be serving, or so they say?  They certainly did not serve for the purpose of getting a pension, or gratuity, or compensation.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary thing that without them the fight would have been a failure.  One of the reasons why the Republican side in the civil war was a failure was that they had no reserves, and as the men were gathered up, there was no one to take their place.  For all practical purposes in the latter stages of the civil war the IRA did not exist.  If it were not for the reserves standing by in the Tan war, the same would have happened, because the enemy would soon have found out that there were no reserves except a few columns here and there.  They would soon have been surrounded and there would have been no Truce in 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, those men got no recognition. <Col N="1108" /> If I give the case of two brothers, the Minister will realise what I am driving at.  There were two brothers who served during the Tan war.  They did not do any shooting but they served, and they took part in the Civil War.  They served long terms of imprisonment, went on hunger strikes, and lost their jobs.  One of them had to go away to the wilds of Canada.  He went on some free scheme; he was used, and he came back just as &ldquo;broke&rdquo; as he had been.  Their careers were destroyed and they never got a penny.  There were thousands like them who never got a bean and what justice was done for them?  None.  There was no justice for them because they did not shoot someone in the Tan war, although they served in it.</P>
    <P>I want to bring the Minister's mind back to such people.  While I do not advocate pensions I think they should get some compensation.  There should be some scheme in which people who served long terms of imprisonment and lost their jobs would get some sort of compensation.  There are probably about 10,000 or 15,000 of them and I would ask the Minister to make provision for them even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints that members of the Casement Brigade were not recognised and were not entitled to medals, although the Connaught Rangers are recognised.  It is a well-known fact that those who decided to join the Casement Brigade underwent terms of imprisonment and during that period they received no service pay.  Quite a considerable number were at a financial loss.  To my knowledge, a great many of them got nothing and were refused a service medal.</P>
    <P>Old IRA men ought to be able to go to some military hospital for treatment. We are becoming fewer now.  Whatever excuses there may have been at one time that the hospitals would be overcrowded, henceforth that argument cannot be made.  The State should look after the health of Old IRA men, especially medal holders.</P>
    <P>I understand if these men have disability pensions attributable to injuries sustained in service, they can get certain grants, but if the disability <Col N="1109" /> pension is attributable to injuries aggravated by service, they get no grants.  It is most unfair to have any differentiation.  If their injuries were as a result of service, whether direct or indirect, they should be assisted in the matter of getting surgical appliances where such are necessary.  I have protested on behalf of those who have never got anything, but at the same time, I welcome the benefits for those who have been fortunate enough to receive them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise matters concerning two special categories of retired Army officers.  Before doing so, I should like to say I welcome the news in the Minister's speech that he proposes to review certain aspects of the Pensions Acts, particularly the one that has given rise to very great hardship, which I believe was never intended, namely, the question of whether a person suffered disability attributable to Army service. Because of the lapse of time between the date of contracting of the disability and subsequent examination by medical authorities, undoubtedly there have been cases of hardship.  I do not believe it was ever intended that the Pensions Acts, as framed, should have worked in that way. Undoubtedly, at least the initial causes could be traced to service, either during the Emergency or service at a particular period.  However, the news that the Minister will look into that will be generally welcomed. I have no doubt we are most anxious that whatever defects there are in the Acts should be remedied in order to alleviate any cases of hardship that have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other points to which I wish to refer concern two separate groups of officers.  The first group consists of a small number because, due to the date of retirement, quite a few have since died.  A number of acting commandants were retired between the years 1946 and 1951.  Because those officers held the acting rank of commandant, they received the Defence Forces pension appropriate to the substantative rank of captain.  As the rank of commandant was only a <Col N="1110" /> temporary rank, the IRA pension appropriate to each case was that based on the substantative rank of captain.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, there are at present only about a dozen of these officers left.  Although some of them had quite considerable periods of service in the acting rank, because of the fact they were not substantative they received the pension appropriate to the rank of captain.  All these officers had IRA service and had rendered not merely loyal but efficient and conscientious service over a great number of years.  I believe there is a strong case for reviewing that position.</P>
    <P>The other category are the group of officers who were retired under a regulation made by the Minister's predecessor.  All these officers had IRA service and were entitled to the extra year.  Subsequently, when that year was increased by a further two years, a few of them served for the two years but the majority were denied the two years and were retired.  After the matter was considered, it was decided they would be granted pay and allowances appropriate for the two years that they should have served had the amendment not been made to the regulations.</P>
    <P>Initially, that seemed reasonable enough treatment, because they were paid the salary and allowances appropriate to the rank for the two years. But, since the date of the retirement, in the case of a number of these officers there have now been three or four pensions increases and also salary increases.  The result is that, since these officers were retired earlier than they expected because of the regulations, their pensions are based on pay at retirement.  Consequently, they find that officers who filled the same position, some of whom have since retired, now enjoy pensions substantially higher.  I know of some of these cases and the amounts the officers in question have lost range from £2 a week to I think in some cases, something like double that.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that was ever intended. I believe that the Government cussed here, recognised an injustice at the time, after the matter was dishad <Col N="1111" /> been done and decided to allow them full pay and allowances for the two-year period they would have normally served.  In the meantime, salary and wage increases occurred and the officers who were serving at that time and who retired subsequently now enjoy a higher rate of pension. All the officers I have referred to would not have been entitled to the extended period unless they were in possession of a service medal or had full IRA service.  These officers&mdash;now numbering about 50 and becoming fewer each year &mdash; have certainly suffered and continue to suffer the injustice of not having received pensions at the same rate as the officers who served in a similar rank and retired subsequently.</P>
    <P>I want to urge the Minister, in considering the two categories I have mentioned, to consider that the sum involved would be comparatively small in relation to the total annual pensions Vote and that the effect on the income of the individuals concerned would be, for them, quite a considerable amount.  I believe it was never intended that the regulations should operate in this way and that, in considering this question of the amendment of the regulations, this matter should also receive sympathetic consideration so that remedial measures can be taken to provide these men with the same increases as would allow them to have pensions appropriate to a similar rank of officer retiring at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better deal with the other matter first, as Deputy MacEoin was first off the mark about it.  Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Collins also dealt with the same subject, the question of certifying the cause of death of people who have been in receipt of pensions.  If a man is in receipt of a wound pension assessed at 20 per cent. disability, say, and lives for 40 years, it is not easy to conclude that his wound disability caused his death.  That is how the matter has been put to me on medical considerations.  On the other hand&mdash; and this is the reference I made towards the end of my remarks&mdash;if a man has had a very serious disability, say, 60, 70 or 80 per cent., and has lived for 40 years after receiving the wound, again the medical view is that it is not ordinarily possible to prove that his death was caused by that <Col N="1113" /> disability.  Nevertheless&mdash;and this is the meaning of the remarks I made in reference to it&mdash;his disability was so great that it must have affected the course of his life and the provision which he might otherwise have been able to make for himself and his family.  It is that aspect of the question which I think deserves the further consideration I am giving to it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the certification Deputy Tully spoke about, certification of service, what can we do but rely on those who were colleagues of the applicant at the time when the service was given?  If the recognised certifying officers have died, we go to others in the locality who might be presumed to have some knowledge of the services given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But usually two should be enough.  You should not have to go around to everybody until you get somebody who says: &ldquo;It is not correct; he was not in it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not confine ourselves to two, although if we got two good officers with a good record themselves to certify, it might be reasonable enough to accept their views on the applicant, but we have to go further afield and it often helps the applicant. Some doubt may exist about the type of certification given and we then try to get further information, if we think, in fact, that the applicant has some merit in his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very difficult question, as Deputy Tully pointed out, and with the passing of time, it becomes more difficult. We try to be sympathetic towards the applicant but surely Deputies will recognise we must take every precaution to ensure that people who do not deserve recognition should not get it.  We know the amount of dissatisfaction caused when people who have given no service manage to get letters and representation made and probably slip through.  The knowledge that they have succeeded causes an amount of ill-feeling among those in the locality who gave good service and knew the neighbours in the area who also gave good service.  If they see somebody who did not deserve it getting <Col N="1114" /> recognition, they think, at least, there is maladministration.</P>
    <P>There is not a great deal to be said about this Bill, which gives legislative authority for increases which have, in fact, been paid since 1st August and which were announced in the Budget. I am afraid I cannot say very much about active service on this Bill. Deputy Sherwin spoke about that, but we are dealing very largely with the administration of the disability benefits and, in any case, the time is past for the making of applications for certificates of military service under either the 1924 or 1934 Acts.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned hospital treatment.  This may be given to disability pensioners who have not yet been given a final award.  Applicants for special allowances are occasionally brought to St. Bricin's Hospitals for their further examination.  If all Old IRA pensioners were to have the right to hospital treatment, we would not have sufficient hospital accommodation to deal with them.  That is a limitation also.  It is not through lack of sympathy for Old IRA men who are in bad health but simply because there is not the capacity to make hospital treatment available to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned a matter about which I am not very clear, the case of a man having the substantive rank of captain in the Army who retires while he has a temporary higher rank.  His complaint is that the temporary higher rank is the one which should be recognised for the purpose of measuring his pension.  Is that it?</P>

      <P>Yes.  The IRA pension is on the substantive rank.  These men were temporary commandants. Then they retired as acting commandants. Because they were only acting, the IRA pension is based on the substantive rank, which is captain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave also referred to a number of officers who were granted two years' extra service because of their Old IRA service. They were required to retire and in lieu of the two years' extended service, were given the equivalent of two years' pay.  I think the Deputy was making the case that this extra two years should be recognised for their pension. Is that not the point?  We had this before.  I understand that the decision is based on an old-established and what I am told is an invariable principle, that a pension may not be granted except for actual service given and that this suggestion of recognising a notional period would be quite a novelty and would upset all pension thinking in the public service.  That is the main objection that has been put to me in relation to this matter.  In any event, the officers concerned did get the two years' pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>By an arbitrary order of the Minister for Defence, these men were compelled to retire.  They had the right to serve on for a further period.  If they had served on, they would have got the normal increases that came, plus the pension based upon the two years and the increases. I do not think it can be argued on the basis of its not being usual.  This is the sort of thing that can never happen again&mdash;it is for this period and for this particular type of service.  These officers had the particular type of service which gave them the two years' service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the fact that they were given two years extra indicated that they were coming near their retiring time.  I understand that there was a good deal of dissatisfaction because of the lack of promotional prospects for the younger officers.  That was the motive behind it.  In any event, I do not think I could promise Deputy Cosgrave that I could undo that now.</P>

      <P>Again, it is a good example of the type of case I mentioned. <Col N="1117" /> A man gets a wound and lives for over 40 years afterwards and has been working during that time.  I admit this man has been in and out of hospital but here is a case in which there is not a medical certificate that his disability was, in fact, the cause of his death.  When that is the position, the Minister's hands are tied.  However, it does have reference to the remarks I made about considering certain aspects of disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In that particular case, the applicant refused to recognise the State up to a very late date.  Had he recognised the State and applied for his disability under the 1923 Act, he would have got 100 per cent. disability.  He did not and did not apply for a disability pension until long after 1932&mdash;I am putting it that way&mdash;and he then is allowed his disability.  I know the person&mdash;I was in prison with him.  I know the wounds he got.  While he was in King George V Hospital, now St. Bricin's, his life was not worth very much.</P>

It is a disgrace that some of them were allowed to die in workhouses throughout the country. It would not cost the State a lot to deal with these people.  The Minister, being a Connacht man, should be big enough to extend proper recognition to these men.

As a result, they suffered gravely, some of them being executed and some dying in India.  The remains of some of those men are still in India and I hope the Government will assist in bringing them home.  A similar group of men who were not on active service at the time&mdash;they were prisoners of war in Germany&mdash;also rebelled against authority.  They were Casement's Brigade.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme 1962 prepared by the Minister for Defence with the consent of the Minister for Finance under Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, and Section 4 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, <Col N="1123" /> 1938 and laid before the House on the 10th day of March, 1962, be confirmed.</P>
    <P>This scheme is made pursuant to the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1957.  Under the terms of Section 4 of the Act of 1932, it will not come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by a resolution of each such House.</P>
    <P>Unlike the superannuation code, there is no provision in the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme for automatic increases in retirement benefits proportionate to increases in service pay.  When an increase in service pay is granted, therefore, it is necessary to amend the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme to provide for proportionate increases in the retired pay, pensions and gratuities of retired or discharged members of the Defence Forces who, before retirement or discharge, had enjoyed the benefit of the pay increase.</P>
    <P>The pay increase which led to the making of this amending scheme came into operation with effect from the 1st February, 1961.</P>
    <P>The scheme contains eight articles. Articles 1 to 4 set out the title, the conditions for its coming into operation, the application of the Interpretation Act, 1937, and the definition of certain terms used in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Increases in retired pay of officers and in gratuities for married officers who retired on or after the 2nd February, 1961, are provided for in Articles 5 and 6.  The increases are in proportion to the increases in the pay of officers granted with effect from the 1st February, 1961.  I should explain that the percentages shown are the percentages to be added to the retired pay or gratuity as calculated under the original scheme of 1937.  It will be seen how the original rates have increased over the years.  The percentages now shown exceed the percentages in the previous scheme to the extent necessary to give the appropriate increase in relation to the increase of pay.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Articles 7 and 8 for increased pensions, married pensions <Col N="1124" /> and gratuities for non-commissioned officers and men discharged on or after 1st February, 1961.  The increases are likewise in proportion to the pay increases granted with effect from 1st February, 1961.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw particular attention to the fact that the increases provided for in this scheme are consequent only on the Army pay increase of 1st February, 1961.  A further increase in pay was granted with effect from the 1st November, 1961, and the necessary amending scheme to provide increased retirement benefits appropriate to the November, 1961, pay increase is also awaiting the consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>This is a motion to give effect to a promise made, and as such, I think we must approve of it. I am not sure whether this is not the Order that covers the cases referred to by Deputy Cosgrave.  I think it is the Order that leaves these officers without the increased pensions they would have received had they been allowed to serve for a further two years.  I do not hold any brief in particular for them but I would mention that they are Old IRA officers who rendered very great service to this country.  I am glad to say that that service is recognised by all now: I do not intend to make any point about it.</P>
      <P>When the Minister says, as his predecessor said, that the junior officers were taking offence at the retention of these officers for two extra years, I find it very hard to believe.  I do not believe there is a serving Army officer who is jealous of those who made the position possible for him. Whatever the reasons for the Minister's predecessor's withdrawal of the privilege which a previous Minister and Government granted them, I think it was not done in good taste. The withdrawal of this privilege of extended service means that these men lost the increased pay and gratuity they would have received, had they served the two years, and they lose the pension as well.  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, the sum involved runs to £120 or £130 a year.</P>

      <P>I have a brief which says they did not get the increase they should have got.  I stand to be corrected on that, but one thing is certain: they did not get the pension to which they would be entitled.  I realise that if this Order were to be amended, it would hold up and delay payment of the pensions to those who qualified.  However, I do suggest to the Minister that he should take steps to rectify the position.  It cannot happen again and it will mean that justice will be done and, what is very important, a sense of grievance will be removed.</P>

      <P>I agree that nothing can be done about it at present but I am hoping to see the Minister bringing in a proposal to give a decent pension, to alter entirely the pension structure. As it stands, the amount of pension received by people who retire from the Army does not encourage young people to come into the Army.  The fact that people leave the Army at a relatively early age does not remedy the position at all because these people, having spent 20 years or more in the Army, find that they do not fit easily into civilian life and that there is no readymade job for them.  The result is that when they come out, they depend for a considerable time on the labour exchange and on what they get by way of pension.  The pension is entirely inadequate and the Minister ought to consider that before he brings in another proposal of this kind.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this scheme is to provide for proportionate increases in the retired pay, pensions and gratuities of retired or discharged members of the Defence Forces who, before retirement or discharge, enjoyed the benefit of the further increase in service pay which came into operation with effect from the 1st November, 1961.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this scheme is to provide for the Budgetary increases in retired pay and pensions.  The <Col N="1127" /> increases are already being paid on foot of the Supplementary Estimate for pensions approved on 18th July, 1962.</P>
    <P>The increases are similar in nature to those provided for in the other measures already considered by the House.  Retired pay and pensions are brought up to 2nd November, 1955, level in the case of those retired before that date and are then further increased by 6 per cent.  Those retired on or after 2nd November, 1955, receive an increase of 6 per cent.  Pensions in respect of widows and children of officers are increased by 20 per cent.  There is also an article dealing with the special case of an officer who joined the Garda Síochána after retirement from the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>As I understand the Bill, it is intended to be all-embracing. It seems to me that may not be so under Section 1 and I should like the Minister to look into it.  It is specifically stated that hotels which are registered are included but the section defines a hotel as &ldquo;an establishment which provides or holds itself out as providing sleeping accommodation, food and drink for reward for all comers.&rdquo;  It occurs to me that a guesthouse or some other establishment which is not registered under the Tourist Traffic Act and which, at the same time, the Minister had intended should come within the framework of the Bill, in fact will not come within it, if it takes the simple precaution of putting up a notice in the porch to say it reserves the right to refuse admission or entry.  It would seem to me that if they do that, then the position is that <Col N="1128" /> they can say: &ldquo;We are not holding ourselves out as prepared to take all comers because we are reserving the right to refuse entry.&rdquo;  I should just like the Minister to examine that point.</P>

This Bill sets out to regulate the relationship obtaining between a hotel proprietor and his guest.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental notion here is that we have certain types of establishments which up to now were known legally as inns and which from now on we propose to call hotels. These establishments are such that, by their very nature, they hold themselves out to receive anybody who comes along.  Once they do that, we proceed from there to say: &ldquo;very well; if you are that type of establishment, you are going to be subject to certain obligations and liabilities and you are also going to get certain privileges and advantages; but, if you are not that type of establishment, then this Bill does not concern you at all&rdquo;.  The Bill is concerned only with the relationship between a guest of this type of establishment and the establishment itself.  If regulations have to be made about guesthouses, lodgings, etc. then that is a matter for Bord Fáilte, perhaps, or the Department of Transport and Power or some other Government agency.  But here we are purely concerned with the particular legal <Col N="1131" /> relationship between the guest of a hotel and a hotel itself.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman is quite right when he says we go further than that. We do go further.  We have decided that it would be a beneficial thing to include in that definition of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; all hotels which are registered as such with Bord Fáilte.  The reason for that will be obvious.  It brings a certain amount of precision and clarity into the situation so that anybody who is going along to a hotel which is registered as such with Bord Fáilte knows for a certainty that he is covered by the terms of this Bill and that all the various obligations, duties, and so on, laid down in the Bill will apply to the establishment in which he is staying.</P>

      <P>The position therefore is that a guesthouse, shall we say, which does not have an advertisement sign out but which, if they have a room free, can give accommodation to anyone who comes along, if it is reasonable for them to do it&mdash;the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is mentioned there&mdash; they are in this, according to the definition.  I do not know whether the Minister intended to put them in or not but they are in it, according to the definition except for one thing.  They are there in the generality.  There is a specific inclusion of hotels registered under the Act, but remember there is a register of guesthouses under the Act, and you could quite well say that because the inclusion is there of hotels under the Act, the effect of that <Col N="1132" /> inclusion was to contradict the generality of the earlier part.  I do not know what the Minister wants.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Higgins and I occasionally travel through the town of Ballinasloe.  There is one guesthouse there that is not a hotel.  It is a guesthouse and it has an advertisement outside it that it obviously holds itself out as providing accommodation.  The Minister probably knows it as well as Deputy O'Higgins.  It is just on the Loughrea side of the turn in Ballinasloe. That holds itself out.  That, the Minister would intend to be included. At the other end of the town, I know a place that will take anybody in. There is no advertisement as such outside at all.  I think that is also included. Is that what the Minister intended? If it is what the Minister intended, why does he run the risk of what is there in the first part of that definition being excluded by leaving out the word &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality thereof&rdquo;?</P>

If there is the &ldquo;Ard na Mara&rdquo; guesthouse in Enniscorthy and that establishment, despite the fact that it calls itself a guesthouse, either provides board and lodging for everybody who comes along or advertises, that it will do so, then it is in, no matter what it calls itself.</P>

      <P>I do not think so, because the whole thing is, if you like, a matter of corresponding liability.  If you go into a certain type of business, and maintain a certain type of establishment, then you must accept these liabilities or obligations.

      <P>That is just the point on which I raised this matter. All of us, if we cast our eyes around the country, can think of hotels, whether they call themselves hotels or are entitled to call themselves hotels or not&mdash;establishments which are in fact, in the ordinary person's designation hotels, but which may not be registered with Bord Fáilte.  They may carry on under the name of guesthouse or anything else.  The position as far as I can see under this Bill is that those who are registered with Bord Fáilte are to be faced with heavy liabilities.  Some of those obligations and liabilities exist already in the common law.  I do not think they all do, but probably most of them do.  Now we seem to be arriving at a stage if there is an exclusion allowed under the terms of the Bill where it will be a very definite advantage to establishments that they should not allow themselves to be registered with Bord <Col N="1135" /> Fáilte and simply by providing a notice on their notice board, they may make it quite clear they are not coming in under the terms of the Bill.  You may have on different sides of the street two establishments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a question of fact on provision but it seems to me that if I put up a notice saying I reserve the right to admit certain people, and if I exercise that right even once, I am in a position to give evidence of it.  I think I could satisfy a court that I do not provide for all-comers if I refuse as much as one person.  The point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I was about to put to the Minister is that a hotel means an establishment which holds itself out as providing sleeping accommodation, food and drink for reward for allcomers under special contract.  The case has been made that you have quite a number of holiday resorts, such as Bray, where during the summer season, these services are provided but are not provided outside the summer season.  It may be a question of fact, but it <Col N="1140" /> seems to be extraordinary, when discussing this Bill, that if you are in any doubt in the first section as to whether or not you can have a situation where people run hotels within the meaning of the Act for a couple of months of the year, they are thereby hotel proprietors for a couple of months of the year, and are not hotel proprietors for the remainder of the year.  It makes a very great difference to their duties, obligations and responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so because the definition of hotel is relevant only in so far as the services are being provided.  Once they are provided, or are advertised as being provided, then the place is a hotel so long as that set of circumstances obtains, with all the liabilities and obligations attaching to it as a hotel.  Once these circumstances do not apply, then the liabilities and obligations cease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>You can more or less safely forget all about guesthouses, lodging houses, student residences, and that type of establishment, because all these establishments invariably take people in on special contract.  There might not be a written contract, but there is an implied contract as to the terms, conditions, and so on, under which a person is kept, and these <Col N="1141" /> establishments are not hotels within the meaning of this Bill at all.  This Bill deals with an establishment which says: &ldquo;`I am in business as a hotel and anyone who comes along here will be taken in without any special contract.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to look again at the point I mentioned briefly a few moments <Col N="1143" /> ago.  It is provided under Section 2 of the Bill that all existing duties, liabilities and rights under the common law relating to innkeepers are now being replaced by this Bill, so I think it is a fair assumption hereafter, if this Bill passes, to say that the entire law in relation to the duties, rights and liabilities of innkeepers are contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the position of the establishment that does not come under the Bill.  Surely the intention should be that whatever rights, duties and obligations now exist under the common law will continue to apply to these establishments, if there were a fair case for saying that up to this they were inns and their proprietors innkeepers.  In other words, is the Minister quite clear that by the operation of Section 2 he is not lifting various duties and obligations entirely from quite a number of establishments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that any establishment which was an inn before is now a hotel for the purposes of this Bill.  All we are doing in Section 2 is wiping out all the liabilities and so on which attached to inns.  If all inns are in, Deputy O'Higgins's fears are groundless. Section 2 does not remove any establishments from the obligations imposed on innkeepers.  All establishments which were formerly inns and all liabilities which applied to them are covered in the Bill.  I think that is clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is clear, with respect.  I think it is the intention, but the Minister has tried to get a definition which will bring all those in and I am not entirely happy that he has, because it is a question of fact at the moment for the court to decide whether an establishment is or is not an inn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been made to me that there is a peculiarity in the drafting of Section 3 as compared particularly, shall I say, with the drafting of subsection (1) of Section 6.  If you cut out certain words which are merely descriptive, Section 3 reads: &ldquo;The proprietor of a hotel is under a duty to receive all persons without special contract&rdquo;.  Is he not also under a duty to receive people who come with a special contract?</P>
