      <P>The rate of interest on loans from the Local Loans Fund, from <Col N="512" /> which local authorities raise the great bulk of their capital requirements for housing and other purposes, is reviewed from time to time, especially by reference to the terms of issue of National Loans.  I am glad to be able to say that as a result of a recent review the interest rate on issues from the Fund on and after 1st January next will be reduced from 6¼% to 6%.</P>
      <P>The full cost of the interest charged on their borrowings does not fall on the local authorities.  Exchequer subsidies, estimated at over £3 million in the current financial year, are paid in respect of loans for local authority housing and other works.  These subsidies cover a substantial part not only of the interest charges but also of the capital repayments.</P>

      <P>It is universally accepted that customs examination necessarily involves some inconvenience for travellers.

Neither do they involve long delays for passengers.</P>

    <P>The customs must employ a more intensive degree of examination where they have reason to suspect attempted smuggling.

      <P>It is not possible to say exactly how many civil servants are engaged on customs work because many of the officers concerned have other functions, notably in relation to excise duties.  It is estimated, however, that customs work by itself would account for about 1,175 officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even after admission to the European Economic Community, the Common Market would not be expected to become fully operative as far as this country is concerned for several <Col N="514" /> years.  During the transitional period there would be no diminution in the responsibilities of the customs and the possibility of redundancy in that field is not, therefore, at present in view.</P>
    <P>It would be premature to speculate now as to what our customs staffing requirements would be by the time the Common Market would be fully established.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the approximate cost of <Col N="516" /> bringing State pensions up to the limit of current retirement pensions; and if, in view of the hardship that many pensioners are undergoing, he will consider this question when framing his next Budget proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing this year's pensions increases, I indicated that the cost of raising public service pensions to take account of post-war movements in the cost of living, with special provision for the older pensioners, was estimated at approximately £1.3 million.  The Deputy will appreciate that the increases provided for in this estimate were within the limits of the percentage increase shown by the movements of the cost of living figures in the post-war period.</P>
      <P>The increases granted in this year's Budget, which are estimated to cost £820,000 in a full year, have brought all pensions up to a floor at 1955 salary level, with a further increase of 6% on top of that.  This was a very substantial benefit, particularly for the older pensioners.  In fact, this increase has now brought all pensions closer to the level of the cost of living figure to which current salaries are linked than any previous general pensions increase.</P>
      <P>Any question of further increases must be considered with reference to financial and economic conditions generally, and I cannot give any undertaking about future possibilities at this stage.  Such figures as are available indicate that the cost of bringing all pensions up to the limit of current retirement pensions would be very substantial. The work involved in preparing an estimate of the kind requested by the Deputy would be too considerable to undertake at present.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, it has been the practice since 1921 for maps produced in Great Britain to indicate the six north-eastern counties of Ireland as portion of what is described as the &ldquo;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>So far as I am aware no special protest has ever been made against this practice nor have the British Government been asked to withdraw such stamps and maps; but all Irish Governments have insisted continuously directly to the British Government and otherwise, that the six north-eastern counties of Ireland rightfully belong to Ireland.  They have pointed out that the overwhelming majority of the Irish people, North and South, repudiate the partition of our country in defiance of the right of self-determination of nations which Britain upholds in other parts of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the provisions of <Col N="535" /> the Land Acts governing the acquisition of stud farms, compulsory proceedings were not instituted in respect of this estate but protracted negotiations were undertaken by the Land Commission with a view to voluntary purchase of the property.  It is not the practice to publish price details in voluntary purchase transactions.</P>
    <P>In September last, when negotiations had reached a stage which appeared to offer prospects of success, it was learned that the property had been sold privately to two local farmers. The possibility of purchasing part of the lands from the latter was then investigated but such an arrangement did not prove feasible.  My information is that the purchasers do not propose to continue working the estate as a stud farm.</P>
    <P>Whilst the sale of land to a new owner in no way impairs the powers of the Land Commission under the Land Acts to acquire such land for relief of congestion, should such a course prove necessary, the question as to what further action can be taken by the Land Commission regarding the property referred to will necessarily depend on the user thereof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister bear in mind that on these estates, formerly used as stud farms, a substantial number of persons found employment, that they now have lost this employment without, I understand, any compensation whatever, that there are a considerable number of small and uneconomic holders in the area, and would the Land Commission, therefore, in the exercise of their powers under the Land Acts, take steps to ensure that these people will be given holdings on these estates so as to provide for the continuity of their employment in the areas where they were born and where no other employment whatever is offered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how effect could be given to the steps suggested, in view of the fact that these estates have not been acquired by the Land Commission.  The Deputy will appreciate that as the law stands the Land <Col N="536" /> Commission are precluded from exercising compulsory powers for the acquisition of lands which were used as stud farms.  As far as those working on estates which the Land Commission take over are concerned, there are two provisions depending on the length of time those people have been employed on the estates.  The Deputy suggests giving them land but he will appreciate that it is more usual in recent times to give them some form of cash compensation.  In view of the fact that the Land Commission have not so far taken over these lands, I fail to see how they could meet the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

I understand, however, that the talk given on 8 November last was a summarised report of the full day's proceedings and contained the principal points made whether in Irish or English.  Much had inevitably to be omitted but I am sure that the Authority did not intend to reflect upon the use of the Irish language in the debate.</P>

      <Col N="541" /> As I have said, publicly, more than once in recent months, I am anxious that more should be done for the prevention of crime and the rehabilitation of offenders and in that connection I set up an inter-Departmental Committee last September to inquire into our present methods, giving attention in particular, to such matters as juvenile delinquency, the probation system, the institutional treatment of offenders and their after-care.  This is a committee of persons with specialised knowledge of their subject and, as I mentioned in the Dáil last week, on my opening speech on the Estimates for my Department, I have received from them a number of practical recommendations to some of which I have already given approval, including the appointment of Prison Welfare Officers, the introduction of corrective training courses for certain classes of prisoners, and the provision of psychiatric treatment for prisoners in need of it.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>Every bus licensed as a public service vehicle has to be inspected at least once a year by a member of the Garda Síochána qualified to make such an inspection.  In addition, a bus is inspected if it is involved in an accident, or if any structural alteration is made in it or if a complaint about it is received by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examination is primarily directed towards ensuring that the vehicle is safe both mechanically and <Col N="544" /> otherwise, but it also extends to the general suitability of the vehicle for the accommodation of passengers, and a bus that was in such a condition that it appeared to the examiner to be particularly prone to breaking down would not be passed by him.</P>

      <P>I was saying here the last day we should develop our tourist industry to the utmost.  In the past year, there has been a slight sinking back but I am glad to see that the Minister and the Tourist Board have realised that there is something wrong or that something needs to be done.  I was pleased to see from the Minister's speech that they have discovered there is a need for Grade B hotels.  We have been tending towards building nothing but grade A hotels.  We certainly built some extremely good ones but we lack the hotels we need for a large number of our tourists.  It is a welcome development that a couple of companies intend to build hotels near airports. It would be a great advantage at Shannon and certainly at Dublin to have a hotel right beside the airport to obviate the necessity of people having to travel long distances into the city to get accommodation particularly when merely staying overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter in connection with Bord na Móna to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister, that is, the amount of turf mould that has been going down the rivers, particularly the river in my area in County Meath, the Boyne, which divides Meath and Kildare.  This turf mould coming down from the bogs at flood time spreads over the land.  To give Bord na Móna their due, they spend quite an amount of money each year cleaning the drains and have tried to solve the problem by building cess ponds.  I hope they will make further efforts to deal with this turf mould.  After flooding there is this turf mould on the land and for the past four or five years it has gone next to the banks.  On top of what used to be grass, there is turf mould to a depth of about six inches. If anything can be done to relieve the <Col N="548" /> farmer in this respect it would certainly be greatly appreciated.  From the fisherman's point of view, this has upset fishing for salmon on the Boyne which was one of the most famous salmon rivers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the years, the ESB have made great strides in providing rural electrification but there is one aspect of it which it is very hard for people to understand.  They make an application to get electric light which may be only 100 or 200 yards away and when the return comes from the ESB, they find a very heavy special service charge imposed on them, while in another case when the ESB have to bring the light a bit further, there may be no special service charge or only a small one.  That leads to a great deal of dissatisfaction among applicants in isolated places.  It is rather unfair to them and I would ask the ESB to do whatever they can to try to get electricity to these isolated places at a lower cost.  I know of one case where people are living on the main road within a mile of one of the generating stations and still it is considered an isolated place by the ESB.  Such great efforts have been made in recent years to provide other amenities such as roadways and so on, that the ESB should make every endeavour to provide the one amenity we all appreciate, that is, electric light.</P>
    <P>The provision of bottled gas does not fulfil the real need as it is very dear to install.  Take the ordinary house that would need three lights. The fitting of the three lights costs £22.  The people get a £10 grant after that but it still leaves them very far short of their requirements in regard to electric current because they are not able to have television or use an iron.  They can cook with bottled gas which is a great help but we would like to see the ESB going a little further.</P>
    <P>Over the years, the State-sponsored bodies under the control of the Minister's Department have been doing a very good job.  They must be complimented on this because they have experienced some very difficult times. Again I should like to compliment the Minister on giving us details in <Col N="549" /> regard to the activities of these State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has acquired a reputation as a stonewall Minister who will not answer questions, but the day of reckoning comes. On this Estimate, he deserves the sympathy of the House but he would be wise to give a little more information.  In that way irritation would not be added to the ordinary efforts of the Deputies to acquire information about the activities of all these bodies for which the Minister is once a year responsible.  He has a very curiously patterned collection of activities to supervise.  Most of them are in the red, and their methods of accounting would land the ordinary citizen in Carey Street or whatever corresponds in Ireland to the bankruptcy court.</P>
      <P>The case made by Deputy McGilligan last Thursday is one that should be listened to.  It was reasonably put. The figures on the balance sheets of all these State or semi-State bodies should state honestly the facts of the situation of each body.  I do not think any pretence is called for.  If the facts are faced, the bodies themselves will not suffer in any way.  The idea of using phrases like &ldquo;operating surplus&rdquo; at once starts us searching for what the real operating loss is.</P>
      <P>I was going to say that there was a suggestion of whistling past the graveyard but I hope that none of these activities will result in graveyards. I cannot see any justification for gilding the pattern of the loss that is obvious in all these bodies.  If anything emerges from all this, it is that there is an unanswerable demand that figures should be given on the normal basis and there should be no gloss on them.  If there is a subsidy, it should be made clear.</P>
      <P>False optimism is no assistance of any kind to the bodies themselves, to the members of the House or to the public.  It really only tends towards eroding our standards, and our duty now is to maintain standards at a very high level at this stage of our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister's title should be changed.  He should <Col N="550" /> be called the Minister for Subsidised Bodies.  Let us face the fact that we are attempting activities that must be subsidised for many years and probably during the lifetime of most of us will have to continue to be subsidised. If that is stated plainly, that he is the Minister in charge of those bodies which require to be subsidised, we could always have power to review progress, seeing where economies are taking place, reducing the subsidy or increasing it.  If we know what the pattern is, we will not have to go back through balance sheets which are not produced in accordance with accepted practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for very important sectors of our economy, and except the ESB, they are all posing problems of assistance and continuing demand on the public purse.  In fact, there is a curious slant on the situation. I learned from Deputy McGilligan last week when he was speaking that the only one of all these bodies that is not being subsidised is the one completely serving the Irish people, and the only other one that serves the Irish people does not require subsidy. That is a depressing fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister will correct me when he is replying.  At any rate, if shipping has to be subsidised, it has to be subsidised; if flying has to be subsidised, it must be subsidised; if airports need subsidy, they must be subsidised.  We do not subsidise our railways because they serve our own people, and we do no subsidise the ESB because it does not require subsidy.  The others are losers and the dilemma is before us. It is quite understandable that we do not improve the situation, we do not raise our own standards of accounting and increase our concept of what the situation should be, by avoiding publication of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take them <i>seriatim</i>, the railway pattern is part of the world pattern that railways do lose money nowadays.  The Minister deserves a good deal of sympathy for the line he <Col N="551" /> has to take in attempting to maintain a reasonable amount of railway track, providing a reasonable service to a reasonable proportion of our population. He just cannot let it go.  Indeed, I am going to repeat what I said before in this House&mdash;I think Dr. Andrews's task is a very difficult one, and we gave him the task in this House.  The time is coming when we shall have to face a decision on whether we can continue to treat the railways on a hard financial basis or consider the part they play in the social structure.  If we do subsidise shipping, mainly tramp shipping, and airlines, there is a case to be made for maintaining the railways for the social needs that they serve.</P>
    <P>If I do express sympathy with the Board of CIE, there is also some evidence of some sudden decisions by that Board and of telescoped planning. There is a depot in Cork that employs well over 100 men, and the decision has been taken to close it. That is a major decision.  It is a major decision indeed for the 100 families involved and for the prosperity of the city I have the honour to represent here.  It is a decision that apparently has been taken very suddenly, because it was only last August that a number of apprentices were recruited there. That seems a curious thing.  Then, some of the proposals for compensation being paid to displaced workers are almost in the realms of fantasy. Given a normal expectation of life, some of the pensioners will be drawing pensions in the year 2,000.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the whole thing make sense and I wonder, as I said earlier in my speech and before in this House, whether the social needs and the entire pattern of our society must not be taken into account instead of excessive pigeon-holing, as we have done in the case of CIE?  The pensions being paid to these quite young men, who are being discharged at a very early age, compare very favourably indeed with the pensions which the old railway company paid to employees who are now in their 70s and who served all their lives in the railways, whose pensions are in <Col N="552" /> the region of shillings.  That has been disgraceful to the railway company and to us.  The Minister should, because nobody else can, make some effort to ensure more kindly treatment for these old railway employees than we have accorded them.</P>
    <P>I do not know the proposal about the Rosslare to Mallow line but I do know that the Minister has mentioned expenditure which it is proposed to undertake at the port of Rosslare in order to improve the tourist trade and make it easier for tourists to come ashore there.  Surely that railway line, which serves the whole south of Ireland and which runs through Wexford and Waterford to Mallow and on to Limerick and Kerry, is of immense importance to the tourist trade?  If any money is to be spent in Rosslare to bring tourists into that area I want to make sure that no silly decision will be come to about taking up that railway line which should carry those tourists.  If the railways go, we cannot handle the tourist trade.  The Minister should consider the kind of traffic that comes ashore at Cork from a transatlantic liner and ask himself how that traffic could be handled without a railway line.  The same applies to the port of Rosslare.</P>
    <P>On the question of the airlines and airports, we must admit that this country has achieved considerable success in the air.  When we survey the figures, we all feel a certain pride that Aer Lingus and Aerlinte have done so well.  We know that their accounting is done in an unorthodox way but we have to face the fact that, when dealing with airports and airlines, ordinary accountancy does not apply.  The Chairman of BOAC has said that he found himself in the straitjacket of cockeyed finance and by &ldquo;cockeyed finance,&rdquo; I take it he meant that the accountancy was not done in the orthodox manner.  The provision of air services for a small country in such a successful manner is something of which we can be proud and I would be less than generous if I withheld any credit from the Taoiseach for it.</P>
    <P>The expenses on the airports make it essential for us to support them.  We should endeavour to work these airports <Col N="553" /> as hard as we possibly can.  The airport opened at Cork last year has far exceeded the forecast made of the figures of use.  Still, it is a slightly used airport and it would be used much more if the services were more extensive. I think the trouble is that we have got the problem of planes, that we have not got enough planes to meet all the demands on them.</P>
    <P>I know that something should be done in association with other countries engaged in air activities about the problem of seats which are required at short notice.  I had occasion to go to London last autumn at short notice and I was unable to get a seat in an Aer Lingus plane.  The local management of Aer Lingus could not have been more courteous or active in seeking to get that seat for me.  They contacted the London and Dublin offices to see if there were any cancellations but they could not get one and I had to travel by another route.  I heard afterwards that the plane I sought to travel on did not travel fully loaded, that there were three seats vacant in it.  I suppose that is one of the problems arising from a new mode of transport but I think that in order to counter that a substantial deposit should be put down when reservations are made.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what has happened to the proposal to buy Caravels.  I hear from travellers that this is an extremely good plane and I take it that the decision not to proceed with the purchase is based not so much on financial as on technical grounds.  If airports like Cork are to function at a reasonably high level of activity, then the services will have to be much more frequent than they are.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport is now a very peculiar and a very great problem.  Eight or nine years ago, in the days of piston aeroplanes, one would have said that it was one of the most important airports in the world.  That importance has by-passed us now and every credit is due to those who operate that airport for the efforts they are making to catch up on the roundabouts what we have lost on the swings.  The five or six hour flights across the Atlantic have posed a great problem for the <Col N="554" /> type of traffic that Shannon had gone in for.  All through the night, planes were coming in and landing there but now there are only occasional flights during the daytime.</P>
    <P>There is a great catering service there of which we are all very proud but now the position has arisen that it is too large for the numbers being catered for.  Every credit must be given to those who are making such great efforts to restore that airport to its former activity.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it is a great thing to have Irish planes flying over the Atlantic every day.  It is a great thing to see them flying the Irish flag. It does our hearts and the hearts of the Irish Americans good but I think they have contributed in no small way to the decline of Shannon Airport.  The fact is that we creamed off the passenger trade to and from this country which had formerly justified other air lines landing here and paying landing charges.  Now we are left with a very large stable holding our own coaches but with a very few other people's carriages calling there.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue to resist the demand for Dublin landings. It was never wise to permit Aerlinte to by-pass Shannon.  It weakened the case made in rebutting the demands of foreign airlines.  The terminal port should have been Shannon and feeder services should have been organised from that port both to Dublin and the continent.  The investment in Shannon is a major one.  It is a colossal size, really, and we must sustain it and protect it by every means in our power.</P>
    <P>I think Bord Fáilte are going places. Certainly visitors are coming to Ireland as a result of their activities. I believe Bord Fáilte are doing more to spread moneys and employment all over the countryside than any other activity over which the Minister has control.  The Irish image they are projecting, the places in Ireland and the kind of place Ireland is, are slowly becoming accepted and, I think, successfully accepted.  All the credit must be given there to those who administer the Board.</P>
    <P>Our ordinary hoteliers are mainly <Col N="555" /> very good.  I take it that these new great groups organising big hotels here will be at least efficient and, really, efficiency is all you require from that size of hotel.  You will not require, expect or get the friendly and homely treatment you get in the smaller establishment.  I believe, and I hope the Minister agrees with me, that the smaller kind of hotel in Ireland makes a more valuable contribution to bringing back and tempting back all those who come to us than the larger hotel. It is a very difficult business in which to be engaged.  It requires constant supervision for 24 hours of the day. Staffs are a continual difficulty.</P>
    <P>Really, only the family concern can remain open successfully all the year round and that only with the family being content to engage in an interesting activity for a reasonable reward &mdash;not a great reward&mdash;with very hard work.  The family hotel in this country with a good table, clean linen, and so on, is our greatest asset to the tourist trade.  Added together, I think they are much more valuable than any of the bigger hotels now being planned, though the big hotels are necessary.</P>
    <P>Is there any necessity for two tourist organisations?  When the Bord Fáilte Bill was introduced into this House some years ago, I asked the Taoiseach who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce if it were necessary to have two tourist organisations.  I know the reply will be that the other organisation is an organisation in respect of the tourist industry itself and that Bord Fáilte is something different.  I still wonder if there is need for two such organisations and if there is not some overlapping, some duplication of function.</P>
    <P>If Bord Fáilte were expanded to take over the whole function and, above all, to organise the local contribution in respect of special localised tourist projects, they probably would do it more efficiently.  Taking a long term view rather than a short term one&mdash;which local activists usually take so that when results do not come up to expectations, they are inclined <Col N="556" /> to retire from the activity&mdash;it would be better if all the moneys spent in every way in the country towns, villages and seaside resorts as well as on hotels, and so on, were under the control of one organisation.</P>
    <P>I cannot say much about shipping except that I was surprised to read in the Dáil debates that all the ships we have put on the sea&mdash;fine ships they are&mdash;are plying, practically all the time, between one foreigner and another and very seldom come to Ireland. A lady came to me some time ago who wanted to get her son into the Irish merchant service.  He was very anxious to go and whatever help I could give her I gave.  However, she said that the only thing she did not like about it was that she would see her son so very seldom as he would be on the other side of the world most of the time.</P>
    <P>It is curious that we do this carrying for foreigners on all the oceans of the world and that we subsidise it. Of course, many people are employed on the shipping services.  It is a good career.  The ships are good.  It is a matter of pride, I suppose, to all of us to see the Irish flag on an Irish vessel.  There are other points of view also.  The fact that we have been able to have ships built in the new ship-building yard in Cork is very important.  Apart altogether from the point of view of keeping the money for labour and material in this country &mdash;the industry has a very large labour content&mdash;particular skills are required which could not be acquired at home. The extraordinary agreements that have been made between employers and labour in the matter of demarcation disputes could be regarded as a landmark in 20th century industrial disputes.  I know that it is a matter of amazement to naval architects from Great Britain that it can be done.</P>

      <P>I do not mind if it does not pay a dividend, if we do not subsidise a loss.  I shall listen with interest to what the Minister has to say when replying.  I am very glad to see Irish boats there.  I was sorry to hear they do not quite make the grade as regards paying back this capital.  At some stage, I take it, some decision will be come to that freight rates will ease the picture so much that the shipping company can deal with it themselves. However, that is not my line of country.  I do not know much about shipping.</P>
      <P>I do know something about the ESB.  It is a tribute to those who conceived it.  It has made an extraordinary contribution to all activity in this country since 1922.  The Minister was not particularly vocal about it.  He devoted very little time during his speech to it.  However, the figures were vocal enough.  They spoke volumes for it.  One of the important things about it is that, very largely, it is based on native fuel.  That must be a very important thing for us.</P>
      <P>Now for complaints.  I have spoken before in reference to certain things about the ESB that annoy me.  One is the disfiguring of the towns and cities with their supply poles.  It is a small thing, an unimportant thing, but it should not be done.  They should be asked to deliver current to the consumer in a more discreet manner.  That is putting it as gently as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not enter into the dispute on the Fitzwilliam Street building because I think that probably the balance lies evenly between both <Col N="558" /> sides.  The design that has been selected is a pretty good design, by contemporary Irish architects.  It will not look as badly as certain kinds of contemporary buildings would have looked. Thinking about this the other evening in the House, and looking around the walls at that fine collection of Malton prints of old Dublin, I thought the Minister might move one of them up a bit and put the architects in there to study them.</P>
    <P>However, the ESB is doing a good job and with regard to Irish shipping activities, if they are not making a great deal of money, at least we do know they are well run and, if the price is high, it adds up to prestige and has established the Irish image as being contemporary and efficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters I want to raise on this Estimate. The first is a matter which came to my personal notice some time ago when travelling from Cobh to Dublin by train and which reinforced the view I had acquired on a previous trip over the same line.  Passengers coming off transatlantic liners at Cobh very frequently take the train from Cobh to Cork and there, probably, have to wait for a later train which comes on to Dublin.  I am not interested at this stage in their having to wait for the later train but I am interested in the filthy condition of the train which carries these passengers from Cobh to Dublin.  The one I travelled in recently could not have seen paint for many years.  The carriage was dirty.  The paint, whenever it was put on, was appallingly uninteresting and the whole thing had a horrible atmosphere around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some passengers asked if that was the kind of train they had in Ireland. I had to assure them that it was probably the worst train in the country and that I could not understand why it was used for transportation between Cobh and Cork.  It was a wretched carriage altogether.  In addition, it was not heated, which was a source of complaint by many passengers. As an attempt to give a bleak and miserable picture of Ireland, it could not have succeeded better, at <Col N="559" /> 8.30 that morning, to those people who, having come across the Atlantic in a spick and span ship, were huddled into this Cobh to Cork train.  It was a scandalous performance.  Whoever is responsible for putting a train of that kind into commission to convey tourists arriving in the country for the first time has not the foggiest notion of what it is necessary to do in order to present to tourists an acceptable, pleasing and memorable impression of a visit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any of our Cork Deputies has seen this piece of construction which plied on that day between Cobh and Dublin.  Burning would be too expensive for it, it was such a wretched-looking carriage.  I hope it will not be continued on the service, especially having regard to tourists, who have a right to expect something better.</P>

      <P>There you are.  That is the mentality in regard to the tourist trade today.  An 1880 coach is used for tourists from America and then we wonder why they do not come in millions for the privilege of travelling in it. Somebody ought to look into this matter and have that coach put out of commission.  It is a disgrace, but merely as a type of construction, but to our intelligence, that it should be used in 1962, when the world is on its toes to offer tourists the best possible comforts in the hope of attracting them for balance of payments purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Next I wish to deal with the question of canals, in particular the portion of the canal between Dublin and Robertstown.  A canal is a most attractive type of waterway in a city, if kept in a proper condition. In Europe, canals are idolised by tourists.  In those countries, where canals operate, the citizens take great pride in them.  Every possible effort is made to make them as attractive as possible, not merely for the benefit of the local people, but also for tourists. Tourists frequent canals and rivers on the continent for pleasure-boating in a way that brings substantial return to those who operate the waterways. We have only to look at the canals in Belgium and Holland and the canal, which runs from Gotenburg in Sweden to Stockholm, to see how they are used, not merely to give pleasure but to obtain a substantial return.  There are many other canals which could be cited.</P>
      <P>The canal from Dublin to Robertstown in Kildare is about the filthiest stretch of water that could be found in the whole of Europe.  Recently, two tourists came from London with a boat and, on arrival at the Ringsend Basin, started to sail for the Shannon. They had a good engine on the boat, a fact which made their journey less hazardous than otherwise it would have been.  They had a pleasant sail for the first ten minutes and then they ran into every kind of impediment that it was possible for people, who wanted to dispose of rubbish, to dump into the canal from Mount Street Bridge to Robertstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These tourists wrote a letter to the papers.  I hope the Minister saw that letter.  It is hard to believe that the waterway they were trying to navigate was the Grand Canal.  They painted such a horrible picture of it that it constituted the worst possible piece of propaganda for the canals.  Others to whom I have spoken, and who have travelled on the canal, have told me <Col N="561" /> there was not a word of exaggeration in the description given by those two English tourists of their efforts to get from Ringsend Basin to the Shannon. What did they say was wrong with the canal?  First, it was choked with weeds, but apart from that, the canal was used as a kind of cemetery for asses, cattle, dogs and cats, abounding in old bed-steads, old bicycle wheels, rusty corrugated iron and every kind of rubbish.  Yet that was the canal that ran virtually through the centre of the capital city of the country.</P>
    <P>Either we are mugs and the rest of Europe are wizards or the position is the opposite, but every country in Europe is keeping its waterways open, doing its best to beautify its waterways, doing its best to make the waterways the highways of transportation. Here we virtually abandon the canals and now they are used as outdoor garbage bins in which the decomposed bodies of animals can be seen floating, available for inspection, and every kind of rubbish is dumped in the canal as well.  I do not think it is fair to this city, I do not think it is fair to us as a people.  I am convinced that the Minister or Bord Fáilte or some such body interested in the promotion of tourism with, perhaps, the aid of the Department of Local Government and the co-operation of CIE, could get together and clean the canal of weeds and at the same time remove all the refuse, while taking steps to stock the canal with coarse fish, and thus provide a first-class waterway which would be used much more extensively than it is used to-day for transportation.</P>
    <P>You would provide a very substantial measure of enjoyment for harassed citizens of Dublin and district who might on week evenings in the summer or autumn spend their leisure time in coarse fishing from the banks of the canal, and if the banks were tidied up and made clean, then they would provide very pleasant boulevards for people who want a stroll in the evenings along a piece of thoroughfare which in every other country is a natural attraction for the walker or those who like to saunter in the evenings. Something ought to be done about <Col N="562" /> this canal; something can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Ninety per cent. of the work to be done is labour content and I would strongly urge the Minister to avail of whatever powers and status he has in this matter to get the canal cleaned up, the banks made properly and the debris removed, because if God ever sends us a dry summer, there will be disease in this city as sure as we are sitting in the Dáil this evening.  You could not expect anything else having regard to the putrid contents of the canal for a distance of 20 to 30 miles. If it is worth cleaning the canal from the point of view of tourism, it must be worth far more doing so from the point of view of beautifying the city and providing amenities for many people.  I hope the Minister will take time off from lecturing the public on CIE and devote a little more time to trying to beautify the canal and removing the debris.  If he did that, we would be getting places.</P>
    <P>I want to make a reference to CIE, not at any great length.  At all events, I want to express a point of view on behalf of my Party, lest silence on the subject might give the impression that we thought as the Minister apparently thinks.  In 1958, when the Transport Bill was going through, the intention was that CIE would be subsidised to the extent of £1,175,000 per year for a period of five years.  I said then and I say it again that I never believed that was possible of achievement.  You can always get a sheet of paper and a pencil and write down what your theory is, but some of the things frequently overlooked in making these calculations are the imponderables you have to consider in the light of events in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The position is that the CIE subsidies are due to end in March, 1964. We are very near March, 1963.  What is the position?  The loss on CIE up to March, 1962, was approximately £1,700,000.  I gather from a speech made by the Minister the other day that the supposition is there will be approximately the same loss for the year ending March, 1963.  Then we have only one year to go for the final and fifth year and in that year, from <Col N="563" /> a loss of approximately £1,700,000, CIE have to become a line-ball undertaking. I do not believe that will happen, unless in the 12 months from March, 1963, to March, 1964, there is to be a wholesale closure of the railway lines involving large scale dismissals and the truncation of a very substantial portion of what are regarded today as our normal railway services, and have been so regarded since railways were first introduced into this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he seriously thinks CIE will be able to carry on without a subsidy after March, 1964, in view of the fact that the anticipation is they will lose approximately £1,700,000 in the 12 months ending in March next.  I do not know how this miracle is to be brought about, but even if it could be brought about, it seems to me a most dangerous kind of miracle and I can see its being achieved only by the closing of large sections of the railway and the throwing out of employment of a large number of married men who have dedicated themselves to the service of the railways.  I do not know whether the Minister regards himself as having some supernatural directive instinct to make the Irish railways pay or whether this is just a political passion with the Minister, that, being very anxious to get publicity on as many occasions as possible, he feels obliged to talk about CIE almost every time he speaks.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that his speeches have created an atmosphere of uncertainty and crisis about the operation of our railway service. Every time the Minister speaks on CIE, we are told about the appalling losses, about the necessity to get away from deficits per annum, about the necessity to end the subsidy at the earliest possible date.  I ask myself can this be done and what price must we pay for ending the subsidy.  The subsidy is not one for somebody living in Siam: it is for everybody travelling on the Irish railways and it is necessary because of the fact that we continue to export 40,000 people <Col N="564" /> every year and, with a falling population, we expect our railways to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In Western Europe, densely populated as it is, I doubt if even Holland can make the railways pay.  In any case if they do, there might be an exceptional reason for their paying in a small country such as Holland, having regard to its size and density of population.  Why we should make such a fetish of balancing the budget in relation to railways regardless of the price seems to me to demand an explanation from the Government because apparently we will not get it from the Minister.</P>
      <P>Every time the Minister speaks of railways, it is a crisis speech.  We are told of imminent happenings, of railway lines that must be torn up and of the diversion of further traffic from the railways to the roads, and a long dissertation then on the percentage of freight and the number of lorries necessary to transport it by road as against the transport which has been provided by the railways.  The Minister ought to give CIE a rest from speeches.  There must be some subject on which the Minister can talk besides CIE.  I do not want to deprive him in the slightest of the publicity he likes to accumulate for himself but I do suggest CIE want a rest and that this firebrigade administration which enshrouds it from the constant speeches by the Minister is not calculated to give people the impression that it is a thriving, progressive service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well and good if CIE can become a lineball financially and well and good if they can eliminate losses. Everybody will welcome that, but I do not think there is any purpose in the Minister's continuing to make these <Col N="565" /> crisis speeches and giving the impression that the only thing that matters to this country is the balancing of the CIE budget.  There are 22,000 Irishmen employed in CIE.  When you consider the fact that substantial sums of money have been given to people who come to this country to establish industry who have never employed a fraction of the 22,000 employed by CIE, we say that CIE, being the biggest employer of labour in the country, is entitled to a reasonable deal from Parliament.</P>
    <P>This virus that CIE must pay is of only relatively recent growth.  There has been an intelligent acceptance of the fact that in the circumstances of our scattered population, with a country large sections of which are denuded of population, lower than that of any other country in western Europe, when we have special transport difficulties, we should try to meet them.  But let us meet them in a reasonable way.  It is a great mistake to make a fetish out of balancing the budget of CIE, especially when we know the balance will be effected by firing men out of employment who have given long service to the railway companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to take a balanced view of this whole situation and CIE ought to be allowed to do whatever they can do within the ambit of the legislation passed by this House.  It is unreasonable to lead them to believe they are engaged in a death or glory struggle to be ended in March, 1964, and that there will be medals for those who will balance the budget of CIE in March, 1964, irrespective of the long line of economic casualties in the form of unemployed men which will be necessary in order to achieve that balance.</P>
    <P>Many other activities in this country are being subsidised and being subsidised not in the interests of our own people.  We are paying millions of pounds in the subsidisation of commodities which are exported from this country.  The subsidy we pay to the British for eating our butter would go a long way towards subsidising CIE which would be a subsidy to our own people travelling <Col N="566" /> on our own railway system.  There ought to be some effort to balance this in a rational way instead of getting this tangent on the whole thing, leading people to believe that something mesmeric will happen if we can only manage to balance this budget.  We do not balance our budget for air services; we do not balance our food exports budget; there are many other activities of this kind we do not balance.  Why do we insist on a balance being achieved in an industry which employs 22,000 persons and does not require any subsidy in order to do so?</P>
    <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to the fact that under the 1958 Act, the compensation payable, because of redundancy or worsening of conditions, expires, I think, in July, 1963, that is, next year.  If we are to have redundancy, dismissals or retirements, due to worsening of conditions after July, 1963, I take it the Minister will introduce the necessary legislation to prolong that provision of the 1958 Act and thereby provide coverage against redundancy and worsening of conditions, which will terminate in July, 1963.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that that will be done.  I am quite satisfied there will be further redundancy after 1963, if the present policy is maintained and if that is so, then there must be reasonable treatment for those who are employed by the national transport undertaking.</P>
    <P>I suspect from a speech made the other day that the Minister considers that there may have to be rethinking in regard to transport.  I got from his speech the impression that there might have to be a competition between rail and road.  Again that is just resort to anything that has the element of novelty about it.  In a small country such as this, where there is a scattered population, very few large centres of population, what we ought to aim at is an integrated transport service.  Trying to play Dublin off against the provinces, to play the provinces off against Dublin, to play the railways off against the buses may have its appeal if you are dealing with facets of the problem but there can only be one sound transport policy for the country, <Col N="567" /> that is, an integrated transport policy. That transport policy ought not to be based upon clipping off what are described as uneconomic portions of the transport services.  Transport services necessary for 1962 standards of living ought to be maintained.</P>
    <P>If the whole problem of CIE is approached coldly, calmly and with a recognition of the peculiarities of this country, we can probably provide a transport service under reasonable conditions and giving a reasonable measure of satisfaction.  However, if we are to have this type of firebrigade administration, brinkmanship speeches telling us of the grave dangers which lie ahead in CIE, then a state of hysteria will be created in which CIE will not merely become a joke in every musichall in the country but will be denied these elements which are necessary if the service is to grow and to prosper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to misrepresent what Deputy Norton said <Col N="568" /> here this afternoon, but the impression I got from his speech was that we should continue subsidising CIE, even subsidising uneconomic units and branch lines which the people have refused to use for years.  I have taken a great interest in CIE.  I went on deputations to CIE, and even to the Great Northern Railway when certain lines were being abandoned by that company.  It was proved to us that these lines were not paying.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have approached this problem of transport. Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce in his Government. He dealt with CIE in his time. He suffered the same headaches as the present Minister suffers.  He was up against the same problems.  He had to try to find money to subsidise CIE. There are portions of the CIE system which are completely uneconomic.  The people will not use them.  They prefer to use cars or lorries.  Emphasis is laid on certain small towns which, it is alleged, will suffer if branch lines are closed down.  The fact is that the traders in these towns contribute nothing to these lines.  They prefer to use private transport.</P>
      <P>Under the 1958 Act, we appointed a Board and we appointed a Chairman of that Board.  I do not like mentioning names here, but the Chairman of that Board is maligned inside and outside this House.  He is expected to work miracles.  In my opinion, he deserves sympathy.  He deserves the sympathy and thanks of this Dáil and of the people for trying to do a very tough job.  Those responsible for Aer Lingus, the ESB, CIE, Bord na Móna and the Sugar Company have all done a very fine job in these various semi-State organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country owes the present Chairman of CIE a good deal because he was one of the founder organisers of Bord na Móna, and he did an impossible job.  A man of his type and calibre is not going to do anything which will discredit this nation.  Men of his type were soldiers of Ireland when soldiers of Ireland were few. These men, appointed as chairman of these various boards, are appointed to <Col N="569" /> do a national job.  In my heart of hearts, I feel none will do anything except what he believes is best in the interests of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should not wish to see any man displaced.  All my life I have been trying to get people jobs and more money in an effort to create an atmosphere of economic wellbeing.  We are dealing here with CIE.  We are trying to make CIE an economic unit. If the State could afford it, we should like to have more money to spend on social services, more money for capital investment for the benefit of the nation as a whole.  That would bring back some return; it would decrease our adverse trade balance because we would be able to export more goods and employ more people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton was Minister in two Coalition Governments here.  He was Minister for Industry and Commerce in one of them.  He and his Government did not work any miracles during their period in office.  A somewhat similar situation existed then as exists now.  There was another Board in operation.  A very honourable man was Chairman of that Board.  He did his job well.  That Board tried to do their best.  Expert outside advice was sought as to what should be done and what should not be done.  Mr. Dan Morrissey was then Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is a comment on the whole situation that in England to-day those in charge of transport are following our example.  Certain lines are uneconomic. The people in certain parts of England are not using the railways. What is one to do when faced with such a situation?  If people prefer other forms of transport, if they will not travel on the railways, what is one to do?  If traders in Dublin want to send their goods by private lorry, they will do so.  No Minister can compel them to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has plenty of headaches and people should be fair in their criticism of him.  What is the Minister or the Chairman of CIE to do if people will not use the system? One cannot ask this House to subsidise that system and keep it going; but that is what we are being asked to do here.  When Deputy Norton was <Col N="570" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce, I was trying to keep the Hill of Howth tram in operation.  I played the band just as good as anybody else did in order to keep it going.  I remember going in one day with about 20 others, to see the general manager and the chairman of the Great Northern Railway.  Before we got down to discussion, the chairman said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, just before you start, will you tell me how you came down from the summit?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no road.  I used the argument that the road was bad and that the trams should be left there until the Corporation made a new road.  Eventually the trams had to go.  I am only giving that as an example of the fact that all over the country people did not want to use the system but once anything happened, they cried out asking why it was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, the present Chairman of CIE and the Board deserve the thanks of this House for the national work they are doing.  The only thing I hope is that when any employees are made redundant, they will get adequate compensation for their long years of service, because the State should try to treat these dedicated men properly.  Even if the Minister has to come to this House for a vote, I think the whole House would support him in a generous attitude.  I do not <Col N="571" /> like to see any man after years in any employment just thrown on the scrap-heap and given a little so that he will just fade away and not be able to look after himself, if he is a single man, or look after his wife and his family, if he is married.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy Norton that dirty coaches should not be tolerated on the journey to Cobh or to any of our principal stations.  Wherever they go, up-to-date clean trains will make an impression on any visitors coming to this country and be a part of our tourist make-up.  At the same time, I was surprised when Deputy Norton mentioned that such a thing should happen, because any time I travelled up or down the country, I found the trains all right.  I do not know whether they put on a special train for me when they got to know when I was travelling.  The canals are really a problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Use them to wash the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The old lock gates are falling off.  The canals have become completely uneconomic.  That is another part of the dead weight that the Chairman and Board of CIE had to deal with.  Deputy Norton wants the canals to be kept going as waterways, but I wonder what it will cost the State to keep them clean as a waterway, and what Board are going to do it.  Are we to set up an Inland Water Board for our waterways? How are we to collect the revenue to keep the canals going?  Those are problems we have to face.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is another semi-State body that has done a very good job over the years.  While it had a deficit this year, I hope that next year will be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall go into that.  I may have slipped up on that statement <Col N="572" /> but I shall go into it again.  It is very encouraging to see that Irish Shipping is doing so well, notwithstanding certain items that have been met from time to time.  In my opinion, all the semi-State bodies the Minister is responsible for administering have excelled themselves.  Take Bord na Móna, which is going from success to success, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Irish Shipping, the ESB and Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte is one of my pet subjects, and I would like to see Bord Fáilte doing a little more work, especially in the tourist areas adjacent to the city of Dublin.  Two local authorities I have been associated with have been trying to get certain work done through Bord Fáilte but I believe the red tape there still is killing some of the projects we have sought to have carried out.  For some years, we have been trying to get something worthwhile in Skerries but we have been frustrated in that regard and I should like the Minister, when he has time, to look into that matter.</P>
      <P>We have also been trying to get something done in Portmarnock, to which resort at least 20,000 or 30,000 people come out from the city.  Even Dublin Corporation is most anxious to make a contribution there, because it concerns the city more than the county while it is only a few miles from the city boundary.  These are detailed matters and I do not want to go into them now, but in general, Bord Fáilte has done a wonderful job since it was established.  Its officers and its organisation generally in this and in other countries deserve the thanks of the Dáil and of the Irish people.  We are definitely grateful to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Irish Tourist Association, while Deputy Barry said he did not think there should be two organisations, I should like to see the second organisation continued.  It has its value.  It is made up of representatives of each local authority throughout the country and it is keeping more people personally interested.  They come to meetings, and whereas Bord Fáilte is a smaller, more compact body altogether, governed and controlled by a board, the Irish Tourist Association <Col N="573" /> is a good body because it is well to have an organisation of public representatives and people generally, whether their criticisms are destructive or constructive.  Such an organisation helps the country and shows that democracy is properly in action.</P>
    <P>These are the great things we have achieved in our time.  No country in the world should be prouder of its semi-State bodies than Ireland because every one of them without exception, has been an outstanding success and we have produced some of the greatest characters of all time in administering the affairs of these bodies.  They are the economic heroes of this nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been said about the various sections in this Estimate that it is difficult to avoid repetition, but I hope to do so. There are two sections of the Estimate on which I have some personal knowledge and which vitally concern my constituency.  I refer to those sections which concern Shannon Airport and the Shannon Industrial Estate.  The present situation at Shannon merits a much more detailed examination than has been given to it up to now.  To get a clear picture of the present setup at Shannon, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between Shannon as an airport and Shannon as an industrial estate.</P>
      <P>For the past few years, the airport at Shannon has had many difficulties to contend with.  Companies came and have gone and there has been considerable fluctuation in the numbers employed there.  The future of Shannon as a passenger airport is indeed very doubtful.  The redundancy in the catering section which occurred in the past week is, I think, the final blow to Shannon as a passenger airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many factors have been responsible in recent years for the present situation at Shannon.  Newer and better types of aircraft have been developed and the transatlantic crossing time has been cut down considerably.  All this has affected Shannon but one factor more than any other which has affected it is the decision to fly the transatlantic jets to Dublin Airport.  There is no doubt whatever that this decision has had disastrous results for Shannon and <Col N="574" /> I am not satisfied that there were genuine grounds for deciding to have the transatlantic air terminal at Dublin Airport.  I feel, and many people at Shannon and Limerick feel, that Shannon should have been the terminal for the jet aircraft and that a feeder service should be operated from Shannon to Dublin and Cork.  In this way, you would have the servicing plants at Shannon and you would possibly have avoided the persistent efforts of the other operators to get into Dublin Airport also.</P>
    <P>I think it is now pretty definite that the introduction of the transatlantic service by Aerlínte has had disastrous results for Shannon.  This was envisaged to a certain extent when Aerlínte was inaugurated.  The Shannon Development Company has seen this and has been trying to develop a freight traffic at Shannon.  It is from this idea of preserving Shannon as an airport that this industrial estate was born.  One of the main objectives of the industrial estate was to promote air freight traffic through Shannon Airport. It now seems pretty definite, particularly from the redundancy in the catering service, that Shannon as a passenger airport has very little future. If we want to maintain Shannon as an airport, the only hope seems to lie in the future development of freight traffic through it.</P>
    <P>Whether this is possible is a very debatable point and one has to look at the industrial estate to see how far it has contributed up to the present in maintaining the traffic at the airport.  I think the results have not been very satisfactory.  Recently I asked a question here seeking the figures for air freight through Shannon and these figures show that only about one-third of the entire air freight through Shannon has been generated by the industrial estate.  The firm which is sending most goods through Shannon is one which is sited at Ennis.  The industrial estate has not generated the amount of air freight which it was expected to generate.  The question now remains as to how far we can expect the industrial estate to contribute to freight traffic at the airport in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> The future of the industrial estate at the present stage of its development raises a considerable number of difficulties, in my opinion.  I want to say that the industrial estate as such has been a success and there is nobody more delighted with this success than I am but we have to be realistic about its future.  A situation has now been reached there where labour is being recruited from long distances.  People are travelling to work at Shannon from distances of 20 or 30 miles.  Within the past fortnight, I had discussions with the company regarding the question of transport to the industrial estate and last Monday week a bus service was provided from my home town, a distance of 30 miles.  About 25 young people are travelling on that bus every morning and returning home in the evening.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy to see them getting on that bus every morning.  I would rather see them go to Shannon than to Birmingham.  These are young people, mainly in the 16 to 18 years age group.  They have to get up at a very early hour in the morning and travel long distances to their work and the question arises whether that long journey impairs their efficiency. The question also arises as to whether they are being compensated sufficiently for the inconvenience of this journey. At the end of the first week, six or seven of those young people who had started off working at Shannon pulled out and decided that they would not continue working there.  The reason was that they were starting in one of the industries and were receiving 50s. a week.  The weekly fare to the estate was 30s., which left them with £1. There were other incidental expenses during the day and from the information I got, I found that on an average they had 7s. 6d. or 10s. at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>This is significant because if the industrial estate at Shannon is to expand and if more industries are to be sited there, provision will have to be made for the subsidisation of fares from outside areas.  Transport from the city of Limerick to the industrial estate at Shannon Airport is subsidised but not <Col N="576" /> beyond Limerick city.  If other industries are to be sited at Shannon, then the Industrial Development Company will of necessity have to examine very carefully the provision of transport from, in addition, the towns I have mentioned.  It is quite likely that there will be different bus service from Newcastle West, Croom, Newport, Castleconnell and all the outlying areas.  It would be very difficult to recruit sufficient labour at these distances, unless conditions were made reasonably attractive.</P>
    <P>There is another alternative regarding the recruitment of labour at the industrial estate, that is, the provision of hostel accommodation at the estate and the provision of housing and other amenities there.  However, in view of the fact that the industrial estate, as such, has not provided the air freight traffic that was expected, one must now ask the question: Is there any reason why future industry should not be located at Limerick city or at Ennis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the future of the industrial estate at Shannon and particularly its contribution to air freight traffic at Shannon Airport.  I believe that this matter will have to be faced up to.  I am not introducing all this or going into it in detail in order to make a case for the establishment of industries in my constituency. If the industrial estate at Shannon is to expand and is to get all its labour requirements, the difficulties I have mentioned will have to be overcome.  Proper transport to the industrial estate will have to be provided and it will have to be subsidised. Alternatively, as I said, it is possible to overcome the difficulty by having hostel accommodation and adequate housing at Shannon.</P>
      <P>Before the Minister interrupted me, I posed a question as to whether or not it is wise to continue to offer the same attractions and inducements to industrialists at Shannon to the disadvantage of Limerick and Ennis and the surrounding areas.  If the industries at present sited at the airport and future industries which may be sited there do not play their part in maintaining Shannon as an airport, by providing freight traffic, then I see no point whatever in siting future industries there.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why these industries could not be set up in the large centres of population I have mentioned. I have already stated that the best customer that Shannon has for air freight is a firm at Ennis.  It is estimated that the cost of conveying goods by air is roughly three times more than that of conveying them by sea between Ireland and the United States.</P>
      <P>This question of Shannon has been a very topical one in Limerick over the years.  Considerable propaganda has been made out of it.  I have seen the posters which have been plastered all over my constituency to the effect that the future of Limerick depends on the future of Shannon.  The people were told, in effect: &ldquo;If you vote for Fine Gael, they will close Shannon. Therefore, Limerick will be a ghost town.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather surprising that the people who were so vocal in the past in lauding <Col N="578" /> Shannon Airport and in condemning the supposed attitude of Fine Gael towards Shannon should be silent in recent weeks when the airport was faced with the crisis of redundancy in the catering section.  I am genuinely interested in the future of Shannon, both as an airport and as an industrial estate.  On numerous occasions in recent weeks and in recent months, I have gone out to the airport and had discussions with various people there and at the industrial estate.  I can assure the Minister that I have raised this matter here and gone into it in detail, not for any personal motives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complicated matter and there are many difficulties to be faced.  Are we now faced with this situation that the future of Shannon as a passenger airport is very much in doubt but that, on the other hand, there is a possibility of developing air freight traffic?  I realise that the development of air freight depends on a number of factors outside the Minister's control, the most important being the success of the present efforts on the part of aircraft manufacturing companies to design aircraft suitable for the carriage of freight.  The future of air freight in general will depend to a large extent on that factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another possibility for Shannon, apart from air freight.  There is the possibility of maintaining the passenger traffic to the airport.  While the proposition has been put forward that the future of Limerick depends on the future of Shannon, I have always held the belief, and still hold it, that the future of Shannon as an airport depends on the development of the entire region stretching from Ennis to Limerick city and county.  There is a very large tourist potential in this area.  I was particularly pleased to note that in recent months the Shannon Development Company has been interesting itself in the promotion of tourism in the area.  This potential could be exploited.  In this area there are the finest fishing facilities in Europe.  There is the River Shannon. Throughout Clare, there are numerous <Col N="579" /> lakes some of which are in process of development and others which have not yet been touched.  There are throughout County Limerick fishing waters which as yet have not been developed commercially.</P>
    <P>Could the Shannon Development Company not get into this matter of promoting tourism in the area adjoining the airport and might it not tackle this matter in a much more determined and aggressive fashion than has been the case up to now?  Another question: Would the Shannon Development Company at this stage be better employed in concentration on the promotion of tourism rather than the bringing of other industries to the airport?</P>
    <P>There is a great deal that can be done by local groups to promote tourism in the area.  I shall instance one little experiment which was carried out, again in my home town, just two years ago.  A local development group, under the auspices of Muintir na Tíre, organised an annual festival.  The idea occurred to us that it would be a very nice thing if, during the period of the festival, many of our exiles could be at home.  All the people from the locality who are living in exile were contacted and a group in New York chartered a special plane which brought to Shannon 135 exiles for that week.  Next year it is hoped that we will have plane loads of exiles coming in from New York and other centres in the United States of America and from Britain.  If local groups received the encouragement they should receive and if the Shannon Development Company made a determined effort to promote tourism in this area and to exploit the tremendous natural tourist attractions there, the future of Shannon as an airport would not be so gloomy as it would now appear to be.</P>
    <P>In this area, there is the added tourist attraction of outstanding hunting facilities.  If there were a progressive and really determined policy, it should be possible to develop fishing and hunting.  By reason of the hunting tradition in the area, where there are several packs of hounds and tremendous hunting country, the tourist season could be extended right through <Col N="580" /> the winter.  Hunting is generally carried on between the months of October and April.</P>
    <P>I put it, therefore, to the Minister, that perhaps, Bord Fáilte and the Shannon Development Company might tackle this question and at some not too distant date, a conference might be held of all interested parties for the formulation of a co-ordinated policy.</P>
    <P>The questions of Shannon Airport and the Shannon Development Company are the two matters with which I am most concerned but there are a few other matters arising on the Estimate to which I wish to refer.  I must confess that I am rather confused by the Minister's attitude towards his responsibility regarding the operations of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I realise that the Minister is not responsible, and obviously cannot be responsible, for the day-to-day administration of CIE but I do feel that, as a member of the Government, the Minister cannot disclaim his moral and social obligations towards the people whose lives and fortunes have been affected by the decisions of the Board of CIE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking of the general question of subsidies, I said here on the previous occasion that there is, even in the Minister's Department, clear evidence of the inconsistent basis of the Minister's argument.  When speaking on the ESB, the Minister said that urban dwellers must subsidise rural electrification to the tune of £1,000,000 a year.  Making that submission, the Minister said it was absolutely essential the people living in urban and highly industrialised areas must bear the cost of bringing electricity to the areas of scattered population throughout the country.  He also dealt with the point of cross-subsidisation, <Col N="581" /> to which Deputy S. Dunne referred, and said you must have that kind of thing in this type of company, if you are to deal in any way adequately with the needs of the people living in those areas.  Here you could not possibly provide a profit and loss type of balance sheet such as Dr. Andrews and the Minister visualise.</P>
      <P>You must face this in relation to running the life of the community, if you are to see everybody is treated reasonably.  It would be quite absurd to suggest that the city areas should have electric current while places in the Kerry, Connemara and Donegal Gaeltachta are left in the candle era. It would be analogous to a situation where the Minister would take over control of, say, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and decide that people in places such as Glencree, Moneystown or Roundwood in County Wicklow, would get mail deliveries only once a week because the service was not paying its way.  The result of that would be that urban centres would benefit at the expense of remote districts and rural depopulation would go on more quickly still.</P>
      <P>It is an absurd proposition but it is the one the Minister is putting before the House.  Our suggestion is that you must provide a continuing system of subsidies for a service of this kind, which is neither purely private enterprise nor a nationalised industry, but one of these horrible in-between hybrids which cannot be made to operate successfully.  The evidence over the years must prove that to the Minister, even making allowance for his obstinacy, and he should have been prepared to accept the point as the Taoiseach accepted it as Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1958, when he brought in the Transport Bill.  He then pointed out that we were trying to do something in relation to transport which most other countries were unable to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the world against trying to do something which other countries have not been able to do. There is no harm in trying to succeed where they have failed, but surely, after three or four years of trying, when you are faced with the hard fact <Col N="582" /> of a £1,700,000 deficit per annum, is it not better to accept that fact and to agree that you are not likely to succeed where others failed?  Taking all the other criteria&mdash;the frequency of timetables, the extent of those timetables, the conditions of service, the attitude of the public to the service, and all the other criteria&mdash;the various European countries faced the reality of an annual deficit.</P>
    <P>The railways lose in Great Britain, as we know; they lose in Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, France, Italy, Norway, Austria, Luxembourg, Portugal.  All these countries have accepted the reality of the position. The Minister suggested that we were suffering from what he called ill-digested social theories.  It seems to me that he is the person who is suffering from this indigestion but it is unfortunate for the country that it is the people who are feeling the pain of this indigestion.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has not bothered to consider the economic implications of the impossible task he has set the Board of CIE, is responsible for this question of redundancy. which CIE now face.  The whole picture of the organisation was investigated by various commissions and finally by the Beddy Commission which was established by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce in preparation for the 1958 Bill.  The whole basis of the proposals in that Bill was the Beddy Report and the Minister for Transport and Power reiterated that fact the other night.</P>
    <P>One of the points mentioned in the Beddy Report on page 198, concerns this question of redundancy, the number of persons who would lose their jobs as the result of the reorganisation proposed.  The report adds:</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that there would be a substantial number of workers whose employment with or in relation to CIE would cease. Whether or not the reduction would be as great as the reduction of 3,569 between 1926 and 1938 is a matter on which, there would be mere speculation.</P>
    <P>While it would be speculation, I do not think we can dismiss this figure of <Col N="583" /> 3,500 odd, add or subtract a thousand either way, as an inconsiderable figure. It is quite clear that the Beddy Commission did envisage a considerable reduction in the total number employed in the CIE network.  This was in the Beddy Report, with most of the fundamental criteria of which I disagree but it is put forward by the Government as their gospel for behaviour in relation to the use of public transport.  Clearly Beddy intended that there should be a very sharp reduction in the total number of persons employed in CIE and we have the Minister telling us in reply to a Parliamentary Question recently that there was a reduction of approximately 200 persons since 1958, a reduction of 200 instead of something in the region of 2,000, 3,000 or more as implied in the Beddy Report.</P>
    <P>One of the things which the Minister should answer is the fact that when we asked this Question, we were given certain figures which did show a reduction of approximately 200 between 1958 and 1962.  I should like to know from the Minister why he gave us that figure showing this approximate reduction of 200 when his annual reports show differently. His annual reports show that 22,109 persons were employed in March, 1959 and 22,146 persons in March, 1962.  Therefore the position is, appalling and all as it was&mdash;looking at it from Dr. Andrews' criterion, profit and loss account&mdash;that according to the Minister, there were 200 people drawing redundancy pay at the rate of £800,000.  Having paid out nearly £1 million in redundancy money, we are now in the completely lunatic position of having over 100 more persons employed in the concern, when Beddy anticipated a reduction of anything up to 3,500 persons.</P>
    <P>This is the management that is put up to us, put up to every urban district council, every county council, every public body, which has the insolence to tell us it will not discuss the affairs of our constituents.  This Dr. Andrews and his associates will not meet us to discuss these matters with them, these people who have made such an appalling, blundering failure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we are faced with the position that over the four years there has been an addition and not a reduction in the total staffs of CIE.  I should like the Minister's explanation for his reply in which he gave certain figures relating to January and October which, for reasons he probably knows very well, did not give a true picture of the staff position, whereas these other figures in his annual report did show there was an increase in the years concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is there this increase but there is, I understand, a difference between CIE and certain clerical unions about the intake of a number of <Col N="585" /> their members.  When that is settled, it will presumably add to the total number employed in CIE.  Hand in hand with that fact, there is a proposal which was reported in the newspapers recently that approximately 140 men in the CIE workshops at Inchicore and Broadstone will be disemployed because of a decision to reduce the maintenance services on the buses and lorries.  If this is true, I should like to have an explanation for it.  Is this another cut which arises from the mistaken belief of the Board of CIE that it must break even by 1964?  I say &ldquo;mistaken belief&rdquo; because we have been assured by the Minister now that there is no fixed date line&mdash;they can ignore it.  He has ignored it and we are going to ignore it.  Is it a fact that this lay-off is being made by the Board in the mistaken belief that they must cut down expenses and show some sort of saving between now and the end of this financial year?</P>
    <P>Alternatively, I should like to find out from the Minister if this is not a retrograde step on the part of the company.  Up to now I understand these vehicles have been serviced at a minimum of once every four years.  I understand that servicing will now only be carried out intermittently, whenever the bus breaks down.  Does this mean we shall have a reduction in the safety standards of CIE and does this reduction in safety standards stem from the belief that they must make this particular economy?  Surely it is most undesirable that there should be this economy in safety standards where the public are concerned?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is as a result of that decision or not but the other night a friend of mine had this unfortunate experience.  As I told the House, it takes 55 minutes to do the 11 or 12 miles to Enniskerry.  This night, it took 2½ hours for the reason that this bus broke down on the road and the lights went out, a highly dangerous thing to happen in the dark. This happened when most of these passengers were on their way home. This is one isolated incident but will it be repeated?  Surely it is very important that we should have the highest standard of maintenance, not only <Col N="586" /> from the point of view of safety but also from the point of view of sound economics.  As regards those of us who have motor cars, we are told that maintenance and after care are very important.  In order to save a few pounds in the next year, are we to jeopardise the type of service we get from the buses and lorries we already have?  To what extent will this reduce the margin of safety for the personnel in and the people driving these lorries and buses?  It seems to me a sort of panic decision by the Board, and a completely undesirable one.  I wonder whether it is one which has the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has attempted to justify his increase in the total intake of staff by suggesting that this breaking-up of the country into areas, with managers in charge of them, is desirable and very valuable from the point of view of the country and will lead to greater efficiency, more business for the company and an improvement in the general control of CIE.  As usual, the Minister wants to have things both ways.  On the one hand, he says we are a country with a colossal agricultural hinterland, on which very few are living; apart from Galway, Dublin, Cork and, possibly, Limerick, there are very few large urban areas.  I have always been given to understand that, to create successful area management, one needs a very highly industrialised society with large population groups, because otherwise people tended to operate in the vacuum the Minister talked about, and there is very little to work on.  This area management business has certainly increased the overheads very considerably because these people are being paid relatively high salaries; they must have office equipment and staff.  Most interesting of all, they all must have motor cars.</P>
    <P>One of the tests I should like the Minister to try out on CIE is to tell these people, as he told us, and as he told the general public, that the CIE service is perfectly adequate throughout the whole of rural Ireland; if one wants to go about one's business, whether it be as shopkeeper, tradesman, businessman, industrialist, or farmer, the Minister adopts the attitude that CIE is running an extremely <Col N="587" /> efficient service to cater for all business. What is to stop the Minister making this point to his employees in CIE?  Could they not use CIE when travelling from place to place?  If it is sufficiently efficient for the rest of the community, why is it not efficient enough for the employees of CIE? Why must they have the added great expense of motor cars?  Surely there is a glaring inconsistency in this.</P>
    <P>The Minister attempts, as I say, to have things both ways.  He has dismissed at one end and he has continued to recruit at the other.  The result is the creation in the public mind of a general impression that the whole concern is out of control.  It is a desperately important one as far as the public are concerned.  It is a very costly one as far as the public are concerned.  Because of that, it is particularly important that it be in the hands and under the control of someone who knows what is going on.</P>
    <P>There was one question, a very vital one, which the Minister did not answer.  Looking at it from the point of view of the public, the ordinary person travelling from place to place in the city, in the town, or in rural Ireland, why is it that there has been no substantial change in the timetable over the past six years?  Why is it that there has not been a speeding up, an increase in schedules, a shortening of the time between services, or the provision as was suggested, of an express service and a slow service so that people could pick whichever they wanted?  Why has there been no substantial change in the timetables? Surely that is a most important consideration from the public's point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister says people are content. I should like to read for him just one communication about the Dublin services.  It is a specific case and it may serve to show the Minister, who probably does not use the service very much, that it is not as satisfactory as he thinks it is.  This lady uses the No. 11 bus service&mdash; Clonskeagh, Ranelagh, Leeson Street. It is quite unable to cope with the morning passenger traffic: &ldquo;If I leave my home at 8.41 a.m., I have to stand <Col N="588" /> at the bus stop and admire anything from five to seven buses passing me, all full, and therefore unable to stop. This means I am frequently late for work.&rdquo;  This lady adds: &ldquo;In the evening, I always walk home as I find this quicker, but I feel you will appreciate that one does not feel like doing this in the morning.&rdquo;  I am sure every Deputy here could produce facts similar to those I have quoted from his own knowledge and from the knowledge of many of his constituents in the various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>It was about complaints of this kind, in addition to the increase in fares, that we wished to see the general manager.  We were not permitted to do so.  It is very worrying and very disturbing to be told that the Minister, and those associated with the concern, appear to think that they are running a satisfactory concern. Whether you take it on the tiny incident of one person trying to get to work in the morning or the extreme of losing £1.7 millions, I do not think there is anywhere in the whole ambit of this institution in which one could say that this is a properly run service giving adequate facilities to the travelling public.</P>
    <P>One of the very few occasions on which Telefís Éireann has been either amusing or interesting&mdash;the Minister will correct me, no doubt, if I am wrong&mdash;was last night when we had a programme about CIE.  One of the people who appeared on the programme was interested in railways. He was asked about a railway carriage which was built 100 years ago and which was in use apparently on the Dublin-Sligo route in 1861.  The interviewer asked how long the journey took.  He smiled at the thought of the old thing chugging its way from Dublin up to Sligo and had visions obviously of a very long journey.  The man who was being interviewed said: &ldquo;It took about four hours.&rdquo;&ldquo;What does it take now?&rdquo; he was asked.  He said: &ldquo;Three hours and 55 minutes.&rdquo; A speeding up of five minutes in 100 years! I should like confirmation of that.  I find it very difficult to believe that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> Does it take three hours and 55 minutes to get from Dublin to Sligo now and did it take just four hours to get to Sligo 100 years ago?  Maybe there is a certain amount of exaggeration in it.  The figures were as I have given them.  If it is true, then surely it is a scathing indictment of the appalling stagnation in thinking in relation to transport and rail services over the years.  It is this attitude which allows the Minister to give the impression that, so long as there is a service, he is not really interested in how the service operates, whether it is a fast or a slow service, a costly or a cheap service, or whether the people are warm or cold when they travel.</P>
    <P>He is under a grave misapprehension also in his comments about the substitution of services.  His attitude apparently is that if you have a railway and find there are very few people travelling on it, all you need do is to provide a couple of buses and a lorry or two and that solves your problem. But of course, as Deputy O'Connor of Kerry, his colleague, pointed out, that is one of the most important fallacies. He said that he had no alternative but to provide a lorry for his own business. That again is just like the lady who walks home from work and makes her protest against the inefficiency of CIE. Businessmen make exactly the same protest by providing themselves with lorries.</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks that because he produces two lorries, or six lorries and three buses, or whatever it may be, that is the end of the business needs in the area.  It is not so at all, of course.  All the business men in the area take exactly the same attitude as Deputy O'Connor and all provide themselves with lorries.  Many of the people who could or would not travel by bus provide themselves with motor cars, and many of them, as we have heard from Deputy S. Dunne, club together and provide themselves with taxis.  Some get bicycles; some get motor scooters. The whole problem is not the simple single issue the Minister says.  It is very much more complex, and that is simply looking at it from the point of view of the business man.</P>
    <P>But if the Minister were to provide <Col N="590" /> adequate alternative transport arrangements on the road, very many more matters are involved.  There is the question of standards of safety and comfort which are very important and were, generally speaking, nearly inseparable from rail travel.  There were occasional accidents, but broadly it was a very safe and sure way of travelling. You usually arrived on time and schedules are well kept.  In order to provide alternative transport arrangements, it is not merely a question of providing two lorries and three buses. First of all, one must provide a first-class highway.  The Minister gave the impression that the local authorities were perfectly satisfied with the consideration they were given by CIE.  The total of the special railway road grants from the Road Fund to local authorities over the past four years is £1,400,000 odd.  That is what they used to call in Hollywood heart balm, or conscience money, given to satisfy county councillors and members of corporations and of other bodies.  It could not possibly begin to pay for the creation of the essential motorways which are needed, if satisfactory and comparably safe and efficient transport services confined to the roads are to be provided.</P>
    <P>If we take even the Bray road of about 11 or 12 miles, we find that it would cost the Minister or the Government approximately £1 million per mile to provide alternative roads for a safe railway transport service.  That would be about £11 or £12 million for the Bray service.  That is a conservative estimate.  The Minister jeers at people here because they are unable, as he says, to make accurate assessments of the costs for running a particular part of a service during any particular time, but he clearly has not begun to understand the true implications of closing down the railway service.</P>
    <P>The fact that the railways are already there is a tremendous capital investment.  What the Minister and his colleagues clearly refused to do was to face the possibility of making rail transport more efficient.  It was accepted right from the beginning, and I do not understand how or why, that there should be a rejection of the possibility of making rail transport <Col N="591" /> more efficient by smaller rail car units, faster services, better time schedules, lower fares and so on.  That appears to have been abandoned from a very early stage.  It seems to me that even leaving aside any other consideration, the Minister has to face the reality of his own figures concerning the increase in transport on the roads.  His figures were that one in every eight persons, or something like that, had a car and that the figure would be doubled in ten years time.  That is probably true.  You are going to have more and more people on the roads in every kind of vehicle they can lay their hands on.  Again, one must consider the question of the density of traffic in the light of the peak period. Everybody knows that in the peak period, if you try to drive from here to Rathmines, to Balbriggan or to anywhere else in the city or outside it, you have to go at about two miles an hour, and to do that under very dangerous circumstances.</P>
    <P>These are the two main facts that the Minister cannot gainsay: the first, that the accident rate and the death rate on the roads is increasing virtually every year&mdash;it does not matter a bit whether it occurs to a person at the peak period or in the other periods, the accidents are happening, and are happening more frequently because of the increased density of traffic on the roads&mdash;and the second, which is, of course, recognised by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, is the necessity of imposing certain speed limits in relation to traffic.  This means that virtually everybody on the road will be going along in certain circumstances at 30 miles an hour, and where there are these colossal oil tankers and great trailer lorries and so on, most of us who might have cars which could do 50 or 60 miles an hour or more will be travelling at the rate of the slowest vehicle on the road, and that will be the vehicle upon which there is a compulsory 30 miles an hour limit. That will be the rate at which the whole transport for business will travel around the countryside, when in fact if you had concentrated on the railways, <Col N="592" /> you would have been able to move to the 80 miles an hour level which I understand British railways and many other railways are trying to approach now.  There is no reason why we should not have reached the same level here if we had hastened slowly, and not taken a great jump before taking this very important decision.</P>
    <P>I have said on a number of occasions that I wrote to the general manager of CIE for some information some time ago and he would not give it to me. I wonder if the Minister could give it.  It concerns the usage of different kinds of engines by CIE.  I was attempting to come to some conclusions on the efficiency of the different types of locomotives which they had brought into use over the years.  However, I did not get the information.  I have looked up the annual report. Deputy Corry was abused because he gave what were alleged to be inaccurate figures and Deputy Lynch was accused of much the same thing.  One of our difficulties is that we cannot get accurate information and that with the information at our disposal, we may arrive at conclusions which are not correct.  We try our best to get this information from the Minister and from the general manager but it is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain to us Page 30 of the CIE annual report for 1962.  There are locomotives noted there for 1961-62, steam locomotives and tenders, diesel electric, diesel mechanical and diesel hydraulic engines and it also gives the various numbers.  One of the matters I would like to know is why it is that in a significant table there are numbers and mileage regarding steam engines and tenders and diesel electric engines but no number is given for diesel mechanical and diesel hydraulic.</P>
    <P>There is a total of 26 of these and I should like to know what was their mileage during that period.  The mileage for the other types of engines is given but there is no figure for the diesel mechanical and diesel hyraulic. Do they exist?  Do they do any work? Are they, like the men, redundant? How long has the Minister had them? <Col N="593" /> What work did he get out of them? How much did he pay for them? Where did he buy them?  How long has he had them?  All this information is missing from this report.  Has it been left out deliberately?  Are they trying to conceal something from the public?  Did they make another mistake about this type of locomotive which they wish to conceal from the public? Was there a big capital outlay on them?  What were their expected years of life?  Did they meet that expectation?  These are the questions which I asked the general manager some time ago but I could not get any information from him.</P>
    <P>We have been met very often by this reticence, to use a mild word, on the part of the Board and the Minister, this refusal to give information. We know that a colossal amount of money was spent on a certain type of locomotive, which could not be used in the way it was intended by the makers because the purchasing commission made a great blunder in their purchase.  Have they done the same thing here?  I should like an answer from the Minister on that matter.</P>
    <P>Taken with their unwillingness to be questioned about the true figures of employment in CIE, with other inaccurate information given to Deputy Lynch about the Tramore railway, and the difficulty Deputy Corry had in finding out about his particular problem in Cork, the difficulty I had myself in finding out the truth about the diesel engines which could only go one way, it is all evidence of an attempt by CIE to run the whole concern as a sort of secret service organisation.  Who is concealing these facts and why are they doing it?  Are they themselves involved and in what are they involved?</P>
    <P>I suppose we were all very surprised to notice that, in spite of the fact that we have this Bill before the House, the Labour Party, Fine Gael, and an Independent Labour Deputy have motions before the House expressing our dissatisfaction at the decisions of CIE, the Board's attitude is to close down more branch lines, presumably because they are trying to hit the 1964 deadline.  Is that the reason they <Col N="594" /> decided to close down the railway to Ballaghaderreen?  I hope the Minister will intervene in this matter.  One of the matters which greatly concerns the development association in Ballaghaderreen is the prospect of an industry being established there.  They are obviously worried that if the railway is not there, it will militate against their getting the industry.  It is a German project which will employ 500 people and a decision to close down the railway at this time, jeopardises the possibility of an industry of this kind starting up in an area which greatly needs it.  I hope the Minister will reconsider this matter and ask the Board of CIE, if he has any access to them and if they take any notice of him, to reconsider their decision in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister would save himself a lot of trouble if he would adopt a more understanding or tolerant attitude to the job of Deputies and the various public representatives who draw his attention to what they consider are defects in CIE.  The other Ministers, on the whole, accept the fact that all their geese are not swans and that there are occasions on which Deputies are right.  The Minister seems to give the impression that the whole integrity is being questioned, if we ask him a question as to how CIE operate when we can get no reply from Dr. Andrews.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider appointing a Transport Commission such as is recommended in the Beddy Report on Page 217?  There it is stated:</P>
    <P>We recommend that this should be undertaken by a Transport Consultative Council consisting of not more than seven persons of eminence in spheres of activity not connected directly with transport and selected for their outstanding personal abilities and wide general experience. We consider it important to preserve the independence of the Council and we are, therefore, of opinion that the members should not be representative of particular interests and should be unpaid.</P>
    <P>The Council should be a purely consultative body.  It should be available for consultation by public <Col N="595" /> and private transport organisations, by representatives of agriculture, industry and trade, by trade unions, professional organisations and by any member of the public.  It should have power to initiate discussions with those engaged in transport or with others on matters relating to transport and should have power to obtain such reasonable information regarding transport as it requires from public and private transport operators and other bodies in a position to supply relevant material. </P>
    <P>I wonder would that suggestion made by the Beddy Report commend itself to the Minister?  It is clearly one way out of the present very undesirable impasse which gives rise to a very considerable level of hostility in this House against the operations of CIE.  Either that or we should have access to Dr. Andrews.</P>
    <P>This concern is losing money and will continue to lose money.  This House recognises that there will be a continuing loss in relation to CIE as operated in this way.  The company cannot possibly meet its debts.  It will not break even by 1964.  All the unpleasantness, a lot of the inefficiency and a lot of the hostility that exists towards the management of CIE all seem to us to stem from the continued retention of these provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed with us that this has no validity in law; that it has no binding force; that it should never have been used in labour court negotiations; that it should not be applied to the workers when they look for increases in pay, shorter hours, a better working week; that it has no relevance when used by the officials of CIE.  The Minister agrees with us that when we ask for a service to be extended in a rural area or when we ask for services to be extended in the cities, when we ask for a more frequent service at any particular time or when we ask for fares to be maintained at a particular level or reduced, it is completely irrelevant and wrong of the officials of CIE to blame this House for the provision that 1964 has been laid down as a date which must not <Col N="596" /> be passed; that they cannot continue to lose money after March, 1964.  This House has laid down that that is so: this is what we have heard from the officials of CIE, acting for Dr. Andrews, acting for the Minister for Transport and Power, on every possible occasion when any extention of service was asked for.</P>
    <P>We have been met&mdash;members of the public, members of trade unions, local bodies, Deputies, whoever they may be&mdash;by this completely dishonest evasion because we have now been told by the Minister that there is no such compulsion at all.  There is no binding compulsion on the company at all to break even by 1964.  Their most important function is to provide an efficient service, a service giving a reasonable standard of comfort at a reasonable rate of fares.</P>
    <P>They must not continue to blame this section for any curtailment in services which they impose or intend to impose on the public.  They must not blame this section for any restrictions they impose on the workers' right to get a proper return for their work.  It is for that reason that we have introduced this Bill.  We hope it will get the support of the House. We do not think the Minister has made his case that the service is prosperous, that it is expanding at a healthy rate, that it has a good standard of public relations, that it has a satisfactory standard of labour relations and that the main factor intervening between the achievement of these objectives is the retention of this section.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to refer to the annual report of CIE.  The Minister claimed that there has been considerable expansion over the years in the activities of CIE, particularly over recent years, under Dr. Andrews. I would refer the House to page 35 of the 1962 Report.  You will find there a series of statistics of operation.  You will find the tonnage of the principal classes of merchandise and minerals carried by goods train originating on the Board's system.  The details in relation to 1961 and 1962 are given. There is a list of the articles carried&mdash; bacon, ham, groceries, grain, gypsum, <Col N="597" /> porter, and so on.  Altogether, 19 items are included.</P>
    <P>There has been a drop in tonnage in 12 of the 19 items between 1961 and 1962 &mdash; and that, of course, includes the part the Minister played up as being the most satisfactory.  In total engine miles there has been a drop.  In goods and in total engine miles there has also been a drop.  In passenger miles travelled, there has been a drop, though there has been an increase of .01 of 1d. in receipts per unit.  Fares have gone up which, of course, explains the fact that receipts have gone up too, to a limited extent. Passenger transport, of course, also has gone down.</P>
    <P>Take the operation of CIE on any of the tests put forward by those who believe in it.  The profit of Dr. Andrews: it is not making a profit; it is making a loss of approximately £1,700,000.  If you take any of the other criteria&mdash;the availability of a service to people living in the remoter areas&mdash;the whole picture of a restriction in the services is being provided. Then there is the increase in transport on the road and the failure to compensate local authorities for the great increase in expenditure, which they may not be paying now but which they certainly will continue to pay in the years ahead, because of the very heavy transport which will be travelling on these roads because of the transfer of traffic to the roads.</P>
    <P>The £3,000 or £4,000 which they now spend to put a light surface on the road will not suffice in the years ahead. The roads will be pounded to pulp in a matter of months.  The question arises of adequate alternative roads <Col N="598" /> to reduce deaths on the roads, to reduce congestion on the roads.  There is the question of the provision of services which are comfortable.  The time schedule is virtually the same.  There has been no improvement in the speed or frequency with which people get from one place to another but merely an increase in the cost of getting from one place to another and a very clear bias against the passenger.  He is now faced with a monopoly in this passenger transport position and, because of that, no appreciable improvements have been made.  As I say, the Dublin to Sligo journey takes much the same time now as it did 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>No matter what test is applied, it is quite clear that the Minister has no case at all for refusing to concede this Bill.  Allowing that we have to give the Minister his responsibility of defending those people for whom he is responsible, allowing that he is bound by that code in not accepting our Bill, I wonder would the Government consider allowing the Bill to go to a free vote of the House, allowing the Deputies who are in their Party and who support this suggestion that we should stop living a lie, that we should face the reality of continuing to subsidise CIE, to vote as they wish?  Would they allow the whole question to be put to a free vote of the House because it can reasonably be said that nearly everybody, no matter from which side of the House he spoke, was either in favour of the Bill or, else was favourably disposed to us, with possibly one exception, Deputy Noel Lemass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to bring agricultural workers within the scope of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, and to abolish the present system whereby they are dealt with by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The Bill proposes to transfer the wage fixing functions of the Agricultural Wages Board to a Labour Court Joint Labour Committee representative of agricultural workers and employers appointed by the Labour Court.  The transfer of functions is effected by deleting two lines from Section 4 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1936, namely paragraph (h), which has the effect of excluding agricultural workers from the scope of that Act.</P>
      <P>Section 1 contains definitions and Section 2 amends the Industrial Relations Act as described above.  The remaining provisions of the Bill are consequential.  Section 3 provides for the repeal of the Agricultural Wages Acts.  The transfer of wages regulating functions to a Labour Court Joint Labour Committee and the consequential operation of the enforcement provisions of Part IV of the Industrial Relations Act render these Acts unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 makes provision for the consequential amendment of the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts of <Col N="601" /> 1950 and 1952.  In future, holiday remuneration and weekly half-holiday remuneration will be fixed from time to time by a Labour Court Joint Labour Committee.  Inspectors appointed under Section 51 of the 1956 Act will be empowered to enforce minimum rates of wages and holiday remuneration.  In short, the Bill presumes the transfer of the staff of the Agricultural Wages Board to the Labour Court.  Section 5 provides for the setting up of the Joint Labour Committee for agricultural workers. Section 6 continues in operation certain statutory instruments made by the Agricultural Wages Board until such time as they are amended or revoked by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>The principal objects of this Bill, introduced in July last, are to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, which according to the Minister for Agriculture have no power to prescribe the conditions of employment for agricultural workers, and to provide for the establishment of an Agricultural Joint Labour Committee under the auspices of the Labour Court which will have power to regulate the conditions of employment as well as the wages of farm workers.  The powers of the Agricultural Wages Board, under Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, are stated to be confined to the fixing of minimum rates of wages, overtime rates and the value of perquisites.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has stated in the House on several occasions that the Board have not power to prescribe conditions of employment. If so, the Agricultural Wages Board are the only wage-fixing authority in the State with no power to regulate conditions of employment.  When the Minister for Agriculture was asked to define the powers of the Board in relation to conditions of employment on 16th May, 1961, he replied that Section 17 of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, did not lend itself easily to the making of an Order by the Board prescribing St. Patrick's Day as a holiday without loss of pay.  All other wage fixing bodies in the State have this power and it is only fair and reasonable that the body charged with the obligation <Col N="602" /> to fix farm wages should also have power to regulate conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>There are 20 Joint Labour Committees functioning under the Labour Court.  Employment Regulation Orders made by the Court have recently reduced the number of hours in the working week, in some occupations, to 45.  In the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1962, the working week is one of 50 hours and the Minister for Agriculture claims that the board has no power to prescribe a working week of 45 hours.  Is it fair and reasonable that the House and the Government should deny agricultural workers the facilities which have been made available to other workers?  Is it fair and reasonable to say to agricultural workers in 1962 that the Wages Board is there to fix wages but not to regulate conditions of employment? If the House and the Government do not accept this Bill they are in effect telling the farm workers that if they want improved conditions of employment they should go on strike&mdash; as they did in 1946 and 1947 in support of a claim for the weekly half-holiday.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of our native industries are based on agriculture or agricultural products and it is ludicrous to find that the body which fixes the wages of milkers has no power to regulate conditions of employment while the body which fixes the wages of butter-makers has this power.  The self-same set of circumstances apply respectively to the &ldquo;harvester&rdquo; in the field and the &ldquo;grinder&rdquo; in the mill.</P>
    <P>The sponsors of this Bill believe that the Government will find it extremely difficult to oppose this reasonable request, namely, that the agricultural wage fixing body should also have power to regulate conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>Some, but not all, of the faults, which the sponsors of this Bill find in the Agricultural Wages Acts, have been described in another measure which was introduced in Dáil Éireann on 16th December, 1961&mdash;the Agricultural Wages (Amendment) Bill (No. 45).  A somewhat longer list of proposals to improve the Agricultural <Col N="603" /> Wages Acts were placed before Dáil Éireann on 1st August, 1961, when the House was considering a measure to give farm workers two weeks' holidays.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages (Amendment) Bill was abandoned because that lengthy and complicated Bill of 16 sections could not remove all the faults in the Agricultural Wages Acts within the limits of a private member's measure.  The sponsors of this present Bill are satisfied that the deletion of two lines in Section 4 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 is the best and the simplest way to modernise and improve the Agricultural Wages legislation.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to point out that there is a set up in the Wages Board which has no parallel in wage fixing machinery in any country in Western Europe.  There is a central board and five regional boards which are set up by the Minister for Agriculture. The Central Board consists of a Chairman to whom I have already referred, three neutral members, one a lady&mdash;I do not know if she knows anything about agriculture; I am sure she is at least neutral&mdash;and two gentlemen both of whom happen to be Fianna Fáil members of the county council but I shall not hold that against them.  I will say, however, that one of them who is supposed to be neutral is the managing director of the firm which employs a very big number of workers in a rural area whose workers' wages are regulated by the rates of wages being paid to the agricultural workers surrounding the town in which this industry operates. How can that person be neutral?  He would not be human if he were neutral.</P>
    <P>There are four farmer representatives on the central board and again one of them, by a coincidence, is a Fianna Fáil councillor.  The other four are small farmers.  They possibly represent farmers' interests but they do not represent the wage-paying farmers' interests.  There are four workers' representatives and again, by a coincidence, three of them are labour members of the county council.  One of the main complaints we have about the Central Agricultural Wages Board <Col N="604" /> is that while it is set up by the Minister there appears to be no effort made to give direct representation to organised farmers and organised workers on that board.  We suggested that if this Bill which is before the House is not adopted, the Labour Court will see to it that these are the people who will be the representatives.</P>
    <P>The five regional boards consist of people who are again selected by the Minister.  They do not have any say in the matter at all because while they may make recommendations to the Central Board there is no obligation on the board to accept that recommendation even if the five members make a unanimous recommendation. The operative word there is &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Again, we find all sorts of people representing the workers on these regional boards.  Because of the fact that the recommendations do not count for very much, it is not very important but just for the record may I say that we have county council road workers, gangers, builders' labourers, even a fellow who was two years working as a builder's labourer in Birmingham representing his area as a workers' representative on the Agricultural Regional Wages Board.  The fact that he did not turn up at any meetings did not matter apparently.</P>
    <P>The Central Board meets occasionally and before they meet there is a notice sent advising them of the date of the meeting.  It is an extraordinary thing that if the weather is bad or if for some other reason nobody is able to turn up at the meeting except the Chairman, the Chairman is a quorum and he can make a decision on his own which is binding.  If everybody turns up and a decision is taken which is not unanimous, in other words if one of the people present decides to be different from the rest, then the Chairman can make a decision which may not be what the majority want or may not be even what the minority want. If that is a democratic way or a fair way to fix wages in the year 1962, then there is something wrong with my thinking.  The sooner that type of thing is done away with the better.</P>
    <P>When the Wages Board was first set up it did a very good job because in a <Col N="605" /> very short time it at least put a floor on agricultural wages.  We all remember the 24/- a week which was the first wage fixed by them and that started the regulation of agricultural workers' wages.  However, for the last 20 years, the Agricultural Wages Board has been completely outmoded and does not provide a proper way of fixing agricultural wages or any other type of wages.</P>

Since then, Deputy Dunne has asked that his motion be considered with the Estimate and he was told that he could speak on his motion but no vote would be taken until the end of the discussion. Can I speak again on Deputy Dunne's motion when it is put to the House?  I was not aware that Deputy Dunne's motion was being discussed and I should like to say a few words on it.</P>

      <P>When I reported <Col N="606" /> progress, I was making some points with regard to CIE.  I said the axe had not as yet fallen on any branch line in my constituency but, nevertheless, a number of problems have been created there.  In the locomotive works at Limerick, there has been considerable redundancy in recent months because of the change over to dieselisation.  I made representations to the Minister, asking him if it would be possible to provide any alternative work at Limerick for those rendered redundant. I suggested that perhaps wagon-building might be an alternative.  My reason for making that suggestion was that some years before, when wagon-building was carried on in Limerick, the output compared more than favourably with other areas.  The Minister informed me that it would not be possible to divert some wagon-building work to Limerick because that would create redundancy at Inchicore and other places.  Something in the region of 29 workers have been rendered redundant.  They had under three years' service and they were paid off.  They did not qualify for compensation. Perhaps, even at this stage, it might be possible to provide some alternative work or put the buildings which housed the locomotive workers to some alternative use to provide employment for those rendered redundant.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise my voice now in support of one section of our transport workers who have been scandalously treated.  I refer to CIE pensioners. Most other sections of the community have received increases to enable them to cope with the rising cost of living.  CIE pensioners have received no increase since 1956 and we have a situation now in which 1,725 pensioners are in receipt of only 12/- per week and about 1,000 others are in receipt of £1.  There is no need for me to make the case that these people are entitled to a decent pension in respect of the service they have given during their working years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that these people could be given an increase without any serious loss to the pension fund, without even seeking any increased contributions, and without any cost to the State.  There is a substantial <Col N="607" /> pension fund.  I understand it is £3,250,000.  I have been informed that this money is invested at something like 4¼ per cent.  Perhaps it might be possible to explore ways and means of investing this pension fund in something which would yield a return of six per cent.?  That would enable justice to be done to this badly treated section of the community. These CIE pensioners were the generation of men who did a great deal for the national cause in their young days. I think they deserve better.  I appeal to the Minister to explore every possible way in order, even at this late stage, to mete out some justice to this deserving section of the community.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I want to say how much I deplore the manner in which the Minister endeavoured at an earlier stage of this debate to put me at a political disadvantage.  When I was trying, consciously and genuinely, and as a result of considerable work over the past three or four weeks, to remedy difficulties at Shannon and to suggest ways and means by which they might be overcome, the Minister interrupted, accused me of double talk, and being against Shannon Airport.  That type of interruption is, I think, unworthy of a Minister in our national Parliament.  It is downright mean and contemptible, and something one might meet at a school debating society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is inevitable that practically the entire debate on the Estimate for the Minister's Department should be dominated by a discussion on transport, with particular, indeed heavy, stress on CIE. Whilst the emphasis in this debate has been on CIE, and particularly on the closing of the railway lines, I do not think we should disregard the other semi-State bodies for which the Minister has control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should hate to see a situation arise in which semi-State and State-promoted bodies would be more or less <Col N="608" /> bundled in with CIE and condemned as being either inefficient or failures. Despite any criticism that might be made about such bodies as Aer Lingus, Irish Shipping, Bord na Móna and the ESB&mdash;I think they are the ones for which the Minister has responsibility&mdash;we can be pretty well pleased with their progress, and certainly pleased with their efficiency.  They are an example of the promotion&mdash;some do not like to use the word &ldquo;establishment&rdquo;&mdash;of industry by the State and the way in which it has been successful. The situation in regard to the railways and CIE generally has not been so happy.  It must be remembered in respect of CIE that, when it was taken over in form in 1943 or 1944, it was not a paying proposition.  It was not regarded as being a success financially.  Everything that has been done since has been an effort to make it successful in efficiency and of course financially.</P>
    <P>I want to say straight away, in case anybody might be under any misapprehension that our motion which suggests a reduction in the Minister's salary, is a Parliamentary device in order to extend the scope of the debate and to allow us to debate the whole question of transport in a very general way or, should I say, in a very detailed way. That has been done by members of my Party and by various other members of the House.  I do not propose to go into it in any great detail, but to make some comments which represent the views of my Party and of the trade union movement affected by the closure of certain of the railway lines.</P>
    <P>I want to say that as far as the Ministry is concerned, we do not feel that the Minister has the free scope that we believed he might have when the new Ministry was created here some years ago.  We envisaged that, when the Ministry of Transport and Power was being established, the Minister would have wider powers and would in fact be responsible to Dáil Éireann for transport extending to the road system.  His Ministry could quite well have taken on that job and taken it away from the Minister for Local Government, because in view of the emphasis which now seems to be laid <Col N="609" /> on road transport it appears rather ridiculous that the Minister, described as the Minister for Transport and Power, has no function about matters of roads and no responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government ought to appreciate this in respect of the semi-State companies for which the Minister is responsible.  No matter what the Acts of Parliament say, the ordinary people, when they think about Aer Lingus, CIE, Bord na Móna or any other semi-State bodies, believe that the Government and the Minister and the members of Dáil Éireann have some responsibility for them and should be able to ask Questions here in the House, to give a certain amount of information to the public, and to be in a position to make complaints, particularly about the general policy which those semi-State companies are pursuing and even to make complaints, not about day-to-day administration but on the affairs generally of those semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the Labour Party, not today or yesterday but many years ago, advocated the establishment from members of the Dáil and Seanad of committees that would be empowered to discuss general policy with the officers of these semi-State bodies, and to make complaints in committees of the House which would comprise members of, say, the CIE Board and its officers, the Dáil and of the Seanad. There would be more public confidence in the semi-State bodies if such a method were adopted.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for us to appreciate the role of the Minister for Transport and Power in respect of the ESB, CIE, Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus, Irish Shipping, etc.  I personally find it very difficult to understand what his role is, because it seems that when the Minister has to make a speech outside this House&mdash;and he has occasion to make very many speeches&mdash;he seems to be able to tell his listeners very much more about CIE, about tourism, about Bord na Móna or these other semi-State companies than he seems to be able to tell us here in Dáil Éireann.  I do not think anybody wants to badger the Minister, and certainly nobody <Col N="610" /> wants to badger Deputy Childers as such, with petty questions as to why there was such-and-such a charge on such-as-such a route or why a particular man was sacked by CIE, Aer Lingus or any other company.  But it is not unreasonable, even when the Minister disclaims a certain amount of responsibility for day-to-day administration, that, when a Deputy asks him a Question in this House, he should be able to get the information through his officials from the officials of the semi-State companies and be prepared to give it here in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not say he is discourteous when he refuses to do that, but it would appear more courteous if he were to answer these Questions that are tabled from time to time in the Dáil, because the public do not understand when they make a complaint to a Deputy and he in turn raises the matter in the Dáil, if the Deputy is not able to get an answer or the Minister refuses to give an answer on the basis of his not being responsible for the administration or what is sometimes described as the day-to-day policy of Aer Lingus, CIE and the rest.</P>
    <P>We have a similar situation in respect of Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.  We know and admit that the legislation says that the Minister has no power to interfere in the policy which this particular State company pursues, but the public would have greater confidence and much greater respect for these semi-State bodies if the Minister for Transport and Power, and in the case which I have mentioned, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, would transmit the information sought by Deputies which he could readily get from those semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Over and above all that, again, to ensure greater public confidence, the Minister or at least the Government&mdash; because the Minister is not the Minister for all the semi-State bodies &mdash;should seriously consider the idea of the establishment of House Committees that would be in a position to question the members of the board of directors or officials from these semi-State bodies.  Such a committee should <Col N="611" /> act in somewhat the same manner as the Committee on Public Accounts, which is regarded as one of the most valuable committees in the House, and regarded by its members and by Deputies who are not members as an admirable way to check on the administration of the various departments by the elected representatives. It is very difficult for the ordinary man in the street to understand why he cannot get information from a Minister about these semi-State companies when, on the other hand, he as a taxpayer is expected to pay any losses that may be incurred or to pay through taxes subsidies that may be given from time to time by the Government to the various semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>Again I find very difficult to understand&mdash;and I trust the Minister will clear it up in his speech&mdash;the statement of his in the debate last week in reply to, I think, Deputy Lynch as to who was responsible for the policy that was being pursued by CIE.  The Deputy had occasion to mention the name of the Chairman of CIE, Dr. Andrews.  I hope that I do not have occasion to mention his name in my short speech, but the Minister ought to appreciate, and I am sure Dr. Andrews himself appreciates, that if his name comes up here in this House, and if there appears to be severe criticism, it is not criticism of Dr. Andrews as a person, but as the person who is pursuing the policy with which a Deputy disagrees.</P>
    <P>I do not think those in charge of semi-State companies should be above criticism.  I would deplore any scurrilous attack on those people.  I would deplore any allegations to the effect that they were doing this, that or the other with some ulterior motive.  I do not say this by way of criticism, but I think those in charge of semi-State companies, who have pretty substantial salaries judging by our standards in any case, accepted responsibility. Theirs are public appointments and I think any criticism of them is valid and should not be regarded by them&mdash; I know that most of them do not&mdash;or by the Minister or any member of the Government, as unfair criticism.  If they are pursuing a policy they should <Col N="612" /> be prepared to accept responsibility for it.</P>

However, I do not think they should be above criticism.  Knowing some of them, as I do, I do not think they regard much of this criticism as being unfair&mdash;although it has been described as unfair in some cases by the Minister and other members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not act unless he believes the policy which is being pursued is contrary to the legislation, and within the legislation the board of directors can do anything.  That seems to me to be the position.  As the Minister has said, if he believes that the policy which is being pursued is wrong&mdash;it does not necessarliy have to be wrong: the Minister says that if it is not in accordance with the legislation&mdash;he acts.</P>
      <P>They have pretty wide terms of reference under the 1958 Act.  That is the reason why there is so much criticism of what they have done in closing branch lines and rendering a certain number of men redundant. That is permissible within the Act, but what we are trying to say on this side of the House is that what they have done generally seems to be far-reaching and undesirable, has disrupted the transport services in various parts of the country, and has certainly caused a certain amount of redundancy.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister that there is a great feeling of fear and uncertainty amongst the transport workers of this country generally.  The board of directors and the Chairman of CIE have been charged with doing a certain job.  They were told that they must, in effect, make CIE a paying proposition within a period of five years.  I have no hesitation in saying that that legislation was generally supported in this House.  It was supported by the Labour Party and by the trade union movement.  I do not remember what the Fine Gael attitude was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that was the view of the House in 1958, I do not think it could be described as unreasonable if the Minister or anyone else decided in the middle of that period that the method by which that undertaking was to be achieved was too ruthless and damaging, that the legislation should be amended to provide for a date later than 1st April, 1964, and that what is <Col N="614" /> being done by the Board of CIE is too drastic.</P>
    <P>The 1958 legislation was passed on the assumption that a subsidy of £1,175,000 would be paid for the five years and after that period CIE would, so to speak, break even.  The latest figures that have been disclosed show that there was a deficit of £1,696,000 for the year ending 31st March, 1962. We were told, of course, that the deficit reached such proportions because of the eighth round of wage increases and the readjustment of the hours of employment of railway workers.  Someone said&mdash;I do not know whether it was the Minister&mdash;that the deficit for the present year is expected to be something the same as it was for the previous financial year, that is, something like £1¾ million.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to believe that CIE will break even by the 31st March, 1964, when one remembers the amount of their deficit last year and when one considers what it appears their deficit will be for the present year.  Therefore I believe the five year period was much too optimistic in 1958.  I suppose it did not appear optimistic when we discussed it in 1958.  Now, with the clamour there is &mdash;and in some cases it is justified&mdash; about the closing of railway lines and the amount of redundancy, we should have second thoughts and decide to extend the period by a number of years.  It has just occurred to me that at 7.10 p.m. we voted that that would not be the case, so I suppose there is no point in pursuing it any longer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked a very pertinent question: could CIE ever be self-supporting?  He went on to say that very few, if any, transport systems in western Europe were self-supporting. Therefore, I think we should regard transport as a service and certainly we should regard the railways as a service, perhaps in the nature of a social service.  We have many social services that do not pay in many respects in many of their branches and yet no one decides that those uneconomic branches should be cut off.  No one suggests, for example, that a postman who has to go twice a week perhaps up a mountain for a distance of three or four miles should be sacked.  It is uneconomic <Col N="615" /> for him to deliver a postcard with a 2d. stamp three or four miles away, but it is regarded as an essential service in the community.  Other parts of the country have to subsidise that service and perhaps there is also a subsidy by way of direct taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Post Office balances at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That service, where the postman goes every day to a remote part of the country with a twopenny postcard, cannot be regarded as an economic one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE will always lose on a great many services, even if they do balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is over the degree of loss that we differ.  I have not yet had experience of railway closures in my constituency, but I assume that will happen.  Deputies are frustrated because they cannot get information to convince them that a line should be closed down.  I have listened for months to Deputies Lynch, Kyne and Corry.  Their sources of information have been very limited indeed and they have yet to be convinced that certain lines in their constituencies should be closed down.  Indeed, Deputy Corry purported to produce evidence that one of the branch lines in his constituency which it is proposed to close down was actually a paying proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if CIE have bad public relations but they have not got a very good reputation recently.  I am not referring to the guards, ticket collectors and so on.  But the officials who administer the affairs of CIE at Kingsbridge appear, from what I have heard, to be people not prepared to co-operate to any great extent with the public when it comes to providing information as to whether a branch line was run at a profit or a loss.  The Board and officers of CIE should implement the promise which was certainly made by the Taoiseach when, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he said that before a <Col N="616" /> branch line was closed, there should be full consultation.  That certainly did not happen when the Waterford-Tramore line was closed down.  There was a softening when it was announced recently that further branch lines were to be closed, but by and large consultation has not appeared to be satisfactory and the deputations always appeared to be presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> They get a nominal hearing and no more.  CIE should have a better system of public relations so that the public will have a little more confidence in Kingsbridge.</P>
    <P>I would say&mdash;and I speak again from information supplied to me by the trade union movement&mdash;that some of the appointments in CIE, where the appointees had to deal with the workers, were not very happy ones. We had some unofficial strikes in CIE. I have no hesitation in saying that unofficial strikes in any circumstances are to be deplored.  Unfortunately, men are human and these unofficial strikes did occur.  I am informed it was because of the attitude of certain CIE officials, newly-appointed men. I would therefore suggest to the Minister that if he is responsible for the policy of CIE, he should advise the Chairman and responsible officials to be extra careful in the selection of men who have day-to-day dealings with the public or, as in this case, with the workers.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will agree with me or not&mdash;he has much more information than I have&mdash; but my information is that CIE has become a happy hunting ground for industrial consultants.  Despite the fact that hundreds of minor workers have been rendered redundant over the past three years, there are now more on the clerical staff of CIE than there were two or three years ago.  It is difficult, unless the Minister has a satisfactory explanation, to reconcile that with the redundancy that has occurred.</P>
    <P>I had occasion here at Question Time to deny vehemently to the Minister that there had been consultation in two cases of redundancy in Dublin and Cork.  I am afraid I was wrong.  I want to confess that.  My <Col N="617" /> information was wrong.  I was not entirely wrong, however.  Let us say that I was half wrong and that the Minister was half wrong also in his allegation to me.  I said there had been no consultation whatsoever.  In fact, there was consultation with the constituent unions of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions but there was no consultation with the body originally consulted when it was suggested there would be redundancy in CIE, that is, the executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Therefore, I suggested by way of Question that the Minister should ensure that in all cases of redundancy&mdash;and the cases to which I referred were major cases of redundancy&mdash;there should be consultation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, if the Minister and the Board of CIE are to have the confidence of trade unions generally.  It is not sufficient merely to consult with a group.  It is necessary to have consultation with the body originally consulted in 1958 or 1959 when redundancy was mentioned and rates of redundancy compensation were discussed and agreed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised another point here.  I should like again to demonstrate its importance, as far as trade unions are concerned.  I mention it again to make sure I will get a reply. There is a statutory obligation in respect of compensation for redundancy or worsening of conditions up to the end of July, 1963.  Is it intended that, as the legislation suggests, there will be no such thing as compensation for redundancy after July, 1963, or does the Minister contemplate amending legislation to ensure that those who will be rendered redundant after that period will get compensation?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister be able to tell me whether the ESB have any obligation to provide a certain amount of power to users of electricity?  Apart from the fact that the ESB generally seem to get away with murder, we regard them as being pretty efficient. They may be ruthlessly efficient.  This description could be applied to many of the other semi-State organisations as well.  The ESB were established in 1926 or 1927 and the Minister should <Col N="618" /> ensure that they fulfil their obligations to the public.  When it comes to paying bills, erecting poles on farmers' lands and that sort of thing, they are the kingpins.  They can do what they like.  The people of this country are required to pay their bills promptly. I would say that there are very few bad debts, as far as the ESB are concerned.</P>
    <P>What do we do in a situation where they give very weak power to users of the ESB?  I assume that the voltage that should be supplied, say, to an ordinary house is in the region of from 220 amps or volts to 230 or 250 amps or volts.  So I am told.  We have a situation where it goes down to 200. There is very little, if any, power.  One cannot use the ordinary electrical gadgets if the voltage goes down to 200 as it does.  I know it from experience. You just cannot get a television picture.  It is not even sufficient to work an electric razor.  That has gone on in the area in which I live&mdash;I do not mind confessing it is my area&mdash; for weeks and months.  Therefore, if the users of the ESB are required to fulfil their obligations as far as prompt payment and that sort of thing is concerned, I think that the ESB in turn have also a responsibility to provide normal power.</P>
    <P>There was very little discussion, I think, on tourism.  There is only one aspect of that which I want to mention and maybe it was already mentioned in the debate.  I refer to the extension of the tourist season.  The extension is meant to embrace the ordinary folk in this country.  Without talking about the matter at length, I wonder if the Minister has anything to tell us with regard to the extension of the school holidays?  There is no use talking to an Irish farmer about an extension of the tourist season, so long as his children have to remain in school, as they do in most cases, until the first week in July or the last two weeks in June. I do not know whether the Minister has discussed this problem with the Minister for Education.  It is futile and silly to talk about an extension of the tourist season in the first part of the year, unless there is some change in the matter of school holidays.</P>

      <P>We will have to live with that.  The Minister is going to have quite an amount to reply to in his speech.  I know it is not possible for him to deal with local matters but what I want to talk about now is a local matter of some importance.  It concerns the fate of Rosslare harbour. I deliberately refrained from mentioning in the past few weeks the rumours that have been going around about the possibility of the closure of Rosslare harbour by the British Railways Commission&mdash;I think that is what they call it.  Personally, I do not want to wake up some morning to get the newspaper and discover that Rosslare harbour is closed.  I am informed that an order to close it would need legislation in the British Houses of Parliament and legislation in this Parliament.  I should be very pleased to have that confirmed.  I took an opportunity of mentioning the matter to the Minister in private one time and he did say that to me but it sounds better to get that information in the House.  Perhaps the Minister would, therefore, spend 30 or 60 seconds in refuting these rumours because, again, there is a feeling of insecurity among the workers and the people of Rosslare harbour generally.  I should be satisfied if the Minister would tell us that he knows nothing about it or, better still, that he has made inquiries and such is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch and some other Deputy referred to what appeared to be a lack of facilities on the Rosslare-Fishguard service and the danger there is to passengers by reason of overcrowding. I made inquiries and I was assured by the agents of British Railways in Rosslare harbour that they sail strictly under the British Board of Trade regulations.  These regulations provide that the ship shall carry only so many.  If there are abuses on this line, it is the bounden duty of the Minister for Transport and Power to have them investigated.  It is the duty of the British Minister for Transport also to have them investigated but, as Rosslare happens to be in my constituency, I should like the Minister to make some comment on the matter. <Col N="620" /> If there are abuses, they should be corrected; if there are not, the allegation should be denied.</P>

      <P>My intervention in this debate will be of very short duration.  Since I came into the House 12 months ago, I have put down a few questions concerning CIE.  I was informed that they were not the responsibility of the Minister.  I should like to refer to the failure of CIE to provide adequate road transport for the carriage of livestock.  In my constituency where there are cattle marts, CIE have failed utterly to provide adequate transport for the farmers.  In some cases, farmers require to get their cattle to the mart by 11 or 12 o'clock. The mart generally starts at 12 o'clock. In some cases, the CIE truck arrived at 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening when the sale was almost over and when all the buyers were gone.  I tabled a Question recently about this.  In his reply, the Minister said he did not hear of any complaints and that he would be surprised if my statements were correct.  I presume that most of the complaints received by the Department were put in the wastepaper basket.  Some of them were referred back to the local office and, of course, they replied that they fulfilled their obligations as best they could.</P>
      <P>There have been several complaints regarding this.  I have a few here. In one case where there was a prosecution because a man employed a private haulier, an unlicensed carrier, he said that on previous occasions he engaged CIE to transport cattle to the mart but he always found the service unsatisfactory.  In fact, on one occasion CIE had arranged to collect the cattle at 11 a.m. and instead their truck did not arrive until 6 p.m., with the result that he was unable to dispose of the cattle in the mart that day. That meant he had the added expense of bringing them in on another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to remove all restrictions on private hauliers for the transport of livestock, especially to cattle marts.  It occurs only on one day per week and it is understandable that CIE could not provide adequate transport to bring in 1,000 <Col N="621" /> cattle when they have only two or three trucks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In case the Deputy is not in the House when I am replying, would he send me full particulars of these cases of cattle transportation that were not done efficiently and I shall make inquiries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDunne" hpid="Mr. T. Dunne Mr. T. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly do that, and plenty of them.  Yet, the Department of Local Government will not refuse taxation from those carriers.</P>
      <P>Some CIE pensioners are living on 12/- per week while more, who are lucky, get 51/3 per week but, at the age of 70, that sum is reduced 20/-. I do not know why and I should like the Minister to refer to that when replying.  Those pensioners have served CIE over many years, some for over 40 years, starting at 1/- and working their way up to 3/6 a week. It seems to be a grave injustice to reduce their pension to 21/6 when they reach 70 when this pension is something they have paid into all along.  I should also like the Minister to state how much is in the pension fund, as I am told it is quite substantial.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated some time ago that the bottled gas subsidy would be paid to people who installed bottled gas because of the exorbitant special service charge imposed by the ESB. He said the subsidy would be paid to anybody who installed this gas since 1st April, 1962, I think.  I ask the Minister to consider the people who installed bottled gas prior to that date.  They were forced to do so because of the excessive special charges by the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer is the subsidisation of luxury hotels by Bord Fáilte.  Very large grants are given for those hotels while the charges for meals and refreshments in those places are prohibitive for most people.  They generally cater for tourists but 95 per cent. of our tourists are our own people who have been forced to emigrate to England and elsewhere and they return here for holidays.  In conclusion, I should particularly like <Col N="622" /> the Minister, when replying, to deal with the CIE pensioners and the subsidy on bottled gas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House knows, CIE in the course of the last week published their intention to close down the Ballaghaderreen-Kilfree branch line.  The company alleged in their statement that this decision had been taken after consultation with local bodies.  I have made inquiries of all organised bodies and I am satisfied those consultations did not take place.  The second aspect of this decision to which I want to refer concerns a proposal by a German industrialist to establish a factory near Ballaghaderreen.  Before I add anything in regard to the factory, perhaps I should make my own position clear in regard to the branch line.</P>
      <P>I am aware, and the public are aware, that this line has been mentioned by CIE for quite some time past as one likely to be closed.  I realise that CIE have a statutory duty so to prune the railway system as to ensure, if possible, that it will at least break even in 1964.  I share the doubts of previous speakers as to the possibility of CIE achieving that objective in 1964 or even later.  I also realise that the decision to close down many branch lines has been due to lack of local support for the railway and that, in regard to Ballaghaderreen, the accusation that local traders, with some notable exceptions, did not support the line sufficiently, justly lies.  Like Deputy Corish and many other speakers, the people of that area in which I live, and I as their representative, feel absolutely entitled to know how CIE established that this particular branch line has incurred a loss of £9,000 in the past year.</P>
      <P>It must be perfectly obvious to the Minister now that all sides of the House are dissatisfied, not that CIE have a job to do and must do it as best they can, but that the justice of their decision has not been made manifest to the people and to the representatives of the people concerned.</P>

      <P>In connection with the Ballinrobe closure, some time ago, <Col N="623" /> I wrote to CIE and asked them to receive a deputation of representatives from South Mayo.  I stated that we would like to have available to us at the meeting a breakdown of the figure given by CIE in justification of their decision.  I was told that if I did not withdraw the request for a breakdown of the figures, we would not be granted an interview at all.  I think that is appalling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and makes nonsense of the function a Deputy is supposed to fulfil, and is in duty bound to fulfil, as representative of his people.  Subsequently, Parliamentary questions were put down and the Minister replied to them.  I asked the Minister here if he approved of the attitude of CIE in regard to this request of mine and he said that he did.  If there is a reason that can stand examination, I have yet to be told of it and I am most anxious to be given it even now, two years afterwards.</P>
      <P>It may be perfectly true that the Ballaghaderreen-Kilfree line has lost £9,000 in the past 12 months but on the basis of the figure which CIE have furnished, the local people are in no way satisfied as to the manner in which this figure was calculated.  I am told&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the figure given to me.  I am told from inquiries made locally that that is the figure which was given to the Development Association.  I am also told that the income officially given by CIE for the branch line in respect of that period is not much over £1,000.  Again, if this figure is accurate, some explanation must be forthcoming to show why one firm alone, which during that period paid close on £4,000 to CIE, should not be given value for that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy evidently has not read my speech.  I made it <Col N="624" /> perfectly clear in my speech on the Transport Bill.  He should read my speech before he comes in here and makes these statements.  I gave a full explanation of the difference in figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not jump to conclusions.  I am not saying that the Minister has not given an explanation.  What I am saying, and what I now repeat, is that CIE should give to the representatives of the people involved wherever a branch line is being closed, clear and unequivocal evidence to show how they arrived at this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They have given it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not.  They did not give it to us in the case of the Waterford-Tramore line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is correct in saying that they have done so, how is it that CIE were allowed to get away with the attitude they adopted some time ago with regard to the closure of the Ballinrobe-Claremorris line?  These are the things which very much agitate the public mind and again I repeat that local people, in the main, realise that CIE have a duty to perform and realise perfectly well that, if CIE are not sufficiently supported by local interests, the branch lines must go.</P>
      <P>The difference between the situation with regard to the Ballaghaderreen-Kilfree line and other branch lines is that one of the considerations which led the German promoter of the factory in question to decide on Ballaghaderreen was the presence of the branch line.  At the time he communicated his decision to the local Town Development Association, the Association asked the Industrial Development Authority to be kind enough to advise CIE of the position and ask them not to take any action which would prejudice the chances of Ballaghaderreen getting the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the closure of the branch line will have no effect whatever on our chances of getting the factory but we do not know that as yet and I am not sure that CIE know it either.  Our immediate request is, and will be, that until such time as <Col N="625" /> this question is resolved, CIE should not close down the line altogether and should at least maintain a freight service between the town and the junction.  I believe they could do that more economically than by continuing the present service which I personally accept is not fully economic at the moment.  Whether it would be sufficiently economic to justify its remaining as a freight service only is a question that we would like to go into with CIE and be satisfied with their decision.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, as I say, we do not know what the effect of this decision will be on the chances of the locality obtaining this much-needed factory.  If the decision of CIE to close it down&mdash;and mark you, the promoter has said that he would send all of his produce, which would be 500 to 1,000 tons per week at full production, by rail&mdash;adversely affects Ballaghaderreen, which is already a depressed area, CIE will have, in effect, dealt a mortal blow to the locality.</P>
    <P>It is a modest enough request&mdash;perhaps I should say too modest a request &mdash;first, that the figure given by the company should be shown to be accurate, and secondly, that the vital interests, social or otherwise, of the locality should not be prejudiced until such time as the picture is absolutely clear with regard to this industrial project.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in intervening this evening was to mention this matter. I propose to deal with only one other matter and that concerns the recent steep rise in hotel charges throughout the country.  I hope the Minister will bend his efforts to have Bord Fáilte concentrate in the next few years on family type hotels rather than on luxury palaces.  I believe in at least one town there are already three luxury hotels too many.  It is a mistake to cater for the five per cent. and the ten per cent. trade and not concentrate more on the family type hotel from which we can hope for the real expansion in our tourist industry in years to come.</P>
    <P>Recently in another country, I stayed in a hotel in a very large room with a large lounge and a private bath at a cost of 23/- a night.  In first-class restaurants in the same city, there was <Col N="626" /> no item on the menu which costs more than 7/6d.  We should aim at keeping down the cost to the very minimum and in concentrating on luxury type hotels, we are not going to achieve that.  Some of the bills which I saw given to people last summer who stayed at first-class, grade A hotels, shocked me to the core.  I accept that there are plenty of people who can afford to pay these accounts, but they are not the people on whom the future of the tourist industry in this country depends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot during the course of this debate about the obligation imposed on CIE to pay their way by 1964.  I have no great objection in principle but I have the strongest objection to CIE paying their way at the expense of the Dublin workers.  Once again this year, it is necessary to protest in this House against the inadequacy of the services provided by CIE in Dublin city and the extremely high fares they are charging for these inadequate services.  There is no justification for this state of affairs. CIE are making excessive profits by the operation of the road passenger services in the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>We do not know exactly what those profits are.  For the year ended 31st March last, CIE made £511,000 on the operation of road passenger services over the whole country.  In the year prior to that, CIE made £764,000 and in 1960, CIE made almost £1 million, actually £868,000, on the operation of its road passenger services.  We all know that in many parts of the country rural bus services are running empty 90 per cent. of the time and it is therefore reasonable to conclude that the profit made in Dublin city is in excess of the total road passenger profits shown by CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, if he wishes to refute that accusation, must disclose to the House what profits CIE are making on the operation of the road passenger services in Dublin.  Today, in answer to a Parliamentary Question put down by me, he refused to disclose that basic and fundamental piece of information. He cannot say that he does not know it and, if he does not know it, he should know it.  The Chairman of <Col N="627" /> CIE has also refused to disclose this information which is available to him when he wrote to me on 8th March stating that he was sure I would understand that the form of CIE accounts which is published was the form required by Government Departments and that that form gave very full information. He added that he disliked very much to seem to stall on this question but hoped I would understand that the whole question at issue was that of the freedom of CIE to conduct their day-to-day operations.</P>
    <P>What has the disclosure of their profits for Dublin city to do with the freedom of the day-to-day operations of CIE?  There are too many complaints coming from Deputies on all sides of the House of their treatment in a high-handed and dictatorial manner by CIE.  The Minister is responsible for the form of accounts presented by CIE.  That form is laid down by the Minister and can be varied at his option under Section 34 of the Transport Act of 1950.</P>
    <P>The services provided by CIE in Dublin city are consistently deteriorating. The fares charged by CIE in Dublin city are outlandish.  Deputy Declan Costello was compelled to complain here last week that in a major housing estate in his constituency not one shelter was erected by CIE.  That is in the vast housing area of Finglas.  The same thing can be said of several parts of the city. The Corporation makes suggestions to CIE that they should run summertime services from outlying housing areas to the seaside.  They are not listened to for a moment.  When the request is made that concession fares should be made available to old age pensioners and people in receipt of social service benefits, as is done in Britain, the answer is that CIE have to pay their way by 1964 and that they cannot afford to provide these concessions.</P>
    <P>There is many a Dublin worker paying 20/-, 25/- and 30/- a week to reach his place of employment.  One of the most significant things about our outlying developments, from which the bus fare to the city can be 9d., 10d. and 11d., is that they are not self-contained. <Col N="628" /> Not only have the workers to travel a considerable distance to their work but their children may have to travel considerable distances to school and their wives also have to travel considerable distances to do their shopping.</P>
    <P>Between 1953 and the current year, bus fares <i>in toto</i> have increased by over 50 per cent and on many routes in Dublin city they have increased by much more.  The manner in which CIE can fiddle the fare stages in order to ensure that the people travelling on the most popular parts of the service have to pay the most is a stratagem which has been closely studied by the experts of CIE.</P>
    <P>The total receipts from the Dublin city services are disclosed in the annual report, although the profits are not.  On page 39 of this year's report, the total receipts are shown to have increased by £260,000.  Nine months ago, when the workers of CIE obtained their wage increases, we were told in the Press, and I was told by the Chairman in writing, that to implement those wage increases for the Dublin city passenger services would cost the company £350,000.  We were further told that the fare increases which were being made would fall short of providing that by a small amount.  Then we come along and see the annual report and find that revenue, far from falling short of the amount necessary to meet the increased wages, has increased by £260,000.</P>
    <P>In the period covered by that report, CIE had the benefit of the increase in fares for only three months.  The report deals with the position in the year ending in March last and the fares were increased in January.  It is pretty clear that unless there is another wage increase&mdash;and that is unlikely&mdash; the profit on the Dublin city passenger services will be substantially greater in the year ended 31st March next and we may then see the position which arose in 1960 repeated when the road passenger services yielded for the whole country a profit of £868,000.</P>
    <P>This principle of subsidising the losses incurred in other sectors of CIE operations at the expense of the workers of this city is one against which any Dublin Deputy with half a <Col N="629" /> conscience must protest.  We hear all around us complaints from rural areas.  It often seems to me that we Dublin Deputies are not nearly vocal enough in making demands on the Minister in this House.  The problem of the branch lines is one on which I have no comment to offer, except to say that I strongly object to the losses on branch lines being met by the workers of Ballyfermot, Cabra, Donnycarney and Crumlin, for it is in fact the working people of this city who are making the fullest use of CIE services&mdash;those people who do not run their own private cars.</P>
    <P>From the administrative point of view, it is surely most unsound to permit CIE to issue an annual report which, for all its gloomy appearance, contains such relatively meagre information.  I wonder if the Minister has ever seen the annual report of the National Coal Board in Great Britain, the major State body in that country. I happened to see it recently, more by accident than anything else.  I was amazed at the extent of the detailed information shown in that report.</P>
    <P>We in this House represent shareholders in CIE.  We are, as a speaker said here last week, entitled to expect from the Minister the same full accounting of his stewardship of CIE as would be given at the annual general meeting of the shareholders of any public company.  A board of directors of public company which treated its shareholders in the manner in which the Board of CIE treat Deputies would not stay very long in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>To enter a debate such as this on transport and power puts one in a very difficult situation. When we are discussing a subject such as transport and power, we should at least be supplied with the facts as we want them.  That has not been the case.  We have been deprived of information &mdash; that grievance has been voiced by members from every side of the House &mdash; which was absolutely necessary for our case and to enable us to make an intelligent contribution to this debate.  That was our first difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> Our second difficulty, which is the most important of all, to my mind, is the fact that we are dealing with a Minister who is ignorant of the situation as it exists in the country today. That was proved beyond yea or nay from his own benches last week by Deputy Corry.  The Minister told us that a place was being serviced by a bus but Deputy Corry said that a bus had not been on that road for 20 years. In such a situation, how can we make a contribution and how can we help the people who sent us here to inquire into and to see that the business of each Department is run in the best interests of our people?  We have to face that situation before we voice our opinions on this Estimate this evening.</P>
    <P>Bearing these things in mind, there are a few matters which we have groped out of the darkness and out of the fog in the Minister's approach to the whole situation.  First of all, I am convinced that unless the Minister had something to hide, he would let the whole question out into the open. Therefore, there is a reason for his depriving us of the facts.  He cannot, because of the startling revelations that would be made, give us the facts and figures as we want them.</P>
    <P>We are told in this House that people in CIE who become redundant will be compensated and that, miracle of miracles, CIE will be a paying proposition in 1964.  There is one matter we must bear in mind.  While these people are being compensated, it is the taxpayer on the street who is paying the compensation.  If we cannot create the situation which the Minister has in mind, the situation where CIE will be paying their way in 1964&mdash; which they will not do&mdash;we must ensure that the money given by way of redundancy pensions will be offset against CIE and not against the man drinking his pint of stout or smoking his cigarette or eating his bread or against the unfortunate old age pensioner with his increase of 2/6d. a week.</P>
    <P>Let us be fair and let the Minister be honest with us, as he is not being honest.  We have heard a lot about the closure of branch lines.  Thanks <Col N="631" /> be to God, my constituency is half lucky in that respect.  However, I am wondering what will be the next move and where it will be.  I am wondering where we will come along with the one-man bus.  What about the redundancy of the conductors, which he has in mind, and putting one man on each bus&mdash;a driver only and no conductor? I want the Minister to tell us the future policy of CIE with regard to the one-man buses.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this transport question which I want to bring before the Minister.  My information is that a one-man lorry, with trailer, is illegal in Britain and in Northern Ireland and that no one man can travel bearing a trailer behind his lorry.  This is the position with CIE.  The Minister says one day he is responsible and the next day says he has no function&mdash;and there we are chasing hares and rainbows and we just cannot run him to earth on this matter.  On top of all that, what has he done?  He has muzzled every stationmaster in the country.  That cannot be denied by the Minister.</P>
    <P>No public representative dare ask a stationmaster: &ldquo;What is happening here with regard to your passenger or rail services?&rdquo; There is the situation in which the Minister has put CIE as far as road and rail services are concerned. That situation would not be tolerated among boy scouts.  The sooner the Minister realises the fact which has been stated from these benches and from the other benches that he is absolutely incompetent to run his Department, the better.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with tourism which also comes under the Minister's Department.  The Minister got a brainwave that the season could be extended by a week in June by closing the schools and sending the children off to the seaside.  Who ever heard such nonsense?  If the Minister is serious about developing the tourist industry and extending the season and encouraging tourists to come here during valley periods, his first step should be to develop the attractions available during those periods.  In the constituency I represent, in the south <Col N="632" /> of Ireland, there are attractions during the winter and autumn seasons such as coarse fishing, excellent shooting and hunting.  What enticements are offered to English people and what advertisement is there of these attractions? The publicity is absolutely negligible.</P>
    <P>A fortnight ago, we discussed means of saving the Gaeltacht.  I can speak from experience.  I have been a constant visitor for the past 14 years to the Kerry Gaeltacht.  I defy the Minister to come with me to that area and find men and women there between the ages of 18 and 50.  They are not there.  I ask him to come down there in the summer season and find what it is that is saving the Gaeltacht.  The only thing that is saving the Gaeltacht today is the fact that emigrants return from England and America and spend their money there during the holidays and support their wives, their fathers and their mothers in the Gaeltacht while they themselves work in England and America.</P>
    <P>There are luxury hotels going up all over Ireland.  I do not know for whom they are intended to cater.  There are German hotels, American hotels and all kinds of combines coming in to build these vast establishments which are completely unsuitable, completely unnecessary and absolutely extravagant. I want the Minister to bear in mind that some of the people who are running these hotels have unfortunate boys and girls working until the early hours of the morning&mdash;2 a.m. and 3 a.m.&mdash;doing 50, 55 and in some cases 60 hours a week for a meagre 10/-. Such conditions would not be tolerated in any Christian country.  The Minister and his Tourist Board are standing by and letting these hotel owners amass money and make hay while the sun shines, at the expense of these unfortunate children.  That is the situation.  There should be no doubt in anybody's mind about it.</P>
    <P>I now come to the ESB.  The Minister has no function there either.  Not so many months ago, I attended a lecture sponsored and organised by the Minister for Local Government.  It was a very interesting and informative lecture.  A gentleman from the Tourist Board attended.  He whiled <Col N="633" /> away the time&mdash;with emphasis on the &ldquo;whiled away&rdquo;&mdash;explaining how the scenic value of Ireland could be enhanced.  He suggested better plans for petrol pumps and advertisements. He made one very significant statement. He charged the ESB with destroying the beauty of parts of the country by their overhead cables and the monstrosities they have built to carry those cables.  He said that if there had been any organisation put into it, these cables would have been laid underground.  We all agree with that but it is a case of one State body telling another State body that they made, not a hames of it, but a whole set of harness of the situation.  It is all very well to joke, but now we find the ESB and the Minister telling unfortunate people who live at the top of a mountain that if they want electricity brought into their homes, they must pay so much a pole.  It may cost them from £50 to £120 to get a supply of electricity.  As an alternative, they are told that they will be given £10 and they can buy a bottle of calor gas. What good is calor gas to a man who wants to go out and draw water to his house?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>A gas Minister, and the quicker he can be exploded, the better.  What good is a calor gas container to a man on the top of a mountain who wants to pump water or to operate a milking machine?  It is the most stupid approach on the part of a responsible Department.  The Minister is the man responsible and he must take responsibility for treating these unfortunate people as he is doing.  It is no wonder that people are emigrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an extraordinary position in regard to another item in the ESB account.  In no place in the world is there a weir erected without a fishpass, except in one instance in the city of Limerick.  The fish are jammed and caught.  We are told that there is a percentage let up the river.  I know what is let up.  If the year is good, there may be a few fish let up but if the year is bad, none at all is let up. People who go up to Killaloe or the <Col N="634" /> upper Shannon find there is nothing to catch, that the fish are not allowed up.</P>
    <P>The next matter with which I want to deal is air transport.  Certain people are given a licence and a monopoly in air transport.  There are flights coming in to Shannon Airport from America.  The planes touch down at Shannon to disembark ten or 20 passengers out of their complement of 100 or whatever may be on board. The plane is held for over half an hour on the tarmac.  The passengers who are continuing the flight are imprisoned inside, not allowed out even for half an hour, to come and spend money in the catering and sales departments at Shannon Airport.  Last month, for instance, a plane came in at 7.40 and did not leave until 8.30. The passengers had to remain in the plane whereas they could have come into the airport building and could have spent money on food or presents. That situation should not be allowed to arise.  Ninety people from the sales and catering department left there last week, and yet we talk about providing work for single persons.  If our single boys and girls leave, they do so for good.  There will be no coming back for them.</P>
    <P>We have been told that in the first six months of this year the sales and catering department at Shannon lost £18,000.  That may be so, but will the Minister tell the House, and the people of Limerick, how much profit that department made in the years since it was established and where that profit went?  The answer to that simple question should be very interesting. We have an industrial development company at Shannon.  I admit it is doing good work.  We all want to see Shannon's position retained and improved, if possible, but we have a certain number of managers in that company and I now want to know the number of managers at top and middle management level employed there.  I also want the Minister to tell me what their remuneration is and what their expenses are.</P>

I also want him to tell me how and by whom they were appointed, how many graduates hold such positions and what are their qualifications.  I want the Minister to realise that not only members of my Party but also members of Fine Gael and of his own Party are convinced that the Minister's position is above him, that this motion on the Order Paper is no cod.  When we ask questions here, the Minister replies: &ldquo;I have no function&rdquo;.  He is the Minister without function and my concluding remarks here will be that the Minister is not fit to run a second-hand bicycle shop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate merely to make a few remarks on the operation of the ESB in rural areas.  As a rural Deputy, I have come across a number of grievances against the ESB in the matter of rural electrification.  They leave pockets behind them and after four or five years, the people in these pockets endeavour to get current installed.  One person contacted the ESB within the past month with this in mind and I have here the reply from the ESB, dated 18th November, 1962.  That was after the recent subsidy was granted to the ESB.  The person in question had a basic rent of £17s. 9d. in respect of a four-roomed house and he has been told that, because he lives a few hundred yards from the electric cable, he will have to pay a special service charge of £4 15s. 3d., which would bring his rent up to £6 3s.  Would anybody expect a man of that kind to accept ESB current on those terms? I do not think the Minister was sincere when he made the announcement that the granting of the recent subsidy to the ESB would help to wind up rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a similar case where a householder's basic rent was 16/- and the special service charge sought was £3 18s., bringing that man's basic rent up to £4 14s.  These are the things we have against the ESB in rural areas and probably Deputies in city constituencies are not aware of them.  The <Col N="636" /> Minister is a sensible man, despite what has been said against him here, and I would ask him to advise the ESB to devise some more equitable system for people wishing to avail of rural electrification. The ESB might develop some kind of scheme under which they would charge, say, a sum of £50 and spread it over a period of two, three or four years so the people would know that at the end of that period, they would have paid off the charge.  I hope the Minister will consider these arguments and do something for the people in backward rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House and shall confine my remarks to a few points.  I would, first of all, draw the Minister's attention to the need for developing the airstrip at Oranmore near Galway.  Galway is one of the major tourist centres.  We do not demand for Oranmore the millions that have been spent on Shannon and Dublin Airports.  We do not even ask for the £750,000 that has been spent on Cork Airport.  All we ask is a small sum that will render this airstrip usable.  There is no doubt it would improve the tourist business in the area.  People in my constituency have been vitally interested in the recent sanctioning of the Galway harbour development scheme.  The question had been hanging fire for 13 years.  It was like a game of ping-pong between the Harbour Commissioners in Galway and the Minister's office, and had become somewhat of a joke.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed in my colleague from another part of the county who attended a protest meeting in Loughrea that he has not been vocal here in protesting against the closing of the Loughrea line.  The same Deputy had a good point at that meeting when he said that, in view of the fact that the Tynagh mines were now about to open, it would be a retrograde step to close that line.  I feel the occasion should not be allowed to pass without referring to it.  It is not my constituency but it is in my county and the economy of the whole country is bound up with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay a compliment to the staffs of Aer Lingus.  If there <Col N="637" /> is any measure of success, I think compliments can be extended for that success to both the ground and air staffs of Aer Lingus.  I have seen them at their work and I can say that it is not in the boardroom alone that success is gained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the House that my intervention tonight will be momentary.  A few weeks ago I was making an appeal on another motion in this House to the Minister to hasten slowly in regard to the proposed closure of the branch railway lines.  I reiterate my appeal to him to hasten slowly, having heard so much since that he had not heard before.</P>
      <P>My main reason for rising tonight is to make an appeal to him on behalf of a very few people&mdash;I want to emphasise &ldquo;a very few people&rdquo;. These are very old people, mostly retired workmen of CIE.  As the House knows, under their conditions, the retired worker and his wife have free travel vouchers from the nearest railhead to them.  Now that the railways have closed, I want to make this appeal to the Minister in good time to ensure that these very few people will have those facilities left to them when travelling by bus.  Up to now, it is clear they have no such facility on the CIE buses.  When the workman dies, the privilege goes to his wife.  I want the Minister and his Department to ensure that this privilege will be retained by those workers of CIE who are today living on a mere pittance of a pension.  I implore him to ensure that in any legislation or any regulations he makes, these people will be thought of in the way they deserve to be thought of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief on this occasion.  If I had been called on before Deputy Seán Flanagan had spoken, my intervention would be somewhat longer but Deputy Flanagan said what I intended to say, I am sure, with much better effect than any remarks of mine would have upon the Minister.  He expressed in identical terms the feelings that I hold so strongly in the part of the country I represent.  It would appear that the policy of the Minister and the policy <Col N="638" /> of CIE are uniform in their complete ignoring of local opinion in the areas affected by rail closure.</P>
      <P>On this Estimate, there is a wide field of discussion in which the House could fruitfully engage itself ranging over tourism and many other aspects important to the life of the country. Like most Deputies who have spoken, we are compelled practically to concentrate our attention on the operation of the affairs of CIE, which means that time and attention are not available for the close examination that is desirable of all the other aspects of the Minister's administration of his Department.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, the railways in the south of Ireland extending from Waterford to Tramore, the entire railway system of West Cork and the entire railway system of West Clare were closed by action of CIE.  It was indicated clearly at that time that the consequences of this closure would be such that no more branch lines would be closed.  That was an unequivocal statement, that these lines were being sacrificed with the objective of making CIE pay their way.  We find, however, this year, a regrettable report in relation to the finances of the company, despite the sacrifices that were made. I want to deal briefly with what the consequences have been in those areas.  Like Deputy Seán Flanagan, we do know that industrialists are still interested in rail transport.</P>

      <P>To help the Deputy, may I say it would be impossible for me to close the debate tonight if I am to reply to the innumerable questions Deputies have put.  The Deputy does not have to hurry himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's intervention but there are other reasons why the contributions of some Deputies are abbreviated.  We have given up the ghost.  We have had so many opportunities of voicing our opinions in this matter that we rise again only because of the continued representations that are made to us by the people in the affected areas and we only hope at some time to break down this wall that has arisen between the Minister, CIE and the interested <Col N="639" /> people in the country.  There is no Department of State in which there is such a shocking state of public relations as there exists in relation to CIE.</P>
      <P>How many people are saying to us that the time is overdue for a revision of the Transport Act?  They ask us how we ever allowed that Act to go through the House in the form in which it was enacted.  They are questioning us very closely about that. Of course, there is just the one explanation; the positive assurance given by the responsible Minister at that time, now the Taoiseach, that under no circumstances would branch lines be closed without full consultation, an express undertaking given with the full force of which the Taoiseach is capable when he expresses himself. The Transport Act, relieving CIE of having to face the inquiry which operated up to the time of the passing of that Act, was passed on that understanding. That undertaking and that promise has been broken.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry and Deputy Flanagan in the Minister's Party are, I am sure, merely the more courageous of his own backbenchers who feel as strongly as they do in relation to the flagrant breaking of that solemn assurance given by the Leader of that Party. The Minister was well and truly served by the members of his Party here and in local authorities who sought, in the initial stages of the closure of branch lines, to divert all attention from him on to the Chairman and Board of CIE. They were certainly diligent in their efforts to protect the Minister from even any modicum of criticism but the Minister, having come out so forthrightly in support of what is occurring, and having so vocally supported the present development, is now in the dock because of what is occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He alleges that those who speak critically, here and elsewhere, of the closure of branch lines are railways hysterical.  He actually used the word &ldquo;hysteria&rdquo;.  If the Minister were to attend any one of the meetings called by the Chairman of the Cork County Council, a colleague of his, a member of his Party, despite the Minister's <Col N="640" /> statement that he is ashamed of him at the moment, and despite the poor opinion in which he is held by the Minister, he would find very little hysteria. The Deputy in question deserves recognition of his upholding of his responsible position.  He was elected as the spokesman of a combined body that has been meeting regularly in an effort to make the case for the retention of the lines, with the solemn assurance given some time ago that full consultation would take place before closure. If the Minister were to attend one of these meetings, he would find very little hysteria.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, he said in this House that a firm of international consultants had made certain recommendations to him and a breakdown of the figures for which Deputy Seán Flanagan asked tonight, and which so many of us sought on earlier occasions both inside and outside the House, would not be, according to the Minister, intelligible to the interested parties.  That was the Minister's answer: they would not be intelligible.  The men attending these meetings are professional men.  They are the leaders of industry.  They are the men who, tomorrow morning, will be called upon to face the competition of the Common Market.  They are the men upon whom the country must rely to manage their concerns with such effect as to enable us to withstand the coming challenge, and we are told from every platform that they are capable of doing so.  Yet the Minister says that a breakdown of simple figures in relation to a branch railway line would not be intelligible to them and, consequently, would not be given to them.</P>
    <P>Since this debate started, one of the lines under discussion in Cork&mdash;it is no longer in my constituency&mdash;is being closed down.  What is the history of that line?  On the debate on the Transport Bill, the Minister stated that he was basing much of the activities of CIE at the moment on the Beddy Report.  At that time, it was incumbent on CIE to set up a tribunal to give local people an opportunity of stating their case before closure was effected.  The Chairman of the tribunal was Dr. Beddy himself.  The other two members were, first, a prominent Fianna Fáil county councillor and, <Col N="641" /> secondly, a former civil servant who, in a recent interview on the radio, was congratulatory and laudatory of Government colleagues of the Minister and it cannot, therefore, be alleged that any single member of that tribunal was biassed against economising by the closure of branch lines.  I must say they did not journey to the location by rail.  Furthermore, they did not deign to have their refreshments in the town affected.  They journeyed by car some 20 miles to another town.  However, that is beside the point.</P>
    <P>At the end of five days' hearing, this tribunal reported that the line should not be closed.  It is now alleged in the particular year upon which the Minister and the Board are basing their figures to justify closure, there was a loss of £1,300 odd.  The merchants from that town have journeyed a very considerable distance to meet the Waterford representatives and they provided receipts for £8,000 in the year in question.  Is it any wonder these people did not wish to come to Kingsbridge until they had more information, until they had a proper breakdown of the figures as presented to them?</P>
    <P>It is now alleged also that a great deal of this must be charged to the main line system.  The assumption that all this traffic obtained at branch railway stations will be delivered on to CIE vehicles at the railhead, after the lines are abandoned, is, of course, complete nonsense, particularly in relation to the transport of beet.  If the Minister, or anybody else, has the idea that someone will load beet on to a lorry at the farm or at the roadside, transport it to Cork railway station, dump it out there and have it loaded again on to CIE wagons for Mallow, he will have to think again.</P>
    <P>We cannot see that there is any point whatever in charging to the main lines any of the income derived from the transport of beet in particular. The effect on the Mallow factory of the closure of the West Cork line has been to create chaotic conditions.  It is impossible to describe them.  There were two intakes at the factory, one ex-rail and one ex-road.  As a result <Col N="642" /> of the closing of the line, lines of lorries are left waiting every night. The drivers have to stay in the town of Mallow until next morning because the intake ex-rail no longer exists.</P>
    <P>The shifting of the transport of beet on to the road has had the effect of choking up the intake point, creating chaos and confusion, with consequential financial and other losses.  Unfortunate drivers have to wait as long as 12 hours for admission to the factory. That is just one of the troubles resulting from the closure of that line.  I referred on an earlier occasion to the fact that CIE are now engaged in taking up the line and nothing can now be done, so far as we are concerned in West Cork, to restore the rail services. There are extreme dangers in the present situation.  The personnel from the various gates have been withdrawn.  Many roads traverse this line.  Unheralded and unscheduled, trains are using the line to take the sleepers and rails into Cork City.  We are all keeping our fingers crossed so that there will not be a fatality because of the withdrawal of the personnel from the various gates.  I hope this is the last time I shall have to refer to that situation.  I hope steps will now be taken to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of the closure of the line has been the transfer of a considerable volume of traffic on to the roads.  These roads were never built to carry this traffic.  We have been assured that certain compensation will be forthcoming from the Department of Local Government to compensate in part, and in very small part, for the effect of the transfer of so much additional traffic on to our road system.  The amount allocated in proportion to the mileage involved is only a fraction of what was given to the Minister for Local Government's county when the railways were removed there.  There should be at least similar accommodation by way of road grant to compensate the people in Cork for the loss of the railways and for the fact that the roads must now carry a vastly increased volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>There is no restriction apparently <Col N="643" /> on the weight that may be launched upon our roads.  We know instances of extremely heavy vehicles carrying fantastic weights.  There is no doubt that this alleged saving effected by the closure of the branch lines will merely mean a transfer of the burden of rail upkeep to road upkeep.  It will present increasing problems for our local authorities in the years to come.</P>
    <P>If there is one Deputy who does not need to be defended, it is Deputy Corry, but I think it right to say that he was not deserving of the reprimand he received from the Minister for Transport and Power, saying that he was talking nonsense, that he was ashamed of him, and generally regarding him as a very small boy.  In the remarks made in relation to this matter, if not for other matters on which Deputy Corry has spoken, he can receive support on this side, and this at least is one occasion on which we feel that the views expressed were those expressed to him by all those present at the public meetings that took place relative to the closure of the lines.  There is grave concern at the fact that those instructions were issued to stationmasters to refrain from furnishing information which the local interested parties required, if they were to make the case that it was supposed that they would be allowed to make before any line was closed.</P>
    <P>When the earlier closures were effected, there was no consultation whatsoever, but this time there was an indication from CIE that there was to be consultation in the interested areas. This consultation has been well described by Deputy Seán Flanagan in his intervention, and I do not think that anybody could improve upon it, because it is quite true that neither full nor partial consultation took place and we have signs of the interested parties not being permitted to get the information which they required, if they were to have an intelligent discussion with the directors of CIE.</P>
    <P>Regarding substitute services, one of the assurances given, quite apart from having full consultation before closure, <Col N="644" /> was that comparable services would be provided if a line were closed.  For a long time, Deputies have been voicing their disapproval of the lack of effect of anything like Parliamentary intervention on the operations of CIE. We have the refusal of the Minister to provide information at Question Time and the general sign that they were a body apart, charged with doing a particular job, and that they were in no ways obliged to hearken to any inquiries or criticism from public representatives.  In the instances I have mentioned there was an indication which had the desired effect regarding the provision of comparable services and it was accepted by the interested people, if not by those who gave the assurances, that there would be a degree of service no less comparable provided, and also in relation to charges.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I know of the experience of at least one trader in the town of Bandon where I reside.  He received goods at a particular price when they were delivered by rail, and later when they were delivered by road through the CIE road freight service, there was an extraordinary increase in the charge. At the time of the fresh agitation to retain the branch lines in Cork county, he was going to provide the committee with the evidence of this increase in charges when he had a visitation from a number of people in CIE who came and guaranteed to him that if he would surrender the evidence of the charges levied upon him, they would restore the charges to the level at which they were before the line was removed.  Of course he parted with them and, having succeeded in getting his bill reduced, felt that he was coming pretty well out of it.</P>
    <P>Would that have been done had it not been that he had indicated that if it were not done, it would be raised in this House?  Should it be necessary for anybody in business in any town in Ireland to resort to that extreme before getting equity in relation to his business? The consequence has been that that finished him as far as CIE transport was concerned, and he now has his own transport and will no longer be subject to such treatment.  These are the things that are causing such bitterness <Col N="645" /> in the public mind in relation to the operations of this company, and it is very regrettable that they should occur.</P>
    <P>Then we had the example given by Deputy Gallagher of a remarkable occurrence where a man's conscience would not allow him to continue his work in CIE because of the fact that they were only playing cards all day. Why blame the public for not supporting the company if that is the way in which they conduct their business, if employees were engaged and paid for work for the carriage of passengers and goods and that is what they were doing?  I do not know if that is an isolated occurrence but nevertheless that is an aspect of CIE administration that should be straightened out before it is a question of closing down certain regions of service which we were informed would result in bringing the company to a happy financial position.  Unfortunately that does not appear to be even on the horizon.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Government were opposed to, and in fact never believed in, current operating losses, and this was one company which the Minister indicated must operate without a loss.  This statement was made before he introduced this Estimate, but he indicated in his introductory speech that there were other transport companies which were not even breaking even.  We all know, of course, that down through the years, there were many facets of our life that had to be assisted by way of tariffs, quotas and so on to enable them to operate successfully.  Just as the public were paying for their subsidies, this was also a subsidy even if one could not indicate to anyone in those particular years the exact charge levied on the public to ensure that they carried on their business successfully. So to suggest that the Government never believed in current operating losses is something the Minister cannot stand over.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Flanagan referred to the possibility of an industry in a part of his constituency affected by a threatened closure and said that closure of the line would have a detrimental effect on that industry.  Deputies will <Col N="646" /> recall that at one time the Taoiseach stated that in fact the greatest industrial progress was in regions where there were no branch lines.  There was much note taken of this comment, and it was regarded as an extraordinary statement.  If we were to carry that to its logical conclusion, we should wipe out all the railways and in that way have industrial development everywhere. I would make the comment that in one town in my constituency, a visiting industrialist did remark on the fact that there was available to him at that time a rail service, and that was later removed.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will hearken now to what one of his own colleagues says on exactly the same point.</P>
    <P>Regarding the tourist industry, I, too, agree with Deputy Flanagan in his criticism of the erection of luxury hotels.  Figures were recently published of the contribution which such visitors to the country made to our entire revenue from tourism.  The experience of those of us who stay overnight in Dublin has been that quite a number of these wealthy Americans stay in one of the luxury hotels for an extremely short time.  They stay just long enough to look around for cheaper and less luxurious accommodation.  I hope they represent for our tourist income as bright a future as the Minister indicates, but if he were to consult any shop girl in Killarney or in any other tourist resort, and ask her what type of tourist is leaving the most money in the resorts, she would say that she would prefer to see one returned emigrant or one British working-class tourist coming in than one of the tourists who come from the super hotels.</P>
    <P>We have on our doorstep this vast potential made up of our own people who are resident in Britain and of British tourists.  If we are to make any real effort to give them the type of holiday they want, at reasonable cost, we must concentrate more on providing accommodation for them rather than on the erection of the luxury hotels which we hope will be filled to capacity and be successful but about whose future we are sceptical.</P>
    <P>There is resentment of the fact that <Col N="647" /> the benefits available to hoteliers for improvements or extensions of their premises are not available to other people.  Great work has been done by means of the loans and grants system to bring the country hotels and the city hotels up to proper standard and better size.  People like to leave their hotels.  They do not want to be tied inside a hotel all the time.  They like to move out and meet people and mix with them in the local public house and discuss the affairs of the day. Therefore, it is desirable that we should bring up the standard of the public houses to such a level that we need not be ashamed of them, a level at which they would be comfortable and provide the ordinary civilised facilities.</P>
    <P>It is true that money is available to hoteliers and guest house owners for renovations and improvements of their premises but there is no grant available to assist the proprietor of a licensed premises in a tourist resort, or in any town in the country, to provide a lounge or improved toilet facilities.  Such improvements today would entail considerable expenditure. If the Tourist Board directed their attention to that matter, they could provide not only much more attractive places for visitors but comforts and facilities for our own people who must not be forgotten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate except that I believe, like so many other Deputies who have spoken, that this is the only opportunity we have of expressing our opinions of or trying to get information about CIE.  I put down a question for tomorrow's Order Paper in regard to the allocation of the engines which were recently debated in the House.  My question was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle because the Minister has no function in the matter.  I have no option but to speak in this debate and ask the Minister questions which, in normal conditions, for the purpose of saving time, and with more satisfactory arrangements between Ministers and Deputies, I could have put down under the Parliamentary Questions <Col N="648" /> system.  I am debarred from doing that because the Minister will not answer questions.</P>
      <P>Having listened to this extensive debate during the afternoon, I believe that nearly 50 per cent. of the speakers were moved to speak because they could not get an answer by other means from the Minister.  When anybody puts down a Question relating to any matter concerning CIE, he is told that it is a matter of day to day administration and that the Minister has no function.  That is pure unadulterated nonsense.  The proof that it is nonsense is the criticism of CIE by Deputies on every side of the House. The Minister looks on himself to be the champion for the defence of this organisation, society, business, or whatever it is, of public transport.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that practically everything possible that could be wrong with CIE is wrong.  They have been given every opportunity that any company could have been given. Nearly five years ago all their debts were paid&mdash;I wish someone would pay my debts as theirs were paid, and I am sure other Deputies have the same view&mdash;and they were given a clean bill to start afresh.  They were also given a considerable donation of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the sorry tale that faces the House today?  They are losing money, and not only are they losing money but they are losing more and more every day.  I believe it is the duty of the Minister to play ball with the House and give us the information we are seeking.  Deputies do not get up here just for the sake of making a row or to get publicity.  Every responsible Deputy wants to see our transport system running as well as it is possible for it to run.  The way to have it running well is to let the people who are responsible for running it know that they will be exposed to the cold light of publicity and that they must pay attention to what Deputies and other public representatives say in regard to the wants and requirements of the public.  It is idiotic for the Minister to think himself the last line of defence of the CIE organisation which is not giving a <Col N="649" /> proper service to the country.  If they were giving a proper service, Deputies from every side of the House would not be protesting here.  If the Minister were to reply to all the criticism that has been levelled at CIE, we certainly would not adjourn on 13th December but would be here until the middle of January.  The greater part of what I have heard said is true.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago, the Minister brought in a Bill asking for 6,000,000 dollars, which is about £2½ million, for CIE to buy in extra engines.  We got no information about the contract. We were not told whether CIE looked for the engines from anyone else.  We were not told whether they tried to get them cheaper anywhere else.  The matter was discussed in the House and the Minister would not give information. I wanted to put down a question, as I am entitled to do as a representative of Wexford, in regard to the allocation of those engines.  It was a perfectly reasonable question to ask because our engine has an unhappy penchant for breaking down and we were looking forward to a change, but I could not even get an answer.  I want to ask the Minister now is the Rosslare line&mdash;which is an important line&mdash;getting a new engine.  I gather there are six new engines.  There are only a few railway lines left because most of them are being closed down. There are only three or four main lines left now.  Are we getting an allocation or are we not?  I do not know if the Minister knows.  I do not even know if CIE will tell him if he asks them. We cannot find these things out because we cannot get answers to Parliamentary Questions.</P>
    <P>I do not think the regulations under the Bill passed here in 1957 or 1958, when CIE were given a fresh start, are being carried out.  One of the things I distinctly remember on that occasion, having spoken myself, was that we were to get information with regard to the closing down of lines. I think the words used by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, were that all interested parties would be consulted. What is the sorry story we have had over the past couple of years?  The <Col N="650" /> first one was the Waterford-Tramore line, when nobody was consulted and no delegation was received or would be received.  There was no redress for this House.  We could not even ask a Parliamentary Question about it because the Minister had no function in the matter.  Apart from the local people not being asked, the very railway lines themselves were torn up and sold immediately, so that if they wanted to try to make their case, there was no use in their doing so because the railway lines were torn up and exported for the sake of our balance of payments with Nigeria or Ghana.  In other words, it is simply bureaucracy.  It means the ordinary parliamentary representative is being flouted here.  That is the challenge I issue to the Minister.  I can only come to the conclusion that bureaucracy is triumphant here and the parliamentary representative ceases to exist any longer.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody can be satisfied with the running of CIE.  I admit they have any amount of difficulties, that every railway in the world is facing difficulties.  I know that every railway in Europe is losing money or carrying a Government subsidy of some sort with the exception of the railways in Holland, where, for a reason I cannot discover, they are managing to pay their way.  Even the French railways, which are perhaps the most efficient in Europe to-day are not paying.  Yet they are always packed.  No matter where you travel on a French main-line train, you must always engage a seat.  Any time I have ever travelled on an express to any centre in France, I have found people standing in the corridors.  Yet the French railways are not making money.</P>
    <P>My criticism against CIE and the Minister, as their representative in the House, is not the fact they are losing money; it is the fact they refuse to take the public into their confidence. After all, what is our function?  Our function is to provide the money to see that public transport is carried out. As public representatives, no matter from what Party we come, we have the right to have that information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> There is a very strong rumour in my part of the world that it is contemplated to close the Rosslare line.  I do not know whether that is true or not.  I suppose the first we will hear about it is that it is to be closed and then it will be closed.  I know from my information, which of course is unofficial, that this is a line which is paying its way.  It is a line which perhaps could be made to pay its way even more provided it got the necessary tourist publicity in the advertisements put out in the other countries concerned.</P>
    <P>As I know the position, the Rosslare-Fishguard line, which is concerned with this railway, is a separate company.  As I understand it, the position is that the Rosslare-Fishguard Steamship Co. is still in existence.  It is a very old-established company, founded somewhere at the beginning of the century.  It is a separate entity from the railway itself.  The directors or owners of this company at the moment are a combination of British Railways and CIE.  CIE are responsible for the harbour on this side and for the servicing of the company by the railway line.  British Railways are responsible for the ships themselves and for the manning of the ships.</P>
    <P>If there is any idea of closing down this line, which would have disastrous consequences for all that side of the country, there must be consultations, first, with British Railways and, secondly, within the company itself, and the company must have consultations with CIE.  Since the company itself is an offshoot, under the control of the Minister for Transport and Power, it should be possible for the Minister to give the House a categorical assurance that there is no intention of closing this line.</P>
    <P>If it were closed, it would be perhaps one of the most shattering blows at our tourist industry imaginable. Over the years, the inclination has been to bring all tourists in through the Dublin ports, Dún Laoghaire and the North Wall.  It has often happened that people get to Dublin and never get any further.  The <Col N="652" /> advertisements right back over the years have been directed to that object of bringing them all in through the port of Dublin.  It is only in recent years that people have been coming in through Rosslare.</P>
    <P>At the moment it is the major entrance port for cars, and this has been a considerable asset to the tourist industry as a whole.  A certain amount of money has been expended there. The Minister and I do not see eye to eye on the subject.  I perhaps feel more money could be expended and the port expanded.  In addition, we have a very bad road out of Rosslare Harbour. While this has nothing to do with the Minister at all, the fact is that his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, has stated categorically in this House that he sees no reason for improving or widening this road, although the strongest representations have been made to him by the very active Deputies who represent Wexford, as well as the other local representatives, to do something about it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to close this line, the whole area would be virtually isolated because they have not got a proper road, and this would cut off a tourist potential which is growing all the time.  Therefore, it would be satisfactory if the Minister felt able to give this categorical assurance to the House that this is one of the lines which will be left extant.  I believe it is paying its way.  I believe it could not only pay its way but could, by expansion and by free advertisement to which I will refer later, be made to pay its way very much better.</P>
    <P>I return now to the argument of tourism <i>vis-á-vis</i> Dublin and rural Ireland, especially the southern part of the country.  The suggestion has often been made that the advertisements could be put up in the United Kingdom whence the greatest number of tourists arrive.  They should be encouraged to visit Ireland through Rosslare and through Cork, if necessary.  We must be fair to everybody.</P>

      <P>They will <Col N="653" /> look after themselves.  They are vociferous enough here.  Travelling in England, one can see at railway stations, especially London, the same old advertisements for the past 40 or 50 years.  Great tributes were paid to Bord Fáilte who have done a certain amount of work.  They could do with a few new ideas in regard to advertisements. We see advertisements which show you how to get to Ireland through Dublin, as if no other place existed in the country.  You are asked to visit Donegal, Connemara and Killarney.  Is there no imagination among those in Bord Fáilte who look after tourist advertising?  They could mention places other than Donegal, Connemara and Killarney.  As a young boy going to school, I can remember these advertisements.  They are still the same.</P>
      <P>As I am on the question of tourism, I think that Bord Fáilte are not very active in regard to publishing advertisements in connection with the opportunities that exist in Ireland.  We in Ireland can offer that which no other country can offer today.  The roads are comparatively free and there is peace and quiet.  When city people or active business people go on a holiday, they do not want to go to first-class luxury hotels in the big centres.  What they want is peace and quiet.  They want to be able to travel in a car in peace along the roads, without having to travel bumper to bumper.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has any doubts on these points, I can assure him that it has been said to me repeatedly by visitors to Ireland that they could not believe there could be such peace and tranquility in a country.  You could not get that anywhere else.  I was recently in a hotel outside Dublin having dinner.  At the next table, three or four Germans were chatting.  The whole theme of their conversation was the great enjoyment they had got from their holiday.  They were able to take out their car and drive it without having to travel bumper to bumper. Those are the things we ought to stress. That brings me to the direct policy of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are to get a Hilton hotel in this country.  Bord Fáilte will not be happy <Col N="654" /> until we have a Hilton hotel.  In every big city in the world, there is a Hilton hotel where if you go in with a £5 note and buy what you want, you come out without any change.  That is not the sort of thing we want here. I agree with the Deputies who said that we want the better class guesthouses. The Spaniards, who find themselves in the bad books <i>vis-á-vis</i> Europe as a whole, for what reason I do not know, have developed a better type of guesthouse and secondary hotel, with the result that they have enormously increased their tourist industry.  They confined the charges of their hoteliers so that there was no question of over-charging.</P>
    <P>There is nobody so sensitive as the tourist to charges and particularly the rich tourist who is the last person to spend anything at all.  He wants to get everything as cheaply as he can.  I do not know for whom we are building these luxury hotels.  I think it was Deputy O'Sullivan who said that these wealthy people come in and stay one or two nights at a hotel and then go somewhere else.  It is for these people we are building the luxury hotels. These hotels are not likely to be full, but we have got to have a certain number of them.  I am very proud of the fact that in my own constituency we have what is tantamount to a luxury hotel which gives first class service.</P>
    <P>We do not want many luxury hotels. We want to cater for the ordinary person here.  We have an enormous potentiality and the Minister could direct all his activities towards developing that tourist potential.  In the first place, there should be a new approach.  The Minister should get in contact with people who are good at designing attractive pictures and taking attractive photographs.  One sees the most glorious photographs of places abroad.  So attractive are they that you feel you can never get to these places soon enough.  When you get there, you discover that the photographs exaggerate their beauty.  Some years back, I saw a photograph of Rosslare strand issued by Bord Fáilte or, perhaps it was Fógra Fáilte.  It was the most ghastly production <Col N="655" /> I ever saw.  Now, Rosslare has one of the finest strands in Ireland&mdash;at least what is left of it.  We are awaiting the Coast Erosion Bill before it is washed away.  From the photograph, one would imagine it was a place, where if you took off your shoes to paddle, you would have to walk on broken glass.  That is an extreme case.  I told Bord Fáilte about it and I am happy to tell the House that the photograph was withdrawn.</P>

      <P>The Minister should get a committee together and try to draft an overall picture of Irish tourist resorts.  We should get away from the idea that we have only Connemara, Donegal and Killarney. There are other places which are more easily accessible.  If a person comes to Ireland and if he gets beyond Dublin at all, he will probably head straight for Connemara, Donegal or Kerry.  He does that because he does not know of any other place to go.</P>
      <P>The weekly or monthly bulletin which the Tourist Board produce is good but I think it could be expanded. We could include in it more pictures and more stories about Ireland generally.  It is one of the things which has certainly given some idea that there are places in Ireland other than Donegal, Connemara and Killarney.  Perhaps the Minister would consider my suggestion and get his people together and stress in the advertisements the peaceful atmosphere that prevails here in which people can enjoy a real holiday.  That is what most people are looking for in the world today, all trying to avoid coronary thrombosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the position is in regard to electricity supplies in other parts of the country but, in my own area, people have been seriously disappointed.  I made inquiries no <Col N="656" /> later than today as to what the position is and apparently some sort of main line is being put up down by Arklow and County Wexford and that has absorbed all available manpower. In the last few days, I had representations from two people who showed me letters from the ESB saying they would have electricity in August.  It is now December and they have not yet been connected.  I immediately made inquiries and received a courteous reply from the ESB saying they would do their best to supply current as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On further inquiry, I found the reason for the delay is that the men are not available, as all available men are on this other job, and I gather they will be completely absorbed until February.  The position of people who thought they were getting light in August can be appreciated.  They had gone to the expense of having their houses wired and were possibly waiting to get television, and other electrical appliances.  I know of a man who has sunk a well.  If he has to wait until February to get power, it seems unreasonable, since the installation sought is probably only a matter of a few hours' work.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would get in touch locally and find out what the position is?  I want to absolve entirely the local officials.  I believe they are not responsible, that they were put on to this heavy job without being aware it was coming and that is why they made promises.</P>
    <P>I should not have spoken in this debate but for the fact that we cannot get answers to Parliamentary Questions. I advise the Minister to answer such questions.  I do not expect I shall ever be a Minister, but if I were, I should answer them because otherwise I know I should only be laying up a store of trouble for myself. Having given the Minister that friendly advice, I sit down.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Burke spoke, he said that the Minister had plenty of headaches.  I agree with that.  We realise the Minister is in charge of five semi-State bodies, only one of which is not in the red.  I <Col N="657" /> should first like to deal with the problems of the operation of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>There is a great feeling of dissatisfaction among passengers from Dublin to London or any other cross-Channel airport in regard to bus charges and airport charges.  I realise that the Minister has a problem here but there is a feeling that these charges should be included in the cost of the ticket purchased by the traveller.  The traveller to London is faced with a landing charge of about 15/- Then he gets a bus to the air terminus and has to pay the bus fare.</P>
      <P>Recently because of the change of the bus terminus from Cathal Brugha Street to Store Street, travellers have complained because they cannot leave their luggage at Store Street, have it transferred to the bus and have it collected at the airport.  They must present themselves at Store Street and transfer their luggage to the bus going to the airport.  This is a small matter but one with which I was concerned last week.  I can assure the Minister that the staff at the bus station would like to see the system that operated in Cathal Brugha Street restored in Store Street.</P>
      <P>I must compliment Aer Lingus and those concerned with the introduction of the car ferry service which, I understand, will operate from next spring. This fills a great want and should be very advantageous to our tourist trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that a great case can be made for Government policy in regard to the curtailment of rail transport.  It operates in many countries but I strongly suggest to the Minister that the curtailment is just a shade too soon here.  I think the roads should be considerably improved before the railways are closed.  I do not think we have sufficient roads, or sufficiently good roads, to carry the traffic that will be <Col N="658" /> transferred from rail to road.  The advances made in this respect in the Six Counties are very much appreciated by the public there and a line should be taken from the manner in which they are dealing with road improvements.</P>
    <P>Coupled with this Estimate is a motion in the names of several Fine Gael Deputies.  I should like to see the transport company making special workers' tickets available in Dublin to people domiciled in corporation housing schemes on the fringe of the city. The majority of these people work in the city centre and many of them have four bus trips a day&mdash;going to work in the mornings, coming home at lunchtime, going back to work and returning home in the evening.  Their bus fares average about 8d per trip which adds up to 2/8 daily.  If they work a five and a half day week, their bus fares can be added on to the rent of their houses and it is quite a heavy burden for them.</P>
    <P>The passenger accommodation at, and the transport services to the B &amp; I terminus at the North Wall are deplorable. The passenger accommodation is most primitive, something one would expect a hundred years ago and, I suggest, no better than it was one hundred years ago.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton's criticisms of the canals.  We have one canal and I think it must have been 25 years since it was used, the Royal Canal, coming from Cross Guns Bridge down by the North Strand.  It is really a dirty cesspool full of weeds, dirt, tin cans and, as Deputy Norton said, a cemetery for animals.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
